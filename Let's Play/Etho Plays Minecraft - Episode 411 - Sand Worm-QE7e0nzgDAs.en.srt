it's not so special to you so maybe
 

21
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,139
it's not so special to you so maybe
you'll stop eating it for a while

22
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:33,149
you'll stop eating it for a while
 

23
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,830
you'll stop eating it for a while

maybe you haven't had in a long time

46
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:06,590
maybe you haven't had in a long time
 

47
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,750
maybe you haven't had in a long time
guys to start off with today I had an

48
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
guys to start off with today I had an
 

49
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,440
guys to start off with today I had an
idea for something pretty random here we

50
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:15,450
idea for something pretty random here we
 

51
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,539
idea for something pretty random here we
are going to be building a sandworm or

52
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:17,549
are going to be building a sandworm or
 

53
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,630
are going to be building a sandworm or
attempting to anyway what is a sandworm

54
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
attempting to anyway what is a sandworm
 

55
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,550
attempting to anyway what is a sandworm
ah

56
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
ah
 

57
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,590
ah
the best the thing that's what am I

58
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
the best the thing that's what am I
 

59
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,569
the best the thing that's what am I
trying to say my inspiration for the

60
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:29,579
trying to say my inspiration for the
 

61
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,249
trying to say my inspiration for the
sandworm is you know when you go to

62
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:31,259
sandworm is you know when you go to
 

63
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,700
sandworm is you know when you go to
those fancy malls sometimes they have

64
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:33,710
those fancy malls sometimes they have
 

65
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,410
those fancy malls sometimes they have
the water jet fountains like the water

66
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,420
the water jet fountains like the water
 

67
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,660
the water jet fountains like the water
snakes that jump over the path so it'll

68
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:38,670
snakes that jump over the path so it'll
 

69
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,660
snakes that jump over the path so it'll
be like a burst of water that shoots

70
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:41,670
be like a burst of water that shoots
 

71
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,149
be like a burst of water that shoots
into the air and it'll hop from one

72
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
into the air and it'll hop from one
 

73
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,190
into the air and it'll hop from one
fountain to the next one and it kind of

74
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,200
fountain to the next one and it kind of
 

75
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,109
fountain to the next one and it kind of
looks like a snake hopping around but

76
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:48,119
looks like a snake hopping around but
 

77
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,539
looks like a snake hopping around but
it's just water timed at certain

78
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:50,549
it's just water timed at certain
 

79
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,069
it's just water timed at certain
intervals and it looks really cool it

80
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
intervals and it looks really cool it
 

81
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,410
intervals and it looks really cool it
bounces around it's very fun to watch

82
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,420
bounces around it's very fun to watch
 

83
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,389
bounces around it's very fun to watch
we're going to try build something like

84
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
we're going to try build something like
 

85
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,830
we're going to try build something like
that here in Sandy City okay so to make

86
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
that here in Sandy City okay so to make
 

87
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,510
that here in Sandy City okay so to make
this happen guys we got to build like an

88
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
this happen guys we got to build like an
 

89
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,880
this happen guys we got to build like an
array of sand block launchers so when

90
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:04,890
array of sand block launchers so when
 

91
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,880
array of sand block launchers so when
the sand falls down before it hits the

92
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:07,890
the sand falls down before it hits the
 

93
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,130
the sand falls down before it hits the
slime block down here we want it to get

94
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,140
slime block down here we want it to get
 

95
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,670
slime block down here we want it to get
shot up while it's still an entity form

96
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
shot up while it's still an entity form
 

97
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,050
shot up while it's still an entity form
if it lands on the slime block that's it

98
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,060
if it lands on the slime block that's it
 

99
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,399
if it lands on the slime block that's it
Gigi because you can't launch it

100
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:19,409
Gigi because you can't launch it
 

101
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,710
Gigi because you can't launch it
afterwards it sticks to it and it won't

102
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:21,720
afterwards it sticks to it and it won't
 

103
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,890
afterwards it sticks to it and it won't
fall ever again so we want it to launch

104
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:24,900
fall ever again so we want it to launch
 

105
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,929
fall ever again so we want it to launch
up and then this will shoot it sideways

106
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:26,939
up and then this will shoot it sideways
 

107
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,240
up and then this will shoot it sideways
and whoa I thought I fell down the hole

108
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,250
and whoa I thought I fell down the hole
 

109
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,210
and whoa I thought I fell down the hole
there it's going to shoot it up over

110
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,220
there it's going to shoot it up over
 

111
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,949
there it's going to shoot it up over
this way and like if we're standing here

112
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
this way and like if we're standing here
 

113
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,720
this way and like if we're standing here
it'll go over top our head type of thing

114
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:38,730
it'll go over top our head type of thing
 

115
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,960
it'll go over top our head type of thing
and hopefully just have like a two-block

116
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:41,970
and hopefully just have like a two-block
 

117
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,119
and hopefully just have like a two-block
hole somewhere around here where the

118
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:44,129
hole somewhere around here where the
 

119
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,129
hole somewhere around here where the
sand will get launched to fall down into

120
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:46,139
sand will get launched to fall down into
 

121
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,530
sand will get launched to fall down into
another one of these launchers and it'll

122
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:48,540
another one of these launchers and it'll
 

123
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,619
another one of these launchers and it'll
shoot it another direction or to another

124
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:51,629
shoot it another direction or to another
 

125
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,559
shoot it another direction or to another
area type of thing that's that's the

126
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:54,569
area type of thing that's that's the
 

127
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,680
area type of thing that's that's the
goal with this so I've set it up so it

128
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:57,690
goal with this so I've set it up so it
 

129
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,059
goal with this so I've set it up so it
should work with a OTO a smart piston

130
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:02,069
should work with a OTO a smart piston
 

131
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,690
should work with a OTO a smart piston
type of thing so if a block lands here

132
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:04,700
type of thing so if a block lands here
 

133
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,580
type of thing so if a block lands here
that will shoot that'll push it sideways

134
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:07,590
that will shoot that'll push it sideways
 

135
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,550
that will shoot that'll push it sideways
and then we just got to take this delay

136
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
and then we just got to take this delay
 

137
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,339
and then we just got to take this delay
and send a signal to this piston and it

138
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:16,349
and send a signal to this piston and it
 

139
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,150
and send a signal to this piston and it
should automatically launch a sand block

140
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,160
should automatically launch a sand block
 

141
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,339
should automatically launch a sand block
if it ever falls into here let's just do

142
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:22,349
if it ever falls into here let's just do
 

143
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,080
if it ever falls into here let's just do
it really rough to start off with I'll

144
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,090
it really rough to start off with I'll
 

145
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,839
it really rough to start off with I'll
polish up off-camera but what we got to

146
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:26,849
polish up off-camera but what we got to
 

147
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,259
polish up off-camera but what we got to
do is maybe just give it a short delay

148
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:29,269
do is maybe just give it a short delay
 

149
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,819
do is maybe just give it a short delay
see we have a two tick delay down there

150
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:31,829
see we have a two tick delay down there
 

151
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,559
see we have a two tick delay down there
so we should give this one a three tick

152
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:33,569
so we should give this one a three tick
 

153
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,860
so we should give this one a three tick
we want them one tick apart and that

154
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:36,870
we want them one tick apart and that
 

155
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,629
we want them one tick apart and that
will go to this piston like so and now I

156
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:41,639
will go to this piston like so and now I
 

157
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,300
will go to this piston like so and now I
think it will will do what we want let's

158
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,310
think it will will do what we want let's
 

159
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,589
think it will will do what we want let's
try this out woohoo oh we almost got the

160
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:48,599

we were to put a block here I wonder
 

179
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,219
we were to put a block here I wonder
what happens is that gonna be in the way

like a two-block 2x1 hole here for it to
 

187
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,390
like a two-block 2x1 hole here for it to
work okay that's pretty good so I'm in

188
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
work okay that's pretty good so I'm in
 

189
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,220

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,230
the middle of polishing this up now like
 

191
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,930
the middle of polishing this up now like
I redid the wiring I'll show you how we

192
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:35,940
I redid the wiring I'll show you how we
 

193
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,910
I redid the wiring I'll show you how we
how to do it when we build the second

194
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:37,920
how to do it when we build the second
 

195
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,310
how to do it when we build the second
one here from scratch and I'm also

196
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
one here from scratch and I'm also
 

197
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,140
one here from scratch and I'm also
trying to hide it the best weekend too

198
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,150
trying to hide it the best weekend too
 

199
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,450
trying to hide it the best weekend too
so I filled sand in wherever we can put

200
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,460
so I filled sand in wherever we can put
 

201
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,810
so I filled sand in wherever we can put
it as it is right now it still works we

202
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:47,820
it as it is right now it still works we
 

203
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,100
it as it is right now it still works we
have to keep these sides open though

204
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,110
have to keep these sides open though
 

205
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,170
have to keep these sides open though
unfortunately because otherwise it tries

206
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,180
unfortunately because otherwise it tries
 

207
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,910
unfortunately because otherwise it tries
to move this sand next to it and it

208
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:55,920
to move this sand next to it and it
 

209
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,850
to move this sand next to it and it
doesn't have a spot for it so it can't

210
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:58,860
doesn't have a spot for it so it can't
 

211
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,510
doesn't have a spot for it so it can't
extend let's see I guess what we could

212
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
extend let's see I guess what we could
 

213
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,700
extend let's see I guess what we could
do is like half slab over top of it

214
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:07,710
do is like half slab over top of it
 

215
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,830
do is like half slab over top of it
possibly let's not put it there maybe I

216
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
possibly let's not put it there maybe I
 

217
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,740
possibly let's not put it there maybe I
miss miss clicking like crazy here you

218
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:15,750
miss miss clicking like crazy here you
 

219
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,150
miss miss clicking like crazy here you
do something like that

220
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,160
do something like that
 

221
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,220
do something like that
or bring it out even further still work

222
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,230
or bring it out even further still work
 

223
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,260
or bring it out even further still work
still works very good if we have a block

224
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,270
still works very good if we have a block
 

225
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,380
still works very good if we have a block
here still works

226
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,390
here still works
 

227
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,270
here still works
what about slab let's try a slab oh it

228
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,280
what about slab let's try a slab oh it
 

229
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,380
what about slab let's try a slab oh it
still works okay full block if it does a

230
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:36,390
still works okay full block if it does a
 

231
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,020
still works okay full block if it does a
full block that would be amazing

232
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,030
full block that would be amazing
 

233
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,010
full block that would be amazing
no that's the limit okay so we might

234
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,020
no that's the limit okay so we might
 

235
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,620
no that's the limit okay so we might
want to lower this all by one because

236
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:45,630
want to lower this all by one because
 

237
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,430
want to lower this all by one because
all these labs can be sand pretty much

238
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
all these labs can be sand pretty much
 

239
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,200
all these labs can be sand pretty much
except for these two that they would

240
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,210
except for these two that they would
 

241
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,940
except for these two that they would
have to be sandstone yeah we could make

242
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:55,950
have to be sandstone yeah we could make
 

243
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,140
have to be sandstone yeah we could make
this look a lot better if it was one

244
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,150
this look a lot better if it was one
 

245
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,140
this look a lot better if it was one
lower so I think that's what we'll do I

246
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,150
lower so I think that's what we'll do I
 

247
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,400
lower so I think that's what we'll do I
wonder if we can get this to juggle like

248
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,410
wonder if we can get this to juggle like
 

249
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,340
wonder if we can get this to juggle like
three three at once

250
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,350
three three at once
 

251
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,159
three three at once
Oh messed up

252
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,169
Oh messed up
 

253
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:14,180
Oh messed up
Oh got to

254
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,190

 

255
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,260

awesome I thought my machine how to

256
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,270
awesome I thought my machine how to
 

257
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,100
awesome I thought my machine how to
jungle that's so cool we might even be

258
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,110
jungle that's so cool we might even be
 

259
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,570
jungle that's so cool we might even be
able to get four but I'm not I'm not

260
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:21,580
able to get four but I'm not I'm not
 

261
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,780
able to get four but I'm not I'm not
greedy this is the effect I want so

262
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:27,790
greedy this is the effect I want so
 

263
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,520
greedy this is the effect I want so
we're gonna have like a big reserve of

264
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:29,530
we're gonna have like a big reserve of
 

265
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,260
we're gonna have like a big reserve of
sand somewhere and it's gonna shoot like

266
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,270
sand somewhere and it's gonna shoot like
 

267
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,020
sand somewhere and it's gonna shoot like
10 20 blocks hopefully and they'll jump

268
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,030
10 20 blocks hopefully and they'll jump
 

269
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,430
10 20 blocks hopefully and they'll jump
from one to another one will set up

270
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
from one to another one will set up
 

271
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,950
from one to another one will set up
another one over here should look pretty

272
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:37,960
another one over here should look pretty
 

273
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,060
another one over here should look pretty
cool oh man this is pretty cool guys I

274
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,070
cool oh man this is pretty cool guys I
 

275
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,920
cool oh man this is pretty cool guys I
got four of them set up right now and

276
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:43,930
got four of them set up right now and
 

277
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,810
got four of them set up right now and
this is what they look like when they're

278
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:45,820
this is what they look like when they're
 

279
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,520
this is what they look like when they're
there all completes when they're flush

280
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,530
there all completes when they're flush
 

281
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,440
there all completes when they're flush
with the ground so I moved it down the

282
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,450
with the ground so I moved it down the
 

283
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:55,080
with the ground so I moved it down the
block and checked it out let's try to

284
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,090
block and checked it out let's try to
 

285
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,390
block and checked it out let's try to
keep up with it here so yeah just kind

286
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,400
keep up with it here so yeah just kind
 

287
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,430
keep up with it here so yeah just kind
of bounces around goes from one to

288
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
of bounces around goes from one to
 

289
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,670
of bounces around goes from one to
another all automatic it's not on timers

290
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:02,680
another all automatic it's not on timers
 

291
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,340
another all automatic it's not on timers
or anything and I think that looks

292
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,350
or anything and I think that looks
 

293
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,070
or anything and I think that looks
pretty cool we might even be able to

294
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
pretty cool we might even be able to
 

295
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,620
pretty cool we might even be able to
just hook it up in a loop and have it go

296
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:10,630
just hook it up in a loop and have it go
 

297
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,730
just hook it up in a loop and have it go
all the time I don't know if that would

298
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:11,740
all the time I don't know if that would
 

299
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,260
all the time I don't know if that would
be a good idea or not or if there'd be

300
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,270
be a good idea or not or if there'd be
 

301
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,050
be a good idea or not or if there'd be
any problems but that would be a really

302
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,060
any problems but that would be a really
 

303
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,280
any problems but that would be a really
simple way of doing it um so yeah I

304
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,290
simple way of doing it um so yeah I
 

305
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,870
simple way of doing it um so yeah I
managed I'm going to set up another one

306
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:21,880
managed I'm going to set up another one
 

307
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,630
managed I'm going to set up another one
here I'll kind of show you the process

308
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:23,640
here I'll kind of show you the process
 

309
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,320
here I'll kind of show you the process
so I want to see where this lands again

310
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,330

 

311
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,120

okay so actually goes pretty high in the

312
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,130
okay so actually goes pretty high in the
 

313
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,570
okay so actually goes pretty high in the
air doesn't it so it lands over here but

314
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:36,580
air doesn't it so it lands over here but
 

315
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,800
air doesn't it so it lands over here but
this is the middle of the road I don't

316
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:37,810
this is the middle of the road I don't
 

317
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,350
this is the middle of the road I don't
really want to put a hole in the middle

318
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,360
really want to put a hole in the middle
 

319
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,630
really want to put a hole in the middle
of the road there so maybe what we could

320
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:42,640
of the road there so maybe what we could
 

321
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,500
of the road there so maybe what we could
do is just build like a tree over here

322
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,510
do is just build like a tree over here
 

323
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,330
do is just build like a tree over here
and hopefully it'll hit the leaf blocks

324
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:48,340
and hopefully it'll hit the leaf blocks
 

325
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,940
and hopefully it'll hit the leaf blocks
and just fall down and then we're going

326
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,950
and just fall down and then we're going
 

327
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,500
and just fall down and then we're going
to send the next one going this way I

328
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:52,510
to send the next one going this way I
 

329
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,380
to send the next one going this way I
think all right so tell you what let's

330
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,390
think all right so tell you what let's
 

331
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,210
think all right so tell you what let's
just set up a wall of leaves here maybe

332
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,220
just set up a wall of leaves here maybe
 

333
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,570
just set up a wall of leaves here maybe
two blocks out from the wood there and

334
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:03,580
two blocks out from the wood there and
 

335
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,350
two blocks out from the wood there and
see what happens next so if we put it in

336
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
see what happens next so if we put it in
 

337
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,820
see what happens next so if we put it in
here oh okay I don't know if we can stop

338
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:14,830
here oh okay I don't know if we can stop
 

339
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,310
here oh okay I don't know if we can stop
it actually not sure if it landed on it

340
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:17,320
it actually not sure if it landed on it
 

341
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,140
it actually not sure if it landed on it
or if it just breaks whenever it hits

342
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,150
or if it just breaks whenever it hits
 

343
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,760
or if it just breaks whenever it hits
something let's try it again

344
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:23,770

 

345
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,869

is it gonna stop oh okay yeah that

346
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:27,879
is it gonna stop oh okay yeah that
 

347
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,969
is it gonna stop oh okay yeah that
worked ah let's try it one more time

348
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:31,979
worked ah let's try it one more time
 

349
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,969
worked ah let's try it one more time
make sure it like freezes that's so

350
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:35,979
make sure it like freezes that's so
 

351
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:36,649
make sure it like freezes that's so
strange

352
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:36,659
strange
 

353
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,089
strange
yeah so let's try set one of these up

354
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:39,099
yeah so let's try set one of these up
 

355
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,130
yeah so let's try set one of these up
together if we can just in case you want

356
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,140
together if we can just in case you want
 

357
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,510
together if we can just in case you want
to build it for yourselves I'll show you

358
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:42,520
to build it for yourselves I'll show you
 

359
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,000
to build it for yourselves I'll show you
how to do it here the very first thing

360
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,010
how to do it here the very first thing
 

361
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,260
how to do it here the very first thing
you got to do if you're chaining them

362
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,270
you got to do if you're chaining them
 

363
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,880
you got to do if you're chaining them
together is figure out where the sand

364
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:47,890
together is figure out where the sand
 

365
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,220
together is figure out where the sand
block is going to land and make sure it

366
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,230
block is going to land and make sure it
 

367
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,930
block is going to land and make sure it
actually lands and does it doesn't get

368
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:51,940
actually lands and does it doesn't get
 

369
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,120
actually lands and does it doesn't get
destroyed when it hits the ground it's

370
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,130
destroyed when it hits the ground it's
 

371
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,850
destroyed when it hits the ground it's
really important and then you got to dig

372
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:56,860
really important and then you got to dig
 

373
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,490
really important and then you got to dig
down I think three blocks or so and then

374
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:02,500
down I think three blocks or so and then
 

375
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,170
down I think three blocks or so and then
you place a furnace or some block that

376
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,180
you place a furnace or some block that
 

377
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,750
you place a furnace or some block that
doesn't move okay and we're going to go

378
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:06,760
doesn't move okay and we're going to go
 

379
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,660
doesn't move okay and we're going to go
that way so then what I like to do is

380
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:09,670
that way so then what I like to do is
 

381
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,750
that way so then what I like to do is
put the piston opposite of that no put

382
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
put the piston opposite of that no put
 

383
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,670
put the piston opposite of that no put
the piston on the side you want it want

384
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
the piston on the side you want it want
 

385
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,340
the piston on the side you want it want
to go that's the way you do it yes and

386
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,350
to go that's the way you do it yes and
 

387
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,220
to go that's the way you do it yes and
then put the sticky piston the sideways

388
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,230
then put the sticky piston the sideways
 

389
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,840
then put the sticky piston the sideways
pusher on the opposite side so I think

390
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:27,850
pusher on the opposite side so I think
 

391
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,370
pusher on the opposite side so I think
that would be over here

392
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:29,380
that would be over here
 

393
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,449
that would be over here
one block below the ground level and

394
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:33,459
one block below the ground level and
 

395
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:38,310
one block below the ground level and
then over here dig down this is a little

396
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
then over here dig down this is a little
 

397
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,110
then over here dig down this is a little
bit confusing make sure you get rid of

398
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,120
bit confusing make sure you get rid of
 

399
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,870
bit confusing make sure you get rid of
all the blocks beside the piston here

400
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
all the blocks beside the piston here
 

401
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,410
all the blocks beside the piston here
otherwise it won't be able to move and

402
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:46,420
otherwise it won't be able to move and
 

403
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,670
otherwise it won't be able to move and
you can put furnace blocks or whatever

404
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
you can put furnace blocks or whatever
 

405
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,699
you can put furnace blocks or whatever
you want instead oh it's going to be

406
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:50,709
you want instead oh it's going to be
 

407
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,639
you want instead oh it's going to be
nighttime okay so the slime block should

408
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:53,649
nighttime okay so the slime block should
 

409
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:56,790
nighttime okay so the slime block should
be one below this furnace and I'm gonna

410
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
be one below this furnace and I'm gonna
 

411
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,740
be one below this furnace and I'm gonna
sleep just so we can skip this night

412
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:58,750
sleep just so we can skip this night
 

413
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,610
sleep just so we can skip this night
time ok back at its here what I like to

414
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:02,620
time ok back at its here what I like to
 

415
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,949
time ok back at its here what I like to
do next is set up the smart pissed and

416
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
do next is set up the smart pissed and
 

417
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,280
do next is set up the smart pissed and
stuff so I'm not going to put stone

418
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,290
stuff so I'm not going to put stone
 

419
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,930
stuff so I'm not going to put stone
brick down just because we're doing this

420
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:09,940
brick down just because we're doing this
 

421
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,819
brick down just because we're doing this
on video otherwise I would trust me but

422
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:14,829
on video otherwise I would trust me but
 

423
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,040
on video otherwise I would trust me but
it's a little bit faster if we don't so

424
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,050
it's a little bit faster if we don't so
 

425
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,920
it's a little bit faster if we don't so
have it powered so that if a block lands

426
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:19,930
have it powered so that if a block lands
 

427
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,740
have it powered so that if a block lands
here it'll send power out to the other

428
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:22,750
here it'll send power out to the other
 

429
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,500
here it'll send power out to the other
side there and just loop it back to this

430
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,510
side there and just loop it back to this
 

431
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:31,470
side there and just loop it back to this
piston so just do this I got put stone

432
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:31,480
piston so just do this I got put stone
 

433
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
piston so just do this I got put stone
brick here

434
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:32,690
brick here
 

435
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,850
brick here
and that works pretty good so now if we

436
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:35,860
and that works pretty good so now if we
 

437
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,949
and that works pretty good so now if we
do this it automatically pushes it and

438
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
do this it automatically pushes it and
 

439
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,220
do this it automatically pushes it and
then what we want to do is take the

440
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,230
then what we want to do is take the
 

441
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,800
then what we want to do is take the
signal from this block here move it down

442
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:44,810
signal from this block here move it down
 

443
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,059
signal from this block here move it down
towards this lower piston you want a two

444
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:49,069
towards this lower piston you want a two
 

445
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:55,509
towards this lower piston you want a two
tick delay from from that okay so we can

446
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
tick delay from from that okay so we can
 

447
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,329
tick delay from from that okay so we can
run it down like this and what I like to

448
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:01,339
run it down like this and what I like to
 

449
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,710
run it down like this and what I like to
do is just put down block here next to

450
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:05,720
do is just put down block here next to
 

451
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,889
do is just put down block here next to
the piston put some redstone furnace or

452
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:08,899
the piston put some redstone furnace or
 

453
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,290
the piston put some redstone furnace or
some some block that transmits power and

454
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:11,300
some some block that transmits power and
 

455
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,999
some some block that transmits power and
doesn't move and then grab the signal

456
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:16,009
doesn't move and then grab the signal
 

457
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,999
doesn't move and then grab the signal
from this dust put it to the furnace and

458
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:19,009
from this dust put it to the furnace and
 

459
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,889
from this dust put it to the furnace and
down set this to - all right so that

460
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:23,899
down set this to - all right so that
 

461
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,519
down set this to - all right so that
should be the the bottom one hooked up

462
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:26,529
should be the the bottom one hooked up
 

463
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,879
should be the the bottom one hooked up
that launches it up very good then

464
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:30,889
that launches it up very good then
 

465
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,220
that launches it up very good then
just run the signal to this and this is

466
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,230
just run the signal to this and this is
 

467
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,949
just run the signal to this and this is
pretty easy to do all right put a stone

468
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
pretty easy to do all right put a stone
 

469
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,030
pretty easy to do all right put a stone
brick down there and just about done

470
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
brick down there and just about done
 

471
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,530
brick down there and just about done
okay we usually don't do redstone

472
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:47,540
okay we usually don't do redstone
 

473
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,530
okay we usually don't do redstone
together but you know we should we used

474
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:50,540
together but you know we should we used
 

475
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,199
together but you know we should we used
to do it all the time and it's been a

476
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:53,209
to do it all the time and it's been a
 

477
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,600
to do it all the time and it's been a
long time since we we did anything like

478
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,610
long time since we we did anything like
 

479
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,889
long time since we we did anything like
this so now it should all be good to go

480
00:11:59,889 --> 00:11:59,899
this so now it should all be good to go
 

481
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,759
this so now it should all be good to go
right yes and launches it about twenty

482
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:03,769
right yes and launches it about twenty
 

483
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,309
right yes and launches it about twenty
eight blocks on level ground from what

484
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:06,319
eight blocks on level ground from what
 

485
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,769
eight blocks on level ground from what
I've seen let me just cover over the

486
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:08,779
I've seen let me just cover over the
 

487
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,530
I've seen let me just cover over the
dust and stuff with the with the sand

488
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:11,540
dust and stuff with the with the sand
 

489
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,960
dust and stuff with the with the sand
oops

490
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:12,970
oops
 

491
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,139
oops
next to this one I like to put double

492
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:17,149
next to this one I like to put double
 

493
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,829
next to this one I like to put double
furnace on both sides like that net so

494
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:20,839
furnace on both sides like that net so
 

495
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:21,939
furnace on both sides like that net so
that's it we're not too worried about

496
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:21,949
that's it we're not too worried about
 

497
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,720
that's it we're not too worried about
sticking to anything and you can't cover

498
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:25,730
sticking to anything and you can't cover
 

499
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,439
sticking to anything and you can't cover
over all this and we are basically done

500
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:29,449
over all this and we are basically done
 

501
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,110
over all this and we are basically done
with it so the thing is we got to keep

502
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,120
with it so the thing is we got to keep
 

503
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,199
with it so the thing is we got to keep
that 2x1 hole but we also need a half

504
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,209
that 2x1 hole but we also need a half
 

505
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,319
that 2x1 hole but we also need a half
slab the direction it's going here

506
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:38,329
slab the direction it's going here
 

507
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,639
slab the direction it's going here
otherwise it's going to run into the

508
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:39,649
otherwise it's going to run into the
 

509
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:44,970
otherwise it's going to run into the
block all right I think we're good to go

510
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:44,980
block all right I think we're good to go
 

511
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,400
block all right I think we're good to go
and drop it on top the furnace ooh and

512
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,410
and drop it on top the furnace ooh and
 

513
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,460
and drop it on top the furnace ooh and
that's all there is to it

514
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:52,470
that's all there is to it
 

515
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,680
that's all there is to it
all right everybody so I just added in a

516
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:55,690
all right everybody so I just added in a
 

517
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,240
all right everybody so I just added in a
few more of these things and we're gonna

518
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,250
few more of these things and we're gonna
 

519
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,860
few more of these things and we're gonna
have some fun with it now because it

520
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:58,870
have some fun with it now because it
 

521
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,660
have some fun with it now because it
does a full cycle a full loop around

522
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:00,670
does a full cycle a full loop around
 

523
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,120
does a full cycle a full loop around
this place so it doesn't ever stop when

524
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,130
this place so it doesn't ever stop when
 

525
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,940
this place so it doesn't ever stop when
we put one in here um I want to see what

526
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:05,950
we put one in here um I want to see what
 

527
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,440
we put one in here um I want to see what
it looks like when we get a ton of them

528
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,450
it looks like when we get a ton of them
 

529
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,780
it looks like when we get a ton of them
just flying around so I'm going to make

530
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,790
just flying around so I'm going to make
 

531
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,410
just flying around so I'm going to make
a big long chain and then we're gonna

532
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:13,420
a big long chain and then we're gonna
 

533
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,860
a big long chain and then we're gonna
watch and see what it looks like because

534
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:16,870
watch and see what it looks like because
 

535
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,170
watch and see what it looks like because
I think it's gonna be pretty cool and we

536
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:19,180
I think it's gonna be pretty cool and we
 

537
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,790
I think it's gonna be pretty cool and we
can have some fun doing some experiments

538
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
can have some fun doing some experiments
 

539
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,530
can have some fun doing some experiments
here I'm curious how much lag it's going

540
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:22,540
here I'm curious how much lag it's going
 

541
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,860
here I'm curious how much lag it's going
to cause alright it's probably gonna

542
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:25,870
to cause alright it's probably gonna
 

543
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,640
to cause alright it's probably gonna
come back around about me now oh yeah

544
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:29,650
come back around about me now oh yeah
 

545
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,940
come back around about me now oh yeah
pretty close pretty close to it oh man

546
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:34,950
pretty close pretty close to it oh man
 

547
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:41,580
pretty close pretty close to it oh man
look at this this is so cool

548
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:41,590

 

549
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,540

getting a little bit of lag yeah we're

550
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:45,550
getting a little bit of lag yeah we're
 

551
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,960
getting a little bit of lag yeah we're
down to 20 frames so this is not

552
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:48,970
down to 20 frames so this is not
 

553
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,460
down to 20 frames so this is not
something we probably want to keep

554
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,470
something we probably want to keep
 

555
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,750
something we probably want to keep
running all the time or at least not

556
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
running all the time or at least not
 

557
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,840
running all the time or at least not
this many at once it might just be the

558
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:54,850
this many at once it might just be the
 

559
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,460
this many at once it might just be the
sound from the Pistons so I'm not sure

560
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,470
sound from the Pistons so I'm not sure
 

561
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,000
sound from the Pistons so I'm not sure
because when we're far away like this

562
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,010
because when we're far away like this
 

563
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,250
because when we're far away like this
it's not lagging anymore

564
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:04,260

 

565
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,430

that's pretty cool though the sandworm

566
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:10,440
that's pretty cool though the sandworm
 

567
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,240
that's pretty cool though the sandworm
okay so the other thing I want to see is

568
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,250
okay so the other thing I want to see is
 

569
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,070
okay so the other thing I want to see is
if it gets messed up if we leave the

570
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,080
if it gets messed up if we leave the
 

571
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,840
if it gets messed up if we leave the
area and come back so I'm going to walk

572
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:18,850
area and come back so I'm going to walk
 

573
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,000
area and come back so I'm going to walk
far away so the chunks unload and go out

574
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,010
far away so the chunks unload and go out
 

575
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,470
far away so the chunks unload and go out
a render distance and then we'll come

576
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
a render distance and then we'll come
 

577
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,030
a render distance and then we'll come
back and see if it's still going or not

578
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,040
back and see if it's still going or not
 

579
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,530
back and see if it's still going or not
okay so we're on our way back now and

580
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:28,540
okay so we're on our way back now and
 

581
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,780
okay so we're on our way back now and
we're gonna see what happened to those

582
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:30,790
we're gonna see what happened to those
 

583
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,000
we're gonna see what happened to those
sand entities because if you take

584
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,010
sand entities because if you take
 

585
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,860
sand entities because if you take
minecarts for example if they go to

586
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:34,870
minecarts for example if they go to
 

587
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,710
minecarts for example if they go to
unloaded chunks sometimes they can bunch

588
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:37,720
unloaded chunks sometimes they can bunch
 

589
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,620
unloaded chunks sometimes they can bunch
up if there's lots of them and that

590
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:40,630
up if there's lots of them and that
 

591
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,270
up if there's lots of them and that
stuff can happen I'm wondering if that's

592
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,280
stuff can happen I'm wondering if that's
 

593
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,370
stuff can happen I'm wondering if that's
going to be the case with these because

594
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:44,380
going to be the case with these because
 

595
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,050
going to be the case with these because
they're flying into unloaded chunks as

596
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,060
they're flying into unloaded chunks as
 

597
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,020
they're flying into unloaded chunks as
well when you leave the area and that

598
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,030
well when you leave the area and that
 

599
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:55,980
well when you leave the area and that
might cause some trouble oh oh darn yeah

600
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:55,990
might cause some trouble oh oh darn yeah
 

601
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,230
might cause some trouble oh oh darn yeah
we're having some issues like we had

602
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
we're having some issues like we had
 

603
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,830
we're having some issues like we had
solid

604
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:58,840
solid
 

605
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,570
solid
sand blocks like a unbroken chain and

606
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:02,580
sand blocks like a unbroken chain and
 

607
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,700
sand blocks like a unbroken chain and
now there is only three jumping around

608
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:05,710
now there is only three jumping around
 

609
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,200
now there is only three jumping around
I'm wondering if they bunched up or

610
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,210
I'm wondering if they bunched up or
 

611
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,890
I'm wondering if they bunched up or
maybe they broke somehow I'm not seeing

612
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:13,900
maybe they broke somehow I'm not seeing
 

613
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,990
maybe they broke somehow I'm not seeing
them on the ground like the item entity

614
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
them on the ground like the item entity
 

615
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,650
them on the ground like the item entity
anywhere though hmm if there's only one

616
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:21,660
anywhere though hmm if there's only one
 

617
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,050
anywhere though hmm if there's only one
block it should never have trouble yeah

618
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,060
block it should never have trouble yeah
 

619
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,250
block it should never have trouble yeah
I don't see them on the ground anywhere

620
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:29,260
I don't see them on the ground anywhere
 

621
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,050
I don't see them on the ground anywhere
so there might be like just a whole

622
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,060
so there might be like just a whole
 

623
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,810
so there might be like just a whole
bunch of them bunched together there

624
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:32,820
bunch of them bunched together there
 

625
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,210
bunch of them bunched together there
tell you what let's let's break this

626
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:36,220
tell you what let's let's break this
 

627
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,750
tell you what let's let's break this
chain and see how many we get back is I

628
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:39,760
chain and see how many we get back is I
 

629
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,270
chain and see how many we get back is I
only see like three or four flying

630
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,280
only see like three or four flying
 

631
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,260
only see like three or four flying
around at the moment

632
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,270
around at the moment
 

633
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,680
around at the moment
how many sand blocks do we have on us

634
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:45,690
how many sand blocks do we have on us
 

635
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,730
how many sand blocks do we have on us
just just under two stacks okay

636
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:50,740
just just under two stacks okay
 

637
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,320
just just under two stacks okay
one each yeah there's only one there for

638
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,330
one each yeah there's only one there for
 

639
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,030
one each yeah there's only one there for
each of those so I don't know what

640
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
each of those so I don't know what
 

641
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,570
each of those so I don't know what
happened to them that's pretty weird

642
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:00,580
happened to them that's pretty weird
 

643
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,130
happened to them that's pretty weird
they wouldn't be on the ground and we

644
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,140
they wouldn't be on the ground and we
 

645
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,890
they wouldn't be on the ground and we
didn't get them back there huh so we

646
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:07,900
didn't get them back there huh so we
 

647
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,580
didn't get them back there huh so we
might need we have two options here we

648
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:11,590
might need we have two options here we
 

649
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,230
might need we have two options here we
either have to make some system that

650
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,240
either have to make some system that
 

651
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,060
either have to make some system that
will detect when we're in the area and

652
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,070
will detect when we're in the area and
 

653
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,660
will detect when we're in the area and
then release them or just have like one

654
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,670
then release them or just have like one
 

655
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,980
then release them or just have like one
flying around at a time which is

656
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:22,990
flying around at a time which is
 

657
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,950
flying around at a time which is
probably the best way of doing it right

658
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:24,960
probably the best way of doing it right
 

659
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,970
probably the best way of doing it right
that's the simplest just to have one

660
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:26,980
that's the simplest just to have one
 

661
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,620
that's the simplest just to have one
block jumping around we'll get the least

662
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:28,630
block jumping around we'll get the least
 

663
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,980
block jumping around we'll get the least
amount of leg that way too but let me

664
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:31,990
amount of leg that way too but let me
 

665
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,240
amount of leg that way too but let me
know if you guys have any ideas in the

666
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,250
know if you guys have any ideas in the
 

667

know if you guys have any ideas in the
comments I suppose and I think we're

668
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,530
comments I suppose and I think we're
 

669
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,650
comments I suppose and I think we're
going to go do something else here

670
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,660

 

671
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,420

stashing them in this room here and it's
getting to the points where like we got

682
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,270
getting to the points where like we got

Gunpowder at least and that will free up

692
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:08,709
Gunpowder at least and that will free up
 

693
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,580
Gunpowder at least and that will free up
a lot of space but we need a lot of sand

this thing up for the first time I did
more wiring here like all this stuff up

842
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:52,149
more wiring here like all this stuff up
 

843
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,659
more wiring here like all this stuff up
here wasn't here before

844
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:54,669
here wasn't here before
 

845
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,210
here wasn't here before
the only thing is where this red clay is

846
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,220
the only thing is where this red clay is
 

847
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,649

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:15,730
rebuild it in place and I gotta like
 

861
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,029
rebuild it in place and I gotta like
figure out how to do that because I got

862
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:18,039
figure out how to do that because I got
 

863
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,980
figure out how to do that because I got
to build it in Reverse like from the

864
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:19,990
to build it in Reverse like from the
 

865
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,899
to build it in Reverse like from the
wiring the back of the wiring to the

866
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:21,909
wiring the back of the wiring to the
 

867
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:27,090
wiring the back of the wiring to the
front yeah it's gonna be tough to do but

868
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,100
front yeah it's gonna be tough to do but
 

869
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,680
front yeah it's gonna be tough to do but
I think we're going to get that done

870
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:28,690
I think we're going to get that done
 

871
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,330
I think we're going to get that done
next time and then we'll be able to

872
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:30,340
next time and then we'll be able to
 

873
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,460
next time and then we'll be able to
start programming things in and getting

874
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:32,470
start programming things in and getting
 

875
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,960
start programming things in and getting
stuff where it needs to go and I think

876
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:33,970
stuff where it needs to go and I think
 

877
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,539
stuff where it needs to go and I think
that should be pretty fun but anyways

878

and it was wasting time and I just
 

913
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,810

there may be a few more episodes of that
 

931
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,310
there may be a few more episodes of that
but I'll probably bail out next season

932
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,320
but I'll probably bail out next season
 

933
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,460
but I'll probably bail out next season
if they do another season and with mine

934
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,470
if they do another season and with mine
