Ito and welcome back we're playing some
more minecraft today guys and yes I have

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:16,770
more minecraft today guys and yes I have
 

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,890
more minecraft today guys and yes I have
been working on the Nexus today so I was

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:21,900
been working on the Nexus today so I was
 

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,870
been working on the Nexus today so I was
a little while ago now but if you

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:23,880
a little while ago now but if you
 

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,689
a little while ago now but if you
remember I had I did a bunch of work on

12
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:26,699
remember I had I did a bunch of work on
 

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,339
remember I had I did a bunch of work on
this thing and then I ran into kind of a

14
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:28,349
this thing and then I ran into kind of a
 

15
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,870
this thing and then I ran into kind of a
problem and it seemed a bit weird to me

16
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
problem and it seemed a bit weird to me
 

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,979
problem and it seemed a bit weird to me
at first and it still does but basically

18
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:36,989
at first and it still does but basically
 

19
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,319
at first and it still does but basically
the codes were reversed with our system

20
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:39,329
the codes were reversed with our system
 

21
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,959
the codes were reversed with our system
and I thought about it a little bit in

22
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:41,969
and I thought about it a little bit in
 

23
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,200
and I thought about it a little bit in
our English language we go left to right

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,210
our English language we go left to right
 

25
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,740
our English language we go left to right
you know like hello how's it going I'm

26
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:48,750
you know like hello how's it going I'm
 

27
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,000
you know like hello how's it going I'm
typing left to right on screen here

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,010
typing left to right on screen here
 

29
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,410
typing left to right on screen here
right

30
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:53,420
right
 

31
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,510
right
but with numbers when we do like combo

32
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,520
but with numbers when we do like combo
 

33
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
but with numbers when we do like combo
locks for example when you have to

34
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:57,930
locks for example when you have to
 

35
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,950
locks for example when you have to
include the zeros like say you have four

36
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
include the zeros like say you have four
 

37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,240
include the zeros like say you have four
digits generally we go right to left so

38
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,250
digits generally we go right to left so
 

39
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,469
digits generally we go right to left so
to iterate through this it would be like

40
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
to iterate through this it would be like
 

41
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,350
to iterate through this it would be like
zero zero zero zero zero then the one

42
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,360
zero zero zero zero zero then the one
 

43
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,390
zero zero zero zero zero then the one
and the two one on the right instead of

44
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
and the two one on the right instead of
 

45
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,359
and the two one on the right instead of
on the left ends it's kind of opposite

46
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,369
on the left ends it's kind of opposite
 

47
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,649
on the left ends it's kind of opposite
isn't it like we don't go one and then

48
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:20,659
isn't it like we don't go one and then
 

49
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,200
isn't it like we don't go one and then
then this would be two you know we go we

50
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,210
then this would be two you know we go we
 

51
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,899
then this would be two you know we go we
go the other way so basically the way I

52
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:26,909
go the other way so basically the way I
 

53
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,789
go the other way so basically the way I
was doing with with the system this was

54
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
was doing with with the system this was
 

55
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,679
was doing with with the system this was
one

56
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:29,689
one
 

57
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,260
one
this was two you know it's going left

58
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,270
this was two you know it's going left
 

59
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,340
this was two you know it's going left
the right oops

60
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,350
the right oops
 

61
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,039
the right oops
and that that's not right that's not

62
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,049
and that that's not right that's not
 

63
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,469
and that that's not right that's not
what we view it as as proper so I

64
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:39,479
what we view it as as proper so I
 

65
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,100
what we view it as as proper so I
flipped it around so now go zero one now

66
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,110
flipped it around so now go zero one now
 

67
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,929
flipped it around so now go zero one now
zero two zero three etc etc and the way

68
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:47,939
zero two zero three etc etc and the way
 

69
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,960
zero two zero three etc etc and the way
I did that I just flipped the displays

70
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:50,970
I did that I just flipped the displays
 

71
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,490
I did that I just flipped the displays
on this to to fix it and it seems to do

72
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:55,500
on this to to fix it and it seems to do
 

73
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,749
on this to to fix it and it seems to do
the trick but I had to do a whole bunch

74
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:56,759
the trick but I had to do a whole bunch
 

75
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,700
the trick but I had to do a whole bunch
of rewiring in the back year I spent

76
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:58,710
of rewiring in the back year I spent
 

77
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,399
of rewiring in the back year I spent
like three hours on this today it was a

78
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:01,409
like three hours on this today it was a
 

79
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,590
like three hours on this today it was a
big project it was pretty difficult but

80
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
big project it was pretty difficult but
 

81
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,959
big project it was pretty difficult but
I had to disconnect all the wires and

82
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:05,969
I had to disconnect all the wires and
 

83
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,900
I had to disconnect all the wires and
reconnect them differently and and it

84
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:08,910
reconnect them differently and and it
 

85
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,370
reconnect them differently and and it
seems to be good now which is great

86
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:12,380
seems to be good now which is great
 

87
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,380
seems to be good now which is great
so yeah I'm basically just trying to

88
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,390
so yeah I'm basically just trying to
 

89
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,510
so yeah I'm basically just trying to
work out any rough edges with our our

90
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:16,520
work out any rough edges with our our
 

91
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,490
work out any rough edges with our our
design here trying to make it as

92
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:18,500
design here trying to make it as
 

93
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:26,140
design here trying to make it as
intuitive and uncommon at surely to us

94
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,150
intuitive and uncommon at surely to us
 

95
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,360
intuitive and uncommon at surely to us
and one other thing that caught my

96
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,370
and one other thing that caught my
 

97
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,970
and one other thing that caught my
attention here that I'm going to try fix

98
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:29,980
attention here that I'm going to try fix
 

99
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,920
attention here that I'm going to try fix
we just requested item zero zero out of

100
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:32,930
we just requested item zero zero out of
 

101
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,670
we just requested item zero zero out of
the system which tada is coal as it

102
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:36,680
the system which tada is coal as it
 

103
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,420
the system which tada is coal as it
turns out so it's got the code zero zero

104
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,430
turns out so it's got the code zero zero
 

105
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,440
turns out so it's got the code zero zero
there I looked where that is in the

106
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,450
there I looked where that is in the
 

107
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,720
there I looked where that is in the
system right where it's actually

108
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:46,730
system right where it's actually
 

109
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,990
system right where it's actually
physically located and it turns out it's

110
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
physically located and it turns out it's
 

111
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,770
physically located and it turns out it's
down here on the left side at the very

112
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:53,780
down here on the left side at the very
 

113
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,150
down here on the left side at the very
end so this is item zero zero with our

114
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,160
end so this is item zero zero with our
 

115
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,430
end so this is item zero zero with our
current set up I don't really want this

116
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
current set up I don't really want this
 

117
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,280
current set up I don't really want this
to be our very first item again thinking

118
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,290
to be our very first item again thinking
 

119
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,520
to be our very first item again thinking
about what comes naturally to us since

120
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,530
about what comes naturally to us since
 

121
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,190
about what comes naturally to us since
we are I left the rights language and

122
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
we are I left the rights language and
 

123
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,430
we are I left the rights language and
that kind of thing I think what I'm

124
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:12,440
that kind of thing I think what I'm
 

125
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,590
that kind of thing I think what I'm
going to do is make the very first item

126
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:16,600

 

127
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,710

the top top of the storage room and on

128
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
the top top of the storage room and on
 

129
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,070
the top top of the storage room and on
the very left towards the back so that

130
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
the very left towards the back so that
 

131
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,270
the very left towards the back so that
would be I think this row here this is

132
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,280
would be I think this row here this is
 

133
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,020
would be I think this row here this is
last row right I think so so this is the

134
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,030
last row right I think so so this is the
 

135
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,670
last row right I think so so this is the
very very left very back corner of the

136
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:36,680
very very left very back corner of the
 

137
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,410
very very left very back corner of the
whole thing and the item number 256 or

138
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,420
whole thing and the item number 256 or
 

139
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,060
whole thing and the item number 256 or
whatever should be the opposite of it so

140
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,070
whatever should be the opposite of it so
 

141
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,440
whatever should be the opposite of it so
downstairs very rights very front of the

142
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,450
downstairs very rights very front of the
 

143
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,510
downstairs very rights very front of the
room so I wanted to go from 0 0 here 0 1

144
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:52,520
room so I wanted to go from 0 0 here 0 1
 

145
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,260
room so I wanted to go from 0 0 here 0 1
0 2 0 3 all the way down and then I want

146
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,270
0 2 0 3 all the way down and then I want
 

147
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,230
0 2 0 3 all the way down and then I want
it to start on this side and then go

148
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,240
it to start on this side and then go
 

149
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,620
it to start on this side and then go
over a row and then another row another

150
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,630
over a row and then another row another
 

151
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,450
over a row and then another row another
row once it gets to the very right of

152
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:04,460
row once it gets to the very right of
 

153
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,390
row once it gets to the very right of
this go down and start on the left and

154
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,400
this go down and start on the left and
 

155
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,060
this go down and start on the left and
then make its way to the right kind of

156
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,070
then make its way to the right kind of
 

157
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,470
then make its way to the right kind of
like a typewriter you know once you hit

158
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,480
like a typewriter you know once you hit
 

159
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,770
like a typewriter you know once you hit
the end of the rows you go down the line

160
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:13,780
the end of the rows you go down the line
 

161
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,780
the end of the rows you go down the line
from left to right

162
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:15,790
from left to right
 

163
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,400
from left to right
alright so that's the plan with that in

164
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,410
alright so that's the plan with that in
 

165
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,640
alright so that's the plan with that in
order to do that so as I was building

166
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:21,650
order to do that so as I was building
 

167
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,530
order to do that so as I was building
this whole thing since it's a pretty big

168
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:23,540
this whole thing since it's a pretty big
 

169
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,780
this whole thing since it's a pretty big
crazy complicated project

170
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:25,790
crazy complicated project
 

171
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,650
crazy complicated project
um made a few mistakes on the way as you

172
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:29,660
um made a few mistakes on the way as you
 

173
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,700
um made a few mistakes on the way as you
would expect and some of these switchers

174
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:33,710
would expect and some of these switchers
 

175
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,410
would expect and some of these switchers
let's see if we can find one here I

176
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,420
let's see if we can find one here I
 

177
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,760
let's see if we can find one here I
think it's the blue one we got to change

178
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:36,770
think it's the blue one we got to change
 

179
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,420
think it's the blue one we got to change
you see how it's it's like this I think

180
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:39,430
you see how it's it's like this I think
 

181
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,500
you see how it's it's like this I think
to do it properly

182
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,510
to do it properly
 

183
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,220
to do it properly
I put the piston on the left side and

184
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,230
I put the piston on the left side and
 

185
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,420
I put the piston on the left side and
block coming out this way but one way I

186
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:49,430
block coming out this way but one way I
 

187
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,150
block coming out this way but one way I
can sort of cheese it and fix it is just

188
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
can sort of cheese it and fix it is just
 

189
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,590
can sort of cheese it and fix it is just
invert it and steal this block is this

190
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
invert it and steal this block is this
 

191
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,270
invert it and steal this block is this
going to work can we just do this and

192
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
going to work can we just do this and
 

193
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,780
going to work can we just do this and
then switch it like this yeah so that'll

194
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:04,790
then switch it like this yeah so that'll
 

195
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,030
then switch it like this yeah so that'll
be the opposite now and I got to do that

196
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,040
be the opposite now and I got to do that
 

197
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,010
be the opposite now and I got to do that
for all these blue ones in total there's

198
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,020
for all these blue ones in total there's
 

199
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,560
for all these blue ones in total there's
only two there's one more up here that I

200
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,570
only two there's one more up here that I
 

201
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,840
only two there's one more up here that I
got to flip and then I think it'll start

202
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:13,850
got to flip and then I think it'll start
 

203
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,480
got to flip and then I think it'll start
at the very very left side at the very

204
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,490
at the very very left side at the very
 

205
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:24,250
at the very very left side at the very
back where we want there no oh I just

206
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,260
back where we want there no oh I just
 

207
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,960
back where we want there no oh I just
thought I just discovered something that

208
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:25,970
thought I just discovered something that
 

209
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,550
thought I just discovered something that
that crushed my spirits here guys my my

210
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
that crushed my spirits here guys my my
 

211
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,540
that crushed my spirits here guys my my
fix the flipping the displays wasn't so

212
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,550
fix the flipping the displays wasn't so
 

213
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,240
fix the flipping the displays wasn't so
much a fix as I thought had to make

214
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,250
much a fix as I thought had to make
 

215
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,630
much a fix as I thought had to make
things a lot worse here three hours down

216
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:40,640
things a lot worse here three hours down
 

217
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,780
things a lot worse here three hours down
the drain uh so I got it so that this is

218
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:43,790
the drain uh so I got it so that this is
 

219
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,050
the drain uh so I got it so that this is
item zero zero the problem is instead of

220
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,060
item zero zero the problem is instead of
 

221
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,470
item zero zero the problem is instead of
this being zero one like I want zero one

222
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:50,480
this being zero one like I want zero one
 

223
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,270
this being zero one like I want zero one
is all the way down here which was an

224
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
is all the way down here which was an
 

225
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,860
is all the way down here which was an
enderpearl and then zero two was all the

226
00:05:59,860 --> 00:05:59,870
enderpearl and then zero two was all the
 

227
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,640
enderpearl and then zero two was all the
way over here so it's not going smoothly

228
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:03,650
way over here so it's not going smoothly
 

229
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,970
way over here so it's not going smoothly
through this now like it was before or

230
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:06,980
through this now like it was before or
 

231
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,440
through this now like it was before or
it's going from one to the next it's

232
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,450
it's going from one to the next it's
 

233
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,940
it's going from one to the next it's
like hopping all over the system by

234
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:09,950
like hopping all over the system by
 

235
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,720
like hopping all over the system by
sixteen and that is not so good because

236
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:13,730
sixteen and that is not so good because
 

237
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,610
sixteen and that is not so good because
when we're looking to get a piece of

238
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:15,620
when we're looking to get a piece of
 

239
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,620
when we're looking to get a piece of
wool for example we want all the wool to

240
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:17,630
wool for example we want all the wool to
 

241
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,020
wool for example we want all the wool to
be grouped together in our code system

242
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,030
be grouped together in our code system
 

243
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,430
be grouped together in our code system
and all the glass and all that kind of

244
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
and all the glass and all that kind of
 

245
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,110
and all the glass and all that kind of
stuff we don't just want it to be random

246
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
stuff we don't just want it to be random
 

247
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,470
stuff we don't just want it to be random
items so I have to know to back up and

248
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:29,480
items so I have to know to back up and
 

249
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,860
items so I have to know to back up and
try to fix it another way or maybe I

250
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:32,870
try to fix it another way or maybe I
 

251
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,680
try to fix it another way or maybe I
just won't fix it because I don't know

252
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:35,690
just won't fix it because I don't know
 

253
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,860
just won't fix it because I don't know
how to fix it to be honest

254
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:37,870
how to fix it to be honest
 

255
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,470
how to fix it to be honest
all right well I just loaded the back up

256
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:40,480
all right well I just loaded the back up
 

257
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,860
all right well I just loaded the back up
here guys I made some of the fixes that

258
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:42,870
here guys I made some of the fixes that
 

259
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,560
here guys I made some of the fixes that
we applied before so this was zero zero

260
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,570
we applied before so this was zero zero
 

261
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,500
we applied before so this was zero zero
like we wanted and another problem has

262
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:49,510
like we wanted and another problem has
 

263
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,120
like we wanted and another problem has
shown its ugly face though

264
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,130
shown its ugly face though
 

265
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,640
shown its ugly face though
we're gonna have a lot of problems to

266
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:53,650
we're gonna have a lot of problems to
 

267
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,420
we're gonna have a lot of problems to
fix it feels like now so this is zero

268
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,430
fix it feels like now so this is zero
 

269
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,910
fix it feels like now so this is zero
zero there should be zero one but

270
00:06:59,910 --> 00:06:59,920
zero there should be zero one but
 

271
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,070
zero there should be zero one but
instead when I put zero one in it it

272
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
instead when I put zero one in it it
 

273
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,590
instead when I put zero one in it it
gave me a second one of these and then

274
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:04,600
gave me a second one of these and then
 

275
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,410
gave me a second one of these and then
zero two hopped over and skip this and M

276
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:07,420
zero two hopped over and skip this and M
 

277
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,220
zero two hopped over and skip this and M
gave me pink zero three skip this and

278
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,230
gave me pink zero three skip this and
 

279
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,480
gave me pink zero three skip this and
give me gave me pink again then zero for

280
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,490
give me gave me pink again then zero for
 

281
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,460
give me gave me pink again then zero for
whatever give me blue so it's it's

282
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:17,470
whatever give me blue so it's it's
 

283
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,650
whatever give me blue so it's it's
skipping every second one and giving us

284
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:19,660
skipping every second one and giving us
 

285
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,220
skipping every second one and giving us
the same as the one before something is

286
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,230
the same as the one before something is
 

287
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,280
the same as the one before something is
messed up I need to try figure out what

288
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,290
messed up I need to try figure out what
 

289
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:32,280
messed up I need to try figure out what
it is so it could be one row of these

290
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,290
it is so it could be one row of these
 

291
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,990
it is so it could be one row of these
Pistons this is this is what's supposed

292
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
Pistons this is this is what's supposed
 

293
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,150
Pistons this is this is what's supposed
to be switching these Pistons here and

294
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
to be switching these Pistons here and
 

295
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,650
to be switching these Pistons here and
maybe they're not I don't know let's try

296
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:40,660
maybe they're not I don't know let's try
 

297
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,570
maybe they're not I don't know let's try
this out so they were extended right now

298
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:42,580
this out so they were extended right now
 

299
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,920
this out so they were extended right now
right that's extended okay let's try

300
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:46,930
right that's extended okay let's try
 

301
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,120
right that's extended okay let's try
switches and see if that does anything

302
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,130
switches and see if that does anything
 

303
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,950
switches and see if that does anything
so it's on an even number right now

304
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
so it's on an even number right now
 

305
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,660
so it's on an even number right now
let's try an odd number if it's an odd

306
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:54,670
let's try an odd number if it's an odd
 

307
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,550
let's try an odd number if it's an odd
number it should be different

308
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
number it should be different
 

309
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,690
number it should be different
we'll go for three all right let's go

310
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:03,700
we'll go for three all right let's go
 

311
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,720
we'll go for three all right let's go
check it now see if it if it didn't

312
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:06,730
check it now see if it if it didn't
 

313
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,670
check it now see if it if it didn't
change then something's something's

314
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:08,680
change then something's something's
 

315
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,470
change then something's something's
wrong that's not getting powered for

316
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,480
wrong that's not getting powered for
 

317
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,800
wrong that's not getting powered for
some reason and oh it did change well

318
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:16,810
some reason and oh it did change well
 

319
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,970
some reason and oh it did change well
how about that I need to probably spend

320
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:20,980
how about that I need to probably spend
 

321
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,570
how about that I need to probably spend
a lot of time figuring this out then I

322
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:23,580
a lot of time figuring this out then I
 

323
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,150
a lot of time figuring this out then I
think I spotted the problem thankfully

324
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,160
think I spotted the problem thankfully
 

325
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,620
think I spotted the problem thankfully
this one's an easy fix

326
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:28,630
this one's an easy fix
 

327
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,470
this one's an easy fix
very easy in fact you'll notice on the

328
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:31,480
very easy in fact you'll notice on the
 

329
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,830
very easy in fact you'll notice on the
other side those repeaters are on and on

330
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:34,840
other side those repeaters are on and on
 

331
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,800
other side those repeaters are on and on
this side it is off up to this point

332
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:37,810
this side it is off up to this point
 

333
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,610
this side it is off up to this point
because the repeater is missing here for

334
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:41,620
because the repeater is missing here for
 

335
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,140
because the repeater is missing here for
some reason I might have broke it while

336
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,150
some reason I might have broke it while
 

337
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,010
some reason I might have broke it while
building who knows so that should do it

338
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,020
building who knows so that should do it
 

339
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,780
building who knows so that should do it
now

340
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:48,790
now
 

341
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,040
now
just been doing a few more tests here

342
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,050
just been doing a few more tests here
 

343
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,269
just been doing a few more tests here
things are actually going pretty great

344
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:52,279
things are actually going pretty great
 

345
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,650
things are actually going pretty great
for a while and then more problems this

346
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:56,660
for a while and then more problems this
 

347
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,449
for a while and then more problems this
is actually a good way of debugging this

348
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:58,459
is actually a good way of debugging this
 

349
00:08:58,459 --> 00:08:59,829
is actually a good way of debugging this
like figuring out where the issue is I

350
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
like figuring out where the issue is I
 

351
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,210
like figuring out where the issue is I
just left it writing I and this follow

352
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,220
just left it writing I and this follow
 

353
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,699
just left it writing I and this follow
the blinking lights to where it stops

354
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:03,709
the blinking lights to where it stops
 

355
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,380
the blinking lights to where it stops
and then that's usually where the

356
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,390
and then that's usually where the
 

357
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,350
and then that's usually where the
problem is as is with this case just a

358
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,360
problem is as is with this case just a
 

359
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,420
problem is as is with this case just a
slightest little mistake you know will

360
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:10,430
slightest little mistake you know will
 

361
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,199
slightest little mistake you know will
will wreck everything and in this case

362
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:13,209
will wreck everything and in this case
 

363
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,760
will wreck everything and in this case
redstone signal only travels as far at

further so fortunately I'm going to put

370
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:23,930
further so fortunately I'm going to put
 

371
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,850
further so fortunately I'm going to put
a repeater there and probably have to do

372
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:27,860
a repeater there and probably have to do
 

373
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,680
a repeater there and probably have to do
that a few more times here for each of

374
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:29,690
that a few more times here for each of
 

375
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,260
that a few more times here for each of
these ones affected oh man oh snappers

376
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,270
these ones affected oh man oh snappers
 

377
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,480
these ones affected oh man oh snappers
things are happening guys progress is

378
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,490
things are happening guys progress is
 

379
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,070
things are happening guys progress is
being made I'm now in the middle of

380
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,080
being made I'm now in the middle of
 

381
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,800
being made I'm now in the middle of
building the code table to this thing so

382
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:41,810
building the code table to this thing so
 

383
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,090
building the code table to this thing so
I got to put one of each item in the

384
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,100
I got to put one of each item in the
 

385
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,160
I got to put one of each item in the
chest give it a code I got to name it on

386
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,170
chest give it a code I got to name it on
 

387
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,260
chest give it a code I got to name it on
an anvil and it it takes a level every

388
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,270
an anvil and it it takes a level every
 

389
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,829
an anvil and it it takes a level every
time so I need like 256 levels total to

390
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:50,839
time so I need like 256 levels total to
 

391
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,130
time so I need like 256 levels total to
do all these items and yeah it's coming

392
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,140
do all these items and yeah it's coming
 

393
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,590
do all these items and yeah it's coming
along here while building this table

394
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:56,600
along here while building this table
 

395
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,840
along here while building this table
though ran into another snag a little

396
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,850
though ran into another snag a little
 

397
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,850
though ran into another snag a little
another little problem I had to have to

398
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:00,860
another little problem I had to have to
 

399
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,310
another little problem I had to have to
work out fixing here there were a few

400
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,320
work out fixing here there were a few
 

401
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,350
work out fixing here there were a few
items missing in our system there mainly

402
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
items missing in our system there mainly
 

403
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,210
items missing in our system there mainly
the food items there was a bunch of them

404
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:07,220
the food items there was a bunch of them
 

405
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,860
the food items there was a bunch of them
missing so I put them in I went and

406
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:08,870
missing so I put them in I went and
 

407
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,530
missing so I put them in I went and
killed a rabbit and killed a pig and

408
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:11,540
killed a rabbit and killed a pig and
 

409
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,500
killed a rabbit and killed a pig and
cook some of the meats and you know made

410
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:14,510
cook some of the meats and you know made
 

411
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,870
cook some of the meats and you know made
some golden carrots we're missing put

412
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
some golden carrots we're missing put
 

413
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,630
some golden carrots we're missing put
them all in the system and then now that

414
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:19,640
them all in the system and then now that
 

415
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,579
them all in the system and then now that
I'm checking it again they're still not

416
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:21,589
I'm checking it again they're still not
 

417
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm checking it again they're still not
there for some reason so for some reason

418
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:23,990
there for some reason so for some reason
 

419
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,199
there for some reason so for some reason
not all the food items are getting to

420
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:26,209
not all the food items are getting to
 

421
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,530
not all the food items are getting to
where they need to go so I've made a

422
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:29,540
where they need to go so I've made a
 

423
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,139
where they need to go so I've made a
little item debugger here try figure out

424
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:32,149
little item debugger here try figure out
 

425
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,510
little item debugger here try figure out
where the problem is because I've tried

426
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:34,520
where the problem is because I've tried
 

427
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,030
where the problem is because I've tried
following an item in it like it's faster

428
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
following an item in it like it's faster
 

429
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,970
following an item in it like it's faster
than me so I can't just go in and walk

430
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:39,980
than me so I can't just go in and walk
 

431
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,569
than me so I can't just go in and walk
this and see where it stops because look

432
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:43,579
this and see where it stops because look
 

433
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,130
this and see where it stops because look
it gets too far ahead of me and then I

434
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,140
it gets too far ahead of me and then I
 

435
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,620
it gets too far ahead of me and then I
don't see where it goes so I'm going to

436
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:46,630
don't see where it goes so I'm going to
 

437
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,420
don't see where it goes so I'm going to
have several items going here and

438
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,430
have several items going here and
 

439
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,590
have several items going here and
hopefully I can see what is going on

440
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,600
hopefully I can see what is going on
 

441
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,980
hopefully I can see what is going on
where the trouble is all right they're

442
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:56,990
where the trouble is all right they're
 

443
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,500
where the trouble is all right they're
still going

444
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:58,510
still going
 

445
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,030
still going
ah I'm expecting to see a problem up

446
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
ah I'm expecting to see a problem up
 

447
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,410
ah I'm expecting to see a problem up
here but so far still so good

448
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:07,420
here but so far still so good
 

449
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,870
here but so far still so good
still so good yes that made sense oh

450
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:11,880
still so good yes that made sense oh
 

451
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,850
still so good yes that made sense oh
yeah this is where they're stopping aha

452
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:14,860

those are all the items I tried to put

458
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,490
those are all the items I tried to put
 

459
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,890
those are all the items I tried to put
in the system I wonder what this was

460
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:28,900
in the system I wonder what this was
 

461
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,880
in the system I wonder what this was
supposed to be before and why it got

462
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:32,890
supposed to be before and why it got
 

463
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,170
supposed to be before and why it got
messed up maybe this was emptying and

464
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,180
messed up maybe this was emptying and
 

465
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,880
messed up maybe this was emptying and
something I don't know alright I spotted

466
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:38,890
something I don't know alright I spotted
 

467
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,360
something I don't know alright I spotted
the problem alright well I just had an

468
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,370
the problem alright well I just had an
 

469
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,960
the problem alright well I just had an
idea here we need a lot of XP to do all

470
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:45,970
idea here we need a lot of XP to do all
 

471
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,570
idea here we need a lot of XP to do all
this to to name everything in the anvils

472
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:48,580
this to to name everything in the anvils
 

473
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,400
this to to name everything in the anvils
and I've had like over a chest of coal

474
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,410
and I've had like over a chest of coal
 

475
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,200
and I've had like over a chest of coal
ore that I've been considering just

476
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,210
ore that I've been considering just
 

477
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,230
ore that I've been considering just
throwing away because I don't really

478
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
throwing away because I don't really
 

479
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,490
throwing away because I don't really
want to break it all like and just break

480
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:02,500
want to break it all like and just break
 

481
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,170
want to break it all like and just break
it you know like I have lots of coal

482
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,180
it you know like I have lots of coal
 

483
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,370
it you know like I have lots of coal
laying around it's not something I

484
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,380
laying around it's not something I
 

485
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,950
laying around it's not something I
probably would ever do just to get the

486
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:07,960
probably would ever do just to get the
 

487
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,410
probably would ever do just to get the
coal from it but it works out pretty

488
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:10,420
coal from it but it works out pretty
 

489
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,790
coal from it but it works out pretty
good in this case because we get a

490
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:11,800
good in this case because we get a
 

491
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,430
good in this case because we get a
little bit of XP from this and I don't

492
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:14,440
little bit of XP from this and I don't
 

493
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,680
little bit of XP from this and I don't
have to go all the way to the end or

494
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:16,690
have to go all the way to the end or
 

495
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,390
have to go all the way to the end or
something like that which is what I was

496
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:18,400
something like that which is what I was
 

497
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,760
something like that which is what I was
doing was taking quite a bit of time

498
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:20,770
doing was taking quite a bit of time
 

499
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,760
doing was taking quite a bit of time
walking back and forth here so I got

500
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:23,770
walking back and forth here so I got
 

501
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,650
walking back and forth here so I got
like portable XP here and this way I can

502
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:25,660
like portable XP here and this way I can
 

503
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,530
like portable XP here and this way I can
actually get the coal out of these ores

504
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:27,540
actually get the coal out of these ores
 

505
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,710
actually get the coal out of these ores
two birds in one stone type of thing you

506
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:31,720
two birds in one stone type of thing you
 

507
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,390
two birds in one stone type of thing you
really don't get a lot of XP from it

508
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,400
really don't get a lot of XP from it
 

509
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,670
really don't get a lot of XP from it
though I'm noticing you need to bring a

510
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
though I'm noticing you need to bring a
 

511
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,660
though I'm noticing you need to bring a
lot of coal but every 16 levels I get

512
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:39,670
lot of coal but every 16 levels I get
 

513
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,510
lot of coal but every 16 levels I get
basically then what I do drop off the

514
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:42,520
basically then what I do drop off the
 

515
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,950
basically then what I do drop off the
coal and I will go up into our room here

516
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:48,960
coal and I will go up into our room here
 

517
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,830
coal and I will go up into our room here
woah and start taking the items out from

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:52,840
woah and start taking the items out from
 

519
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,440
woah and start taking the items out from
the droppers here starting from this end

520
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,450
the droppers here starting from this end
 

521
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,660
the droppers here starting from this end
and working my way down trying to be

then I go to the anvil name them all put
 

529
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,080
then I go to the anvil name them all put
them in the chest break some more coal

them in the chest break some more coal
 

531
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,420
them in the chest break some more coal
this one's messed up there's no way this

532
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:09,430
this one's messed up there's no way this
 

533
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,290
this one's messed up there's no way this
is supposed to be dirt

534
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:11,300
is supposed to be dirt
 

535
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,030
is supposed to be dirt
all right I don't know why it's dirt

536
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
all right I don't know why it's dirt
 

537
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,880
all right I don't know why it's dirt
I'll have to fix that later because it's

538
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:18,890
I'll have to fix that later because it's
 

539
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,199
I'll have to fix that later because it's
supposed to be like slabs and stairs

540
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:20,209
supposed to be like slabs and stairs
 

541
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:23,710
supposed to be like slabs and stairs
here but that one got overwritten

542
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:23,720
here but that one got overwritten
 

543
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,600
here but that one got overwritten
somehow the other one I figured out what

544
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,610
somehow the other one I figured out what
 

545
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,740
somehow the other one I figured out what
it was I'm pretty sure it was just

546
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:26,750
it was I'm pretty sure it was just
 

547
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,819
it was I'm pretty sure it was just
regular clay

548
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:27,829
regular clay
 

549
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:32,259
regular clay
I got her done man I can't believe it I

550
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:32,269
I got her done man I can't believe it I
 

551
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,870
I got her done man I can't believe it I
did it all in one day here finished the

552
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
did it all in one day here finished the
 

553
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,230
did it all in one day here finished the
tables oh my goodness I went through

554
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
tables oh my goodness I went through
 

555
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,630
tables oh my goodness I went through
like 20 anvils aiming all this stuff it

556
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:40,640
like 20 anvils aiming all this stuff it
 

557
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,110
like 20 anvils aiming all this stuff it
was insane

558
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
was insane
 

559
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,560
was insane
so now ideally there's a couple spots

560
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:47,570
so now ideally there's a couple spots
 

561
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,440
so now ideally there's a couple spots
missing and why is there a sign here I

562
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,450
missing and why is there a sign here I
 

563
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,910
missing and why is there a sign here I
don't understand like these are flowers

564
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
don't understand like these are flowers
 

565
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,490
don't understand like these are flowers
and plants somehow a sign got mixed in

566
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:54,500
and plants somehow a sign got mixed in
 

567
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,440
and plants somehow a sign got mixed in
the middle there don't know what that's

568
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,450
the middle there don't know what that's
 

569
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,600
the middle there don't know what that's
about but for the most part its complete

570
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,610
about but for the most part its complete
 

571
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,389
about but for the most part its complete
here got to figure out what what belongs

572
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:01,399
here got to figure out what what belongs
 

573
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,110
here got to figure out what what belongs
where this dirt is too because we have

574
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
where this dirt is too because we have
 

575
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,800
where this dirt is too because we have
two dirts pretty sure yeah here's here's

576
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:08,810
two dirts pretty sure yeah here's here's
 

577
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,199
two dirts pretty sure yeah here's here's
the real dirt and this is supposed to be

578
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,209
the real dirt and this is supposed to be
 

579
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:16,030
the real dirt and this is supposed to be
podzol but yeah if all goes according to

580
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,040
podzol but yeah if all goes according to
 

581
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,740
podzol but yeah if all goes according to
plan I would actually be really amazed

582
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,750
plan I would actually be really amazed
 

583
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,210
plan I would actually be really amazed
if this worked let's be dee let's try to

584
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,220
if this worked let's be dee let's try to
 

585
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,160
if this worked let's be dee let's try to
get BD we'll just pick a random one here

586
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,170
get BD we'll just pick a random one here
 

587
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,350
get BD we'll just pick a random one here
see if it works or not we should be able

588
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,360
see if it works or not we should be able
 

589
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,500
see if it works or not we should be able
to just pick any item we want now though

590
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:29,510
to just pick any item we want now though
 

591
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,920
to just pick any item we want now though
and request it this has to be flipped

592
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:32,930
and request it this has to be flipped
 

593
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,620
and request it this has to be flipped
again though see what I did with the

594
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:35,630
again though see what I did with the
 

595
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,590
again though see what I did with the
displays I switched this light here with

596
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:38,600
displays I switched this light here with
 

597
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,480
displays I switched this light here with
this one this one with this one this one

598
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,490
this one this one with this one this one
 

599
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,079
this one this one with this one this one
with with that one and so so forth that

600
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:47,089
with with that one and so so forth that
 

601
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,360
with with that one and so so forth that
I had the right idea of switching the

602
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,370
I had the right idea of switching the
 

603
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,639
I had the right idea of switching the
displays I just did in the wrong way

604
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:51,649
displays I just did in the wrong way
 

605
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:54,010
displays I just did in the wrong way
what I really need to do is switch this

606
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,020
what I really need to do is switch this
 

607
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,019
what I really need to do is switch this
light with this one this one with this

608
00:14:59,019 --> 00:14:59,029
light with this one this one with this
 

609
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,319
light with this one this one with this
one this one with this one because

610
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:02,329
one this one with this one because
 

611
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,380
one this one with this one because
binary also is right-to-left I found out

612
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,390
binary also is right-to-left I found out
 

613
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,710
binary also is right-to-left I found out
I just looked up like on the wiki it the

614
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
I just looked up like on the wiki it the
 

615
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,040
I just looked up like on the wiki it the
binary wiki so this equals one and this

616
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,050
binary wiki so this equals one and this
 

617
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,639
binary wiki so this equals one and this
is 128 all right so I I did this

618
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:21,649
is 128 all right so I I did this
 

619
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,790
is 128 all right so I I did this
backwards because when this lights on I

620
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
backwards because when this lights on I
 

621
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,120
backwards because when this lights on I
count

622
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,130
count
 

623
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,550
count
that is one leaf if this is on off off

624
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:27,560
that is one leaf if this is on off off
 

625
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,610
that is one leaf if this is on off off
off off off off off I count that as one

626
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:30,620
off off off off off I count that as one
 

627
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,980
off off off off off I count that as one
currently so if I flip the display so

628
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:32,990
currently so if I flip the display so
 

629
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,980
currently so if I flip the display so
that that light is over there then it

630
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:35,990
that that light is over there then it
 

631
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,420
that that light is over there then it

709
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,520
all right let's go back though we'll see
if we got stone brick

710
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:38,530
if we got stone brick
 

711
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,440
if we got stone brick
hopefully hopefully see if it picked the

712
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,450
hopefully hopefully see if it picked the
 

713
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,279
hopefully hopefully see if it picked the
right item anyway it did not hit no that

714

this repeater here but it's going

730
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:14,809
this repeater here but it's going
 

731
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:17,190
this repeater here but it's going
through two blocks instead of just one

732
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
through two blocks instead of just one
 

733

if I want to put per per blocks in here

804
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:14,169
if I want to put per per blocks in here
 

805
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,899
if I want to put per per blocks in here
for example I have to take something out

806
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:15,909
for example I have to take something out
 

807
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:17,489
for example I have to take something out
something I don't really necessarily

808
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:17,499
something I don't really necessarily
 

809
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:20,489

want like leads for example not a high
 

811
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,649
want like leads for example not a high
priority item I could replace that with

812
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:22,659
priority item I could replace that with
 

813
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,749
priority item I could replace that with
another type of block but I can't really

814
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:24,759
another type of block but I can't really
 

815
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,759
another type of block but I can't really
expand the system nor do I really want

816
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:26,769
expand the system nor do I really want
 

817
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:29,579
expand the system nor do I really want
to because the level of complexity of

818
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:29,589
to because the level of complexity of
 

819
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:34,289
to because the level of complexity of
this thing already is just insane so so

820
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:34,299
this thing already is just insane so so
 

821
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,969
this thing already is just insane so so
yeah but yeah it seems to be working and

822
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:38,979
yeah but yeah it seems to be working and
 

823
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:41,399
yeah but yeah it seems to be working and
of course if we want to put an item back

824
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:41,409
of course if we want to put an item back
 

825
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,229
of course if we want to put an item back
inside to just put in this chest seems

826
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:43,239
inside to just put in this chest seems
 

827
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,199
inside to just put in this chest seems
to get there automatically sorted pretty

828
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:46,209
to get there automatically sorted pretty
 

829
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:51,919
to get there automatically sorted pretty

there's any stone inside the system

838
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:03,819
there's any stone inside the system
 

839
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:07,439

00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:40,859
build the technical part of it anyway
 

857
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,109
build the technical part of it anyway
obviously we got some building to do the

858
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:43,119
obviously we got some building to do the
 

859
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,409
obviously we got some building to do the
building itself has not been built but

860
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:46,419
building itself has not been built but
 

861
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,199
building itself has not been built but
all the head-scratching hair-pulling out

862
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:49,209
all the head-scratching hair-pulling out
 

863
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:50,879
all the head-scratching hair-pulling out
part of the build is done all the

part of the build is done all the
 

865
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:54,839
part of the build is done all the
tedious repetitive copy this this thing

866
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:54,849
tedious repetitive copy this this thing
 

867
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:59,909
tedious repetitive copy this this thing
256 times is all done and I just feel

relief though because honest
 

873

relief though because honest
guys when I started building this I knew

874
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:07,419
guys when I started building this I knew
 

875
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:09,740
guys when I started building this I knew
it was going to be a big project I

876
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:09,750
it was going to be a big project I
 

877
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,299
it was going to be a big project I
underestimated just how big it was and I

878
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:14,309
underestimated just how big it was and I
 

879
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:16,590
underestimated just how big it was and I
didn't plan it all out in creative mode

880
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:16,600
didn't plan it all out in creative mode
 

881
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
didn't plan it all out in creative mode
like believe it or not this wasn't all

882
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:18,370
like believe it or not this wasn't all
 

883
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,039
like believe it or not this wasn't all
figured out in creative mode most of the

884
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,049
figured out in creative mode most of the
 

885
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,799
figured out in creative mode most of the
figuring was done here in survival and

886
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:22,809
figuring was done here in survival and
 

887
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,110
figuring was done here in survival and
there was a very good chance it wasn't

888
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
there was a very good chance it wasn't
 

889
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,190
there was a very good chance it wasn't
going to work in the end of all this but

890
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,200
going to work in the end of all this but
 

891
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,110
going to work in the end of all this but
we pulled through somehow it does

892
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
we pulled through somehow it does
 

893
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,049
we pulled through somehow it does
actually work and seems like it'll

894
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:34,059
actually work and seems like it'll
 

895
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,899
actually work and seems like it'll
actually be practical which was another

896
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:36,909
actually be practical which was another
 

897
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:38,070
actually be practical which was another
thing I was worried about like yeah

898
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
thing I was worried about like yeah
 

899
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,749
thing I was worried about like yeah
maybe we can get it working but is it

900
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:39,759
maybe we can get it working but is it
 

901
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,600
maybe we can get it working but is it
something I can actually use at an

902
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:41,610
something I can actually use at an
 

903
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,909
something I can actually use at an
efficient way in an efficient way

904
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:44,919
efficient way in an efficient way
 

905
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:47,070
efficient way in an efficient way
I kind of blurred two words together

906
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,080
I kind of blurred two words together
 

907
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,220
I kind of blurred two words together
there and it seems like we we're going

908
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,230
there and it seems like we we're going
 

909
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,690
there and it seems like we we're going
to be using it so that's great very

910
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:51,700
to be using it so that's great very
 

911
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,070
to be using it so that's great very
happy about that for the building itself

912
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
happy about that for the building itself
 

913
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
happy about that for the building itself
I decided I want to build it out of

914
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:57,850
I decided I want to build it out of
 

915
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,580
I decided I want to build it out of
those new purpura blocks I like those a

916
00:22:59,580 --> 00:22:59,590
those new purpura blocks I like those a
 

917
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,710
those new purpura blocks I like those a
lot they also seemed kind of futuristic

918
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:01,720
lot they also seemed kind of futuristic
 

919
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,700
lot they also seemed kind of futuristic
like because they're purple right purple

920
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:05,710
like because they're purple right purple
 

921
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,710
like because they're purple right purple
is not really a natural color kind of a

922
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:07,720
is not really a natural color kind of a
 

923
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,830
is not really a natural color kind of a
odd block I think that's great for this

924
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,840
odd block I think that's great for this
 

925
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,570
odd block I think that's great for this
I like the way they look I'm going to do

926
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:12,580
I like the way they look I'm going to do
 

927
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,549
I like the way they look I'm going to do
pepper and quartz and maybe one other

928
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
pepper and quartz and maybe one other
 

929
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,379
pepper and quartz and maybe one other
type of block mixed in here with the

930
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:16,389
type of block mixed in here with the
 

931
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,869
type of block mixed in here with the
main room and then we got to like

932
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:18,879
main room and then we got to like
 

933
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:20,909
main room and then we got to like
connect this main room to these hallways

934
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:20,919
connect this main room to these hallways
 

935
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:23,100
connect this main room to these hallways
because I want to still be able to enter

936
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,110
because I want to still be able to enter
 

937
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,440
because I want to still be able to enter
into the storage room even though we

938
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,450
into the storage room even though we
 

939
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,799
into the storage room even though we
don't really need to go in there but may

940
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:28,809
don't really need to go in there but may
 

941
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,340
don't really need to go in there but may
as well make a way of getting into there

942
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,350
as well make a way of getting into there
 

943
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,539
as well make a way of getting into there
because I kind of designed it around

944
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:33,549
because I kind of designed it around
 

945
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,789

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,870
into our system here I don't think not
not like super well I think one thing we

1104
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:39,880
not like super well I think one thing we
 

1105
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,510
not like super well I think one thing we
could do is add a like instead of this

1106
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:42,520
could do is add a like instead of this
 

1107
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,220
could do is add a like instead of this
being glowstone we could add the

1108
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,230
being glowstone we could add the
 

1109
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,710
being glowstone we could add the
lingering potion ingredient here and

1110
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
lingering potion ingredient here and
 

1111
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,990
lingering potion ingredient here and
then we just dump items in that we want

1112
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,000
then we just dump items in that we want
 

1113
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
then we just dump items in that we want
to make lingering in here and then they

1114
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,010
to make lingering in here and then they
 

1115
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,300
to make lingering in here and then they
would they would get the effect applied

1116
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,310
would they would get the effect applied
 

1117
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,860
would they would get the effect applied
but one of the other things about them

1118
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:55,870
but one of the other things about them
 

1119
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,410
but one of the other things about them
updating the potions is I think all the

1120
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:58,420
updating the potions is I think all the
 

1121
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,050
updating the potions is I think all the
previous like the old ones were broken

1122
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,060
previous like the old ones were broken
 

1123
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,290
previous like the old ones were broken
so all these ones we have brewed already

1124
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:04,300
so all these ones we have brewed already
 

1125
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,790
so all these ones we have brewed already
might not work when we update and this

1126
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:08,800
might not work when we update and this
 

1127
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,980
might not work when we update and this
will all be like a bad batch basically

1128
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:10,990
will all be like a bad batch basically
 

1129
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,430
will all be like a bad batch basically
and that would kind of suck but maybe

1130
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:14,440
and that would kind of suck but maybe
 

1131
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,520
and that would kind of suck but maybe
they'll fix it up before before I update

1132
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:17,530
they'll fix it up before before I update
 

1133
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,300
they'll fix it up before before I update
