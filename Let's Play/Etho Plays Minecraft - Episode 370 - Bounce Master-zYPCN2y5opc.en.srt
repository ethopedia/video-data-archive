these are water temples we have not been
 

33
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,779
these are water temples we have not been
to yet so that's pretty cool and there's

34
00:00:59,779 --> 00:00:59,789
to yet so that's pretty cool and there's
 

35
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,189
to yet so that's pretty cool and there's
some light in the water there too I'm

36
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
some light in the water there too I'm
 

37
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,170
some light in the water there too I'm
guessing it's a lava pool but I kind of

38
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,180
guessing it's a lava pool but I kind of
 

39
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,000
guessing it's a lava pool but I kind of
want to go check that out but that has

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,010
want to go check that out but that has
 

41
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,530
want to go check that out but that has
nothing to do with why this place is

42
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:06,540
nothing to do with why this place is
 

43
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,469
nothing to do with why this place is
special the reason I was looking for

44
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:09,479
special the reason I was looking for
 

45
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,740
special the reason I was looking for
this spot this is like an island out in

46
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:12,750
this spot this is like an island out in
 

47
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,750
this spot this is like an island out in
the middle of an ocean you got desert

48
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:14,760
the middle of an ocean you got desert
 

49
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,600
the middle of an ocean you got desert
over here there's only a little bit of

50
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,610
over here there's only a little bit of
 

51
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,460
over here there's only a little bit of
grass outside of this area that I'll

52
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:19,470
grass outside of this area that I'll
 

53
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,260
grass outside of this area that I'll
have to take care of but I want to build

54
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,270
have to take care of but I want to build
 

55
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,510
have to take care of but I want to build
a passive mob farm right over here aha

56
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
a passive mob farm right over here aha
 

57
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,039
a passive mob farm right over here aha
and and yeah so that's our our little

58
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,049
and and yeah so that's our our little
 

59
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,480
and and yeah so that's our our little
project for today the reason I want to

60
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,490
project for today the reason I want to
 

61
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,280
project for today the reason I want to
build a passive mob farm I have found

62
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,290
build a passive mob farm I have found
 

63
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,910
build a passive mob farm I have found
out I always had this assumption that

64
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:40,920
out I always had this assumption that
 

65
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,280
out I always had this assumption that
you could only spawn horses in once in

66
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,290
you could only spawn horses in once in
 

67
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,420
you could only spawn horses in once in
your world like when you load a new

68
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,430
your world like when you load a new
 

69
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,670
your world like when you load a new
chunk that's when you get your horses

70
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
chunk that's when you get your horses
 

71
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,050
chunk that's when you get your horses
and there's no chance of getting any

72
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,060
and there's no chance of getting any
 

73
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,310
and there's no chance of getting any
more unless you go to new world turns

74
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
more unless you go to new world turns
 

75
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,800
more unless you go to new world turns
out that is not true I found out today

76
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:54,810
out that is not true I found out today
 

77
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,410
out that is not true I found out today
you have to you just have to kill all

78
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:57,420
you have to you just have to kill all
 

79
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,850
you have to you just have to kill all
the passive mobs in the area and there's

80
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:58,860
the passive mobs in the area and there's
 

81
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,480
the passive mobs in the area and there's
a chance to get horses Oh guardians are

82
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,490
a chance to get horses Oh guardians are
 

83
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,760
a chance to get horses Oh guardians are
getting out here so this is a Plains

84
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,770
getting out here so this is a Plains
 

85
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,429
getting out here so this is a Plains
biome which is important if I tell all

86
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
biome which is important if I tell all
 

87
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,710
biome which is important if I tell all
these sheep and cows here we should get

88
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:09,720
these sheep and cows here we should get
 

89
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,320
these sheep and cows here we should get
horses so if we can kind of automate

90
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,330
horses so if we can kind of automate
 

91
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,600
horses so if we can kind of automate
that somehow

92
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:13,610
that somehow
 

93
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,580
that somehow
we can spawn a lot of horses and I'll be

94
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:16,590
we can spawn a lot of horses and I'll be
 

95
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,900
we can spawn a lot of horses and I'll be
able to get donkeys again in my world

96
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:17,910
able to get donkeys again in my world
 

97
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,480
able to get donkeys again in my world
because right now I don't have any

98
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,490
because right now I don't have any
 

99
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,810
because right now I don't have any
uh-huh

100
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:20,820
uh-huh
 

101
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,060
uh-huh
so probably the easiest way to deal with

102
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,070
so probably the easiest way to deal with
 

103
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,370
so probably the easiest way to deal with
things though is to sort of limit how

104
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,380
things though is to sort of limit how
 

105
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,140
things though is to sort of limit how
much grass area we have and also to

106
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,150
much grass area we have and also to
 

107
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,020
much grass area we have and also to
flatten things out so that's what we're

108
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,030
flatten things out so that's what we're
 

109
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,500
flatten things out so that's what we're
going to do here and I am so lazy I'm

110
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:36,510
going to do here and I am so lazy I'm
 

111
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,480
going to do here and I am so lazy I'm
not even going to dig a hole for the TNT

112
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,490
not even going to dig a hole for the TNT
 

113
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,100
not even going to dig a hole for the TNT
I'm just gonna TNT a hole for more TNT

114
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,110
I'm just gonna TNT a hole for more TNT
 

115
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,690
I'm just gonna TNT a hole for more TNT
that's right amazing because usually it

116
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:47,700
that's right amazing because usually it
 

117
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,760
that's right amazing because usually it
takes like two or three minutes just to

118
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:49,770
takes like two or three minutes just to
 

119
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,050
takes like two or three minutes just to
dig a hole for all the tea and tea I

120
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,060
dig a hole for all the tea and tea I
 

121
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,230
dig a hole for all the tea and tea I
place I'm finally at the point in my

122
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:54,240
place I'm finally at the point in my
 

123
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,170
place I'm finally at the point in my
world here where I got more TNT than I

124
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,180
world here where I got more TNT than I
 

125
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,020
world here where I got more TNT than I
know what to do with it so any chance I

126
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,030
know what to do with it so any chance I
 

127
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,620
know what to do with it so any chance I
can use it the same timer to have fun

128
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:02,630
can use it the same timer to have fun
 

129
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,000
can use it the same timer to have fun
yes let's take it so I use two stacks

130
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,010
yes let's take it so I use two stacks
 

131
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,100
yes let's take it so I use two stacks
and I guess this is going to be our

132
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,110
and I guess this is going to be our
 

133
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,770
and I guess this is going to be our
explosion platform it's a little bit

134
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:12,780
explosion platform it's a little bit
 

135
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:23,740
explosion platform it's a little bit
risky but we will try it here we go whew

136
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:23,750
risky but we will try it here we go whew
 

137
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,000
risky but we will try it here we go whew
that was actually more contained than I

138
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,010
that was actually more contained than I
 

139
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,380
that was actually more contained than I
thought it would be nice Wow look at

140
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,390
thought it would be nice Wow look at
 

141
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,540
thought it would be nice Wow look at
that

142
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:31,550
that
 

143
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,800
that
okay well this should be a little bit

144
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:33,810
okay well this should be a little bit
 

145
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,980
okay well this should be a little bit
more fun I use the rest of D&D there's

146
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:36,990
more fun I use the rest of D&D there's
 

147
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:46,930
more fun I use the rest of D&D there's
four stacks hopefully this does a lot

148
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:46,940

 

149
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,869

No

150
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:49,879
No
 

151
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,430
No
we're good

152
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
we're good
 

153
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,880
we're good

ooh right in the face man
 

155
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,980
ooh right in the face man
uh yeah a little bit more I am going to

156
00:03:59,980 --> 00:03:59,990
uh yeah a little bit more I am going to
 

157
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,270
uh yeah a little bit more I am going to
have to get a beacon over here though it

158
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
have to get a beacon over here though it
 

159
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,440
have to get a beacon over here though it
looks like okay so I decided rather than

160
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,450
looks like okay so I decided rather than
 

161
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,150
looks like okay so I decided rather than

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,340
all right so we can move on to the next
 

177
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,670

step here all the grass has been removed

178
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:30,680
step here all the grass has been removed
 

179
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,400
step here all the grass has been removed
from this island I have removed all the

180
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,410
from this island I have removed all the
 

181
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,880
from this island I have removed all the
grass over there and a bit of the grass

182
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:36,890
grass over there and a bit of the grass
 

183
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,410
grass over there and a bit of the grass
over there you can see I made a line so

184
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:41,420
over there you can see I made a line so
 

185
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,140
over there you can see I made a line so
hopefully it doesn't spread but I think

186
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,150
hopefully it doesn't spread but I think
 

187
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,240
hopefully it doesn't spread but I think
an Enderman might just like grab a grass

188
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,250
an Enderman might just like grab a grass
 

189
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,220
an Enderman might just like grab a grass
block from over there and Transplant it

190
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,230
block from over there and Transplant it
 

191
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,190
block from over there and Transplant it
there and then I got a big problem I

192
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,200
there and then I got a big problem I
 

193
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,810
there and then I got a big problem I
have to take care of so all the dirt

194
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:52,820
have to take care of so all the dirt
 

195
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,580
have to take care of so all the dirt
really needs to be removed anyway so we

196
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:57,590
really needs to be removed anyway so we
 

197
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,600
really needs to be removed anyway so we
are going to where's my chests over here

198
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,610
are going to where's my chests over here
 

199
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,160
are going to where's my chests over here
we're just going to put down a grass

200
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,170
we're just going to put down a grass
 

201
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,520
we're just going to put down a grass
platform and see if anything spawns so

202
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,530
platform and see if anything spawns so
 

203
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,030
platform and see if anything spawns so
it's pretty simple

204
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,040
it's pretty simple
 

205
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,920
it's pretty simple
see this is all sunflower Plains yes it

206
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:11,930
see this is all sunflower Plains yes it
 

207
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,590
see this is all sunflower Plains yes it
is maybe add we'll just build a platform

208
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:14,600
is maybe add we'll just build a platform
 

209
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
is maybe add we'll just build a platform
right over here and then we'll step away

210
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:19,610
right over here and then we'll step away
 

211
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,000
right over here and then we'll step away
from it and we will see if anything

212
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,010
from it and we will see if anything
 

213
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,070
from it and we will see if anything
spawns on it and how long it takes for

214
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
spawns on it and how long it takes for
 

215
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,470
spawns on it and how long it takes for
something to spawn and that should give

216
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:26,480
something to spawn and that should give
 

217
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,990
something to spawn and that should give
us a pretty good idea of what we need to

218
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,000
us a pretty good idea of what we need to
 

219
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,430
us a pretty good idea of what we need to
do well guys we have a little bit of a

do well guys we have a little bit of a
 

221
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,510
do well guys we have a little bit of a
problem here possibly it's been a little

222
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,520
problem here possibly it's been a little
 

223
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,340
problem here possibly it's been a little
while couple minutes anyway and we have

224
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,350
while couple minutes anyway and we have
 

225
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,250
while couple minutes anyway and we have
not got a single mob yet and I've went

around the cylon that went around there
 

229
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,409
around the cylon that went around there
and over there there's no animals around

230

Island I removed all the grass on this

234
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,200
Island I removed all the grass on this
 

235
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,900
Island I removed all the grass on this
should be the only grass in the area

got to figure it out now it's a spawn

242
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:11,730
got to figure it out now it's a spawn
 

243
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,130
got to figure it out now it's a spawn
chunks any animals in our spawn chunks

244
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,140
chunks any animals in our spawn chunks
 

245
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,710
chunks any animals in our spawn chunks
count towards the total population cap

246
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
count towards the total population cap
 

247
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,470
count towards the total population cap
before it stops spawning them so that

248
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:21,480
before it stops spawning them so that
 

249
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,810
before it stops spawning them so that
means this is our spawn right here you

250
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:23,820
means this is our spawn right here you
 

251
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,430
means this is our spawn right here you
got the compass out true spawn right

252
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:28,440
got the compass out true spawn right
 

253
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,590
got the compass out true spawn right
right at this point if we go over top

254
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:30,600
right at this point if we go over top
 

255
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,740
right at this point if we go over top
compass flips around uh-huh

256
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:33,750
compass flips around uh-huh
 

257
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,770
compass flips around uh-huh
so this complicates things extremely

258
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:38,780
so this complicates things extremely
 

259
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,800
so this complicates things extremely
because well we do have these chickens

if I get the population cap down it's
 

271
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,010
if I get the population cap down it's
just going to spawn more because it's

all grass here right so I would have to
 

275
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,050
all grass here right so I would have to
put like 15 chickens in each of the four

put like 15 chickens in each of the four
 

277
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,600
put like 15 chickens in each of the four
corners around the spawn chunks so that

278
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:14,610
corners around the spawn chunks so that
 

279
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,780
corners around the spawn chunks so that
when I'm standing here it won't spawn

280
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:17,790
when I'm standing here it won't spawn
 

281
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,570
when I'm standing here it won't spawn
any new ones or I could try to get rid

so this is what I did before I start the

340
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:44,529
so this is what I did before I start the
 

341
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,100
so this is what I did before I start the
episode this is what gave me the the

342
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,110
episode this is what gave me the the
 

343
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,310
episode this is what gave me the the
hope that I could get this working today

344
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,320
hope that I could get this working today
 

345
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,860
hope that I could get this working today
but then there was another layer to the

346
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:52,870
but then there was another layer to the
 

347
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,720
but then there was another layer to the
whole thing besides the spawn chunks

348
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:54,730
whole thing besides the spawn chunks
 

349
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,500
whole thing besides the spawn chunks
affecting that the mob count and let's

350
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,510
affecting that the mob count and let's
 

351
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,010
affecting that the mob count and let's
go to another world so it turns out even

352
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,020
go to another world so it turns out even
 

353
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,590
go to another world so it turns out even
if we can deal with the spawn chunk

354
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:04,600
if we can deal with the spawn chunk
 

355
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
if we can deal with the spawn chunk

that stuff is loaded all the time by the

that stuff is loaded all the time by the
 

363
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,750
that stuff is loaded all the time by the
spawn chunks even if we were to somehow

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:18,760
spawn chunks even if we were to somehow
 

365
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,410

deal with that or move the spawn chunks

366
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:21,420
deal with that or move the spawn chunks
 

367
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,530
deal with that or move the spawn chunks
we have another problem where it's

368
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:25,540
we have another problem where it's
 

369
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,260
we have another problem where it's
extremely rare to get any passive mobs

370

too bad actually it was like seven or
 

381
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,920

eight spawned if we do it again compared

to a super flat world it's way slower

384
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:52,209
to a super flat world it's way slower
 

385
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,690
to a super flat world it's way slower
though that's because there's a lot more

passive mobs to spawn if we were to cut

400
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,270
passive mobs to spawn if we were to cut
 

401
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,670

it down to only a couple hundred blocks

402
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
it down to only a couple hundred blocks
 

403
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,740
it down to only a couple hundred blocks
like I was planning it's basically not

404
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:19,750
like I was planning it's basically not
 

405
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,150
like I was planning it's basically not
going to happen but anyways guys I guess

always debate like should I just

410
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,040
always debate like should I just
 

411
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,310
always debate like should I just
cut out my fails from the episodes or

412
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
cut out my fails from the episodes or
 

413
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,519
cut out my fails from the episodes or
should I include them like today what we

414
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:33,529
should I include them like today what we
 

415
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,199
should I include them like today what we
just did was basically a waste of time

416
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:35,209
just did was basically a waste of time
 

417
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,360
just did was basically a waste of time

our armor I don't think we can be seen
 

637
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,940
our armor I don't think we can be seen
or else I'm going to get one shotted

if you touch him I hope not
so you can capture these guys with the

644
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,060
so you can capture these guys with the
 

645
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,170
so you can capture these guys with the
minecarts for sure and he is big isn't

646
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,180
minecarts for sure and he is big isn't
 

647
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,480
minecarts for sure and he is big isn't
he

648
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,490

 

649
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,890

this guy might not be good actually

650
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:51,900
this guy might not be good actually
 

651
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,670
this guy might not be good actually
because he's a little bit too trapped in

652
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
because he's a little bit too trapped in
 

653
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,560
because he's a little bit too trapped in
here how tall is he is he okay he's not

654
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:00,570
here how tall is he is he okay he's not
 

655
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,690
here how tall is he is he okay he's not
he's only two blocks or three blocks

656
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:02,700
he's only two blocks or three blocks
 

657
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:13,070
he's only two blocks or three blocks
maybe yeah so he's about oh oh no don't

658
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,080
maybe yeah so he's about oh oh no don't
 

659

run away don't run away I could

660
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:17,780
run away don't run away I could
 

661
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:24,530
run away don't run away I could
potentially like empty all the water out

662
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:24,540
potentially like empty all the water out
 

663
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,860
potentially like empty all the water out
of this room pretty easily with these

664
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:26,870
of this room pretty easily with these
 

665
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:32,600
of this room pretty easily with these
all right yeah I've got air pockets now

666
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:32,610
all right yeah I've got air pockets now
 

667
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,260
all right yeah I've got air pockets now
I wanted to make a portal to transport

668
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,270
I wanted to make a portal to transport
 

669
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,840
I wanted to make a portal to transport
them into the nether but I don't think

670
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:38,850
them into the nether but I don't think
 

671
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,430
them into the nether but I don't think
I'll be able to set one up big enough in

672
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,440
I'll be able to set one up big enough in
 

673
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,030
I'll be able to set one up big enough in
this room all right well let's try it

674
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,040
this room all right well let's try it
 

675
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,890
this room all right well let's try it
anyway we will see if we can build a

676
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:45,900
anyway we will see if we can build a
 

677
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,400
anyway we will see if we can build a
portal

678
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,410
portal
 

679
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,920
portal
he's just bigger than I thought he was

680
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:48,930
he's just bigger than I thought he was
 

681
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,090
he's just bigger than I thought he was
is the problem so we might be able to

682
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,100
is the problem so we might be able to
 

683
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,640
is the problem so we might be able to
fit them through but it's not looking

684
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:55,650
fit them through but it's not looking
 

685
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:02,290
fit them through but it's not looking
the greatest put that there that there

686
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:02,300
the greatest put that there that there
 

687
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,740
the greatest put that there that there
this here and then if we slime block the

688
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:06,750
this here and then if we slime block the
 

689
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,590
this here and then if we slime block the
middle we might be able to light it

690
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600

 

691
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,520

although hmm it's so tough because we

692
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,530
although hmm it's so tough because we
 

693
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,730
although hmm it's so tough because we
can't uh ooh

694
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:19,740
can't uh ooh
 

695
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,409
can't uh ooh
he took damage

696
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:22,419
he took damage
 

697
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:25,390
he took damage
it's tough because we can't break blocks

698
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:25,400
it's tough because we can't break blocks
 

699
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,220
it's tough because we can't break blocks
normally we unless you're using these

700
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,230
normally we unless you're using these
 

701
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,409
normally we unless you're using these
slime blocks oh there we go today maybe

702
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:32,419
slime blocks oh there we go today maybe
 

703
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:37,080
slime blocks oh there we go today maybe
if we do don't can't break it like that

704
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,090
if we do don't can't break it like that
 

705
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,039
if we do don't can't break it like that
you know what I got to do I got to get

706
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:39,049
you know what I got to do I got to get
 

707
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,690
you know what I got to do I got to get
rid of all the water around it that's

708
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:40,700
rid of all the water around it that's
 

709
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,950
rid of all the water around it that's
right and make sure it doesn't reek

710
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:44,960
right and make sure it doesn't reek
 

711
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,100
right and make sure it doesn't reek
reate it slope maybe this is a nightmare

712
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,110
reate it slope maybe this is a nightmare
 

713
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:56,529
reate it slope maybe this is a nightmare
um don't think it's gonna work no

714
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:56,539
um don't think it's gonna work no
 

715
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:04,750
um don't think it's gonna work no
there's still water here darn it um what

716
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:04,760
there's still water here darn it um what
 

717
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,090
there's still water here darn it um what
to do what to do what if we do it like

718
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,100
to do what to do what if we do it like
 

719
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:16,360
to do what to do what if we do it like
this and I go inside with it and then we

720
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,370
this and I go inside with it and then we
 

721
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,789
this and I go inside with it and then we
do this here we go here we go this might

722
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:21,799
do this here we go here we go this might
 

723
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:28,409
do this here we go here we go this might
work okay now I can probably light it

724
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:28,419
work okay now I can probably light it
 

725
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:36,010
work okay now I can probably light it
break ourselves out see a minecart idea

726
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,020
break ourselves out see a minecart idea
 

727
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,039
break ourselves out see a minecart idea
looking easier that then what I'm doing

728
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,049
looking easier that then what I'm doing
 

729
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,580
looking easier that then what I'm doing
here possibly so now I want to see if I

730
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:42,590
here possibly so now I want to see if I
 

731
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,930
here possibly so now I want to see if I
can push him into it so I'm going to set

732
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:43,940
can push him into it so I'm going to set
 

733
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:50,919
can push him into it so I'm going to set
up a couple blocks alongside it and kind

734
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:50,929
up a couple blocks alongside it and kind
 

735
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:56,200
up a couple blocks alongside it and kind
of shove them oh did work yes oh man all

736
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,210
of shove them oh did work yes oh man all
 

737
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,880
of shove them oh did work yes oh man all
right what are we doing on invisibility

738
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:57,890
right what are we doing on invisibility
 

739
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,010
right what are we doing on invisibility
we're still good let's go through and

740
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,020
we're still good let's go through and
 

741
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:11,289
we're still good let's go through and
see where he ended up oh man that is

742
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:11,299
see where he ended up oh man that is
 

743
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:12,480
see where he ended up oh man that is
awesome

744

awesome
 

745
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,710
awesome
all right so we got him to the nether

746
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
all right so we got him to the nether
 

747
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,080
all right so we got him to the nether
now if we want to move them he can

748
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,090
now if we want to move them he can
 

749
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,890
now if we want to move them he can
either jump around himself or a lot of

750
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:20,900
either jump around himself or a lot of
 

751
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,750
either jump around himself or a lot of
that hurt or we could move them with a

752
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:22,760
that hurt or we could move them with a
 

753
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,210
that hurt or we could move them with a
minecart

754
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:25,220
minecart
 

755
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,140
minecart
darn I can't break it Oh guys you know

756
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,150
darn I can't break it Oh guys you know
 

757
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,450
darn I can't break it Oh guys you know
what we got to try here the normal

758
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:32,460
what we got to try here the normal
 

759
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,460
what we got to try here the normal
Guardians they bounce like crazy on

760
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,470
Guardians they bounce like crazy on
 

761
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,110
Guardians they bounce like crazy on
slime blocks I want to see if he does

762
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,120
slime blocks I want to see if he does
 

763
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,279
slime blocks I want to see if he does
too can I place it I don't know if he's

764
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:40,289
too can I place it I don't know if he's
 

765
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,480
too can I place it I don't know if he's
jumping high enough oh he's just jumping

766
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,490
jumping high enough oh he's just jumping
 

767
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:52,070
jumping high enough oh he's just jumping
a little bit short okay yeah let's try a

768
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
a little bit short okay yeah let's try a
 

769
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,750
a little bit short okay yeah let's try a
half slab just to get him a little bit

770
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
half slab just to get him a little bit
 

771
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,560
half slab just to get him a little bit
higher up should be able to place this

772
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:57,570
higher up should be able to place this
 

773
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,960
higher up should be able to place this
right right right yeah there we go

774
00:20:59,960 --> 00:20:59,970
right right right yeah there we go
 

775
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,120
right right right yeah there we go
oops I didn't want to place too okay now

776
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,130
oops I didn't want to place too okay now
 

777
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:09,080
oops I didn't want to place too okay now
I should be able to put this down oh he

778
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,090
I should be able to put this down oh he
 

779
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,409
I should be able to put this down oh he
had a bounce Oh

780
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:14,419

 

781
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,060

sometimes he bounces yeah he's bouncing

782
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,070
sometimes he bounces yeah he's bouncing
 

783

OOP sorry guy sorry um maybe we will do

786
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,710
OOP sorry guy sorry um maybe we will do
 

787
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,590
OOP sorry guy sorry um maybe we will do
something fun with that because I have a

788
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:24,600
something fun with that because I have a
 

789
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,390
something fun with that because I have a
feeling he's going to be able to bounce

790
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
feeling he's going to be able to bounce
 

791
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,360
feeling he's going to be able to bounce
like 10 to 15 blocks up like the normal

792
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,370
like 10 to 15 blocks up like the normal
 

793

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:40,710
just how annoying it would be to have
 

801
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,090
just how annoying it would be to have

I'm going to drink the milk and we'll

804
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,530
I'm going to drink the milk and we'll
 

805
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,350
I'm going to drink the milk and we'll
see how long it is before we get another

806
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,360
see how long it is before we get another
 

807
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,289
see how long it is before we get another
one of those in the meantime I'm going

808
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:51,299
one of those in the meantime I'm going
 

809
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,690
one of those in the meantime I'm going
to try to change this up so he has more

810
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:56,700
to try to change this up so he has more
 

811
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,360
to try to change this up so he has more
freedom to bounce or more space to

812
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,370
freedom to bounce or more space to
 

813
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,710
freedom to bounce or more space to
bounce so I'm going to dig out above

814
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
bounce so I'm going to dig out above
 

815
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,850
bounce so I'm going to dig out above
them so far hasn't kicked back in that's

816
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:04,860
them so far hasn't kicked back in that's
 

817
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:11,870
them so far hasn't kicked back in that's
good where is he he's probably oh yeah

818
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:11,880
good where is he he's probably oh yeah
 

819
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,700
good where is he he's probably oh yeah
he's right there I gotta shut the portal

820
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:13,710
he's right there I gotta shut the portal
 

821
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,490
he's right there I gotta shut the portal
off I brought some water to do that and

822
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:16,500
off I brought some water to do that and
 

823
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,060
off I brought some water to do that and
I'm just gonna make him a little thing

824
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,070
I'm just gonna make him a little thing
 

825
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,130
I'm just gonna make him a little thing
for him to bounce up here looks like

826
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,140
for him to bounce up here looks like
 

827
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,060
for him to bounce up here looks like
he's like two by two by two so it's not

828
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,070
he's like two by two by two so it's not
 

829
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,270
he's like two by two by two so it's not
too bad actually it hasn't come back on

830
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
too bad actually it hasn't come back on
 

831
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,480
too bad actually it hasn't come back on
so it probably only comes on every

832
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:31,490
so it probably only comes on every
 

833
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:37,400
so it probably only comes on every
minute or two I don't know we will see

00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:57,750
in the mining fatigue every minute and
 

847
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,090
in the mining fatigue every minute and
that oh there we go again

this time we will aim to get all four
 

879
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,820
this time we will aim to get all four
slime blocks down not just two and see

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:01,830
slime blocks down not just two and see
 

881
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,730
slime blocks down not just two and see
if he'll be okay and I got them healed

882
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:04,740
if he'll be okay and I got them healed
 

883

damage got all four down oh man yeah I

900
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:31,950
damage got all four down oh man yeah I
 

901
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,830
damage got all four down oh man yeah I
think he might be okay now yeah that

902
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:36,840
think he might be okay now yeah that
 

903
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,350
think he might be okay now yeah that
might be might have been the trick let's

904
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
might be might have been the trick let's
 

905
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,400
might be might have been the trick let's
could take a look how high can he jump

906
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,410
could take a look how high can he jump
 

907
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,750
could take a look how high can he jump
um is he hitting his head or H&E go even

908
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
um is he hitting his head or H&E go even
 

909
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,840
um is he hitting his head or H&E go even
higher I wonder

910
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:50,850

 

911
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:58,230

all right let's uh try get up there is

912
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
all right let's uh try get up there is
 

913
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,270
all right let's uh try get up there is
he hitting his head I think he is

914
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,280
he hitting his head I think he is
 

915
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,100
he hitting his head I think he is
actually hitting his head still so he

916
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,110
actually hitting his head still so he
 

917
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,490
actually hitting his head still so he
can jump even higher possibly oh he

918
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:05,500
can jump even higher possibly oh he
 

919
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,910
can jump even higher possibly oh he
kicked in again yeah he seems fine now

920
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:08,920
kicked in again yeah he seems fine now
 

921
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,270
kicked in again yeah he seems fine now
though like he's not taking damage

922
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,280
though like he's not taking damage
 

923
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,610
though like he's not taking damage
that's cool let's do another one of

924
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:14,620
that's cool let's do another one of
 

925
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,550
that's cool let's do another one of
these in us let's make sure we don't get

926
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:17,560
these in us let's make sure we don't get
 

927
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:23,940
these in us let's make sure we don't get
trapped up here good yeah I'm gonna take

928
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:23,950
trapped up here good yeah I'm gonna take
 

929
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,920
trapped up here good yeah I'm gonna take
out some more and apparently I've dug a

930
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:28,930
out some more and apparently I've dug a
 

931
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,000
out some more and apparently I've dug a
top tunnel here and I had no idea okay

932
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,010
top tunnel here and I had no idea okay
 

933
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,620
top tunnel here and I had no idea okay
let's take out these because he might

934
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:37,630
let's take out these because he might
 

935
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,240
let's take out these because he might
even be stronger than the regular

936
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,250
even be stronger than the regular
 

937
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,770
even be stronger than the regular
Guardians like you might be able to jump

938
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:40,780
Guardians like you might be able to jump
 

939
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,320
Guardians like you might be able to jump
even higher than them oh that might be

940
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,330
even higher than them oh that might be
 

941
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:49,470
even higher than them oh that might be
it there yeah that's it holy smokes so

942
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:49,480
it there yeah that's it holy smokes so
 

943
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,500
it there yeah that's it holy smokes so
that could be a fun little display for

944
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,510
that could be a fun little display for
 

945
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,990
that could be a fun little display for
them if we have a long tube that he's

946
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,000
them if we have a long tube that he's
 

947
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,800
them if we have a long tube that he's
