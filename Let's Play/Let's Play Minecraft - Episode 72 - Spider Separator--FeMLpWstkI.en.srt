00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:14,699
episodes but I finally have like the
 

163
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,820
episodes but I finally have like the
perfect idea which I will hopefully get

164
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:19,830
perfect idea which I will hopefully get
 

165
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,820
perfect idea which I will hopefully get
to see Rijn bust that out that's where

166
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:25,830
to see Rijn bust that out that's where
 

167
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,200
to see Rijn bust that out that's where
the items will fall down and we'll have

168
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,210
the items will fall down and we'll have
 

169
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:40,340
the items will fall down and we'll have
a sign

170
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,350

 

171
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:52,140

feel like I forgot something all right I

172
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,150
feel like I forgot something all right I
 

173
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,690
feel like I forgot something all right I
went to got some more glass and I stick

174
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:54,700
went to got some more glass and I stick
 

175
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,490
went to got some more glass and I stick
today so that we can see a little bit

176
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:56,500
today so that we can see a little bit
 

177
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,560
today so that we can see a little bit
better it's kind of dark here still so

178
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,570
better it's kind of dark here still so
 

179
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,180
better it's kind of dark here still so
the way I'm going to do this actually is

180
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,190
the way I'm going to do this actually is
 

181
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,200
the way I'm going to do this actually is
I'm going to put another water here so

182
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,210
I'm going to put another water here so
 

183
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,680
I'm going to put another water here so
then it's little straight there's

184
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:10,690
then it's little straight there's
 

185
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,280
then it's little straight there's
something I want to try we're gonna make

186
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,290
something I want to try we're gonna make
 

187
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,050
something I want to try we're gonna make
this two blocks otherwise it'll make

188
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,060
this two blocks otherwise it'll make
 

189
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,820
this two blocks otherwise it'll make
it'll be hard to get this streams to

190
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:20,830
it'll be hard to get this streams to
 

191
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,480
it'll be hard to get this streams to
point right without adding more water so

192
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,490
point right without adding more water so
 

193
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,110
point right without adding more water so
it'll be like no that's not what I want

194
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
it'll be like no that's not what I want
 

195
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:43,020
it'll be like no that's not what I want
and it's not what I want Jay I want the

196
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,030
and it's not what I want Jay I want the
 

197
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:51,540
and it's not what I want Jay I want the
signs over here

198
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,550

 

199
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:57,610

like to that okay so the spiders will

200
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:57,620
like to that okay so the spiders will
 

201
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,140
like to that okay so the spiders will
get pushed in then I want a stream over

202
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,150
get pushed in then I want a stream over
 

203
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:10,540
get pushed in then I want a stream over
here pushing in this way and I want a

204
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:10,550
here pushing in this way and I want a
 

205
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,200
here pushing in this way and I want a
trapdoor

206
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,210

 

207
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,620

oops

208
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:17,630
oops
 

209
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,750
oops
I'm gonna put my trapdoor on there

210
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
I'm gonna put my trapdoor on there
 

211
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,290
I'm gonna put my trapdoor on there
hopefully oh wait no that's too low

212
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,300
hopefully oh wait no that's too low
 

213
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,970
hopefully oh wait no that's too low
oh yeah well let's do the stream first

214
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:27,980
oh yeah well let's do the stream first
 

215
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:49,960
oh yeah well let's do the stream first
then stream we'll go across I should

216
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:49,970
then stream we'll go across I should
 

217
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:57,990
then stream we'll go across I should
probably be doing this off-camera oh

218
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000

 

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,230

yeah if I do that to cancel them up huh

220
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
yeah if I do that to cancel them up huh
 

221
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,660
yeah if I do that to cancel them up huh
I guess I'll have to use signs actually

222
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:04,670
I guess I'll have to use signs actually
 

223
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:12,510
I guess I'll have to use signs actually
when replace this with actual glass and

224
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:12,520
when replace this with actual glass and
 

225
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,630
when replace this with actual glass and
so what we learned from our last video

226
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:15,640
so what we learned from our last video
 

227
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,570
so what we learned from our last video
the water is I think it was five level

228
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:19,580
the water is I think it was five level
 

229
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,570
the water is I think it was five level
five they won't drown that would be

230
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:22,580
five they won't drown that would be
 

231
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,390
five they won't drown that would be
eight seven six we got to go one more I

232
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:25,400
eight seven six we got to go one more I
 

233
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:35,340
eight seven six we got to go one more I
think I'll run it here like this and

234
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,350

 

235
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,350

something like this

236
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,360

 

237
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,560

[Music]

238
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:41,570
[Music]
 

239
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,090
[Music]
so the water will go here and that will

240
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,100
so the water will go here and that will
 

241
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,519
so the water will go here and that will
allow the spiders to swim up it and then

242
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:51,529
allow the spiders to swim up it and then
 

243
00:10:51,529 --> 00:11:01,420
allow the spiders to swim up it and then
we'll place a sign a lot of work to

244
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,430
we'll place a sign a lot of work to
 

245
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,819
we'll place a sign a lot of work to
making a mob system keep that in mind if

246
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:03,829
making a mob system keep that in mind if
 

247
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:08,439
making a mob system keep that in mind if
you ever do lots of lots of little

248
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:08,449
you ever do lots of lots of little
 

249
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:13,240
you ever do lots of lots of little
tedious work like this but the sign

250
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,250
tedious work like this but the sign
 

251
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:22,840
tedious work like this but the sign
there and I suppose one over here now

252
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:22,850
there and I suppose one over here now
 

253
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,300
there and I suppose one over here now
ouch just for now I'm going to put dirt

254
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,310
ouch just for now I'm going to put dirt
 

255
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:37,600
ouch just for now I'm going to put dirt
under here so you can jump up so

256
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,610
under here so you can jump up so
 

257
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,100
under here so you can jump up so
basically I have a water block pushing

258
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,110
basically I have a water block pushing
 

259
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,410
basically I have a water block pushing
to the right here that the spider should

260
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:44,420
to the right here that the spider should
 

261
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,900
to the right here that the spider should
swim up without drowning and then we can

262
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,910
swim up without drowning and then we can
 

263
00:11:49,910 --> 00:12:02,949
swim up without drowning and then we can
have a trapdoor over here like that so

264
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
have a trapdoor over here like that so
 

265
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,809
have a trapdoor over here like that so
they won't drown in this in this stream

266
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:04,819
they won't drown in this in this stream
 

267
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,879
they won't drown in this in this stream
here and the streams pushing them this

268
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:06,889
here and the streams pushing them this
 

269
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,509
here and the streams pushing them this
way so they hinge on this trapdoor ssin

270
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:10,519
way so they hinge on this trapdoor ssin
 

271
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,600
way so they hinge on this trapdoor ssin
and being away either

272
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,610
and being away either
 

273
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:19,300
and being away either
hopefully okay so we've got that we can

274
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,310
hopefully okay so we've got that we can
 

275
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,370
hopefully okay so we've got that we can
injure that way we can control if we

276
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:21,380
injure that way we can control if we
 

277
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,860
injure that way we can control if we
want the spiders to drown or if we want

278
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:23,870
want the spiders to drown or if we want
 

279
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,550
want the spiders to drown or if we want
them to collect and why you'd want them

280
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,560
them to collect and why you'd want them
 

281
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,150
them to collect and why you'd want them
to collect I don't know but it's just

282
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
to collect I don't know but it's just
 

283
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,139
to collect I don't know but it's just
something some little extra control we

284
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:35,149
something some little extra control we
 

285
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,390
something some little extra control we
can have for no real purpose

286
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:40,400
can have for no real purpose
 

287
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:48,410
can have for no real purpose
cuz that's the way I roll okay okay I'm

288
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:48,420
cuz that's the way I roll okay okay I'm
 

289
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,920
cuz that's the way I roll okay okay I'm
gonna finish

290
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:55,930

 

291
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,790

okay we can cover this we'll put some

292
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
okay we can cover this we'll put some
 

293
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,359
okay we can cover this we'll put some
more signs

294
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:06,369

 

295
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:17,460

I'm so glad knotch added shift-clicking

296
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,470

 

297
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,829

okay so we need something for the water

298
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:20,839
okay so we need something for the water
 

299
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,160
okay so we need something for the water
to be suspended by so we're going to put

300
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,170
to be suspended by so we're going to put
 

301
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:33,129
to be suspended by so we're going to put
signs and we'll have water and you need

302
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:33,139
signs and we'll have water and you need
 

303
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:43,079
signs and we'll have water and you need
one over here okay let's go up some more

304
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:43,089
one over here okay let's go up some more
 

305
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,590
one over here okay let's go up some more
so I'm gonna fill this in with water and

306
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:46,600
so I'm gonna fill this in with water and
 

307
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,660
so I'm gonna fill this in with water and
then they should drown so I'll be right

308
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,670
then they should drown so I'll be right
 

309
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,340
then they should drown so I'll be right
back alright I finished filling that in

310
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,350
back alright I finished filling that in
 

311
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,829
back alright I finished filling that in
with solid water somehow I fell through

312
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:56,839
with solid water somehow I fell through
 

313
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,040
with solid water somehow I fell through
this glass - I like stepped in the water

314
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,050
this glass - I like stepped in the water
 

315
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,040
this glass - I like stepped in the water
and then fell through the glass kind of

316
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,050
and then fell through the glass kind of
 

317
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:14,009
and then fell through the glass kind of
strange this is all solid water and

318
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:14,019

 

319
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,939

sick so there's three air pockets here
 

323
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,069
sick so there's three air pockets here
and one stream pushing them to the right

324
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
and one stream pushing them to the right
 

325
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,710
and one stream pushing them to the right
or that they won't drown in trap door

326
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
or that they won't drown in trap door
 

327
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,780
or that they won't drown in trap door
holding them down if we want if it's

328
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:31,790
holding them down if we want if it's
 

329
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:40,549
holding them down if we want if it's
open they'll swim up and drown hopefully

330
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:40,559
open they'll swim up and drown hopefully
 

331
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:49,400
open they'll swim up and drown hopefully
cover on that and I just did it again

332
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,410

 

333
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,079

and again man that's weird

334
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,089

 

335
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,939

right now I just have a lever hooked up

336
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:56,949
right now I just have a lever hooked up
 

337
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:01,259
right now I just have a lever hooked up
to the trapdoor but I'll probably hook

338
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:01,269
to the trapdoor but I'll probably hook
 

339
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,470
to the trapdoor but I'll probably hook
up redstone and wire down to the control

340
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
up redstone and wire down to the control
 

341
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,929
up redstone and wire down to the control
room

342
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:08,939

 

343
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:12,799

yeah so this should be ready for a test

344
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:12,809
yeah so this should be ready for a test
 

345
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:20,129
yeah so this should be ready for a test
so that's what I'm gonna do the might

346
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:20,139
so that's what I'm gonna do the might
 

347
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,619
so that's what I'm gonna do the might
how's this work

348
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:21,629
how's this work
 

349
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,790
how's this work
tall mobs fall down here string falls

350
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
tall mobs fall down here string falls
 

351
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,269
tall mobs fall down here string falls
down here okay so I'm gonna get some

352
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:30,279
down here okay so I'm gonna get some
 

353
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,850
down here okay so I'm gonna get some
spiders up here and see what happens

354
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:34,860

 

355
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,780

here they come

356
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:36,790
here they come
 

357
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:45,119
here they come
oh oh

358
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,129

 

359
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:48,929

no he's not swimming up oh because I

360
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:48,939
no he's not swimming up oh because I
 

361
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:52,919
no he's not swimming up oh because I
have the trapdoor help yeah that's

362
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:52,929
have the trapdoor help yeah that's
 

363
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,650
have the trapdoor help yeah that's
exactly what one

364
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:55,660
exactly what one
 

365
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,620
exactly what one
they're very cheerful feathers shooting

366
00:15:59,620 --> 00:15:59,630
they're very cheerful feathers shooting
 

367
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:08,530
they're very cheerful feathers shooting
through the glass yeah

368
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:08,540
through the glass yeah
 

369
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:21,730

oh dang they hit a creeper oh okay I'm
 

371
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,680
oh dang they hit a creeper oh okay I'm
gonna let them collect and stand far far

372
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:26,690
gonna let them collect and stand far far
 

373
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,230
gonna let them collect and stand far far
far away as that happens houston we have

374
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
far away as that happens houston we have
 

375
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,520
far away as that happens houston we have
a problem there's a jam the spiders they

376
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:39,530
a problem there's a jam the spiders they
 

377
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,370
a problem there's a jam the spiders they
climb up and then get stuck in the

378
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:42,380
climb up and then get stuck in the
 

379
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,100
climb up and then get stuck in the
ceiling so I need to put instead of

380
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,110
ceiling so I need to put instead of
 

381
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,520
ceiling so I need to put instead of
having the gap down there I need it up

382
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:48,530
having the gap down there I need it up
 

383
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:53,080
having the gap down there I need it up
there after all so I might have to redo

384
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,090
there after all so I might have to redo
 

385
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:59,010
there after all so I might have to redo
all this let's try the release it's good

386
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,020
all this let's try the release it's good
 

387
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,510
all this let's try the release it's good
swims up should drown

388
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:01,520
swims up should drown
 

389
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,120
swims up should drown
Oh major like the skeletons don't shoot

390
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,130
Oh major like the skeletons don't shoot
 

391
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,689
Oh major like the skeletons don't shoot
if you put blocks in the corner

392
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:12,699

 

393
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,159

and let's see if the string falls down

394
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:15,169
and let's see if the string falls down
 

395
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:23,120
and let's see if the string falls down
here oh shoot

396
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,130

 

397
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:29,529

okay I heard some skeletons shooting

398
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:29,539

 

399
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:32,570

alright that sound nice Lili grouped

400
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:32,580
alright that sound nice Lili grouped
 

401
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:39,409
alright that sound nice Lili grouped
together so I'm gonna fix that and then

402
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:39,419
together so I'm gonna fix that and then
 

403
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,419
together so I'm gonna fix that and then
we'll be back alright so I made the

404
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:44,429
we'll be back alright so I made the
 

405
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:52,430
we'll be back alright so I made the
changes it's still not perfect but it

406
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:52,440
changes it's still not perfect but it
 

407
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,850
changes it's still not perfect but it
works

408
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:54,860

 

409
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,760

they kind of kindly get stuck here but

410
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:58,770
they kind of kindly get stuck here but
 

411
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,060
they kind of kindly get stuck here but
the mobs pushing them will cause him to

412
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,070
the mobs pushing them will cause him to
 

413
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,669
the mobs pushing them will cause him to
eventually go so it's only if they're on

414
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
eventually go so it's only if they're on
 

415
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,710
eventually go so it's only if they're on
their own like that like you would

416
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:09,720
their own like that like you would
 

417
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,000
their own like that like you would
probably get stuck there forever

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,010
probably get stuck there forever
 

419
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,210
probably get stuck there forever
if I'm unless another mob came up behind

420
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,220
if I'm unless another mob came up behind
 

421
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,460
if I'm unless another mob came up behind
them then he'd get pushed in and of

422
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:19,470
them then he'd get pushed in and of
 

423
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,570
them then he'd get pushed in and of
course he's doing that because there's

424
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:20,580
course he's doing that because there's
 

425
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,159
course he's doing that because there's
tons of mobs there a normally a stream

426
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:25,169
tons of mobs there a normally a stream
 

427
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:29,750
tons of mobs there a normally a stream
would take them away and I think I've

428
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
would take them away and I think I've
 

429
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,029
would take them away and I think I've
reached the mob limit almost so what I

430
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
reached the mob limit almost so what I
 

431
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,789
reached the mob limit almost so what I
ended up doing I had to raise it all up

432
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:37,799
ended up doing I had to raise it all up
 

433
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:44,690
ended up doing I had to raise it all up
another block and I added in it's the

434
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:44,700
another block and I added in it's the
 

435
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,669
another block and I added in it's the
same thing I just raised it a block up

436
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:46,679
same thing I just raised it a block up
 

437
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,409
same thing I just raised it a block up
and I added in a few extra signs here

438
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:51,419
and I added in a few extra signs here
 

439
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:57,110
and I added in a few extra signs here
and that's it so watch these guys should

440
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
and that's it so watch these guys should
 

441
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,970
and that's it so watch these guys should
push this spider into here

442
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:01,980

 

443
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,950

or maybe not there's this too many guys

444
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
or maybe not there's this too many guys
 

445
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,880
or maybe not there's this too many guys
there he's not not going

446
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:08,890
there he's not not going
 

447
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,840
there he's not not going
they keep knocking him back but anyway

448
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:12,850
they keep knocking him back but anyway
 

449
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,440
they keep knocking him back but anyway
it does seem to work pretty good

450
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,450
it does seem to work pretty good
 

451
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:22,980
it does seem to work pretty good
I'm and this release works good they

452
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:22,990
I'm and this release works good they
 

453
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,030
I'm and this release works good they
drown there so that might be useful for

454
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,040
drown there so that might be useful for
 

455
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,300
drown there so that might be useful for
example let's say them mob limit was a

456
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,310
example let's say them mob limit was a
 

457
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,940
example let's say them mob limit was a
hundred hundred hostile mobs at a time

458
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:34,950
hundred hundred hostile mobs at a time
 

459
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,550
hundred hundred hostile mobs at a time
if I wanted spiders to collect I would

460
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:38,560
if I wanted spiders to collect I would
 

461
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,220
if I wanted spiders to collect I would
have this trapdoor down and I would have

462
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,230
have this trapdoor down and I would have
 

463
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,830
have this trapdoor down and I would have
these Paul mobs being killed constantly

464
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:46,840
these Paul mobs being killed constantly
 

465
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:57,740
these Paul mobs being killed constantly
and over time oh oh that's a problem

466
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:57,750
and over time oh oh that's a problem
 

467
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:07,920
and over time oh oh that's a problem
string landed on the trapdoor oh well I

468
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:07,930
string landed on the trapdoor oh well I
 

469
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,330
string landed on the trapdoor oh well I
guess I got to get rid of this feature

470
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,340
guess I got to get rid of this feature
 

471
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,610
guess I got to get rid of this feature
then because that's going to be a

472
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:11,620
then because that's going to be a
 

473
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,400
then because that's going to be a
serious problem and there's no way

474
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,410
serious problem and there's no way
 

475
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,100
serious problem and there's no way
around that

476
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,110

 

477
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,200

okay well you say I do better than that

478
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,210
okay well you say I do better than that
 

479
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,180
okay well you say I do better than that
I can get rid of it just by lowering it

480
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,190
I can get rid of it just by lowering it
 

481
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,350
I can get rid of it just by lowering it
one level so the next thing I need to do

482
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
one level so the next thing I need to do
 

483
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,430
one level so the next thing I need to do
is I need to run a water stream to this

484
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
is I need to run a water stream to this
 

485
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,450
is I need to run a water stream to this
hole here and I'll probably have another

486
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:39,460
hole here and I'll probably have another
 

487
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:48,660
hole here and I'll probably have another
trap door above right here I got it

488
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:48,670
trap door above right here I got it
 

489
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,900
trap door above right here I got it
working really good now guys I made two

490
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:51,910
working really good now guys I made two
 

491
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:58,090
working really good now guys I made two
main changes to this

492
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,100

 

493
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,410

the really important changes I have

494
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:00,420
the really important changes I have
 

495
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:09,110
the really important changes I have
half-slabs there now whole date that was

496
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
half-slabs there now whole date that was
 

497
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,390
half-slabs there now whole date that was
a close one

498
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
a close one
 

499
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,950
a close one
those skeletons can see me through these

500
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
those skeletons can see me through these
 

501
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,260
those skeletons can see me through these
coroner's here I would need to put

502
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:15,270
coroner's here I would need to put
 

503
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,160
coroner's here I would need to put
blocks here

504
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,170
blocks here
 

505
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,780
blocks here
just keep that from happening but yeah I

506
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:20,790
just keep that from happening but yeah I
 

507
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,730
just keep that from happening but yeah I
have half slabs there so it's a block

508
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:22,740
have half slabs there so it's a block
 

509
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,920
have half slabs there so it's a block
and a half opening there's a water

510
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:24,930
and a half opening there's a water
 

511
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,340
and a half opening there's a water
stream above pushing the spiders to the

512
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,350
stream above pushing the spiders to the
 

513
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,220
stream above pushing the spiders to the
left and since it's a block and a half

514
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,230
left and since it's a block and a half
 

515
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,610
left and since it's a block and a half
tall mobs don't fit but the spiders do

516
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:36,620

 

517
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:44,000

and yeah and then this is actually not a

518
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,010
and yeah and then this is actually not a
 

519
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,870
and yeah and then this is actually not a
problem because if if I want them

520
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:47,880
problem because if if I want them
 

521
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,380
problem because if if I want them
drowning it needs to be open like that

522
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,390
drowning it needs to be open like that
 

523
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,540
drowning it needs to be open like that
what I did is I removed the two source

524
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,550
what I did is I removed the two source
 

525
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,850
what I did is I removed the two source
blocks here so now there's a stream

526
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:55,860
blocks here so now there's a stream
 

527
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,930
blocks here so now there's a stream
going to the right so if any string was

528
00:21:59,930 --> 00:21:59,940
going to the right so if any string was
 

529
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,120
going to the right so if any string was
to land on the trapdoor that a little

530
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,130
to land on the trapdoor that a little
 

531
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,730
to land on the trapdoor that a little
section there the stream would pull it

532
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:04,740
section there the stream would pull it
 

533
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,260
section there the stream would pull it
off anyway so that is not a problem

534
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,270
off anyway so that is not a problem
 

535
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,250
off anyway so that is not a problem
after all because the door won't be down

536
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,260
after all because the door won't be down
 

537
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:19,610
after all because the door won't be down
like that it'll be up so yeah I'm gonna

538
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:19,620
like that it'll be up so yeah I'm gonna
 

539
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,560
like that it'll be up so yeah I'm gonna
let this thing fill up and then you'll

540
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,570
let this thing fill up and then you'll
 

541
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:29,330
let this thing fill up and then you'll
see it's getting pretty full now

542
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,340

 

543
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,510

so since those are half-slabs now if the

544
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
so since those are half-slabs now if the
 

545
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,310
so since those are half-slabs now if the
spiders fought like before those were

546
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:35,320
spiders fought like before those were
 

547
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,380
spiders fought like before those were
glass blocks where the half slabs were

548
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,390
glass blocks where the half slabs were
 

549
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,019
glass blocks where the half slabs were
and when the spiders were forced against

550
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:40,029
and when the spiders were forced against
 

551
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,630
and when the spiders were forced against
the glass blocks it was like them being

552
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
the glass blocks it was like them being
 

553
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,899
the glass blocks it was like them being
against the wall but when when their

554
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:45,909
against the wall but when when their
 

555
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,730
against the wall but when when their
force against the half slabs it forces

556
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:47,740
force against the half slabs it forces
 

557
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,080
force against the half slabs it forces
the spiders climb up them much like we

558
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,090
the spiders climb up them much like we
 

559
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,620
the spiders climb up them much like we
walked up half slabs and so they're

560
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:55,630
walked up half slabs and so they're
 

561
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,289
walked up half slabs and so they're
forced up half a block and then they are

562
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:58,299
forced up half a block and then they are
 

563
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,289
forced up half a block and then they are
in the water stream above so they're

564
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:01,299
in the water stream above so they're
 

565
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:11,430
in the water stream above so they're
forced through it kind of thing so we

566
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
forced through it kind of thing so we
 

567
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,419
forced through it kind of thing so we
got I would say at least pan in there 10

568
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:15,429
got I would say at least pan in there 10
 

569
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:21,710
got I would say at least pan in there 10
spiders let's see it

570
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:21,720

 

571
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,870

that stream over there pushes them away

572
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
that stream over there pushes them away
 

573
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,760
that stream over there pushes them away
from the hinge so they all do what no

574
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:26,770
from the hinge so they all do what no
 

575
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:34,110
from the hinge so they all do what no
problem and since the water over here is

576
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,120
problem and since the water over here is
 

577
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,320
problem and since the water over here is
level 7 it's still drown no problem it's

578
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,330
level 7 it's still drown no problem it's
 

579
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,990
level 7 it's still drown no problem it's
only if it's level 5 or less that they

580
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
only if it's level 5 or less that they
 

581
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,020
only if it's level 5 or less that they
won't drown

582
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,030

 

583
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:51,720

and all this drink Lex 100% so it's 100%

584
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:51,730
and all this drink Lex 100% so it's 100%
 

585
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,180
and all this drink Lex 100% so it's 100%
efficient so all in all I'm pretty happy

586
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,190
efficient so all in all I'm pretty happy
 

587
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:04,590
efficient so all in all I'm pretty happy
with this so we just need the stream

588
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:04,600
with this so we just need the stream
 

589
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,900
with this so we just need the stream
below and then we'll have a trapdoor

590
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:09,910
below and then we'll have a trapdoor
 

591
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:18,270
below and then we'll have a trapdoor
here and that will be controlled at the

592
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:18,280
here and that will be controlled at the
 

593
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,040
here and that will be controlled at the
front of our collection area I have

594
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,050
front of our collection area I have
 

595
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:25,170
front of our collection area I have
those two levers if this is closed items

596
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:25,180
those two levers if this is closed items
 

597
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,620
those two levers if this is closed items
can't fall down if it's open

598
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,630
can't fall down if it's open
 

599
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,940
can't fall down if it's open
they can't pretty simple so I'm gonna

600
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:32,950
they can't pretty simple so I'm gonna
 

601
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:39,300
they can't pretty simple so I'm gonna
run a stream and I'll be back so then we

602
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,310
run a stream and I'll be back so then we
 

603
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,080
run a stream and I'll be back so then we
stood a ton of glass building the same

604
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,090
stood a ton of glass building the same
 

605
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,940
stood a ton of glass building the same
but it works really well it's all done

606
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:44,950
but it works really well it's all done
 

607
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,070
but it works really well it's all done
now well basically all done very happy

608
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
now well basically all done very happy
 

609
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,990
now well basically all done very happy
with how this turned out

610
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000

 

611
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,350

spiders go up they drown none get stuck

612
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
spiders go up they drown none get stuck
 

613
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,440
spiders go up they drown none get stuck
there's no dead zones they all drown

614
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:04,450
there's no dead zones they all drown
 

615
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,010
there's no dead zones they all drown
items get collected 100% and there's

616
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:09,020
items get collected 100% and there's
 

617
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,170
items get collected 100% and there's
just a stream underneath there now that

618
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,180
just a stream underneath there now that
 

619
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,680
just a stream underneath there now that
goes left goes around this Bend through

620
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:14,690
goes left goes around this Bend through
 

621
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:22,750
goes left goes around this Bend through
this trapdoor here see all the string

622
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:22,760
this trapdoor here see all the string
 

623
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:30,330
this trapdoor here see all the string
down there it was

624
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:30,340
down there it was
 

625
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,740
down there it was
yeah listen and make sure no creepers

626
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:32,750
yeah listen and make sure no creepers
 

627
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:38,140
yeah listen and make sure no creepers
get shot so it goes here this trapdoor

628
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,150
get shot so it goes here this trapdoor
 

629
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,560
get shot so it goes here this trapdoor
here will allow me to turn string on or

630
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:41,570
here will allow me to turn string on or
 

631
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,650
here will allow me to turn string on or
off in my main collection area down

632
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:44,660
off in my main collection area down
 

633
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,310
off in my main collection area down
below so if I just want to collect say

634
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
below so if I just want to collect say
 

635
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,100
below so if I just want to collect say
gunpowder for example I don't want

636
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,110
gunpowder for example I don't want
 

637
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,830
gunpowder for example I don't want
spring in the stream I would have this

638
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
spring in the stream I would have this
 

639
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,490
spring in the stream I would have this
closed if I if I want the string I would

640
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:57,500
closed if I if I want the string I would
 

641
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,790
closed if I if I want the string I would
have it open and it would go down this

642
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:03,800
have it open and it would go down this
 

643
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,380
have it open and it would go down this
trapdoor is for turning on or off all

644
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,390
