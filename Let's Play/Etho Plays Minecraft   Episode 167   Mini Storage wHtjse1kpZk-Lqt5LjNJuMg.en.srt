obviously the idea is we will have to do
 

105
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,309
obviously the idea is we will have to do
more with the ceiling it's not just

more with the ceiling it's not just
 

107
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,190
more with the ceiling it's not just
going to be

108
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
going to be
 

109
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,309
going to be
this to a stone ceiling like this

110
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
this to a stone ceiling like this

113
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,509

then over here i don't know if this was

114
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
then over here i don't know if this was
 

115
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,869
then over here i don't know if this was
here last time but

116
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879

117
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,149

though

122
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
though
 

123
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,470
though
i think you would look a little bit

124
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
i think you would look a little bit
 

125
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,949
i think you would look a little bit
better if they were one block out

126
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
better if they were one block out
 

127
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,070
better if they were one block out
so but anyway

128
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
so but anyway
 

129
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,470

it seems to be going good then i started

130
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
it seems to be going good then i started
 

131
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,270
it seems to be going good then i started
a second bridge here

132
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
a second bridge here
 

133
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,229
a second bridge here
just because i really like this one so i

134
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
just because i really like this one so i
 

135
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,670
just because i really like this one so i
wanted another one

136
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680

 

137
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,030

and uh i think it looks pretty good

138
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
and uh i think it looks pretty good
 

139
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,750
and uh i think it looks pretty good
uh right now it goes to nothing but we

140
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
uh right now it goes to nothing but we
 

141
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,630
uh right now it goes to nothing but we
will probably

142
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
will probably
 

143
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,710
will probably
be building us the storage room here

144
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
be building us the storage room here
 

145
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,990
be building us the storage room here
today and maybe a

146
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
today and maybe a
 

147
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,030
today and maybe a
furnace room it'll

148
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
furnace room it'll
 

149
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,630
furnace room it'll
i'm not quite sure what shape we're

150
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
i'm not quite sure what shape we're
 

151
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,149
i'm not quite sure what shape we're
going to go with but they'll probably be

152
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
going to go with but they'll probably be
 

153
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,190
going to go with but they'll probably be
the storage room and then to the left

154
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
the storage room and then to the left
 

155
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,949
the storage room and then to the left
like behind behind here is

156
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
like behind behind here is
 

157
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,430
like behind behind here is
maybe going to be the furnace room and i

158
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
maybe going to be the furnace room and i
 

159
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,949

sure
 

165
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,990
sure
and this will probably have to be moved

166
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
and this will probably have to be moved
 

167
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,590
and this will probably have to be moved
back at least three or four blocks

168
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
back at least three or four blocks
 

169
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,270
back at least three or four blocks
um what else

170
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
um what else
 

171
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,990
um what else
what else this this bridge it goes over

172
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
what else this this bridge it goes over
 

173
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,030

top

174
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040

 

175
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,870

there's a drop down here this is a

176
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
there's a drop down here this is a
 

177

there's a drop down here this is a
natural this was here naturally

178
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
natural this was here naturally
 

179
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,189
natural this was here naturally
i was thinking it would be cool if we

180
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
i was thinking it would be cool if we
 

181
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,950
i was thinking it would be cool if we
were to expand it

182
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
were to expand it
 

183
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,230
were to expand it
make it wider like move it out that way

184
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
make it wider like move it out that way
 

185
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,909
make it wider like move it out that way
at least five to ten blocks

186
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
at least five to ten blocks
 

187
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,790
at least five to ten blocks
and the sides a little bit too then put

188
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
and the sides a little bit too then put
 

189
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,270
and the sides a little bit too then put
a water pool at the bottom here

190
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
a water pool at the bottom here
 

191
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,430
a water pool at the bottom here
for a water drop and also

192
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
for a water drop and also
 

193
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,830
for a water drop and also
have a waterfall at the top there going

194
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
have a waterfall at the top there going
 

195
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,749
have a waterfall at the top there going
down to the pool of water

196
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
down to the pool of water
 

197
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,870
down to the pool of water
below and we could use that to get down

198
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
below and we could use that to get down
 

199
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,670
below and we could use that to get down
here

200
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
here
 

201
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,710
here
quickly and also have vines growing

202
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
quickly and also have vines growing
 

203
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,070
quickly and also have vines growing
around the sides i think that would look

204
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
around the sides i think that would look
 

205
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,830
around the sides i think that would look
pretty cool

206
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
pretty cool
 

207
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,510
pretty cool
so that's kind of what i'm thinking with

208
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
so that's kind of what i'm thinking with
 

209
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,710
so that's kind of what i'm thinking with
that

210
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720

 

211
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,990

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
below that's to light up the grass here
 

217
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,749
below that's to light up the grass here
and it does a good job

218
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
and it does a good job
 

219
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,749
and it does a good job
but i feel it looks a little bit

220
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
but i feel it looks a little bit
 

221
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,590
but i feel it looks a little bit
strange so i don't know if i'm going to

222
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
strange so i don't know if i'm going to
 

223
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,469
strange so i don't know if i'm going to
keep that i might just put glowstone

224
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
keep that i might just put glowstone
 

225
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,550
keep that i might just put glowstone
on the ground here and see if that looks

226
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
on the ground here and see if that looks
 

227
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,070
on the ground here and see if that looks
better

228
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
better
 

229
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,990

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,590
too high and it looked
worse in my opinion so now they're one

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
worse in my opinion so now they're one
 

235
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,110

247
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,110
this game
it was in version 1.2.6

248
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120

252
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
so maybe in a few weeks or so we'll
 

253
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,150
so maybe in a few weeks or so we'll
actually

254
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
actually
 

255
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,189
actually
get to where i was when i started that

256
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
get to where i was when i started that
 

257
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,350
get to where i was when i started that
would be pretty exciting

258
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
would be pretty exciting
 

259
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,950
would be pretty exciting
if there's another version after 1.2.5

260
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960

 

261
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,029

283
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,589
we will sneak in a secret uh portal room
or something so that we could throw an

and get into our portal room but i want
 

289
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,950
and get into our portal room but i want

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
it to be
 

291
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,629
it to be
a little ways away from here so we don't

292
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
a little ways away from here so we don't
 

293
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,830
a little ways away from here so we don't
have the portal noise constantly

294
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
have the portal noise constantly
 

295
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,510
have the portal noise constantly
but i think that would be pretty cool

296
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520

 

297
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,749

and that would mean we would need six

342
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
and that would mean we would need six
 

343
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,909
and that would mean we would need six
columns like this

344
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
columns like this
 

345
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,589
columns like this
this is a really practical way of doing

346
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
this is a really practical way of doing
 

347
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,189
this is a really practical way of doing
it because the middle chest

348
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
it because the middle chest
 

349
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,430
it because the middle chest
is at your eye height so it's very easy

350
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
is at your eye height so it's very easy
 

351
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,670
is at your eye height so it's very easy
to

352
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
to
 

353
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,510
to
look down slightly to get to the bottom

354
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
look down slightly to get to the bottom
 

355
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,950
look down slightly to get to the bottom
one and

356
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
one and
 

357
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,869
one and
very easy to look up slightly for the

358
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
very easy to look up slightly for the
 

359
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,309
very easy to look up slightly for the
top one

360
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
top one
 

361
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,749
top one
and it's space space efficient too

362
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759

 

363
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,790

however after looking at it for a little

364
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
however after looking at it for a little
 

365
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,309
however after looking at it for a little
while i realized it was um

366
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
while i realized it was um
 

367
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,029
while i realized it was um
really lame it's uh it would be a lame

368
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
really lame it's uh it would be a lame
 

369
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,589
really lame it's uh it would be a lame
way to do a storage room

370
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
way to do a storage room
 

371
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,070
way to do a storage room
so i started to think of other ways of

372
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
so i started to think of other ways of
 

373
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,190
so i started to think of other ways of
maybe making a

374
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
maybe making a
 

375
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,149
maybe making a
cooler and i got one so

376
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
cooler and i got one so
 

377
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,509
cooler and i got one so
the idea was now or the idea now is

378
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
the idea was now or the idea now is
 

379
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,870
the idea was now or the idea now is
to make it so when you walk into the

380
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
to make it so when you walk into the
 

381
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,750
to make it so when you walk into the
storage room uh the chests kind of pop

382
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
storage room uh the chests kind of pop
 

383
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,389
storage room uh the chests kind of pop
out at you they come alive

384
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
out at you they come alive
 

385
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,829
out at you they come alive
but the thing is you can't move them

386
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
but the thing is you can't move them
 

387
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,509
but the thing is you can't move them
with pistons

388
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
with pistons
 

389
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,269
with pistons
can't move chests with pistons so it's

390
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
can't move chests with pistons so it's
 

391
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,110
can't move chests with pistons so it's
kind of hard to do it

392
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
kind of hard to do it
 

393
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,030
kind of hard to do it
and if you were to sink these in one

394
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
and if you were to sink these in one
 

395
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,310
and if you were to sink these in one
more block and have

396
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
more block and have
 

397
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,630
more block and have
like shutters on the sides where the

398
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
like shutters on the sides where the
 

399
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,829
like shutters on the sides where the
chests are here

400
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
chests are here
 

401
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,350
chests are here
uh it works but they're so

402
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
uh it works but they're so
 

403
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,509
uh it works but they're so
deep in that it doesn't look very good

404
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
deep in that it doesn't look very good
 

405
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,269
deep in that it doesn't look very good
anymore

406
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
anymore
 

407
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,389
anymore
so came up with something else

408
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
so came up with something else
 

409
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,550
so came up with something else
the only problem is i can only have two

410
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
the only problem is i can only have two
 

411
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,590
the only problem is i can only have two
chests together so we're gonna need

412
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
chests together so we're gonna need
 

413
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,389
chests together so we're gonna need
9 columns it's a little less practical

414
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
9 columns it's a little less practical
 

415
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,509
9 columns it's a little less practical
but it's going to be

416
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
but it's going to be
 

417
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,430
but it's going to be
really cool i think i think you guys

418
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
really cool i think i think you guys
 

419
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,350
really cool i think i think you guys
will like it

420
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
will like it
 

421
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,110
will like it
and it's going to be a lot of wiring

422
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
and it's going to be a lot of wiring
 

423
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,550
and it's going to be a lot of wiring
it's going to take a lot of time to do

424
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
it's going to take a lot of time to do
 

425
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,150
it's going to take a lot of time to do
but it's going to be a real treat every

426
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
but it's going to be a real treat every
 

427
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,829
but it's going to be a real treat every
time we go into this storage room

428
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
time we go into this storage room
 

429
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,750
time we go into this storage room
it's going to have a cool effect to it

430
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
it's going to have a cool effect to it
 

431
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,590
it's going to have a cool effect to it
so

432
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
so
 

433
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,870
so
i am going to get working on that

434
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
i am going to get working on that
 

435
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,110
i am going to get working on that
um i'm going to have to clear out some

436
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
um i'm going to have to clear out some
 

437
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,350
um i'm going to have to clear out some
space i think i need a 10 by 10

438
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
space i think i need a 10 by 10
 

439
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,829
space i think i need a 10 by 10
room for the storage room now

440
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839

 

441
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,269

and actually you know what we're gonna

442
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
and actually you know what we're gonna
 

443
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,509
and actually you know what we're gonna
do i think we're gonna have a path here

444
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519

 

445
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,389

so we'll

446
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
so we'll
 

447
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,829
so we'll
maybe do that and then

448
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839

 

449
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,590

like we have the other paths over there

450
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
like we have the other paths over there
 

451
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,230
like we have the other paths over there
where we have the wood

452
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
where we have the wood
 

453
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,670
where we have the wood
outline this way we'll go to the furnace

454
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
outline this way we'll go to the furnace
 

455
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,949
outline this way we'll go to the furnace
room

456
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
room
 

457
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,150
room
and then this way this will be gone

458
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
and then this way this will be gone
 

459
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,670
and then this way this will be gone
obviously

460
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680

 

461
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,110

this way we'll go probably to

462
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120

 

463
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,550

um up over there and connect with this

464
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
um up over there and connect with this
 

465
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,910
um up over there and connect with this
path up here

466
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920

 

467
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,990

so up up up here somewhere probably

468
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
so up up up here somewhere probably
 

469
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,750
so up up up here somewhere probably
although we'll have to adjust the golden

470
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
although we'll have to adjust the golden
 

471
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,990
although we'll have to adjust the golden
door if we do that

472
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000

 

473
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,949

so i think it'll be pretty good and then

474
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
so i think it'll be pretty good and then
 

475
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,630
so i think it'll be pretty good and then
in front here will be the storage room

476
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
in front here will be the storage room
 

477
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,550
in front here will be the storage room
the 10 by 10 room

478
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
the 10 by 10 room
 

479
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,630
the 10 by 10 room
so i'm gonna get to work on it gotta

480
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
so i'm gonna get to work on it gotta
 

481
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,630
so i'm gonna get to work on it gotta
clear out a bunch of space here

482
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
clear out a bunch of space here
 

483
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,630
clear out a bunch of space here
and i will be back

484
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640

 

485
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,110

all right so i got that room cleared out

486
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
all right so i got that room cleared out
 

487
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,230
all right so i got that room cleared out
over here now

488
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
over here now
 

489
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,389
over here now
it's a square it's ten by ten

490
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
it's a square it's ten by ten
 

491
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,430
it's a square it's ten by ten
one two three four five six seven eight

492
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
one two three four five six seven eight
 

493
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,710
one two three four five six seven eight

494
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
nine ten one two three four five
 

495
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,069
nine ten one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten yep and

496
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
six seven eight nine ten yep and
 

497
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,190
six seven eight nine ten yep and
uh it's probably gonna take a while to

498
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
uh it's probably gonna take a while to
 

499
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,949
uh it's probably gonna take a while to
do this so i don't think we'll finish it

500
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
do this so i don't think we'll finish it
 

501
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,190
do this so i don't think we'll finish it
today but hopefully we can get it

502
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
today but hopefully we can get it
 

503
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,030
today but hopefully we can get it
set up at least and you'll just have to

504
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
set up at least and you'll just have to
 

505
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,630
set up at least and you'll just have to
imagine the redstone we'll probably have

506
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
imagine the redstone we'll probably have
 

507
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,350
imagine the redstone we'll probably have
to do the redstone another day

508
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
to do the redstone another day
 

509
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,509
to do the redstone another day
but i think we're just going to half

510
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
but i think we're just going to half
 

511
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,110
but i think we're just going to half
slab the floor

512
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
slab the floor
 

513
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,829
slab the floor
and we'll probably incorporate some

514
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
and we'll probably incorporate some
 

515
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,470
and we'll probably incorporate some
design in the floor but for now

516
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
design in the floor but for now
 

517
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,350
design in the floor but for now
uh for today we're just gonna do solid

518
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
uh for today we're just gonna do solid
 

519
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,629
uh for today we're just gonna do solid
wooden

520
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
wooden
 

521
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,269
wooden
half slabs on the on the floor and on

522
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
half slabs on the on the floor and on
 

523
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,069
half slabs on the on the floor and on
the sides

524
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079

 

525
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,110

on the corners i think we want full

526
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
on the corners i think we want full
 

527
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,629
on the corners i think we want full
blocks

528
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639

 

529
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,389

like that yeah

530
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
like that yeah
 

531
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,310
like that yeah
and then on the sides we'll do stairs

532
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320

 

533
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,430

on all all four sides

534
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440

 

535
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,269

there's gonna be a lot of planks in here

536
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
there's gonna be a lot of planks in here
 

537
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,350
there's gonna be a lot of planks in here
but we might adjust things up a little

538
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
but we might adjust things up a little
 

539
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,230
but we might adjust things up a little
bit once it's all done and get a

540
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
bit once it's all done and get a
 

541
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,350
bit once it's all done and get a
some some

542
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360

 

543
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,790

i'm really stuttering today some

544
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
i'm really stuttering today some
 

545
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,269
i'm really stuttering today some
texture and stuff using different colors

546
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
texture and stuff using different colors
 

547
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,470
texture and stuff using different colors
of blocks

548
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
of blocks
 

549
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,430
of blocks
different types of half slabs and stuff

550
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440

 

551
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,269

all right so i'm going to try to put my

552
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
all right so i'm going to try to put my
 

553
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,230
all right so i'm going to try to put my
world up for download again

554
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
world up for download again
 

555
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,230
world up for download again

for this episode so check the video
description if you want it hopefully i

558
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
description if you want it hopefully i
 

559
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,110
description if you want it hopefully i
remember to

560
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
remember to
 

561
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,150
remember to
and have time to but

562
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
and have time to but
 

563
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,430
and have time to but
that's the plan anyway it's been

564
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
that's the plan anyway it's been
 

565
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,990
that's the plan anyway it's been
close to 15 episodes since i last did

566
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
close to 15 episodes since i last did
 

567
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,550
close to 15 episodes since i last did
that so it would be good to

568
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
that so it would be good to
 

569
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,150
that so it would be good to
it's good to do it again i think

570
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160

 

571
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,110

all right so that's the basic floor and

572
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
all right so that's the basic floor and
 

573
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,870
all right so that's the basic floor and
like i said we'll we'll have a pattern

574
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
like i said we'll we'll have a pattern
 

575
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,190
like i said we'll we'll have a pattern
or something i hope

576
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
or something i hope
 

577
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,629
or something i hope
and then there's gonna be chests all

578
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
and then there's gonna be chests all
 

579
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,629
and then there's gonna be chests all
along here

580
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
along here
 

581
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,829
along here
here and here

582
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839

 

583
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,870

i think the way it's gonna go

584
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880

 

585
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,750

something like this

586
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760

 

587
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,870

yeah like that

588
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
yeah like that
 

589
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,030
yeah like that
and then over here we played uh

590
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
and then over here we played uh
 

591
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,150
and then over here we played uh
the next season of ultra hardcore

592
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
the next season of ultra hardcore
 

593
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,670
the next season of ultra hardcore
i think that's going to be coming out on

594
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
i think that's going to be coming out on
 

595
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,389
i think that's going to be coming out on
monday

596
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399

 

597
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,750

and it's going to be awesome you guys

598
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
and it's going to be awesome you guys
 

599
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,790
and it's going to be awesome you guys
are going to like it i'm sure

600
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
are going to like it i'm sure
 

601
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,269
are going to like it i'm sure
i had a lot of fun doing it again

602
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
i had a lot of fun doing it again
 

603
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,990
i had a lot of fun doing it again
and what else is new i don't know

604
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000

 

605
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,710

okay so in each of these is

606
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720

 

607
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,870

where the chests are gonna go

608
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880

 

609
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,069

and i'm not quite sure how we're going

610
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
and i'm not quite sure how we're going
 

611
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,829
and i'm not quite sure how we're going
to do the lighting i'm guessing ceiling

612
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
to do the lighting i'm guessing ceiling
 

613
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,670
to do the lighting i'm guessing ceiling
lighting maybe

614
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
lighting maybe
 

615
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,509
lighting maybe
or floor lighting i don't know we'll

616
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
or floor lighting i don't know we'll
 

617
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,790
or floor lighting i don't know we'll
just put that there for now

618
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800

 

619
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,829

basically the way it's going to look is

620
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
basically the way it's going to look is
 

621
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,310
basically the way it's going to look is
like this

622
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
like this
 

623
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,949
like this
not like that

624
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959

 

625
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:50,150

like that on all these

626
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160

 

627
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,189

yeah looks a little strange right now

628
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
yeah looks a little strange right now
 

629
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,269
yeah looks a little strange right now
don't worry it gets better

630
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
don't worry it gets better
 

631
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,430
don't worry it gets better
um on the tops

632
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440

 

633
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,150

actually we'll put that all along here

634
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160

 

635
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,910

on the tops it's going to be like this

636
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920

 

637
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,189

and half slabs like that

638
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199

 

639
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:29,829

um probably another full block here

640
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839

 

641
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,189

yeah yeah i think it's gonna be really

642
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
yeah yeah i think it's gonna be really
 

643
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,829
yeah yeah i think it's gonna be really
cool

644
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839

 

645
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,670

okay and then again it continues over

646
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
okay and then again it continues over
 

647
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,189
okay and then again it continues over
here

648
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199

 

649
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,189

maybe we'll just do these

650
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199

 

651
00:15:49,199 --> 00:16:00,470

see how the corner looks

652
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480

 

653
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,990

and so basically behind each of these is

654
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
and so basically behind each of these is
 

655
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,949
and so basically behind each of these is
going to be the chess

656
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
going to be the chess
 

657
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,910
going to be the chess
and it's going to be piston controlled

658
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
and it's going to be piston controlled
 

659
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,550
and it's going to be piston controlled
okay

660
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
okay
 

661
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,749
okay
so let's get rid of these

662
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
so let's get rid of these
 

663
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,870
so let's get rid of these
there will be a piston

664
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
there will be a piston
 

665
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:23,269
there will be a piston
up here i guess it would have to go

666
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
up here i guess it would have to go
 

667
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,550
up here i guess it would have to go
right here i think

668
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560

 

669
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,189

and that stairs will go like that

670
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
and that stairs will go like that
 

671
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,590
and that stairs will go like that
that'll come down and then one on the

672
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
that'll come down and then one on the
 

673
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,470
that'll come down and then one on the
ground here

674
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
ground here
 

675
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,470
ground here
will come up so we'll have

676
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
will come up so we'll have
 

677
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,670
will come up so we'll have
two more pistons down here

678
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
two more pistons down here
 

679
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,269
two more pistons down here
uh stairs like that that'll come up

680
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
uh stairs like that that'll come up
 

681
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,230
uh stairs like that that'll come up
that'll come down over here is where the

682
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
that'll come down over here is where the
 

683
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,030
that'll come down over here is where the
chests are going to be

684
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
chests are going to be
 

685
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,990
chests are going to be
i think we'll put lamps below here that

686
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
i think we'll put lamps below here that
 

687
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,350
i think we'll put lamps below here that
will control later

688
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360

 

689
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,390

over here we will have to use

690
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
over here we will have to use
 

691
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,309
over here we will have to use
stairs so we can open the chest

692
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319

 

693
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,750

so we'll do that

694
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760

 

695
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,630

and then these sides we will do out of

696
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
and then these sides we will do out of
 

697
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,110
and then these sides we will do out of
the regular planks as well

698
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
the regular planks as well
 

699
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,870
the regular planks as well
and maybe for the back here we'll use

700
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
and maybe for the back here we'll use
 

701
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,390
and maybe for the back here we'll use
the dark wood i think that would look

702
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
the dark wood i think that would look
 

703
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,350
the dark wood i think that would look
good

704
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360

 

705
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:36,710

i have to change this

706
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720

 

707
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,070

yeah okay and with

708
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
yeah okay and with
 

709
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,590
yeah okay and with
these fences they're going to connect

710
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600

 

711
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,950

um like that don't know if i'm going to

712
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
um like that don't know if i'm going to
 

713
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,549
um like that don't know if i'm going to
keep the leaves

714
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
keep the leaves
 

715
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,990
keep the leaves
for right now we are and there

716
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
for right now we are and there
 

717
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,270
for right now we are and there
they let up the place very well too

718
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
they let up the place very well too
 

719
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,510
they let up the place very well too
so even if we don't use leads we will

720
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
so even if we don't use leads we will
 

721
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,110
so even if we don't use leads we will
probably put lighting there

722
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
probably put lighting there
 

723
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,150
probably put lighting there
like in those spots so we'll keep it

724
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
like in those spots so we'll keep it
 

725
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,190
like in those spots so we'll keep it
like that

726
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200

 

727
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,230

fences will go

728
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240

 

729
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,350

along there and along here

730
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
along there and along here
 

731
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,190
along there and along here
and eventually connect to a wall

732
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
and eventually connect to a wall
 

733
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,630
and eventually connect to a wall
probably

734
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640

 

735
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,549

um let's go get

736
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
um let's go get
 

737
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,669
um let's go get
well actually i should probably stop

738
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
well actually i should probably stop
 

739
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,630
well actually i should probably stop
recording here um

740
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
recording here um
 

741
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,470
recording here um
i'm gonna get the chests and do all the

742
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
i'm gonna get the chests and do all the
 

743
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,909
i'm gonna get the chests and do all the
sides here and we'll see how it looks

744
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
sides here and we'll see how it looks
 

745
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,710
sides here and we'll see how it looks
okay

746
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720

 

747
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,789

all right there we go that's the basic

748
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
all right there we go that's the basic
 

749
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,070
all right there we go that's the basic
look behind the storage room here

750
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
look behind the storage room here
 

751
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,510
look behind the storage room here
but like i said we're going to try to

752
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
but like i said we're going to try to
 

753
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,150
but like i said we're going to try to
break up the the constant wood look with

754
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
break up the the constant wood look with
 

755
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,150
break up the the constant wood look with
some other type of blocks on the floor

756
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
some other type of blocks on the floor
 

757
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,789
some other type of blocks on the floor
and

758
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
and
 

759
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,310
and
probably the ceiling

760
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320

 

761
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,909

do something fancy with the ceiling

762
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
do something fancy with the ceiling
 

763
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,230
do something fancy with the ceiling
hopefully might put some lighting in

764
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
hopefully might put some lighting in
 

765
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,990
hopefully might put some lighting in
there

766
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
there
 

767
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,270
there
now the next next part of this is to

768
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
now the next next part of this is to
 

769
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,590
now the next next part of this is to
have

770
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
have
 

771
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,789
have
lamps and we'll put those over

772
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
lamps and we'll put those over
 

773
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,510
lamps and we'll put those over
here and then

774
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
here and then
 

775
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,070
here and then
this is going to be the back wall and i

776
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
this is going to be the back wall and i
 

777
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,870
this is going to be the back wall and i
want to try

778
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
want to try
 

779
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,549
want to try
two different types of blocks here we'll

780
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
two different types of blocks here we'll
 

781
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,750
two different types of blocks here we'll
try the dark wood first

782
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
try the dark wood first
 

783
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,190
try the dark wood first
and get our chests down and see how this

784
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
and get our chests down and see how this
 

785
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,110
and get our chests down and see how this
looks

786
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120

 

787
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,270

not bad

788
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280

 

789
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,230

okay let's try the other type of block i

790
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
okay let's try the other type of block i
 

791
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,190
okay let's try the other type of block i
brought

792
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
brought
 

793
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,310
brought
the light wood

794
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320

 

795
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,310

see if that looks better

796
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320

 

797
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,230

you can't really see much of it because

798
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
you can't really see much of it because
 

799
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,150
you can't really see much of it because
the chests are in the way but

800
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
the chests are in the way but
 

801
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,190
the chests are in the way but
hmm

802
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200

 

803
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:05,270

almost think i prefer the light wood

804
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280

 

805
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,630

oh i did light wood again i meant to do

806
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
oh i did light wood again i meant to do
 

807
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,350
oh i did light wood again i meant to do
darkwood

808
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
darkwood
 

809
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,870
darkwood
to compare them it's getting late here

810
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
to compare them it's getting late here
 

811
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,390
to compare them it's getting late here
so we're going to have to call this

812
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
so we're going to have to call this
 

813
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,470
so we're going to have to call this
an end soon as you can probably tell

814
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
an end soon as you can probably tell
 

815
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,430
an end soon as you can probably tell
dark light dark light um

816
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
dark light dark light um
 

817
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,350
dark light dark light um
i think we'll go with light

818
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360

 

819
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,270

not that it matters much

820
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280

 

821
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,430

okay so

822
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440

 

823
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,669

just go there and we'll see if we can

824
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679

 

825
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,950

do this so that's

826
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
do this so that's
 

827
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,710
do this so that's
that's the idea behind it that's what it

828
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
that's the idea behind it that's what it
 

829
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,630
that's the idea behind it that's what it
looks like when it's closed

830
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
looks like when it's closed
 

831
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,390
looks like when it's closed
that's what it looks like when it's open

832
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
that's what it looks like when it's open
 

833
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,070
that's what it looks like when it's open
except the lamps aren't on we're going

834
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
except the lamps aren't on we're going
 

835
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,270
except the lamps aren't on we're going
to do something fancy with those yet

836
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
to do something fancy with those yet
 

837
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,230
to do something fancy with those yet
and this will all be triggered by

838
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
and this will all be triggered by
 

839
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,390
and this will all be triggered by
i think we'll use wooden pressure plates

840
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
i think we'll use wooden pressure plates
 

841
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,669
i think we'll use wooden pressure plates
here

842
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679

 

843
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,510

and when we walk in these will trigger a

844
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
and when we walk in these will trigger a
 

845
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,430
and when we walk in these will trigger a
t flip flop

846
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
t flip flop
 

847
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,029
t flip flop
which will cause all of these to open

848
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
which will cause all of these to open
 

849
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,590
which will cause all of these to open
and then when we leave it'll trigger it

850
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
and then when we leave it'll trigger it
 

851
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,430
and then when we leave it'll trigger it
again and they will all close

852
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
again and they will all close
 

853
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,310
again and they will all close
and we're going to do it with a cool

854
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
and we're going to do it with a cool
 

855
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,110
and we're going to do it with a cool
timing hopefully so maybe

856
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
timing hopefully so maybe
 

857
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,950
timing hopefully so maybe
the one in the middle opens first and

858
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
the one in the middle opens first and
 

859
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,310
the one in the middle opens first and
then it expands to the left and right

860
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
then it expands to the left and right
 

861
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,390
then it expands to the left and right
each one with a longer delay

862
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400

 

863
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,990

and let's see a really cool thing

864
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
and let's see a really cool thing
 

865
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,549
and let's see a really cool thing
about this is i think these stairs here

866
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
about this is i think these stairs here
 

867
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,390
about this is i think these stairs here
are gonna light up from

868
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
are gonna light up from
 

869
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,750
are gonna light up from
the lamps behind even though

870
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
the lamps behind even though
 

871
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,710
the lamps behind even though
it's completely shut off that the light

872
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
it's completely shut off that the light
 

873
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,870
it's completely shut off that the light
can visually leak through but it has no

874
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
can visually leak through but it has no
 

875
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,789
can visually leak through but it has no
effect on actual lighting but you can

876
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
effect on actual lighting but you can
 

877
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,870
effect on actual lighting but you can
see the light behind it

878
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
see the light behind it
 

879
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,590
see the light behind it
so we will probably keep this room

880
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
so we will probably keep this room
 

881
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,110
so we will probably keep this room
fairly dark to get that effect

882
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
fairly dark to get that effect
 

883
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,270
fairly dark to get that effect
so i doubt we'll have these torches here

884
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
so i doubt we'll have these torches here
 

885
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,350
so i doubt we'll have these torches here
when this is all said and done

886
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
when this is all said and done
 

887
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,270
when this is all said and done
i might have some lighting in the

888
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,280
i might have some lighting in the
 

889
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,510
i might have some lighting in the
ceiling though so it's not pitch black

890
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
ceiling though so it's not pitch black
 

891
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,549
ceiling though so it's not pitch black
in here

892
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:12,559
in here
 

893
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,830
in here
but we'll see

894
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840

 

895
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,549

okay so this is all good to go now uh we

896
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
okay so this is all good to go now uh we
 

897
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,909
okay so this is all good to go now uh we
got it all

898
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
got it all
 

899
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,830
got it all
all laid out and and framed and

900
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
all laid out and and framed and
 

901
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,149
all laid out and and framed and
everything uh the pistons are in place

902
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
everything uh the pistons are in place
 

903
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,510
everything uh the pistons are in place
for these uh shutters and we got the

904
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
for these uh shutters and we got the
 

905
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,470
for these uh shutters and we got the
lamps down

906
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
lamps down
 

907
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,669
lamps down
so all we have to do is a redstone on

908
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
so all we have to do is a redstone on
 

909
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,510
so all we have to do is a redstone on
this they'll be quite a bit

910
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
this they'll be quite a bit
 

911
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,710
this they'll be quite a bit
involved with that but

912
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
involved with that but
 

913
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,669
involved with that but
i'll probably do that off camera and

914
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
i'll probably do that off camera and
 

915
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,070
i'll probably do that off camera and
then

916
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
then
 

917
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,070
then
run you through it afterwards maybe next

918
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
run you through it afterwards maybe next
 

919
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,750
run you through it afterwards maybe next
episode

920
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
episode
 

921
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,909
episode
but i think you can get an idea of how

922
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
but i think you can get an idea of how
 

923
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,750
but i think you can get an idea of how
it's going to work from this

924
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,760
it's going to work from this
 

925
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,669
it's going to work from this
and i just want to comment that this is

926
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
and i just want to comment that this is
 

927
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,669
and i just want to comment that this is
not to be confused with the other

928
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
not to be confused with the other
 

929
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,830
not to be confused with the other
storage room we're going to do this is

930
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
storage room we're going to do this is
 

931
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,789
storage room we're going to do this is
this is a small one here we still have

932
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
this is a small one here we still have
 

933
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,470
this is a small one here we still have
to do our big storage room

934
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
to do our big storage room
 

935
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,590
to do our big storage room
at our new base location at the

936
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
at our new base location at the
 

937
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,590
at our new base location at the
stronghold there

938
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
stronghold there
 

939
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,430
stronghold there
and that's going to be more warehouse

940
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
and that's going to be more warehouse
 

941
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,430
and that's going to be more warehouse
like

942
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
like
 

943
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,350
like
reminiscent of the storage room i had

944
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
reminiscent of the storage room i had
 

945
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,430
reminiscent of the storage room i had
on chocolate island probably and

946
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
on chocolate island probably and
 

947
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,350
on chocolate island probably and
there'll be a mob system in the middle

948
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
there'll be a mob system in the middle
 

949
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,950
there'll be a mob system in the middle
and you know how it goes

950
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
and you know how it goes
 

951
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,230
and you know how it goes
um i just want to try one more thing

952
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
um i just want to try one more thing
 

953
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,630
um i just want to try one more thing
here just to see how this looks

954
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640

 

955
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,909

and again we may not necessarily be

956
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
and again we may not necessarily be
 

957
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,310
and again we may not necessarily be
using

958
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
using
 

959
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,950
using
wooden planks for this i just want to

960
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
wooden planks for this i just want to
