00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
left chest people that are right-handed

left chest people that are right-handed
chose right chest not with not with the

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
chose right chest not with not with the
 

71
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,270

them
 

75
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,749
them
that's the way it worked never like a

76
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
that's the way it worked never like a
 

77
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,069
that's the way it worked never like a
left-handed person saying they chose

78
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
left-handed person saying they chose
 

79
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,870
left-handed person saying they chose
a right one um and particularly

a right one um and particularly
 

81
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,990
a right one um and particularly
left-handed people

82
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
left-handed people
 

83
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,670

seem to choose left instead of right
 

85
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,670
seem to choose left instead of right
so that was kind of kind of cool uh

00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
but the thing that really surprised me
 

95
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,830
but the thing that really surprised me
is i thought

96
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840

101
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,550
mention
that the left chest was trapped a trap

102
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
that the left chest was trapped a trap
 

103
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,190

chest
 

105
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,709
chest
but it seems like most people didn't

106
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
but it seems like most people didn't
 

107
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,869

notice it of course video quality was
 

109
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,389
notice it of course video quality was
probably a big factor in that

110
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
probably a big factor in that
 

111
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,110
probably a big factor in that
but the ones that did notice it actually

112
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
but the ones that did notice it actually
 

113
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,229
but the ones that did notice it actually
chose that one

114
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
chose that one
 

115
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,309
chose that one
because they thought it was special

116
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
because they thought it was special
 

117
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,350
because they thought it was special
instead of like

actually realizing what it literally

120
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
actually realizing what it literally
 

121
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,190
actually realizing what it literally
meant that it's a trap chest

122
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200

the cow farm and i finally figured out

172
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
the cow farm and i finally figured out
 

173
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,190
the cow farm and i finally figured out
why my wheat keeps disappearing because

174
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
why my wheat keeps disappearing because
 

175
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,190
why my wheat keeps disappearing because
these guys don't really jump

176
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
these guys don't really jump
 

177
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,509
these guys don't really jump
unless they're in the water but on their

178
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
unless they're in the water but on their
 

179
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,949
unless they're in the water but on their
own they don't

180
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
own they don't
 

181
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,390
own they don't
really jump but what it turns out to be

182
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
really jump but what it turns out to be
 

183
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,309
really jump but what it turns out to be
squitter falling from there and landing

184
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
squitter falling from there and landing
 

185
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,869
squitter falling from there and landing
on my wheat and that's what's killing it

186
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
on my wheat and that's what's killing it
 

187
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,990
on my wheat and that's what's killing it
uh can't really can't really stop that

188
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
uh can't really can't really stop that
 

189
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,070
uh can't really can't really stop that
unfortunately but anyway let's work

190
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
unfortunately but anyway let's work
 

191
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,949
unfortunately but anyway let's work
on this for a bit so we have to do

192
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
on this for a bit so we have to do
 

193
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,309
on this for a bit so we have to do
something about a ceiling here these

194
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
something about a ceiling here these
 

195
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,070
something about a ceiling here these
lights are actually kind of necessary

196
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
lights are actually kind of necessary
 

197
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,470
lights are actually kind of necessary
but we can change them to another type

198
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
but we can change them to another type
 

199
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,470
but we can change them to another type
because they light up the layer above

200
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
because they light up the layer above
 

201
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,869
because they light up the layer above
they shine through the piston

202
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
they shine through the piston
 

203
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,110
they shine through the piston
but if we use glowstone or something

204
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
but if we use glowstone or something
 

205
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,750
but if we use glowstone or something
that will look a lot better

206
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
that will look a lot better
 

207
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,949
that will look a lot better
um underneath the stairs here i

208
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
um underneath the stairs here i
 

209
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,430
um underneath the stairs here i
wasn't really sure what to do i added

210
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
wasn't really sure what to do i added
 

211
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,230
wasn't really sure what to do i added
these uh wooden stairs like this

212
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
these uh wooden stairs like this
 

213
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,110
these uh wooden stairs like this
but now i'm wondering if we take this

214
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
but now i'm wondering if we take this
 

215
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,510
but now i'm wondering if we take this
out

216
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
out
 

217
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,030
out
this might be a cool place to put some

218
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
this might be a cool place to put some
 

219
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,830
this might be a cool place to put some
flowers or something

220
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
flowers or something
 

221
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,629
flowers or something
all right and i'm i'm like making it go

222
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
all right and i'm i'm like making it go
 

223
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,310
all right and i'm i'm like making it go
around something here what should we

224
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
around something here what should we
 

225
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,390
around something here what should we
make it go around is the question

226
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
make it go around is the question
 

227
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,150
make it go around is the question
should this be like a deep pit of some

228
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
should this be like a deep pit of some
 

229
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,030
should this be like a deep pit of some
sort or should we put a tree here

230
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
sort or should we put a tree here
 

231
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,230
sort or should we put a tree here
i think we should put fences

232
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
i think we should put fences
 

233
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,590
i think we should put fences
get some fences going here

234
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
get some fences going here
 

235
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,270
get some fences going here
and go around so it's like there should

236
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
and go around so it's like there should
 

237
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,909
and go around so it's like there should
be

238
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
be
 

239
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,469
be
something significant here otherwise you

240
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
something significant here otherwise you
 

241
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,270
something significant here otherwise you
should just make it

242
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
should just make it
 

243
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,430
should just make it
go straight through here but i like how

244
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
go straight through here but i like how
 

245
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,550
go straight through here but i like how
it wraps around something

246
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
it wraps around something
 

247
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,390
it wraps around something

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
this long time ago i built this and i
 

281
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,230
this long time ago i built this and i
never

282
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
never
 

283
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,150

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
removed this stone that's showing so
 

285
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,469
removed this stone that's showing so
we're going to do that

00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
we're going to do that
 

287
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,670
we're going to do that

get this back there we go
 

289
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,990
get this back there we go
i think let's try just make a stone

290
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
i think let's try just make a stone
 

291
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,029
i think let's try just make a stone
brick thing

292
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
brick thing
 

293
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,629
brick thing
with stairs i just want something and

294
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
with stairs i just want something and
 

295
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,749
with stairs i just want something and
walk into

296
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
walk into
 

297
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,710
walk into
and come out of here

298
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720

 

299
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,390

this is going to be our way up and down

300
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
this is going to be our way up and down
 

301
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,390
this is going to be our way up and down
to the cow farm

302
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
to the cow farm
 

303
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,230
to the cow farm
like we originally planned

304
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240

 

305
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,749

that's one way we could do it we should

306
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
that's one way we could do it we should
 

307
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,150
that's one way we could do it we should
even hide some lights here

308
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
even hide some lights here
 

309
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,749
even hide some lights here
that way we can light up the center of

310
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
that way we can light up the center of
 

311
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,309
that way we can light up the center of
this grass in a nice way

312
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
this grass in a nice way
 

313
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,510
this grass in a nice way
nice and easy way

314
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520

 

315
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,870

yeah it's all right maybe

316
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
yeah it's all right maybe
 

317
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,150
yeah it's all right maybe
let's try this too

318
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160

 

319
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,710

makes it bigger oops

320
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720

 

321
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,189

do that too i'll i should get rid of

322
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
do that too i'll i should get rid of
 

323
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,270
do that too i'll i should get rid of
that a bit though

324
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
that a bit though
 

325
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,309
that a bit though
if we do this what happens then

326
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319

 

327
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,510

that looks weird glowstone down here

328
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520

 

329
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,110

let's let's go check this out from a

330
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
let's let's go check this out from a
 

331
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,710
let's let's go check this out from a
distance

332
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720

 

333
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,510

uh i wish it wasn't all one color

334
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
uh i wish it wasn't all one color
 

335
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,430
uh i wish it wasn't all one color
all right this one is still marked up so

336
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
all right this one is still marked up so
 

337
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,870
all right this one is still marked up so
that must mean this one was down

338
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
that must mean this one was down
 

339
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,430
that must mean this one was down
so we'll mark that again and then we

340
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
so we'll mark that again and then we
 

341
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,309
so we'll mark that again and then we
will add

342
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
will add
 

343
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,390
will add
new water here see we can only get that

344
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
new water here see we can only get that
 

345
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,790
new water here see we can only get that
high

346
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
high
 

347
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,830
high
let's put i guess we can make it solid

348
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
let's put i guess we can make it solid
 

349
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,629
let's put i guess we can make it solid
water

350
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639

 

351
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,990

cool so that'll be our water liner up

352
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
cool so that'll be our water liner up
 

353
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,270
cool so that'll be our water liner up
i tried switching to these and i think i

354
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
i tried switching to these and i think i
 

355
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,189
i tried switching to these and i think i
like them a little bit more

356
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
like them a little bit more
 

357
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,909
like them a little bit more
uh they take the same block space pretty

358
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
uh they take the same block space pretty
 

359
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,629
uh they take the same block space pretty
much but they look a lot smaller

360
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
much but they look a lot smaller
 

361
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,230
much but they look a lot smaller
so that's good i tried tried this out

362
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
so that's good i tried tried this out
 

363
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,670
so that's good i tried tried this out
for the ceiling

364
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
for the ceiling
 

365
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,869
for the ceiling
i don't think it's gonna work it's

366
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
i don't think it's gonna work it's
 

367
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,189
i don't think it's gonna work it's
causing lighting errors

368
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
causing lighting errors
 

369
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,830
causing lighting errors
uh like if we look from here

370
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
uh like if we look from here
 

371
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,430
uh like if we look from here
although i guess it's kind of dark that

372
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
although i guess it's kind of dark that
 

373
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,869
although i guess it's kind of dark that
over there but

374
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
over there but
 

375
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,629
over there but
uh if we put this here

376
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639

 

377
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,510

it makes it really dark so

378
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
it makes it really dark so
 

379
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,350
it makes it really dark so
might have to do full blocks for the

380
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
might have to do full blocks for the
 

381
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,550
might have to do full blocks for the
ceiling

382
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
ceiling
 

383
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,629
ceiling
um and we haven't really used these

384
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
um and we haven't really used these
 

385
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,070
um and we haven't really used these
anywhere so i don't know if we actually

386
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
anywhere so i don't know if we actually
 

387
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,150
anywhere so i don't know if we actually
should use them for this

388
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
should use them for this
 

389
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,029
should use them for this
uh it's looking to me though like this

390
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
uh it's looking to me though like this
 

391
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,189
uh it's looking to me though like this
needs to

392
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
needs to
 

393
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,270
needs to
continue through the stone brick so

394
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
continue through the stone brick so
 

395
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,350
continue through the stone brick so
let's try to do that

396
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
let's try to do that
 

397
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,870
let's try to do that
if we do oh not that

398
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
if we do oh not that
 

399
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,870
if we do oh not that
this do that

400
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880

 

401
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,990

that's i don't really want to

402
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
that's i don't really want to
 

403
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,670
that's i don't really want to
block the wood either

404
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680

 

405
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,870

we need to make it go down somewhere

406
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
we need to make it go down somewhere
 

407
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,870
we need to make it go down somewhere
how's that look

408
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880

 

409
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,550

that's okay but if we make it go down

410
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
that's okay but if we make it go down
 

411
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,070
that's okay but if we make it go down
it's not gonna

412
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
it's not gonna
 

413
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,030
it's not gonna
really work right if we just make it go

414
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
really work right if we just make it go
 

415
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,269
really work right if we just make it go
straight

416
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
straight
 

417
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,870
straight
does that look okay can we get away with

418
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
does that look okay can we get away with
 

419
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,150
does that look okay can we get away with
that

420
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160

 

421
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,910

let's change more of this wall to with

422
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
let's change more of this wall to with
 

423
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,430
let's change more of this wall to with
stone brick

424
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
stone brick
 

425
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,030
stone brick

one of the spider spawners so i thought
 

463
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,630
one of the spider spawners so i thought
i would try putting a window i'm not

464

i would try putting a window i'm not
 

465

sure if we'll keep that either
 

467
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,790
sure if we'll keep that either
depends how much lights it's going to

468
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
depends how much lights it's going to

depends how much lights it's going to
let in

470
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
let in
 

471
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,509
let in
i don't think it'll be much if it does

472
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
i don't think it'll be much if it does
 

473
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,400
i don't think it'll be much if it does
these these seem to work okay

474
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,410
these these seem to work okay
 

475

go back up still need to figure out what
we're putting there

480
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
we're putting there
 

481
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,550
we're putting there
um yeah

482

um yeah
 

483
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,350
um yeah
anyway let's let's maybe just quickly

484
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
anyway let's let's maybe just quickly
 

485
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,910
anyway let's let's maybe just quickly
finish

i think we'll just keep it all stone

492
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
i think we'll just keep it all stone
 

493
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,670
i think we'll just keep it all stone
brick let's

494

brick let's
 

495
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,550
brick let's
try continue this make it go round

496
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560

 

497
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,750

torch in there yeah

498
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760

 

499
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,670

just very simple and make it connect

500
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
just very simple and make it connect
 

501
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,509
just very simple and make it connect
back to there why not

502
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519

 

503
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,949

uh then let's bring a wall down

504
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959

 

505
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,790

how's that look and
 

507
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,470
how's that look and
slabs sure

usually
 

525
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,710
usually
and this is the last of it might

526
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
and this is the last of it might
 

527
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,430
and this is the last of it might
actually want to

528
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
actually want to
 

529
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,910
actually want to
hide some lights in there but we'll just

530
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
hide some lights in there but we'll just
 

531
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,829
hide some lights in there but we'll just
make it solid for now

532
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
make it solid for now
 

533
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,750
make it solid for now
because it does feel kind of dark here

534
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
because it does feel kind of dark here
 

535
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,550
because it does feel kind of dark here
doesn't it

536
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560

 

537
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,590

maybe a little bit

538
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
maybe a little bit
 

539
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,750
maybe a little bit
um oh yeah and then there's this

540
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760

 

541
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,509

i might make a few tweaks with this area

542
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
i might make a few tweaks with this area
 

543
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,350
i might make a few tweaks with this area
but that's that's pretty good

544

on an adventure we haven't gotten
 

563
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,829
on an adventure we haven't gotten
exploring in a long time

564
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
exploring in a long time
 

565
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,710
exploring in a long time
and particularly the thing i've been

566
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
and particularly the thing i've been
 

567
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,310
and particularly the thing i've been
wondering about a lot lately

568
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
wondering about a lot lately
 

569
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,550
wondering about a lot lately
is where are my other strongholds in

570
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
is where are my other strongholds in
 

571
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,310
is where are my other strongholds in
this world

572
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
this world
 

573
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,990
this world
uh so we're gonna hopefully try to

574
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
uh so we're gonna hopefully try to
 

575
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,110
uh so we're gonna hopefully try to
locate another one today

576
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
locate another one today
 

577
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,110
locate another one today
and we're also gonna bring a couple maps

578
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
and we're also gonna bring a couple maps
 

579
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,069
and we're also gonna bring a couple maps
with us so we can chart out some world

580
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
with us so we can chart out some world
 

581
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,670
with us so we can chart out some world
i hope

582
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680

 

583
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,550

so this is actually something i've tried

584
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
so this is actually something i've tried
 

585
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,509
so this is actually something i've tried
to do

586
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
to do
 

587
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,190
to do
in the past and failed uh this world is

588
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
in the past and failed uh this world is
 

589
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,230
in the past and failed uh this world is
a bit unique

590
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
a bit unique
 

591
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,790
a bit unique
when i created it it was the time that

592
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
when i created it it was the time that
 

593
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,990
when i created it it was the time that
strongholds are not

594
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
strongholds are not
 

595
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,710
strongholds are not
and that all sort of started coming out

596
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
and that all sort of started coming out
 

597
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,430
and that all sort of started coming out
so i

598
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
so i
 

599
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,990
so i
think their positions

600
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000

 

601
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,629

might be messed up it's surprising and

602
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
might be messed up it's surprising and
 

603
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,550
might be messed up it's surprising and
all my time in my world here i haven't

604
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
all my time in my world here i haven't
 

605
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,069
all my time in my world here i haven't

they were pretty tricky i remember
 

671
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,990
they were pretty tricky i remember
it's like they would go one way then

672
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
it's like they would go one way then
 

673
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,550

675
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,629

681
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,310
okay we'll try it i don't know if i
really believe it

682
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320

 

683
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,310

and maybe let's take a look at our map

684
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
and maybe let's take a look at our map
 

685
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,670
and maybe let's take a look at our map
here

686
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
here
 

687
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,430
here
that created it yeah

688
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440

 

689
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,829

ah beautiful i don't think this is a

690
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
ah beautiful i don't think this is a
 

691
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,430
ah beautiful i don't think this is a
section i've mapped out yet

692
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440

 

693
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,470

pretty much get the whole map just by uh

694
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
pretty much get the whole map just by uh
 

695
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,230
pretty much get the whole map just by uh
by loading it there's just a top right

696
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
by loading it there's just a top right
 

697
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,629
by loading it there's just a top right
corner there we kind of have to get

698
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
corner there we kind of have to get
 

699
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,030
corner there we kind of have to get
let's go that way

700
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040

 

701
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,430

extremely hard to walk around like this

702
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
extremely hard to walk around like this
 

703
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,710
extremely hard to walk around like this
i think we got it all

704
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720

 

705
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,269

you can see the lava lake uh kind of

706
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
you can see the lava lake uh kind of
 

707
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,389
you can see the lava lake uh kind of
around the middle there

708
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
around the middle there
 

709
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,910
around the middle there
creepers are gonna come up to us like

710
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
creepers are gonna come up to us like
 

711
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,230
creepers are gonna come up to us like
we're a tourist here and just

712
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
we're a tourist here and just
 

713
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,269
we're a tourist here and just
give us give us trouble

714
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
give us give us trouble
 

715
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,870
give us give us trouble
okay so it is this way if i remember

716
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
okay so it is this way if i remember
 

717
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,470
okay so it is this way if i remember
right it was like just past

718
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
right it was like just past
 

719
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,110
right it was like just past
this mountain here

720
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
this mountain here
 

721
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,509
this mountain here
the last time i looked for one

722
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519

 

723
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,910

but i'm pretty sure their location is

724
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
but i'm pretty sure their location is
 

725
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,629
but i'm pretty sure their location is
all

726
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
all
 

727
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,590
all
jazzed up in this world

728
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
jazzed up in this world
 

729
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,550
jazzed up in this world
look at that it's going doesn't know

730
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
look at that it's going doesn't know
 

731
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,710
look at that it's going doesn't know
where it wants to go

732
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
where it wants to go
 

733
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:36,470
where it wants to go
okay now it's it's pointing this way

734
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
okay now it's it's pointing this way
 

735
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,629
okay now it's it's pointing this way
i think we're getting close our other

736
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
i think we're getting close our other
 

737
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,509
i think we're getting close our other
one is like

738
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
one is like
 

739
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,030
one is like
pretty far uh that way like

740
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
pretty far uh that way like
 

741
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,870
pretty far uh that way like
a thousand blocks that way so this feels

742
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
a thousand blocks that way so this feels
 

743
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,990
a thousand blocks that way so this feels
like it should be the spot okay

744
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
like it should be the spot okay
 

745
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,310
like it should be the spot okay
oh it broke

746
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320

 

747
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,710

oh look at this area this is nice

748
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720

 

749
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,150

got some planes over there i don't know

750
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
got some planes over there i don't know
 

751
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,749
got some planes over there i don't know
if i've ever been to those planes

752
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
if i've ever been to those planes
 

753
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,710
if i've ever been to those planes
actually

754
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
actually
 

755
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,270
actually
look at that it changed directions what

756
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
look at that it changed directions what
 

757
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,110
look at that it changed directions what
do you know

758
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120

 

759
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,470

760
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
that makes this so fun
 

761
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,909
that makes this so fun

765
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,470

still wants us to go this way we are

766
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
still wants us to go this way we are
 

767
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,909
still wants us to go this way we are
just a little past zero zero

768
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919

 

769
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,990

river too i should try to link that to
 

777
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:45,990
river too i should try to link that to
my other

778
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
my other
 

779
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,430
my other
river

780
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440

 

781
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,909

okay let's try this again i need to get

782
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
okay let's try this again i need to get
 

783
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,470
okay let's try this again i need to get
another map

784
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
another map
 

785
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,430
another map
going to it feels like

786
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440

 

787
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,950

yeah let's get another map

788
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960

 

789
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,070

i think we got the whole thing here yeah

790
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
i think we got the whole thing here yeah
 

791
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,830
i think we got the whole thing here yeah
cool

792
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840

 

793
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,870

so

794
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880

797
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,430

they would just miss once or twice it

798
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
they would just miss once or twice it
 

799
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:33,430
they would just miss once or twice it
would be so much better

800
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440

 

801
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,110

819
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,230

let's try again here still wants us to

820
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
let's try again here still wants us to
 

821
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,549
let's try again here still wants us to
go this way

831
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,830

839
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,590
i really hope we find a village out here
like one nice and close to our other

840
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
like one nice and close to our other
 

841
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,110
like one nice and close to our other
our man cave there

842
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120

 

843
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,950

no mountains i thought i was kind of

844
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
no mountains i thought i was kind of
 

845
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,310
no mountains i thought i was kind of
hoping there would be mountains

846
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
hoping there would be mountains
 

847
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,710
hoping there would be mountains
out this way too

848
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720

 

849
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,470

and it actually almost looks like this

850
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
and it actually almost looks like this
 

851
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,390
and it actually almost looks like this
could turn into an ocean biome i've

852
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,400
could turn into an ocean biome i've
 

853
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,150
could turn into an ocean biome i've
never found

854
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
never found
 

855
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,630
never found
a proper ocean biome yet in this world

856
