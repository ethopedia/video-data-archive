used f3 to see where he was and when he
 

53
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,069
used f3 to see where he was and when he

got to the elevator there he would swim
 

55
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,370
got to the elevator there he would swim
up into the tower and then he was stuck

up into the tower and then he was stuck
 

57
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,660
up into the tower and then he was stuck
in the tower is how it worked but the

58
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:47,670
in the tower is how it worked but the
 

59
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,789
in the tower is how it worked but the
thing I found interesting is originally

60
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:49,799
thing I found interesting is originally
 

61
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,069
thing I found interesting is originally
when I did this I just had the one water

62
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
when I did this I just had the one water
 

63
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,240
when I did this I just had the one water
source at the top and none down here and

64
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,250
source at the top and none down here and
 

65
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,859
source at the top and none down here and
what happened when he walked into the

66
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:57,869
what happened when he walked into the
 

67
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,510
what happened when he walked into the
tower he just sat here the first time I

68
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
tower he just sat here the first time I
 

69
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,160
tower he just sat here the first time I
tried it

70
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,170
tried it
 

71
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,760
tried it
he wouldn't swim up so by placing a

72
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:07,770
he wouldn't swim up so by placing a
 

73
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,420
he wouldn't swim up so by placing a
water source here I learnt that when I

74
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,430
water source here I learnt that when I
 

75
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,630
water source here I learnt that when I
tried it again he swam up to the top

76
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
tried it again he swam up to the top
 

77
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,569
tried it again he swam up to the top
so that's a pretty interesting thing

78
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:18,579
so that's a pretty interesting thing
 

79
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,000
so that's a pretty interesting thing
about how mobs work if they touch a

80
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,010
about how mobs work if they touch a
 

81
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,270
about how mobs work if they touch a
water source a solid water source they

82
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,280
water source a solid water source they
 

83
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,619
water source a solid water source they
start swimming up but if it's just a

84
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:28,629
start swimming up but if it's just a
 

85
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,709
start swimming up but if it's just a
stream it doesn't change their state so

86
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:33,719
stream it doesn't change their state so
 

87
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,879
stream it doesn't change their state so
that information is going to help me

88
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:35,889
that information is going to help me
 

89
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,179
that information is going to help me
later I'm sure

90
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:38,189
later I'm sure
 

91
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,509
later I'm sure
and yeah okay let's go back up Tower I

went right where that stone block is
 

181
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:33,000
went right where that stone block is
which sand is being held up by these

like this block of sand falls Stroh's
 

191
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,890
like this block of sand falls Stroh's
assigns sand over top falls down which

creates the stairs for the creepers to
climb out and hit me is how it worked

196
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:58,950
climb out and hit me is how it worked
 

197
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,080
climb out and hit me is how it worked
very complicated so the repeater passes

198
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,090
very complicated so the repeater passes
 

199
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,210
very complicated so the repeater passes
a current through this block here which

200
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,220
a current through this block here which
 

201
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:13,350
a current through this block here which
caused the water update which is set up

202
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
caused the water update which is set up
 

203
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:22,130
caused the water update which is set up
like this and this had to be all covered

204
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,140

 

205
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,920

the water poured down cause the sand

206
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:25,930
the water poured down cause the sand
 

207

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,100
another backup so here we are again back
back like it was but yeah I realized

238
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,110
back like it was but yeah I realized
 

239
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,220
back like it was but yeah I realized
like when I tested it out with the way

240
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,230
like when I tested it out with the way
 

241
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,100
like when I tested it out with the way
it is here and creeper was where the

242
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,110
it is here and creeper was where the
 

243
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,530
it is here and creeper was where the
stone is here and the sand fell on him

244
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:04,540
stone is here and the sand fell on him
 

245
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,590
stone is here and the sand fell on him
and he was supposed to jump up and jump

246
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:06,600
and he was supposed to jump up and jump
 

247
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,130
and he was supposed to jump up and jump
on top the sand but what I found was

248
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,140
on top the sand but what I found was
 

249
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,070
on top the sand but what I found was
most of the time they wouldn't do that

250
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,080
most of the time they wouldn't do that
 

251
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,280
most of the time they wouldn't do that
they were unable to see me because the

252
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,290
they were unable to see me because the
 

253
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,520
they were unable to see me because the
sand was inside of them so they just

254
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,530
sand was inside of them so they just
 

255
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,230
sand was inside of them so they just
stood there and I could actually walk

256
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
stood there and I could actually walk
 

257
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
stood there and I could actually walk
right up to the creeper and touch him

258
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,130
right up to the creeper and touch him
 

259
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,490
right up to the creeper and touch him
without them blowing up it's kind of

260
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:26,500
without them blowing up it's kind of
 

261
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,860
without them blowing up it's kind of
weird so what I had to do was with the

262
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:31,870
weird so what I had to do was with the
 

263
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,960
weird so what I had to do was with the
creeper still in here I had to extend

264
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:33,970
creeper still in here I had to extend
 

265
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,160
creeper still in here I had to extend
this make it one longer and place a

266
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,170
this make it one longer and place a
 

267
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,200
this make it one longer and place a
torch at the bottom

268
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,210
torch at the bottom
 

269
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:50,190
torch at the bottom
dig this down place a torch and oh yeah

270
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,200
dig this down place a torch and oh yeah
 

271
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,930
dig this down place a torch and oh yeah
another thing I had a chest here hidden

272
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:51,940
another thing I had a chest here hidden
 

273
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,970
another thing I had a chest here hidden
under the sand so that when I was all

274
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:53,980
under the sand so that when I was all
 

275
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,520
under the sand so that when I was all
done I could hide whatever was in my

276
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:56,530
done I could hide whatever was in my
 

277
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,320
done I could hide whatever was in my
inventory that wasn't supposed to be

278
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,330
inventory that wasn't supposed to be
 

279
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,980
inventory that wasn't supposed to be
there like tea and tea or pressure

280
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:01,990
there like tea and tea or pressure
 

281
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:11,509
there like tea and tea or pressure
plates or anything like that

282
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519

 

283
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:21,090

going to make a sign here so what

284
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,100
going to make a sign here so what
 

285
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,650
going to make a sign here so what
happened is I had another sign this was

286
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:25,660
happened is I had another sign this was
 

287
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:34,319
happened is I had another sign this was
longer had the creeper stand where the

288
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:34,329
longer had the creeper stand where the
 

289
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:38,340
longer had the creeper stand where the
torch is and so when the sand falls on

290
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,350
torch is and so when the sand falls on
 

291
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,920
torch is and so when the sand falls on
him this time the torch destroys the

292
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:40,930
him this time the torch destroys the
 

293
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:46,500
him this time the torch destroys the
sand so there were he would be inside

294
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:46,510
sand so there were he would be inside
 

295
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,120
sand so there were he would be inside
air then so it was fine but I had to

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,130
air then so it was fine but I had to
 

297
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,189
air then so it was fine but I had to
make some more sand blocks fall down so

298
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:53,199
make some more sand blocks fall down so
 

299
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,310
make some more sand blocks fall down so
that their pathfinding could see me was

300
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
that their pathfinding could see me was
 

301
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,519
that their pathfinding could see me was
uh this is a big challenge the

302
00:10:59,519 --> 00:10:59,529
uh this is a big challenge the
 

303
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,610
uh this is a big challenge the
pathfinding was the main issue I had and

304
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:02,620
pathfinding was the main issue I had and
 

305
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,050
pathfinding was the main issue I had and
keeping the mobs from despawning while I

306
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,060
keeping the mobs from despawning while I
 

307
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,000
keeping the mobs from despawning while I
collected more well yeah that's it

308
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,010
collected more well yeah that's it
 

309
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,910
collected more well yeah that's it
that's how it worked so obviously these

310
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:14,920
that's how it worked so obviously these
 

311
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,160
that's how it worked so obviously these
towers aren't very useful if you plan on

312
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,170
towers aren't very useful if you plan on
 

313
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,439
towers aren't very useful if you plan on
loading them with creepers because the

314
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:19,449
loading them with creepers because the
 

315
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:23,069
loading them with creepers because the
creepers will just be spawn but they

316
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:23,079
creepers will just be spawn but they
 

317
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,240
creepers will just be spawn but they
might be useful if if you plan on

318
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,250
might be useful if if you plan on
 

319
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,550
might be useful if if you plan on
operating them yourselves because it's a

320
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:29,560
operating them yourselves because it's a
 

321
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,540
operating them yourselves because it's a
really easy way of setting up a defense

322
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:33,550
really easy way of setting up a defense
 

323
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,050
really easy way of setting up a defense
that you can choose where you're going

324
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,060
that you can choose where you're going
 

325
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,759
that you can choose where you're going
to fire like if I want to shoot in front

326
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:38,769
to fire like if I want to shoot in front
 

327
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:43,050
to fire like if I want to shoot in front
of me just have to walk forward you can

328
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,060
of me just have to walk forward you can
 

329
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,689
of me just have to walk forward you can
set up big walls lined with dispensers

330
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:45,699
set up big walls lined with dispensers
 

331
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,699
set up big walls lined with dispensers
and arrows I don't know do whatever you

332
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:50,709
and arrows I don't know do whatever you
 

333
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,269
and arrows I don't know do whatever you
want to do now let's head back to the

334
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:54,279
want to do now let's head back to the
 

335
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,490
want to do now let's head back to the
base now

336
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:57,500

 

337
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,250

okay so I think I want to talk about is

338
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,260
okay so I think I want to talk about is
 

339
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,410
okay so I think I want to talk about is
the mob systems I've built I've kind of

340
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:06,420
the mob systems I've built I've kind of
 

341
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,090
the mob systems I've built I've kind of
been home humming about them about what

342
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,100
been home humming about them about what
 

343
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,600
been home humming about them about what
I'm going to do because to be completely

344
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:11,610
I'm going to do because to be completely
 

345
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,329
I'm going to do because to be completely
honest I'm not totally happy with the

346
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:14,339
honest I'm not totally happy with the
 

347
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,500
honest I'm not totally happy with the
way they're turning out like don't get

348
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:18,510
way they're turning out like don't get
 

349
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,820
way they're turning out like don't get
me wrong they're really neat and

350
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,830
me wrong they're really neat and
 

351
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,199
me wrong they're really neat and
everything but I started building the

352
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:24,209
everything but I started building the
 

353
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,840
everything but I started building the
mob system back in episode 15 actually

354
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:26,850
mob system back in episode 15 actually
 

355
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,900
mob system back in episode 15 actually
which was a long time ago and at that

356
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:29,910
which was a long time ago and at that
 

357
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,940
which was a long time ago and at that
time I didn't know very much about mob

358
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:31,950
time I didn't know very much about mob
 

359
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,750
time I didn't know very much about mob
behavior or how to build spawning pads

360
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
behavior or how to build spawning pads
 

361
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,699
behavior or how to build spawning pads
or anything like that I kind of figured

362
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:37,709
or anything like that I kind of figured
 

363
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,120
or anything like that I kind of figured
it out as I went along and pieced it all

364
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,130
it out as I went along and pieced it all
 

365
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,110
it out as I went along and pieced it all
together and this is what we have now a

366
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
together and this is what we have now a
 

367
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
together and this is what we have now a
few things I redid try to improve

368
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,330
few things I redid try to improve
 

369
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:54,740
few things I redid try to improve
certain things it's working so so but in

370
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:54,750
certain things it's working so so but in
 

371
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,250
certain things it's working so so but in
all honesty it's kind of sloppy in my

372
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,260
all honesty it's kind of sloppy in my
 

373
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,850
all honesty it's kind of sloppy in my
opinion so in trying to figure out what

374
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:01,860
opinion so in trying to figure out what
 

375
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,500
opinion so in trying to figure out what
to do I can't really tear it down and

376
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,510
to do I can't really tear it down and
 

377
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,400
to do I can't really tear it down and
start fresh because that would involve

378
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,410
start fresh because that would involve
 

379
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,390
start fresh because that would involve
redesigning the storage room and

380
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:08,400
redesigning the storage room and
 

381
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,430
redesigning the storage room and
everything to do what I want to do so

382
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
everything to do what I want to do so
 

383
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,130
everything to do what I want to do so
I'm not going to do that the plan is I'm

384
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,140
I'm not going to do that the plan is I'm
 

385
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm not going to do that the plan is I'm
going to finish this up as well as I can

386
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:17,850
going to finish this up as well as I can
 

387
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,730
going to finish this up as well as I can
and then if I like I want everything

388
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:22,740
and then if I like I want everything
 

389
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,310
and then if I like I want everything
working to the point where I'm happy

390
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,320
working to the point where I'm happy
 

391
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,680
working to the point where I'm happy
with it so for example this pig

392
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:27,690
with it so for example this pig
 

393
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,269
with it so for example this pig
separator here I'm very happy with this

394
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
separator here I'm very happy with this
 

395
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,750
separator here I'm very happy with this
it works perfect in my opinion the only

396
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
it works perfect in my opinion the only
 

397
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,199
it works perfect in my opinion the only
issue is it like seven pigs fall down at

398
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,209
issue is it like seven pigs fall down at
 

399
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:42,590
issue is it like seven pigs fall down at
the same time they might not get split

400
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:42,600
the same time they might not get split
 

401
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,180
the same time they might not get split
here they might go with the sheep and

402
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,190
here they might go with the sheep and
 

403
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,600
here they might go with the sheep and
cows not a big deal I can extend that if

404
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:47,610
cows not a big deal I can extend that if
 

405
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,660
cows not a big deal I can extend that if
I want to all right

406
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:51,670
I want to all right
 

407
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,060
I want to all right
I could make it so that they don't

408
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,070
I could make it so that they don't
 

409
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,280
I could make it so that they don't
converge to a one widescreen here and

410
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,290
converge to a one widescreen here and
 

411
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,500
converge to a one widescreen here and
make it wider and I won't have any

412
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,510
make it wider and I won't have any
 

413
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,130
make it wider and I won't have any
issues the other thing I'm really happy

414
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,140
issues the other thing I'm really happy
 

415
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,970
issues the other thing I'm really happy
with is the wolf separator that seems to

416
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:05,980
with is the wolf separator that seems to
 

417
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,250
with is the wolf separator that seems to
work perfect some things I'm not happy

418
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,260
work perfect some things I'm not happy
 

419
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,540
work perfect some things I'm not happy
with at the moment are the chicken

420
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:14,550
with at the moment are the chicken
 

421
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,740
with at the moment are the chicken
killing thing because they seem to get

422
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:16,750
killing thing because they seem to get
 

423
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,180
killing thing because they seem to get
stuck in the doors kind of so I might

424
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,190
stuck in the doors kind of so I might
 

425
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,470
stuck in the doors kind of so I might
work on fixing that obviously that

426
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,480
work on fixing that obviously that
 

427
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,200
work on fixing that obviously that
Junction is not to my liking because it

428
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,210
Junction is not to my liking because it
 

429
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:36,560
Junction is not to my liking because it
was a sheep stuck there I don't like

430
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:36,570

 

431
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,360

this being a two-by-two area because

432
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,370
this being a two-by-two area because
 

433
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,180
this being a two-by-two area because
mobs can get stuck like this quite

434
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,190
mobs can get stuck like this quite
 

435
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:49,520
mobs can get stuck like this quite
frequently so we're going to change that

436
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,530

 

437
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,840

yeah so I'm just going to try figure out

438
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:51,850
yeah so I'm just going to try figure out
 

439
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,450
yeah so I'm just going to try figure out
how to get this working well all the

440
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:54,460
how to get this working well all the
 

441
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,120
how to get this working well all the
individual parts and then if I ever make

442
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,130
individual parts and then if I ever make
 

443
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,320
individual parts and then if I ever make
a base somewhere else in my an LP series

444
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,330
a base somewhere else in my an LP series
 

445
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,270
a base somewhere else in my an LP series
when I redo it all it'll be really easy

446
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,280
when I redo it all it'll be really easy
 

447
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,690
when I redo it all it'll be really easy
to figure out and I'll have everything

448
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:06,700
to figure out and I'll have everything
 

449
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,410
to figure out and I'll have everything
working neatly and cleanly and organized

450
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:10,420
working neatly and cleanly and organized
 

451
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,020
working neatly and cleanly and organized
the way I want it nice and compact

452
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,030
the way I want it nice and compact
 

453
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,560
the way I want it nice and compact
instead of having like a long tunnel

454
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,570
instead of having like a long tunnel
 

455
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,400
instead of having like a long tunnel
here for the pig to get killed I'm also

456
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,410
here for the pig to get killed I'm also
 

457
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,180
here for the pig to get killed I'm also
really happy with the way I'm getting

458
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,190
really happy with the way I'm getting
 

459
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,880
really happy with the way I'm getting
cooked pork chops there that seems to

460
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:26,890
cooked pork chops there that seems to
 

461
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,150
cooked pork chops there that seems to
work really well

462
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,160
work really well
 

463
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,620
work really well
spawning pads if I ever build them again

464
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:31,630
spawning pads if I ever build them again
 

465
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,480
spawning pads if I ever build them again
in the future they will probably be an

466
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,490
in the future they will probably be an
 

467
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,010
in the future they will probably be an
odd number with all the mobs converging

468
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,020
odd number with all the mobs converging
 

469
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,000
odd number with all the mobs converging
to one by one area I know how to do that

470
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,010
to one by one area I know how to do that
 

471
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:49,650
to one by one area I know how to do that
now properly before when I tried it like

472
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:49,660
now properly before when I tried it like
 

473
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,480
now properly before when I tried it like
if I make all these streams merge

474
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,490
if I make all these streams merge

00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
instead of this 2x2 area the mobs won't
 

479
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,250
instead of this 2x2 area the mobs won't
fall down the one they won't fall down

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,550
the one block wide area the one by one
they'll just keep bumping each other and

484
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
they'll just keep bumping each other and
 

485
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,350
they'll just keep bumping each other and
it takes forever for them to fall down

486
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
it takes forever for them to fall down
 

487
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
it takes forever for them to fall down
if they do but I know how to fix that

488
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:10,570
if they do but I know how to fix that
 

489
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,520
if they do but I know how to fix that
now which I won't show you now but later

490
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:14,530
now which I won't show you now but later
 

491
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:21,720
now which I won't show you now but later
I will if I do that these spawning pads

492
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:21,730
I will if I do that these spawning pads
 

493
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,430
I will if I do that these spawning pads
I'll probably change in the future if I

494
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
I'll probably change in the future if I
 

495
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,940
I'll probably change in the future if I
do it again I have issues with chickens

496
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:26,950
do it again I have issues with chickens
 

497
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,100
do it again I have issues with chickens
getting stuck in the stairs here

498
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,110
getting stuck in the stairs here
 

499
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,040
getting stuck in the stairs here
sometimes this chickens are really small

500
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,050
sometimes this chickens are really small
 

501
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,110
sometimes this chickens are really small
they can fit in that quarter cut out

502
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,120
they can fit in that quarter cut out
 

503
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,380
they can fit in that quarter cut out
section and then they don't move

504
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:41,390

 

505
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:55,300

oh yeah so I think next episode we're

506
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,310
oh yeah so I think next episode we're
 

507
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,790
oh yeah so I think next episode we're
going to work on cleaning this one up we

508
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
going to work on cleaning this one up we
 

509
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,490
going to work on cleaning this one up we
want this one working well as well as we

510
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:03,500
want this one working well as well as we
 

511
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,590
want this one working well as well as we
can get it too so we're going to fix it

512
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
can get it too so we're going to fix it
 

513
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,069
can get it too so we're going to fix it
up one thing I'm going to do next

514
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,079
up one thing I'm going to do next
 

515
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,910
up one thing I'm going to do next
episode I think is get rid of this 2x2

516
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:11,920
episode I think is get rid of this 2x2
 

517
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,069
episode I think is get rid of this 2x2
area and try and make it a one by one so

518
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
area and try and make it a one by one so
 

519
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,220
area and try and make it a one by one so
that they don't get stuck here and then

520
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,230
that they don't get stuck here and then
 

521
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:27,790
that they don't get stuck here and then
later we're going to hopefully build our

522
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:27,800
later we're going to hopefully build our
 

523
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,810
later we're going to hopefully build our
barn or whatever down there where the

524
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:31,820
barn or whatever down there where the
 

525
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,090
barn or whatever down there where the
Sheep of cows go and the holes one thing

526
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,100
Sheep of cows go and the holes one thing
 

527
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,090
Sheep of cows go and the holes one thing
I have to figure out yet is how to shear

528
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,100
I have to figure out yet is how to shear
 

529
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,530
I have to figure out yet is how to shear
the wool off sheep well like obviously

530
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:43,540
the wool off sheep well like obviously
 

531
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,460
the wool off sheep well like obviously
wolves the untamed wolves can do it but

532
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,470
wolves the untamed wolves can do it but
 

533
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,370
wolves the untamed wolves can do it but
I just can't throw a bunch of wolves and

534
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:51,380
I just can't throw a bunch of wolves and
 

535
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,440
I just can't throw a bunch of wolves and
sheep together and expect it to work

536
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,450
sheep together and expect it to work
 

537
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,560
sheep together and expect it to work
well because problem with that is

538
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:56,570
well because problem with that is
 

539
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,410
well because problem with that is
eventually there'll be so many wolves

540
00:17:59,410 --> 00:17:59,420
eventually there'll be so many wolves
 

541
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,620
eventually there'll be so many wolves
that no more other mobs will spawn so I

542
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:02,630
that no more other mobs will spawn so I
 

543
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,960
that no more other mobs will spawn so I
only need one to shear the sheep and I

544
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:07,970
only need one to shear the sheep and I
 

545
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,330
only need one to shear the sheep and I
have to make a way for it to auto detect

546
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:10,340
have to make a way for it to auto detect
 

547
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,080
have to make a way for it to auto detect
that there's only one and if you ever

548
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,090
that there's only one and if you ever
 

549
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,860
that there's only one and if you ever

I need a way for it to know he's the

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,450
I need a way for it to know he's the

spawned so that'll send another wolf and

554
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:20,500
spawned so that'll send another wolf and
 

555
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,810
spawned so that'll send another wolf and
only one wolf and it's kind of

556
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:25,820
only one wolf and it's kind of
 

557
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,560
only one wolf and it's kind of
complicated

558
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:26,570
complicated

I actually experimental with it I got

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,330
I actually experimental with it I got
 

561
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,590
I actually experimental with it I got
some footage of it I'll show you here

562
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
some footage of it I'll show you here
 

563
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,590
some footage of it I'll show you here
the idea is I had a wolf on one

564
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
the idea is I had a wolf on one
 

565
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,410
the idea is I had a wolf on one
individual block floating in the air and

individual block floating in the air and

I thought if I made a sheep pass right

568
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:43,460
I thought if I made a sheep pass right
 

569
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,590
I thought if I made a sheep pass right
by him

570
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:44,600
by him
 

571
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,530
by him
that he'll shear the sheep off the sheep

572
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:47,540
that he'll shear the sheep off the sheep
 

573
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,500
that he'll shear the sheep off the sheep
as it falls down but the problem is he

574
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,510
as it falls down but the problem is he
 

575
00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:02,970
as it falls down but the problem is he
just jumps to his death like an idiot so

576
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:02,980
just jumps to his death like an idiot so
 

577
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:16,260
just jumps to his death like an idiot so

579
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,790

unfortunately that test didn't go the

580
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:18,800
unfortunately that test didn't go the
 

581
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,070
unfortunately that test didn't go the
way I wanted it to the idea was the wolf

582
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,080
way I wanted it to the idea was the wolf
 

583
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,030
way I wanted it to the idea was the wolf
would be standing on a pressure plate on

584
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,040
would be standing on a pressure plate on
 

585
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,380
would be standing on a pressure plate on
one block in midair and if he was on the

586
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,390
one block in midair and if he was on the
 

587
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,030
one block in midair and if he was on the
pressure plate the door would be closed

588
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,040
pressure plate the door would be closed
 

589
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,070
pressure plate the door would be closed
that would determine whether a wolf

590
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,080
that would determine whether a wolf
 

591
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,950
that would determine whether a wolf
would be let onto the pressure plate and

592
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:35,960
would be let onto the pressure plate and
 

593
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,640
would be let onto the pressure plate and
that was how I was going to control only

594
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,650
that was how I was going to control only
 

595
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,380
that was how I was going to control only
having one wolf to shear the sheep and I

596
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,390
having one wolf to shear the sheep and I
 

597
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,030
having one wolf to shear the sheep and I
was hoping he wouldn't jump off the

598
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,040
was hoping he wouldn't jump off the
 

599
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,240
was hoping he wouldn't jump off the
block as the sheep came by but he did so

600
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,250
block as the sheep came by but he did so
 

601
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,710
block as the sheep came by but he did so
it didn't work so need to come up with

602
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:53,720
it didn't work so need to come up with
 

603
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,820
it didn't work so need to come up with
another method and like I tried before

604
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:57,830
another method and like I tried before
 

605
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,950
another method and like I tried before
he can't shear the wool off sheep

606
00:19:59,950 --> 00:19:59,960
he can't shear the wool off sheep
 

607
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,390
he can't shear the wool off sheep
through a door because I could have a

608
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
through a door because I could have a
 

609
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
through a door because I could have a
pressure plate just outside the door

610
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,050
pressure plate just outside the door
 

611
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,730
pressure plate just outside the door
here that he would be standing on I

612
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:11,740
here that he would be standing on I
 

613
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,380
here that he would be standing on I
don't know I've been thinking about this

614
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,390
don't know I've been thinking about this
 

615
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,450
don't know I've been thinking about this
a lot and there's just no good way of

616
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:19,460
a lot and there's just no good way of
 

617
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,770
a lot and there's just no good way of
doing it I think no automatic way I

618
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:26,780
doing it I think no automatic way I
 

619
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,040
doing it I think no automatic way I
might just make it manual like I might

620
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,050
might just make it manual like I might
 

621
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:35,530
might just make it manual like I might
have to let in one wolf manually I don't

622
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:35,540
have to let in one wolf manually I don't
 

623
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:42,730
have to let in one wolf manually I don't
know how else to do it but anyway that's

624
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:42,740
know how else to do it but anyway that's
 

625
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,040
know how else to do it but anyway that's
the end of this episode sorry for making

626
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,050
the end of this episode sorry for making
 

627
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,010
the end of this episode sorry for making
it a talky one the next episode will

628
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,020
it a talky one the next episode will
 

629
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,750
it a talky one the next episode will
actually do something so thank you for

630
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:52,760
actually do something so thank you for
