59
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,030
to mess with it for a while is we got to

reason a zombie gets into the into the

reason a zombie gets into the into the
 

75
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,969
reason a zombie gets into the into the
skeleton chamber you know we don't want

76
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:49,979
skeleton chamber you know we don't want
 

77
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,620
skeleton chamber you know we don't want
it to get stuck or something like that

78
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:51,630
it to get stuck or something like that
 

79
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,889
it to get stuck or something like that
because the skeletons not shooting like

80
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:54,899
because the skeletons not shooting like
 

81
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,660
because the skeletons not shooting like
it's supposed to because the zombie or

82
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:56,670
it's supposed to because the zombie or
 

83
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,260
it's supposed to because the zombie or
something like that so I'm guessing the

84
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,270
something like that so I'm guessing the
 

85
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,090
something like that so I'm guessing the
way I'm going to control these is going

86
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,100
way I'm going to control these is going
 

87
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,149
way I'm going to control these is going
to be time-based somewhat but also will

88
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:05,159
to be time-based somewhat but also will
 

89
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,399
to be time-based somewhat but also will
probably do some logical checking like

90
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:07,409
probably do some logical checking like
 

91
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,300
probably do some logical checking like
if there's a mob in

92
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,310
if there's a mob in
 

93
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,630
if there's a mob in
in our holding areas down there check

94
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:13,640
in our holding areas down there check
 

95
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,080
in our holding areas down there check
that out make sure make sure it does

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
that open and the few places I do have
 

141
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,280
that open and the few places I do have
that we're open I've used so this is

142
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,290
that we're open I've used so this is
 

143
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,810
that we're open I've used so this is
about as close as we're going to get and

brewing works in Minecraft

318
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,180
brewing works in Minecraft
 

319
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,810
brewing works in Minecraft
let's just get this up we can use

320
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:35,820
let's just get this up we can use
 

321
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,250
let's just get this up we can use
hoppers and stuff to automate everything

322
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,260
hoppers and stuff to automate everything
 

323
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,790
hoppers and stuff to automate everything
it's nice what I would like to do is

324
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
it's nice what I would like to do is
 

325
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,270
it's nice what I would like to do is
make a fully automatic brewing room with

326
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,280
make a fully automatic brewing room with
 

327
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,940
make a fully automatic brewing room with
the least amount of efforts from me

328
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:46,950
the least amount of efforts from me
 

329
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,990
the least amount of efforts from me
required so I've come up with a pretty

330
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
required so I've come up with a pretty
 

331
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,700
required so I've come up with a pretty
good thing for that um

332
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:52,710
good thing for that um
 

333
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,500
good thing for that um
if what we can do will I be able to

334
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,510
if what we can do will I be able to
 

335
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,680
if what we can do will I be able to
place this okay I always miss trying to

336
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:00,690
place this okay I always miss trying to
 

337
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,180
place this okay I always miss trying to
place it on a brewing stand it's such a

338
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,190
place it on a brewing stand it's such a
 

339
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:08,450
place it on a brewing stand it's such a
small hitbox there we go okay so what we

340
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:08,460
small hitbox there we go okay so what we
 

341
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,020
small hitbox there we go okay so what we
can do we can add ingredients to our

342
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,030
can do we can add ingredients to our
 

343
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,790
can do we can add ingredients to our
brewing stand automatically from the top

344
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:13,800
brewing stand automatically from the top
 

345
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,550
brewing stand automatically from the top
there and it stays in the brewing stand

346
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
there and it stays in the brewing stand
 

347
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,070
there and it stays in the brewing stand
that doesn't leave we can also just

348
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
that doesn't leave we can also just
 

349
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,530
that doesn't leave we can also just
going to power this we can also put

350
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:24,540
going to power this we can also put
 

351
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,640
going to power this we can also put
bottles in from the side and those go

352
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:27,650
bottles in from the side and those go
 

353
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,130
bottles in from the side and those go
into the proper slot if we attempt to

354
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,140
into the proper slot if we attempt to
 

355
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,020
into the proper slot if we attempt to
put these from the top they don't go it

356
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,030
put these from the top they don't go it
 

357
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,110
put these from the top they don't go it
only accepts valid ingredients for it

358
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
only accepts valid ingredients for it
 

359
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,250
only accepts valid ingredients for it
the thing is though these don't normally

360
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,260
the thing is though these don't normally
 

361
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,900
the thing is though these don't normally
stay in the brewing stand if this is

362
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:44,910
stay in the brewing stand if this is
 

363
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,360
stay in the brewing stand if this is
unpowered they automatically go through

364
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,370
unpowered they automatically go through
 

365
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,580
unpowered they automatically go through
the bottom so it's it's a stuff little

366
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:52,590
the bottom so it's it's a stuff little
 

367
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,160
the bottom so it's it's a stuff little
juggling act we got to do we got to make

368
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,170
juggling act we got to do we got to make
 

369
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,740
juggling act we got to do we got to make
the brewing or make the potion stay in

370
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:57,750
the brewing or make the potion stay in
 

371
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,690
the brewing or make the potion stay in
long enough to brew and then unpowered a

372
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:02,700
long enough to brew and then unpowered a
 

373
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,150
long enough to brew and then unpowered a
hopper below to suck it out and put it

374
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,160
hopper below to suck it out and put it
 

375
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,050
hopper below to suck it out and put it
into storage right the time it takes for

376
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,060
into storage right the time it takes for
 

377
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,730
into storage right the time it takes for
a potion to brew is 20 seconds I think

378
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:13,740
a potion to brew is 20 seconds I think
 

379
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,880
a potion to brew is 20 seconds I think
pretty much exactly 20 seconds like for

380
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:16,890
pretty much exactly 20 seconds like for
 

381
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,970
pretty much exactly 20 seconds like for
this bar to go all the way down so I'm

382
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:19,980
this bar to go all the way down so I'm
 

383
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,220
this bar to go all the way down so I'm
going to be using a clock a 20-second

384
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,230
going to be using a clock a 20-second
 

385
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,910
going to be using a clock a 20-second
clock that's on for 20 seconds like it

386
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
clock that's on for 20 seconds like it
 

387
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,370
clock that's on for 20 seconds like it
will I'm going to use a hopper timer

388
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,380
will I'm going to use a hopper timer
 

389
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,670
will I'm going to use a hopper timer
that will turn the redstone on for 20

390
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
that will turn the redstone on for 20
 

391
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,630
that will turn the redstone on for 20
seconds and then off for 20 more it's

392
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:35,640
seconds and then off for 20 more it's
 

393
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,050
seconds and then off for 20 more it's
going to alternate between the two and

394
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,060
going to alternate between the two and
 

395
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,850
going to alternate between the two and
the general idea behind our brewing

396
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:40,860
the general idea behind our brewing
 

397
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,040
the general idea behind our brewing
setup is have let's see how do I do that

398
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,050
setup is have let's see how do I do that
 

399
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,630
setup is have let's see how do I do that
I think I have two blocks redstone torch

400
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
I think I have two blocks redstone torch
 

401
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,370
I think I have two blocks redstone torch
to invert the signal and that so one of

402
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,380
to invert the signal and that so one of
 

403
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,019
to invert the signal and that so one of
these hoppers is powered right now one

404
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:57,029
these hoppers is powered right now one
 

405
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,880
these hoppers is powered right now one
of them is not if we switch it it

406
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:58,890
of them is not if we switch it it
 

407
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:09,980
of them is not if we switch it it
reverses okay so right now it'll go into

408
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:09,990
reverses okay so right now it'll go into
 

409
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,509
reverses okay so right now it'll go into
the brewing stand I'll hold it until

410
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
the brewing stand I'll hold it until
 

411
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,780
the brewing stand I'll hold it until
this is unpowered then it will go from

412
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:14,790
this is unpowered then it will go from
 

413
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,880
this is unpowered then it will go from
there so that's what we want and no new

414
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:19,890
there so that's what we want and no new
 

415
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,889
there so that's what we want and no new
potions can enter into the brewing stand

416
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:21,899
potions can enter into the brewing stand
 

417
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,150
potions can enter into the brewing stand
while it's in this state so we can

418
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
while it's in this state so we can
 

419
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,280
while it's in this state so we can
alternate between adding them in and

420
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,290
alternate between adding them in and
 

421
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,769
alternate between adding them in and
taking them out just by an on and off

422
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:30,779
taking them out just by an on and off
 

423
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,199
taking them out just by an on and off
real simple that we will control with

424
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:33,209
real simple that we will control with
 

425
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:41,000
real simple that we will control with
our twenty second clock so my design is

426
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,010
our twenty second clock so my design is
 

427
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,819
our twenty second clock so my design is
based off of this what I'm going to do

428
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:43,829
based off of this what I'm going to do
 

429
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,819
based off of this what I'm going to do
is have let's give some chests going

430
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:46,829
is have let's give some chests going
 

431
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:53,449
is have let's give some chests going
here OOP I think I have a crafting table

432
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:53,459
here OOP I think I have a crafting table
 

433
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,350
here OOP I think I have a crafting table
up here actually before I make another

434
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
up here actually before I make another
 

435
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,110
up here actually before I make another
one like I always do

436
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
one like I always do
 

437
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,900
one like I always do
okay so I've kind of come up with a

438
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:02,910
okay so I've kind of come up with a
 

439
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,870
okay so I've kind of come up with a
snake tileable pattern for brewing

440
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:05,880
snake tileable pattern for brewing
 

441
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,620
snake tileable pattern for brewing
stands that's pretty good there's lots

442
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,630
stands that's pretty good there's lots
 

443
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,650
stands that's pretty good there's lots
of different designs for for brewing

444
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:12,660
of different designs for for brewing
 

445
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,240
of different designs for for brewing
stations there's a lot of cool ones out

446
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,250
stations there's a lot of cool ones out
 

447
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,519
stations there's a lot of cool ones out
there I'm not saying this one's the best

448
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:16,529
there I'm not saying this one's the best
 

449
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,269
there I'm not saying this one's the best
or anything but for for my purpose for

450
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:20,279
or anything but for for my purpose for
 

451
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:27,290
or anything but for for my purpose for
being lazy it's pretty nice I think the

452
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:27,300
being lazy it's pretty nice I think the
 

453
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,689
being lazy it's pretty nice I think the
idea is to just pick one you like and go

454
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:29,699
idea is to just pick one you like and go
 

455
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:35,350
idea is to just pick one you like and go
with it so we'll have a reserve for

456
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
with it so we'll have a reserve for
 

457
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,870
with it so we'll have a reserve for
bottles there so bottles can get taken

458
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
bottles there so bottles can get taken
 

459
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,480
bottles there so bottles can get taken
out of that chest automatically and put

460
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:41,490
out of that chest automatically and put
 

461
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,040
out of that chest automatically and put
into the brewing stand and they went

462
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,050
into the brewing stand and they went
 

463
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,380
into the brewing stand and they went
through the bottom will also have a

464
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,390
through the bottom will also have a
 

465
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,840
through the bottom will also have a
chest at the top for ingredients so we

466
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:50,850
chest at the top for ingredients so we
 

467
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,590
chest at the top for ingredients so we
can have a large buffer of ingredients

468
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
can have a large buffer of ingredients
 

469
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,220
can have a large buffer of ingredients
that's

470
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,230
that's
 

471
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:03,710
that's
and then what I want to do is like say

472
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:03,720
and then what I want to do is like say
 

473
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,110
and then what I want to do is like say
we have a water bottle here I want that

474
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,120
we have a water bottle here I want that
 

475
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,300
we have a water bottle here I want that
to turn into an awkward potion here and

476
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,310
to turn into an awkward potion here and
 

477
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,060
to turn into an awkward potion here and
then move down a line add to another

478
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,070
then move down a line add to another
 

479
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,440
then move down a line add to another
brewing stand and convert that into like

480
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,450
brewing stand and convert that into like
 

481
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,080
brewing stand and convert that into like
a speed potion or something and then go

482
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,090
a speed potion or something and then go
 

483
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,090
a speed potion or something and then go
further down the line make it extended

484
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,100
further down the line make it extended
 

485
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,950
further down the line make it extended
speed potion and further make it

486
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:21,960
speed potion and further make it
 

487
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,390
speed potion and further make it
extended speed splash potion you know

488
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:25,400
extended speed splash potion you know
 

489
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,950
extended speed splash potion you know
just keep it going had like a long-ass

490
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:27,960
just keep it going had like a long-ass
 

491
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,700
just keep it going had like a long-ass
snake pattern of brewing stands so I

492
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:31,710
snake pattern of brewing stands so I
 

493
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,040
snake pattern of brewing stands so I
found a way of doing it what we can do

494
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,050
found a way of doing it what we can do
 

495
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,850
found a way of doing it what we can do
is have the hopper facing to the right

496
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:39,860

 

497
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,380

with the way these hoppers work though

498
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,390
with the way these hoppers work though
 

499
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,590
with the way these hoppers work though
the the potions or the bottles go down

500
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
the the potions or the bottles go down
 

501
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,180
the the potions or the bottles go down
two blocks here so we got to get those

502
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,190
two blocks here so we got to get those
 

503
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,520
two blocks here so we got to get those
back up so I use droppers to do that get

504
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:52,530
back up so I use droppers to do that get
 

505
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,910
back up so I use droppers to do that get
that up two blocks and then those go to

506
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
that up two blocks and then those go to
 

507
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,810
that up two blocks and then those go to
a reserve a nice little buffer chess

508
00:13:59,810 --> 00:13:59,820
a reserve a nice little buffer chess
 

509
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,890
a reserve a nice little buffer chess
thing and then see I think I've messed

510
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:06,900
thing and then see I think I've messed
 

511
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,290
thing and then see I think I've messed
this up what did I do wrong this isn't

512
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,300
this up what did I do wrong this isn't
 

513
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,400
this up what did I do wrong this isn't
looking right Oh No

514
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,410
looking right Oh No
 

515
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,210
looking right Oh No
maybe it's right maybe it's right yeah

516
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,220
maybe it's right maybe it's right yeah
 

517
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,050
maybe it's right maybe it's right yeah
this is what I do

518
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,060
this is what I do
 

519
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,510
this is what I do
okay so then hopper goes to the side and

520
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:22,520
okay so then hopper goes to the side and
 

521
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,430
okay so then hopper goes to the side and
we have our next brewing station here

522
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
we have our next brewing station here
 

523
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,310
we have our next brewing station here
and again we have a hopper on top which

524
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,320
and again we have a hopper on top which
 

525
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,760
and again we have a hopper on top which
I'll never be able to place there we go

526
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:34,770
I'll never be able to place there we go
 

527
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,880
I'll never be able to place there we go
and we have a chest on top that for the

528
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:37,890
and we have a chest on top that for the
 

529
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,510
and we have a chest on top that for the
next set of ingredients and you know

530
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:41,520
next set of ingredients and you know
 

531
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,470
next set of ingredients and you know
just it keeps going down the line

532
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,480

 

533
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,490

another one here so it's a pretty simple

534
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:52,500
another one here so it's a pretty simple
 

535
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,800
another one here so it's a pretty simple
repeating pattern get our hopper there

536
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:56,810
repeating pattern get our hopper there
 

537
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,940
repeating pattern get our hopper there
now the thing is though we got to power

538
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:58,950
now the thing is though we got to power
 

539
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,610
now the thing is though we got to power
these droppers to move the items like

540
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:01,620
these droppers to move the items like
 

541
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,730
these droppers to move the items like
that piece of cobble will automatically

542
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:04,740
that piece of cobble will automatically
 

543
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,070
that piece of cobble will automatically
get put to that one we need to power it

544
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,080
get put to that one we need to power it
 

545
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,110
get put to that one we need to power it
to get it up to this chair

546
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120

 

547
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,100

they go through both where'd it go

548
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,110
they go through both where'd it go
 

549
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,780
they go through both where'd it go
I think it went up to the chest through

550
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:17,790
I think it went up to the chest through
 

551
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,579
I think it went up to the chest through
the hopper it's probably stuck in there

552
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:19,589
the hopper it's probably stuck in there
 

553
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,389
the hopper it's probably stuck in there
yeah okay so you gotta send power to

554
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:23,399
yeah okay so you gotta send power to
 

555
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,860
yeah okay so you gotta send power to
that and then we also have to control

556
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:24,870
that and then we also have to control
 

557
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,790
that and then we also have to control
the inversion of these two hoppers to

558
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
the inversion of these two hoppers to
 

559
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,800
the inversion of these two hoppers to
control the flow of the bottles right so

560
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:33,810
control the flow of the bottles right so
 

561
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,360
control the flow of the bottles right so
I'll show you how I plan on doing the

562
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,370
I'll show you how I plan on doing the
 

563
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,160
I'll show you how I plan on doing the
redstone for all this it's actually

564
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,170
redstone for all this it's actually
 

565
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,410
redstone for all this it's actually
pretty simple as well

566
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:38,420
pretty simple as well
 

567
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,960
pretty simple as well
we we need to set up two different lines

568
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:41,970
we we need to set up two different lines
 

569
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,999
we we need to set up two different lines
of redstone one of them to control the

570
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:44,009
of redstone one of them to control the
 

571
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,670
of redstone one of them to control the
hoppers and one of them to control the

572
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:46,680
hoppers and one of them to control the
 

573
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,829
hoppers and one of them to control the
droppers we don't want them interfering

574
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:48,839
droppers we don't want them interfering
 

575
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,499
droppers we don't want them interfering
with each other because for our clock

576
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:51,509
with each other because for our clock
 

577
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,600
with each other because for our clock
that's running the twenty second clock

578
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:53,610
that's running the twenty second clock
 

579
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,230
that's running the twenty second clock
that needs to send one pulse to these

580
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,240
that needs to send one pulse to these
 

581
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,930
that needs to send one pulse to these
and in that time it needs to send I

582
00:15:59,930 --> 00:15:59,940
and in that time it needs to send I
 

583
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,509
and in that time it needs to send I
think three to the dropper because for

584
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:02,519
think three to the dropper because for
 

585
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,519
think three to the dropper because for
every batch of potions were brewing

586
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:04,529
every batch of potions were brewing
 

587
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:08,120
every batch of potions were brewing
we're creating three so if we only sent

588
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,130
we're creating three so if we only sent
 

589
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,620
we're creating three so if we only sent
one it would only send one potion

590
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,630
one it would only send one potion
 

591
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,429
one it would only send one potion
through and then two would get stuck in

592
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:13,439
through and then two would get stuck in
 

593
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,230
through and then two would get stuck in
the dropper and it would pile up and

594
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
the dropper and it would pile up and
 

595
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,720
the dropper and it would pile up and
back up the whole system we need three

596
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:17,730
back up the whole system we need three
 

597
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:23,360
back up the whole system we need three
pulses for the droppers okay so I want

598
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,370
pulses for the droppers okay so I want
 

599
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,360
pulses for the droppers okay so I want
to put our inverter for the hoppers one

600
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,370
to put our inverter for the hoppers one
 

601
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,809
to put our inverter for the hoppers one
block away from them then have the

602
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:29,819
block away from them then have the
 

603
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:32,829
block away from them then have the
hoppers powered using these repeaters

604
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:32,839
hoppers powered using these repeaters
 

605
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,610
hoppers powered using these repeaters
like so and again you can see them

606
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:37,620
like so and again you can see them
 

607
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,889
like so and again you can see them
inverting ones on ones off always then

608
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:42,899
inverting ones on ones off always then
 

609
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,439
inverting ones on ones off always then
the droppers I'm going to have another

610
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:45,449
the droppers I'm going to have another
 

611
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:50,090
the droppers I'm going to have another
repeater one block up like that with

612
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,100
repeater one block up like that with
 

613
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,249
repeater one block up like that with
with our hoppers though this torch adds

614
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:55,259
with our hoppers though this torch adds
 

615
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,879
with our hoppers though this torch adds
a one tick delay to to this one so to

616
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:58,889
a one tick delay to to this one so to
 

617
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,199
a one tick delay to to this one so to
balance them out I'm going to set that

618
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:00,209
balance them out I'm going to set that
 

619
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:05,360
balance them out I'm going to set that
at two and then we are going to have a

620
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,370
at two and then we are going to have a
 

621
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,699
at two and then we are going to have a
separate line of wire at the top here so

622
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:07,709
separate line of wire at the top here so
 

623
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:11,899
separate line of wire at the top here so
this redstone and powered will go to the

624
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:11,909
this redstone and powered will go to the
 

625
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:15,559
this redstone and powered will go to the
droppers and only the droppers not the

626
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:15,569
droppers and only the droppers not the
 

627
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,230
droppers and only the droppers not the
hoppers they just had the figure name

628
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
hoppers they just had the figure name
 

629
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,789
hoppers they just had the figure name
that was so similar to each other you

630
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:19,799
that was so similar to each other you
 

631
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,610
that was so similar to each other you
know it's kind of cool but at the

632
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:22,620
know it's kind of cool but at the
 

633
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,370
know it's kind of cool but at the
time I think you could get confusing

634
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:24,380
time I think you could get confusing
 

635
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:30,049
time I think you could get confusing
really easy see there's a redstone torch

636
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,059
really easy see there's a redstone torch
 

637
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,790
really easy see there's a redstone torch
underneath here though so we got to make

638
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:31,800
underneath here though so we got to make
 

639
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,799
underneath here though so we got to make
sure it doesn't power this line at the

640
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:33,809
sure it doesn't power this line at the
 

641
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:39,070
sure it doesn't power this line at the
top so we put a repeater over that and

642
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,080

 

643
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,090

that's only one we need to worry about

644
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,100
that's only one we need to worry about
 

645
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,360
that's only one we need to worry about
right that's okay so when this switch is

646
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,370
right that's okay so when this switch is
 

647
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,180
right that's okay so when this switch is
it doesn't power the top line which is

648
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,190
it doesn't power the top line which is
 

649
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,490
it doesn't power the top line which is
good okay this should give you a better

650
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:55,500
good okay this should give you a better
 

651
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,169
good okay this should give you a better
idea of the repeating pattern for the

652
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:57,179
idea of the repeating pattern for the
 

653
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,480
idea of the repeating pattern for the
redstone we have the one line down here

654
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,490
redstone we have the one line down here
 

655
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,910
redstone we have the one line down here
for controlling the hoppers you guys

656
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:01,920
for controlling the hoppers you guys
 

657
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,820
for controlling the hoppers you guys
send power to each of these blocks you

658
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:04,830
send power to each of these blocks you
 

659
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,290
send power to each of these blocks you
can even power them from underneath it

660
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,300
can even power them from underneath it
 

661
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,910
can even power them from underneath it
doesn't have to be from the side like we

662
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:07,920
doesn't have to be from the side like we
 

663
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,850
doesn't have to be from the side like we
have here and then we have the other

664
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:10,860
have here and then we have the other
 

665
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,160
have here and then we have the other
line at the top here for controlling the

666
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,170
line at the top here for controlling the
 

667
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,669
line at the top here for controlling the
droppers all right and I can take you

668
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:16,679
droppers all right and I can take you
 

669
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,400
droppers all right and I can take you
through on a quick run of this to how

670
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,410
through on a quick run of this to how
 

671
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,650
through on a quick run of this to how
it's going to work so we got nine water

672
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660
it's going to work so we got nine water
 

673
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,900
it's going to work so we got nine water
bottles in our starter chest here they

674
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:26,910
bottles in our starter chest here they
 

675
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,280
bottles in our starter chest here they
can't go through at the moment because

676
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,290
can't go through at the moment because
 

677
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,580
can't go through at the moment because
this hopper is being powered so our

678
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:31,590
this hopper is being powered so our
 

679
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,230
this hopper is being powered so our
clock is going to switch this it's going

680
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,240
clock is going to switch this it's going
 

681
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,360
clock is going to switch this it's going
to turn the power on for 20 seconds that

682
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,370
to turn the power on for 20 seconds that
 

683
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,290
to turn the power on for 20 seconds that
gives it time to let the bottles into

684
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:42,300
gives it time to let the bottles into
 

685
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,150
gives it time to let the bottles into
the brewing stand they're being held

686
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
the brewing stand they're being held
 

687
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,919
the brewing stand they're being held
there because now this is being powered

688
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:45,929
there because now this is being powered
 

689
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,790
there because now this is being powered
right so after 20 seconds the potions

690
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:49,800
right so after 20 seconds the potions
 

691
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,040
right so after 20 seconds the potions
brew this turns off for 20 more seconds

692
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,050
brew this turns off for 20 more seconds
 

693
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:59,980
brew this turns off for 20 more seconds
and that will send them into the dropper

694
00:18:59,980 --> 00:18:59,990

 

695
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,720

those are ready to be put into there

696
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:02,730
those are ready to be put into there
 

697
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,450
those are ready to be put into there
then we got to send I think three or

698
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:05,460
then we got to send I think three or
 

699
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,580
then we got to send I think three or
four pulses into those droppers and it's

700
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:07,590
four pulses into those droppers and it's
 

701
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,280
four pulses into those droppers and it's
four actually so we do that with this

702
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,290
four actually so we do that with this
 

703
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,620
four actually so we do that with this
per cycle we do this

704
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:15,630
per cycle we do this
 

705
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,580
per cycle we do this
we sent two so that now has one in this

706
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:19,590
we sent two so that now has one in this
 

707
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,130
we sent two so that now has one in this
chest one in the top one one in the

708
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,140
chest one in the top one one in the
 

709
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,380
chest one in the top one one in the
bottom three we'll bring the bottom one

710
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,390
bottom three we'll bring the bottom one
 

711
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,290
bottom three we'll bring the bottom one
up to their top one went into this chest

712
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:30,300
up to their top one went into this chest
 

713
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,540
up to their top one went into this chest
so we need four pulses and finally we

714
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,550
so we need four pulses and finally we
 

715
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,440
so we need four pulses and finally we
have three

716
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,450
have three
 

717
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,970
have three
they're so these are ready to go into

718
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:37,980
they're so these are ready to go into
 

719
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,340
they're so these are ready to go into
the next brewing stand once it switches

720
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,350
the next brewing stand once it switches
 

721
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,590
the next brewing stand once it switches
again so if we switch it for another 20

722
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
again so if we switch it for another 20
 

723
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,380
again so if we switch it for another 20
seconds now you can see both brewing

724
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,390
seconds now you can see both brewing
 

725
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,620
seconds now you can see both brewing
stands have had bottles in these would

726
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:51,630
stands have had bottles in these would
 

727
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,900
stands have had bottles in these would
be awkward potions at this point so if

728
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:53,910
be awkward potions at this point so if
 

729
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,920
be awkward potions at this point so if
we had sugar in there it would become

730
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:56,930
we had sugar in there it would become
 

731
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,750
we had sugar in there it would become
speed potions and this would be brewing

732
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
speed potions and this would be brewing
 

733
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,580
speed potions and this would be brewing
the next set of awkward potions to go

734
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:01,590
the next set of awkward potions to go
 

735
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,890
the next set of awkward potions to go
down the line so it's pretty cool pretty

736
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:06,900
down the line so it's pretty cool pretty
 

737
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,560
down the line so it's pretty cool pretty
cool oh you know what I don't actually

738
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:12,570
cool oh you know what I don't actually
 

739
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,270
cool oh you know what I don't actually
need all that redstone I was thinking

740
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,280
need all that redstone I was thinking
 

741
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,870
need all that redstone I was thinking
about it I can simplify it quite a bit

742
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
about it I can simplify it quite a bit
 

743
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,490
about it I can simplify it quite a bit
this is one of the ways I could set it

744
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:19,500
this is one of the ways I could set it
 

745
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,020
this is one of the ways I could set it
up or I could even totally remove like

746
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,030
up or I could even totally remove like
 

747
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,410
up or I could even totally remove like
that most of this actually hear that

748
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:27,420
that most of this actually hear that
 

749
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:34,550
that most of this actually hear that
that that that's all that make it one

750
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:34,560
that that that's all that make it one
 

751
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,460
that that that's all that make it one
wide only and it all I'd have to do then

752
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,470
wide only and it all I'd have to do then
 

753
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,780
wide only and it all I'd have to do then
is power the droppers from below and

754
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:40,790
is power the droppers from below and
 

755
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,900
is power the droppers from below and
these blocks from below like I can do

756
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:44,910
these blocks from below like I can do
 

757
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,290
these blocks from below like I can do
this like if we put blocks in there

758
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:48,300
this like if we put blocks in there
 

759
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,490
this like if we put blocks in there
they'll make it all the way up to the

760
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:49,500
they'll make it all the way up to the
 

761
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,230
they'll make it all the way up to the
chest if I just have a redstone torch

762
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,240
chest if I just have a redstone torch
 

763
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,720
chest if I just have a redstone torch
below it so it'd be something like this

764
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:55,730
below it so it'd be something like this
 

765
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,550
below it so it'd be something like this
got it up one to the next dropper there

766
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:58,560
got it up one to the next dropper there
 

767
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:06,820
got it up one to the next dropper there
do it again it goes up into the chest

768
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:06,830

 

769
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,130

anyway that's the concept behind it all

770
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,140
anyway that's the concept behind it all
 

771
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,380
anyway that's the concept behind it all
let's stop talking now and get to

772
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,390
let's stop talking now and get to
 

773
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,150
let's stop talking now and get to
building because we're running very low

774
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,160
building because we're running very low
 

775
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,620
building because we're running very low
on time let's try to get at least

776
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:15,630
on time let's try to get at least
 

777
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,580
on time let's try to get at least
something done

778
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:16,590
something done
 

779
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:21,650
something done
I've decided instead of aligning it like

780
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:21,660
I've decided instead of aligning it like
 

781
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,840
I've decided instead of aligning it like
making this main entrance I'm going to

782
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:23,850
making this main entrance I'm going to
 

783
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,830
making this main entrance I'm going to
make over here the main entrance and lay

784
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
make over here the main entrance and lay
 

785
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,450
make over here the main entrance and lay
it out this way we also don't need it

786
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:32,460
it out this way we also don't need it
 

787
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,920
it out this way we also don't need it
quite as wide anymore because we

788
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:33,930
quite as wide anymore because we
 

789
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,740
quite as wide anymore because we
optimized the redstone there so let's

790
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:36,750
optimized the redstone there so let's
 

791
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,370
optimized the redstone there so let's
just pick a center say around here is

792
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:42,380
just pick a center say around here is
 

793

just pick a center say around here is
our center I got a layout planned I want

794
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:45,630
our center I got a layout planned I want
 

795
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,980
our center I got a layout planned I want
to have if you were to make this brewing

796
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:48,990
to have if you were to make this brewing
 

797
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,910
to have if you were to make this brewing
thing you own

798
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:49,920
thing you own
 

799
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,810
thing you own
you really need one snake that has five

800
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:53,820
you really need one snake that has five
 

801
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,840
you really need one snake that has five
brewing stands in it because the longest

802
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:56,850
brewing stands in it because the longest
 

803
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,400
brewing stands in it because the longest
brewing recipe you're going to make is

804
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,410
brewing recipe you're going to make is
 

805
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,760
brewing recipe you're going to make is
going to be about five steps to it and

806
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:03,770
going to be about five steps to it and
 

807
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,080
going to be about five steps to it and
then you just got to shuffle around the

808
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,090
then you just got to shuffle around the
 

809
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,720
then you just got to shuffle around the
ingredients in the in the brewing stands

810
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:08,730
ingredients in the in the brewing stands
 

811
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,040
ingredients in the in the brewing stands
and you know move the potions out into

812
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,050
and you know move the potions out into
 

813
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,380
and you know move the potions out into
storage every time you switch to a

814
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,390
storage every time you switch to a
 

815
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,580
storage every time you switch to a
different type of potion you're brewing

816
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:18,590
different type of potion you're brewing
 

817
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,040
different type of potion you're brewing

I'm going to setup like 10 different

820
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,470
I'm going to setup like 10 different
 

821
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,570
I'm going to setup like 10 different
snakes and have every single potion

822
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:28,580
snakes and have every single potion
 

823
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,540
snakes and have every single potion
possible to make all the time and and

824

possible to make all the time and and
 

825
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,090
possible to make all the time and and
have a chest for each of them so I'm

826
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,100
have a chest for each of them so I'm
 

827
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,810
have a chest for each of them so I'm
going overkill with this that's the

828
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:38,820
going overkill with this that's the
 

829
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,140
going overkill with this that's the
center I want a five five wide walkway

830
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,150
center I want a five five wide walkway
 

831
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,760
center I want a five five wide walkway
here in the middle and we'll have one

832
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:46,770
here in the middle and we'll have one
 

833
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,560
here in the middle and we'll have one
block here for skin and then the

834
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:48,570
block here for skin and then the
 

835
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:54,080
block here for skin and then the
redstone will go here okay let's let's

836
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,090
redstone will go here okay let's let's
 

837
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,060
redstone will go here okay let's let's
just pick an arbitrary starting location

838
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,070
just pick an arbitrary starting location
 

839
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,860
just pick an arbitrary starting location
how about there does that work yeah oh

840
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:03,870
how about there does that work yeah oh
 

841
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,470
how about there does that work yeah oh
wait no no no we need the hoppers and

842
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
wait no no no we need the hoppers and
 

843
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:15,110
wait no no no we need the hoppers and
stuff okay so let's see start starting

844
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
stuff okay so let's see start starting
 

845
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,490
stuff okay so let's see start starting
it is the hard part once you got the

846
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:16,500
it is the hard part once you got the
 

847
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,920
it is the hard part once you got the
pattern going it's easy so in the middle

848
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:20,930
pattern going it's easy so in the middle
 

849
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,430
pattern going it's easy so in the middle
we're going to have four sets of four

850
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
we're going to have four sets of four
 

851
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,990
we're going to have four sets of four
stage snakes it's going to look pretty

852
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
stage snakes it's going to look pretty
 

853
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,900
stage snakes it's going to look pretty
good though I think all right get our

854
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:35,910
good though I think all right get our
 

855
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,990
good though I think all right get our
pattern doing so we'll have one pattern

856
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,000
pattern doing so we'll have one pattern
 

857
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,500
pattern doing so we'll have one pattern
here and then another one going here all

858
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:45,510
here and then another one going here all
 

859
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,570
here and then another one going here all
right and then we'll have one block for

860
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:50,580
right and then we'll have one block for
 

861
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,400
right and then we'll have one block for
redstone and then another set go in here

862
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,410
redstone and then another set go in here
 

863
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,490
redstone and then another set go in here
and we'll have a skin on this side and a

864
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:58,500
and we'll have a skin on this side and a
 

865
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,650
and we'll have a skin on this side and a
skin on this side so you won't be able

866
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:00,660
skin on this side so you won't be able
 

867
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,830
skin on this side so you won't be able
to see any of the guts to it really

868
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840
to see any of the guts to it really
 

869
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,800
to see any of the guts to it really
just an outside appearance anyway that

870
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:08,810
just an outside appearance anyway that
 

871
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,650
just an outside appearance anyway that
is the main concept behind my brewing

872
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:11,660
is the main concept behind my brewing
 

873
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,780
is the main concept behind my brewing
setup here

874
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:12,790
setup here
 

875
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,790
setup here
let's actually get to some building here

876
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:15,800
let's actually get to some building here
 

877
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,920
let's actually get to some building here
before we run out of time today try to

878
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:17,930
before we run out of time today try to
 

879
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,680
before we run out of time today try to
get a little bit done anyway so with my

880
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:20,690
get a little bit done anyway so with my
 

881
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,880
get a little bit done anyway so with my
room I kind of have a layout planned out

882
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:23,890
room I kind of have a layout planned out
 

883
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,310
room I kind of have a layout planned out
maybe as I build I'll explain some of

884
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:27,320
maybe as I build I'll explain some of
 

885
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,420
maybe as I build I'll explain some of
this so with my setup with ethos lab

886
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,430
this so with my setup with ethos lab
 

887
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,180
this so with my setup with ethos lab
here I'm aiming to make about 10

888
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,190
here I'm aiming to make about 10
 

889
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,290
here I'm aiming to make about 10
different of these brewing stand snake

890
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:38,300
different of these brewing stand snake
 

891
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,170
different of these brewing stand snake
things like some of them will have four

892
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:41,180
things like some of them will have four
 

893
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,270
things like some of them will have four
stages some like five I'm going to have

the game if you guys were to build this
 

905
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,310
the game if you guys were to build this
so you don't really want well you might

906
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,320
so you don't really want well you might
 

907
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,750
so you don't really want well you might
want to do that you don't really need to

extended invisibility potion will take

920
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:27,260
extended invisibility potion will take
 

921
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:34,270
extended invisibility potion will take
five stages to make uhm so all you would

922
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,280
five stages to make uhm so all you would
 

923
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,860
five stages to make uhm so all you would
have to do then is a shuffle the

924
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:35,870
have to do then is a shuffle the
 

925
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,660
have to do then is a shuffle the
ingredients around in your brewing stand

926
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:37,670
ingredients around in your brewing stand
 

927
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,970
ingredients around in your brewing stand
and empty out the chests if you want to

928
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:39,980
and empty out the chests if you want to
 

929
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,190
and empty out the chests if you want to
switch to a different type of potion but

930
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,200
switch to a different type of potion but
 

931
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,910
switch to a different type of potion but
what I'm doing is just making it so I

932
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:45,920
what I'm doing is just making it so I
 

933
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,530
what I'm doing is just making it so I
don't ever have to empty the chests or

934
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:47,540
don't ever have to empty the chests or
 

935
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,990
don't ever have to empty the chests or
change the the brewing ingredients I'm

936
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
change the the brewing ingredients I'm
 

937
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,040
change the the brewing ingredients I'm
taking this super duper lazy way to do

938
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,050
taking this super duper lazy way to do
 

939
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:57,400
taking this super duper lazy way to do
in this but downside is I have to make

940
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,410
in this but downside is I have to make
 

941
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,250
in this but downside is I have to make
this big elaborate room for it all which

942
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:00,260
this big elaborate room for it all which
 

943
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,250
this big elaborate room for it all which
I enjoy doing so I don't mind doing it

944
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,260
I enjoy doing so I don't mind doing it
 

945
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,160
I enjoy doing so I don't mind doing it
this way but I'm going to get a bit done

946
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,170
this way but I'm going to get a bit done
 

947
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,960
this way but I'm going to get a bit done
here and we will continue now I tell you

948
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:10,970
here and we will continue now I tell you
 

949
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,760
here and we will continue now I tell you
the two things I go through the quickest

950
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:12,770
the two things I go through the quickest
 

951
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,270
the two things I go through the quickest
in this game are iron and redstone

952
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:16,280
in this game are iron and redstone
 

953
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,170
in this game are iron and redstone
I just cannot get enough of it I wonder

954
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,180
I just cannot get enough of it I wonder
 

955
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,780
I just cannot get enough of it I wonder
why it's because I do stupid stuff like

956
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:22,790
why it's because I do stupid stuff like
 

957
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,730
why it's because I do stupid stuff like
this all the time okay so I was messing

958
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:27,740
this all the time okay so I was messing
 

959
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,320
this all the time okay so I was messing
around with the wiring below we could do

960
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,330
around with the wiring below we could do
 

961
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,120
around with the wiring below we could do
something like this this will work I

962
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,130
something like this this will work I
 

963
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,730
something like this this will work I
might be able to get rid of some of

964
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:33,740
might be able to get rid of some of
 

965
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,320
might be able to get rid of some of
these repeaters and make it a little

966
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,330
these repeaters and make it a little
 

967
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:41,290
these repeaters and make it a little
cheaper but we can control all this from

968
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:41,300
cheaper but we can control all this from
 

969
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,970
cheaper but we can control all this from
below which means we can keep it super

970
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:42,980
below which means we can keep it super
 

971
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,970
below which means we can keep it super
thin like this if we want and my plan

972
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:45,980
thin like this if we want and my plan
 

973
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,980
thin like this if we want and my plan
with this room is we're going to have

974
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:47,990
with this room is we're going to have
 

975
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,840
with this room is we're going to have
about 10 of these snake things so we got

976
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:49,850
about 10 of these snake things so we got
 

977
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,550
about 10 of these snake things so we got
four of them made here this one is

978
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:54,560
four of them made here this one is
 

979
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,440
four of them made here this one is
probably going to be for regeneration

980
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,450
probably going to be for regeneration
 

981
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,920
probably going to be for regeneration
potions this one for instant health this

982
00:26:59,920 --> 00:26:59,930
potions this one for instant health this
 

983
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,570
potions this one for instant health this
one for strength this one for fire

984
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:04,580
one for strength this one for fire
 

985
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,700
one for strength this one for fire
resist and then we need to set up about

986
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:06,710
resist and then we need to set up about
 

987
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,770
resist and then we need to set up about
six more of these throughout this room

988
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:08,780
six more of these throughout this room
 

989
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,480
six more of these throughout this room
so maybe like against a wall here or

990
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,490
so maybe like against a wall here or
 

991
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,670
so maybe like against a wall here or
there or you know we got plenty of

992
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:15,680
there or you know we got plenty of
 

993
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,610
there or you know we got plenty of
options still I'm going to try not to

994
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:18,620
options still I'm going to try not to
 

995
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,250
options still I'm going to try not to
make it a perfectly a square or

996
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:21,260
make it a perfectly a square or
 

997
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,250
make it a perfectly a square or
rectangle room if I can help it maybe

998
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:24,260
rectangle room if I can help it maybe
 

999
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,180
rectangle room if I can help it maybe
add some decoration and stuff to it but

1000
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,190
add some decoration and stuff to it but
 

1001
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,650
add some decoration and stuff to it but
for right now let's focus on the center

1002
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:29,660
for right now let's focus on the center
 

1003
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,780
for right now let's focus on the center
of the room I want to have a five block

1004
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:31,790
of the room I want to have a five block
 

1005
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,230
of the room I want to have a five block
wide path here so that's why I

1006
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
wide path here so that's why I
 

1007
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,540
wide path here so that's why I
positioned it like this and at least I

1008
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:37,550
positioned it like this and at least I
 

1009
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,670
positioned it like this and at least I
want all my paths in this room at least

1010
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:39,680
want all my paths in this room at least
 

1011
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,140
want all my paths in this room at least
five blocks wide so we have seven blocks

1012
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,150
five blocks wide so we have seven blocks
 

1013
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,990
five blocks wide so we have seven blocks
here I left one block for each side here

1014
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,000
here I left one block for each side here
 

1015
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,900
here I left one block for each side here
so we can add a skin to it and cover

1016
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:49,910
so we can add a skin to it and cover
 

1017
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,750
so we can add a skin to it and cover
over most of this stuff so we can't see

1018
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:52,760
over most of this stuff so we can't see
 

1019
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,660
over most of this stuff so we can't see
it and I'm going to try use quartz to do

1020
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:55,670
it and I'm going to try use quartz to do
 

1021
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,780
it and I'm going to try use quartz to do
it so like we could do this

1022
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:57,790
it so like we could do this
 

1023
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:04,210
it so like we could do this
it's blocks of the things here I want to

1024
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,220
it's blocks of the things here I want to
 

1025
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,760
it's blocks of the things here I want to
see I want to be able to see the brewing

1026
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:06,770
see I want to be able to see the brewing
 

1027
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,380
see I want to be able to see the brewing
stand for sure and the chess if we could

1028
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,390
stand for sure and the chess if we could
 

1029
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,310
stand for sure and the chess if we could
see the chess

1030
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
see the chess
 

1031
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,130
see the chess
somewhat that would be awesome and be

1032
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,140
somewhat that would be awesome and be
 

1033
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:22,410
somewhat that would be awesome and be
able to access them from over here let's

1034
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,420
able to access them from over here let's
 

1035
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,280
able to access them from over here let's
another stair there okay we can still

1036
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,290
another stair there okay we can still
 

1037
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,380
another stair there okay we can still
see this chest we don't really need this

1038
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,390
see this chest we don't really need this
 

1039
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,000
see this chest we don't really need this
chest

1040
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,010
chest
 

1041
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,730
chest
much as these ones either this won't run

1042
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:32,740
much as these ones either this won't run
 

1043
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,140
much as these ones either this won't run
out too often that's for the ingredients

1044
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,150
out too often that's for the ingredients
 

1045
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:52,310
out too often that's for the ingredients
let's let's do this okay and 10 we huh

1046
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320

 

1047
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,150

it's kind of cool

1048
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,160

 

1049
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,150

yeah I kind of like that sure I do it

1050
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,160
yeah I kind of like that sure I do it
 

1051
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,480
yeah I kind of like that sure I do it
over here too I ran out of quarts quick

1052
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,490
over here too I ran out of quarts quick
 

1053
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:14,910
over here too I ran out of quarts quick
- yeah yes guess why that is ok ok what

1054
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:14,920
- yeah yes guess why that is ok ok what
 

1055
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,080
- yeah yes guess why that is ok ok what
do you what do you guys think of that

1056
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,090
do you what do you guys think of that
 

1057
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:22,830
do you what do you guys think of that
that's pretty cool I think all right so

1058
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:22,840
that's pretty cool I think all right so
 

1059
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,630
that's pretty cool I think all right so
maybe we'll do something like that and

1060
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
maybe we'll do something like that and
 

1061
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,060
maybe we'll do something like that and
then I want to have a stripe of like

1062
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,070
then I want to have a stripe of like
 

1063
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,850
then I want to have a stripe of like
roller or something something colorful

1064
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:32,860
roller or something something colorful
 

1065
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,390
roller or something something colorful
over here and and here and then the

1066
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:36,400
over here and and here and then the
 

1067
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,430
over here and and here and then the
three blocks wide to something else in

1068
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:38,440
three blocks wide to something else in
 

1069
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,300
three blocks wide to something else in
the very middle give it a real lab look

1070
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,310
the very middle give it a real lab look
 

1071
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:54,620
the very middle give it a real lab look
you know let's change this oh yeah cool

1072
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:54,630

 

1073
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,820

so here's an idea of what it's going to

1074
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:56,830
so here's an idea of what it's going to
 

1075
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,660
so here's an idea of what it's going to
look like when it is done pretty

1076
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:00,670
look like when it is done pretty
 

1077
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,820
look like when it is done pretty
presentable I would say we didn't even

1078
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:02,830
presentable I would say we didn't even
 

1079
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,010
presentable I would say we didn't even
put a block behind the brewing stand I

1080
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,020
put a block behind the brewing stand I
 

1081
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,500
put a block behind the brewing stand I
tried quartz maybe we'll put glowstone

1082
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:07,510
tried quartz maybe we'll put glowstone
 

1083
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,080
tried quartz maybe we'll put glowstone
or something the court stands out a bit

1084
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,090
or something the court stands out a bit
 

1085
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,410
or something the court stands out a bit
much a lot of stuff though like we can't

1086
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:13,420
much a lot of stuff though like we can't
 

1087
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,810
much a lot of stuff though like we can't
put a block there or or there or

1088
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:15,820
put a block there or or there or
 

1089
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,340
put a block there or or there or
anything that has to be there for the

1090
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:17,350
anything that has to be there for the
 

1091
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:22,860
anything that has to be there for the
mechanics yeah I think it looks good so

1092
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:22,870
mechanics yeah I think it looks good so
 

1093
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,410
mechanics yeah I think it looks good so
then the other side starts right there

1094
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:25,420
then the other side starts right there
 

1095
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,380
then the other side starts right there
so hardly anything in between the two

1096
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,390
so hardly anything in between the two
 

1097
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,040
so hardly anything in between the two
which is awesome I'm going to control

1098
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,050
which is awesome I'm going to control
 

1099
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:38,619
which is awesome I'm going to control
all this with one one o'clock I think

1100
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:38,629

 

1101
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,659

and I'm gonna have an on/off switch for

1102
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:41,669
and I'm gonna have an on/off switch for
 

1103
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:43,820
and I'm gonna have an on/off switch for
two so I I don't want this all running

1104
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:43,830
two so I I don't want this all running
 

1105
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,359
two so I I don't want this all running
all the time that would be crazy just
