uh they only produce the mossy stone
 

105
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,550
uh they only produce the mossy stone
bricks if they're facing

106
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560

 

107
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,030

i forgot already i think it was north

108
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
i forgot already i think it was north
 

109
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,190
i forgot already i think it was north
so that's regular

110
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200

 

111
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,350

did we get one yeah we got one there

112
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
did we get one yeah we got one there
 

113
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,470
did we get one yeah we got one there
cool so that's facing

114
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
cool so that's facing
 

115
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,990
cool so that's facing
that's east if we go by real world

116
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
that's east if we go by real world
 

117
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,229

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,509
oh i'm really bad at this game east west
then that would be

122
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
then that would be
 

123
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,990
then that would be
north so if the stairs facing north you

124
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
north so if the stairs facing north you
 

125
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,309
north so if the stairs facing north you
get mossy

126
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
get mossy
 

127
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,229

yeah i still do like sandstone though a

176
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
yeah i still do like sandstone though a
 

177
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,390
yeah i still do like sandstone though a
lot i

178
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
lot i
 

179
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,710
lot i
i find it works better for dark areas

180
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
i find it works better for dark areas
 

181
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,909
i find it works better for dark areas
like if you're building something

182
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
like if you're building something
 

183
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,870
like if you're building something
underground

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
underground
 

185
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,749
underground
because it's a block with a high

186
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
because it's a block with a high
 

187
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,749
because it's a block with a high
luminance

188
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
luminance
 

189
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,990
luminance
and it's a plain texture so it seems to

190
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
and it's a plain texture so it seems to
 

191
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,110
and it's a plain texture so it seems to
make it brighter than

make it brighter than
 

193
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,430
make it brighter than
actually is if you're in a dark area

194
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
actually is if you're in a dark area
 

195
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,390
actually is if you're in a dark area
while these are

196
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
while these are
 

197
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,469
while these are
gray ish so they don't do that as well

198
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
gray ish so they don't do that as well
 

199
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,469
gray ish so they don't do that as well
but they sure do look good when they're

200
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
but they sure do look good when they're
 

201
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,950
but they sure do look good when they're
in the light

202
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
in the light
 

203
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,469
in the light
and from a distance they look really

204
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
and from a distance they look really
 

205
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,310
and from a distance they look really
good too i imagine

206
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
good too i imagine
 

207
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,230
good too i imagine
because uh it's a large

208
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
because uh it's a large
 

209
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,550
because uh it's a large
texture unlike cobblestone

210
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
texture unlike cobblestone
 

211
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,550
texture unlike cobblestone
which is a small repeating pattern type

212
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
which is a small repeating pattern type
 

213
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,990
which is a small repeating pattern type
thing while this is a large

214
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
thing while this is a large
 

215
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,670
thing while this is a large
repeating pattern so it looks better

216
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
repeating pattern so it looks better
 

217
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,110
repeating pattern so it looks better
from farther away

218
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
from farther away
 

219
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,550
from farther away
i'm assuming and they actually blend

220
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
i'm assuming and they actually blend
 

221
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,189
i'm assuming and they actually blend
together

222
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
together
 

223
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,469
together
well that's good if you have like a

224
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
well that's good if you have like a
 

225
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,150
well that's good if you have like a
cracked one next to it

226
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160

 

227
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,590

cool okay uh moving on

228
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
cool okay uh moving on
 

229
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,230
cool okay uh moving on
we also have the new glass panes i

230
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
we also have the new glass panes i
 

231
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,430
we also have the new glass panes i
believe you make them like this

232
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
believe you make them like this
 

233
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,950
believe you make them like this
oh and you get 16 cool

234
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960

 

235
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,230

that is very good so what i want to try

236
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
that is very good so what i want to try
 

237
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,790
that is very good so what i want to try
out

238
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
out
 

239
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,629
out
today you know like how every patch

240
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
today you know like how every patch
 

241
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,230
today you know like how every patch
seems to mess up each road

242
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
seems to mess up each road
 

243
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,990
seems to mess up each road
oh this is like the first patch in a

244
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
oh this is like the first patch in a
 

245
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,189
oh this is like the first patch in a
long time that i think is gonna

246
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
long time that i think is gonna
 

247
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,270
long time that i think is gonna
really help it out so i'm gonna set up a

248
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
really help it out so i'm gonna set up a
 

249
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,510
really help it out so i'm gonna set up a
small eats road here

250
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
small eats road here
 

251
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,550
small eats road here
using the new glass panes and see

252
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
using the new glass panes and see
 

253
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,070
using the new glass panes and see
if they work how i think they'll work

254
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080

 

255
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,230

yeah so what we're gonna do i made some

256
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
yeah so what we're gonna do i made some
 

257
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,350
yeah so what we're gonna do i made some
water buckets here

258
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
water buckets here
 

259
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,510
water buckets here
we're just gonna set up a very small

260
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
we're just gonna set up a very small
 

261
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,189
we're just gonna set up a very small
eats road

262
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
eats road
 

263
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,469
eats road
test over here if it goes well i will

264
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
test over here if it goes well i will
 

265
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,270
test over here if it goes well i will
probably use

266
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
probably use
 

267
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,790
probably use
eats roads a lot in my new

268
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
eats roads a lot in my new
 

269
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,150
eats roads a lot in my new
base that i'm making

270
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160

 

271
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,350

and i want to try these glass panes out

272
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
and i want to try these glass panes out
 

273
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,070
and i want to try these glass panes out
because they have a unique property they

274
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
because they have a unique property they
 

275
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,870
because they have a unique property they
are very thin and they

276
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
are very thin and they
 

277
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,749
are very thin and they
fill in like the middle of a block

278
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
fill in like the middle of a block
 

279
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,790
fill in like the middle of a block
so if i place them like

280
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
so if i place them like
 

281
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,070
so if i place them like
like this

282
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080

 

283
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,990

boats are between one and a half and two

284
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
boats are between one and a half and two
 

285
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,350
boats are between one and a half and two
blocks in size

286
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
blocks in size
 

287
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,629
blocks in size
so this is probably

288
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
so this is probably
 

289
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,430
so this is probably
about two blocks wide here the space

290
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
about two blocks wide here the space
 

291
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,670
about two blocks wide here the space
between these two panes

292
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
between these two panes
 

293
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,390
between these two panes
so really a boat should fit between here

294
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
so really a boat should fit between here
 

295
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,830
so really a boat should fit between here
and it's only one two

296
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
and it's only one two
 

297
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,029
and it's only one two
three four five blocks this way for two

298
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
three four five blocks this way for two
 

299
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,870
three four five blocks this way for two
lanes

300
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
lanes
 

301
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,469
lanes
so it's smaller than the ones i usually

302
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
so it's smaller than the ones i usually
 

303
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,870
so it's smaller than the ones i usually
make and it will be enclosed still

304
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
make and it will be enclosed still
 

305
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,629
make and it will be enclosed still
that's really good so let's let's extend

306
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
that's really good so let's let's extend
 

307
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,390
that's really good so let's let's extend
this

308
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400

 

309
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,670

won't get too crazy i don't want to

310
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
won't get too crazy i don't want to
 

311
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,350
won't get too crazy i don't want to
waste all my supplies here

312
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
waste all my supplies here
 

313
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,070
waste all my supplies here
oops stack them on top of each other oh

314
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
oops stack them on top of each other oh
 

315
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,670
oops stack them on top of each other oh
what you get them back

316
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680

 

317
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,909

okay that's awesome i did not know that

318
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
okay that's awesome i did not know that
 

319
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,270
okay that's awesome i did not know that
all right well i don't feel bad doing

320
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
all right well i don't feel bad doing
 

321
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,150
all right well i don't feel bad doing
this now

322
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160

 

323
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,390

i wonder why you get them back doesn't

324
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
i wonder why you get them back doesn't
 

325
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,070
i wonder why you get them back doesn't
make much sense

326
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080

 

327
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,869

okay so you do that i'll make some

328
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
okay so you do that i'll make some
 

329
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,790
okay so you do that i'll make some
wooden pressure plates to hold the water

330
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800

 

331
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,990

actually that's another thing i wanted

332
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
actually that's another thing i wanted
 

333
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,830
actually that's another thing i wanted
to check do vines

334
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
to check do vines
 

335
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,070
to check do vines
hold water in place

336
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080

 

337
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,430

nope they don't water destroys them

338
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
nope they don't water destroys them
 

339
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,830
nope they don't water destroys them
but doesn't harvest them

340
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840

 

341
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,990

let's try to get to bed before the

342
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
let's try to get to bed before the
 

343
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,350
let's try to get to bed before the
monsters come out

344
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360

 

345
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,990

actually i should see if these give you

346
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
actually i should see if these give you
 

347
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,230
actually i should see if these give you
what these give you

348
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
what these give you
 

349
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,910
what these give you
oh they give you the whatever they are

350
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920

 

351
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,910

the wiki said silverfish will hide in

352
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
the wiki said silverfish will hide in
 

353
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,829
the wiki said silverfish will hide in
them if they sit for a while

354
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
them if they sit for a while
 

355
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,710
them if they sit for a while
i think even if their player placed but

356
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
i think even if their player placed but
 

357
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,310
i think even if their player placed but
to correct me if i'm wrong on that

358
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
to correct me if i'm wrong on that
 

359
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,269
to correct me if i'm wrong on that
because i would like to know

360
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279

 

361
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,030

and stone blocks look pretty good with

362
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
and stone blocks look pretty good with
 

363
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,430
and stone blocks look pretty good with
them too so they're very

364
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
them too so they're very
 

365
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,910
them too so they're very
very versatile these are the blocks i'm

366
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
very versatile these are the blocks i'm
 

367
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,350
very versatile these are the blocks i'm
planning on building

368
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
planning on building
 

369
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,550
planning on building
the new base with

370
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
the new base with
 

371
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,509
the new base with
the main blocks and also grass water

372
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
the main blocks and also grass water
 

373
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,269
the main blocks and also grass water
stuff like that

374
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
stuff like that
 

375
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,350
stuff like that
but these five are the main ingredient

376
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
but these five are the main ingredient
 

377
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,430
but these five are the main ingredient
come on come on come on

378
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440

 

379
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,310

yeah we made it some people were

380
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
yeah we made it some people were
 

381
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,070
yeah we made it some people were
wondering why monsters weren't attacking

382
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
wondering why monsters weren't attacking
 

383
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,230
wondering why monsters weren't attacking
me there when i sleep in my bed if you

384
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
me there when i sleep in my bed if you
 

385
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,829
me there when i sleep in my bed if you
do it

386
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
do it
 

387
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,030
do it
while it's still getting dark monsters

388
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
while it's still getting dark monsters
 

389
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,710
while it's still getting dark monsters
won't be spawning yet

390
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
won't be spawning yet
 

391
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,310
won't be spawning yet
and they seem to only attack you if

392
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
and they seem to only attack you if
 

393
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,150
and they seem to only attack you if
they're within

394
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
they're within
 

395
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,750
they're within
the area when you go to sleep

396
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
the area when you go to sleep
 

397
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,990
the area when you go to sleep
otherwise they won't attack you

398
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000

 

399
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,550

okay so where are we at here yeah we

400
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
okay so where are we at here yeah we
 

401
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,870
okay so where are we at here yeah we
gotta place water in here

402
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
gotta place water in here
 

403
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,389
gotta place water in here
put pressure plates to hold it

404
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
put pressure plates to hold it
 

405
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,990
put pressure plates to hold it
now we'll put it here water

406
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000

 

407
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,110

three blocks water

408
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120

 

409
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,230

and one more here and maybe we'll end it

410
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
and one more here and maybe we'll end it
 

411
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,430
and one more here and maybe we'll end it
there we'll just have a small loop

412
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440

 

413
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,829

okay and do the same on the other side

414
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839

 

415
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,710

missed maybe i'll have a cut here to

416
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
missed maybe i'll have a cut here to
 

417
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,110
missed maybe i'll have a cut here to
speed this up

418
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120

 

419
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,470

i got it set up for our first test

420
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
i got it set up for our first test
 

421
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,150
i got it set up for our first test
so i just had to use whatever blocks i

422
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
so i just had to use whatever blocks i
 

423
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,630
so i just had to use whatever blocks i
had around here i've used sand on top

424
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
had around here i've used sand on top
 

425
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,590
had around here i've used sand on top
these will replace using ladders having

426
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
these will replace using ladders having
 

427
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,790
these will replace using ladders having
full blocks above

428
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
full blocks above
 

429
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,069
full blocks above
glass panes because

430
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
glass panes because
 

431
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,350
glass panes because
you have that air space between so this

432
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
you have that air space between so this
 

433
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,470
you have that air space between so this
space here holds the boat down still i

434
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
space here holds the boat down still i
 

435
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,949
space here holds the boat down still i
hope

436
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
hope
 

437
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,910
hope
we'll see this is the first test let's

438
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
we'll see this is the first test let's
 

439
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,590
we'll see this is the first test let's
try it out

440
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600

 

441
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,870

very nice very very nice

442
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880

 

443
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,069

that is what i wanted to see

444
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
that is what i wanted to see
 

445
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,550
that is what i wanted to see
now i want to try to do it with me

446
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
now i want to try to do it with me
 

447
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,310
now i want to try to do it with me
riding it and see if

448
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
riding it and see if
 

449
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,670
riding it and see if
these blocks will suffocate me

450
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
these blocks will suffocate me
 

451
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,550
these blocks will suffocate me
if they're sticking out far enough

452
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
if they're sticking out far enough
 

453
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,710
if they're sticking out far enough
i don't know these easy loaders though i

454
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
i don't know these easy loaders though i
 

455
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,670
i don't know these easy loaders though i
don't think they're working anymore

456
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
don't think they're working anymore
 

457
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,509
don't think they're working anymore
oh i missed it

458
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519

 

459
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,110

yeah it breaks um

460
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
yeah it breaks um
 

461
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,550
yeah it breaks um
i don't know why it's doing that i think

462
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
i don't know why it's doing that i think
 

463
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,949
i don't know why it's doing that i think
one of the patches change things again

464
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959

 

465
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:54,710

what i'll do maybe try set up a door

466
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720

 

467
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,190

let's do it over here

468
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200

 

469
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,870

don't have a lot of space to work with

470
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
don't have a lot of space to work with
 

471
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,870
don't have a lot of space to work with
uh no we want the door to open the other

472
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
uh no we want the door to open the other
 

473
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,790
uh no we want the door to open the other
way towards the boat

474
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
way towards the boat
 

475
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,949
way towards the boat
where's my door

476
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959

 

477
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,870

so this way

478
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880

 

479
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,710

opens towards the boat now

480
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720

 

481
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,269

and that should stop it

482
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279

 

483
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,310

so if i try to enter the boat loading it

484
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
so if i try to enter the boat loading it
 

485
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,150
so if i try to enter the boat loading it
with the easy loader it will

486
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
with the easy loader it will
 

487
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,509
with the easy loader it will
break but if i align it with a door

488
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
break but if i align it with a door
 

489
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,629
break but if i align it with a door
i believe it will work

490
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
i believe it will work
 

491
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,310
i believe it will work
oops

492
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320

 

493
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,740

dang it

494
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:44,750
dang it
 

495
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,790
dang it
[Applause]

496
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800

 

497
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:58,069

getting dark again

498
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079

 

499
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:07,670

i thought i just slept

500
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
i thought i just slept
 

501
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,870
i thought i just slept
here we go again okay

502
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
here we go again okay
 

503
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:20,230
here we go again okay
out of boots

504
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
out of boots
 

505
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,910
out of boots
would be really good if i could get this

506
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
would be really good if i could get this
 

507
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,710
would be really good if i could get this
working

508
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720

 

509
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,069

i want to do it while i'm in the boat um

510
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
i want to do it while i'm in the boat um
 

511
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,710
i want to do it while i'm in the boat um
uh we can make a lever

512
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
uh we can make a lever
 

513
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,430
uh we can make a lever
just for testing

514
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440

 

515
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,470

i believe yeah right here

516
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
i believe yeah right here
 

517
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,990
i believe yeah right here
good it didn't break oh we took some

518
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
good it didn't break oh we took some
 

519
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,389
good it didn't break oh we took some
damage there

520
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
damage there
 

521
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,110
damage there
but we were able to ride it that's cool

522
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120

 

523
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,310

so after that

524
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
so after that
 

525
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,750
so after that
this is what i think is going to look

526
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
this is what i think is going to look
 

527
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,829
this is what i think is going to look
really good if we replace all this

528
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
really good if we replace all this
 

529
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,110
really good if we replace all this
with the glass

530
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120

 

531
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:23,030

and then it's all glass throat

532
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040

 

533
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,069

that's pretty cool so that's like my

534
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
that's pretty cool so that's like my
 

535
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,189
that's pretty cool so that's like my
new eats road design and i'll probably

536
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
new eats road design and i'll probably
 

537
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,069
new eats road design and i'll probably
use it a fair bit

538
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
use it a fair bit
 

539
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,350
use it a fair bit
in this world

540
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360

 

541
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,269

because it's a lot more compact than it

542
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
because it's a lot more compact than it
 

543
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,150
because it's a lot more compact than it
used to be and i think it looks

544
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
used to be and i think it looks
 

545
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,350
used to be and i think it looks
pretty good

546
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360

 

547
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,189

all right cool um if we break glass

548
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
all right cool um if we break glass
 

549
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,069
all right cool um if we break glass
blocks now

550
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
blocks now
 

551
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,269
blocks now
i'm assuming we don't get them back yeah

552
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
i'm assuming we don't get them back yeah
 

553
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:51,990
i'm assuming we don't get them back yeah
we still don't

554
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
we still don't
 

555
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,990
we still don't
darn okay

556
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
darn okay
 

557
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,069
darn okay
um moving on let's do something else

558
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
um moving on let's do something else
 

559
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,590
um moving on let's do something else
actually there's one more really quick

560
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
actually there's one more really quick
 

561
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,590
actually there's one more really quick
thing i want to try out here uh so i

562
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
thing i want to try out here uh so i
 

563
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,189
thing i want to try out here uh so i
want to see

564
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
want to see
 

565
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,829
want to see
if we have the blocks above the middle

566
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839
if we have the blocks above the middle
 

567
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,389
if we have the blocks above the middle
divider here instead of on the outside

568
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
divider here instead of on the outside
 

569
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,350
divider here instead of on the outside
if that will work uh it would be cool if

570
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
if that will work uh it would be cool if
 

571
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,750
if that will work uh it would be cool if
it did because then you would have

572
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
it did because then you would have
 

573
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,509
it did because then you would have
it more open on the sides and you'd be

574
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
it more open on the sides and you'd be
 

575
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,030
it more open on the sides and you'd be
able to see

576
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
able to see
 

577
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,590
able to see
your scenery in that a lot better if you

578
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
your scenery in that a lot better if you
 

579
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,389
your scenery in that a lot better if you
don't have the blocks in your face

580
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
don't have the blocks in your face
 

581
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,389
don't have the blocks in your face
let's see let's see

582
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399

 

583
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:38,550

it held it down it's being held down

584
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560

 

585
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,110

cool i still got it okay

586
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120

 

587
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,470

yeah it works cool

588
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480

 

589
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,990

so that's even better i like it i like

590
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
so that's even better i like it i like
 

591
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,629
so that's even better i like it i like
it a lot now we can do something else

592
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639

 

593
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,509

all right so we're back here this is

594
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
all right so we're back here this is
 

595
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,829
all right so we're back here this is
that location i found last episode where

596
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
that location i found last episode where
 

597
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,269
that location i found last episode where
i want to build my new

598
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
i want to build my new
 

599
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,550
i want to build my new
base i've been marking some

600
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
base i've been marking some
 

601
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,430
base i've been marking some
key locations here with sand and gravel

602
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
key locations here with sand and gravel
 

603
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,749
key locations here with sand and gravel
right now we're at the 250 250 one

604
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
right now we're at the 250 250 one
 

605
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,910
right now we're at the 250 250 one
the mob system the hostile one's going

606
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
the mob system the hostile one's going
 

607
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,990
the mob system the hostile one's going
to go directly above here this is going

608
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
to go directly above here this is going
 

609
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,509
to go directly above here this is going
to be the center point of it

610
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
to be the center point of it
 

611
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,550
to be the center point of it
this 250 by 250 and i'm going to build

612
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
this 250 by 250 and i'm going to build
 

613
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,389
this 250 by 250 and i'm going to build
i'm pretty much going to copy the last

614
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
i'm pretty much going to copy the last
 

615
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,910
i'm pretty much going to copy the last
one i made

616
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
one i made
 

617
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,509
one i made
there's going to be four towers

618
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
there's going to be four towers
 

619
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,509
there's going to be four towers
put together and there's going to be

620
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
put together and there's going to be
 

621
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,829
put together and there's going to be
four layers in each so 16 layers

622
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
four layers in each so 16 layers
 

623
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,590
four layers in each so 16 layers
total and they will

624
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600

 

625
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,870

occupy this space here from this gravel

626
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
occupy this space here from this gravel
 

627
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,590
occupy this space here from this gravel
column

628
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
column
 

629
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,910
column
to that sand there to

630
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
to that sand there to
 

631
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,389
to that sand there to
that gravel over in the back there and

632
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
that gravel over in the back there and
 

633
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,030
that gravel over in the back there and
then

634
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
then
 

635
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,150
then
to there that's how big

636
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
to there that's how big
 

637
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,309
to there that's how big
the mob floating mob

638
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319

 

639
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,750

terrible looking thing in the sky is

640
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
terrible looking thing in the sky is
 

641
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,909
terrible looking thing in the sky is
gonna be

642
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
gonna be
 

643
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,029
gonna be
uh these two by two

644
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
uh these two by two
 

645
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,870
uh these two by two
columns are where their center points

646
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
columns are where their center points
 

647
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,029
columns are where their center points
are going to be for the four different

648
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
are going to be for the four different
 

649
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,949
are going to be for the four different
uh towers and i'll have to join them

650
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
uh towers and i'll have to join them
 

651
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,590
uh towers and i'll have to join them
together somehow

652
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600

 

653
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,630

and then over there is another like

654
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
and then over there is another like
 

655
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,990
and then over there is another like
uh so

656
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
uh so
 

657
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,230
uh so
this makes a 31 by 31 square

658
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
this makes a 31 by 31 square
 

659
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,470
this makes a 31 by 31 square
that's how big the mob towers are going

660
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
that's how big the mob towers are going
 

661
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,230
that's how big the mob towers are going
to be

662
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
to be
 

663
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,590
to be
and then further over that we have

664
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
and then further over that we have
 

665
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,669
and then further over that we have
another 31 by 31 square

666
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
another 31 by 31 square
 

667
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,270
another 31 by 31 square
that is for a courtyard i want to build

668
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
that is for a courtyard i want to build
 

669
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,630
that is for a courtyard i want to build
i most likely will uh

670
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
i most likely will uh
 

671
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,510
i most likely will uh
not i have a general idea of what i want

672
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
not i have a general idea of what i want
 

673
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,350
not i have a general idea of what i want
to do but i don't know

674
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
to do but i don't know
 

675
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,150
to do but i don't know
exactly what i want to do i was thinking

676
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
exactly what i want to do i was thinking
 

677
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,870
exactly what i want to do i was thinking
of

678
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
of
 

679
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,430
of
maybe making a giant tree like doc m did

680
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
maybe making a giant tree like doc m did
 

681
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,510
maybe making a giant tree like doc m did
but i know one thing i need to keep the

682
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
but i know one thing i need to keep the
 

683
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,750
but i know one thing i need to keep the
area above these two by two columns

684
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
area above these two by two columns
 

685
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,830
area above these two by two columns
clear

686
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
clear
 

687
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,549
clear
so if i put the tree here i would want

688
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
so if i put the tree here i would want
 

689
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,029
so if i put the tree here i would want
the tree to hide the floating mob towers

690
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
the tree to hide the floating mob towers
 

691
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:15,430
the tree to hide the floating mob towers
above

692
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
above
 

693
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,789
above
i could hide it in the tree canopy

694
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
i could hide it in the tree canopy
 

695
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,150
i could hide it in the tree canopy
the giant tower

696
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160

 

697
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,150

quiet quiet

698
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160

 

699
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,270

if i did that but what i found out is i

700
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
if i did that but what i found out is i
 

701
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,549
if i did that but what i found out is i
would need to make

702
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
would need to make
 

703
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,070
would need to make
the diameter of the tree about 30 blocks

704
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
the diameter of the tree about 30 blocks
 

705
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,230
the diameter of the tree about 30 blocks
which would look a little silly i think

706
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
which would look a little silly i think
 

707
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,390
which would look a little silly i think
because if you have a tree with diameter

708
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
because if you have a tree with diameter
 

709
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,070
because if you have a tree with diameter
of 30

710
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
of 30
 

711
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,990
of 30
and a height of 64. it's only going to

712
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
and a height of 64. it's only going to
 

713
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,270
and a height of 64. it's only going to
be

714
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
be
 

715
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,150
be
twice as high as it is what wide you

716
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
twice as high as it is what wide you
 

717
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,870
twice as high as it is what wide you
know

718
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
know
 

719
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,070
know
it'll look a little strange so

720
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
it'll look a little strange so
 

721
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,549
it'll look a little strange so
uh the giant tree idea is kind of out at

722
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
uh the giant tree idea is kind of out at
 

723
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,150
uh the giant tree idea is kind of out at
the moment and

724
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
the moment and
 

725
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,830
the moment and
instead i'm thinking of just having a

726
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
instead i'm thinking of just having a
 

727
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,150
instead i'm thinking of just having a
lot of little trees around the place

728
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160

 

729
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,669

because i want the green look of the

730
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
because i want the green look of the
 

731
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,270
because i want the green look of the
trees

732
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
trees
 

733
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,029
trees
you guys suggested something really cool

734
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
you guys suggested something really cool
 

735
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,029
you guys suggested something really cool
too i should build my storage room

736
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
too i should build my storage room
 

737
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,150
too i should build my storage room
underwater so

738
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
underwater so
 

739
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,110
underwater so
that is a very high probability i'll

740
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120
that is a very high probability i'll
 

741
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,270
that is a very high probability i'll
probably do that

742
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
probably do that
 

743
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,150
probably do that
around my courtyard there's gonna be

744
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
around my courtyard there's gonna be
 

745
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,110
around my courtyard there's gonna be
boat docks i think

746
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
boat docks i think
 

747
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,789
boat docks i think
and they'll also probably be bridges

748
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
and they'll also probably be bridges
 

749
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,549
and they'll also probably be bridges
which will lead off to other areas such

750
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
which will lead off to other areas such
 

751
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,549
which will lead off to other areas such
as the desert over there

752
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
as the desert over there
 

753
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,950
as the desert over there
and those bridges will probably be eats

754
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
and those bridges will probably be eats
 

755
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,590
and those bridges will probably be eats
roads

756
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
roads
 

757
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,830
roads
i don't know just thinking way in the

758
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
i don't know just thinking way in the
 

759
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,549
i don't know just thinking way in the
future

760
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
future
 

761
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,070
future
uh but one thing i i'm planning on here

762
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
uh but one thing i i'm planning on here
 

763
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,029
uh but one thing i i'm planning on here
i need

764
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
i need
 

765
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,029
i need
blocks i need a lot of dirt for this

766
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
blocks i need a lot of dirt for this
 

767
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,230
blocks i need a lot of dirt for this
project i need

768
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
project i need
 

769
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,990
project i need
sand stuff like that so what i'll do

770
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
sand stuff like that so what i'll do
 

771
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,710
sand stuff like that so what i'll do
is i'll harvest it from the seabed here

772
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
is i'll harvest it from the seabed here
 

773
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,470
is i'll harvest it from the seabed here
as much as i can

774
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480

 

775
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,549

so like this it's only one block deep

776
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
so like this it's only one block deep
 

777
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,590
so like this it's only one block deep
here i

778
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
here i
 

779
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,029
here i
this would be a good place to get blocks

780
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
this would be a good place to get blocks
 

781
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,630
this would be a good place to get blocks
from

782
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
from
 

783
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,950
from
especially if i plan on building the

784
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
especially if i plan on building the
 

785
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,669
especially if i plan on building the
storage room

786
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
storage room
 

787
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,110
storage room
underwater i would like this water

788
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
underwater i would like this water
 

789
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,950
underwater i would like this water
deeper then

790
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960

 

791
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,710

so that's one thing i'll probably do off

792
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
so that's one thing i'll probably do off
 

793
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,390
so that's one thing i'll probably do off
camera

794
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400

 

795
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,390

i would use tnt but i don't have it

796
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
i would use tnt but i don't have it
 

797
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,669
i would use tnt but i don't have it
unfortunately

798
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
unfortunately
 

799
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,909
unfortunately
so until i get some i have to use a

800
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
so until i get some i have to use a
 

801
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,070
so until i get some i have to use a
shovel

802
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080

 

803
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,990

here we go everyone i'm about to start

804
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
here we go everyone i'm about to start
 

805
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,990
here we go everyone i'm about to start
placing down our foundation for this

806
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
placing down our foundation for this
 

807
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,630
placing down our foundation for this
thing i'm just going to make a huge

808
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
thing i'm just going to make a huge
 

809
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,950
thing i'm just going to make a huge
square here

810
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960

 

811
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,070

to save on blocks i'm going to make it

812
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
to save on blocks i'm going to make it
 

813
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,630
to save on blocks i'm going to make it
too thick for right now and we're three

814
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
too thick for right now and we're three
 

815
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,110
too thick for right now and we're three
blocks

816
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
blocks
 

817
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,750
blocks
above the water

818
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760

 

819
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,830

so yeah i'm going to use a lot of blocks

820
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
so yeah i'm going to use a lot of blocks
 

821
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,950
so yeah i'm going to use a lot of blocks
in this project

822
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
in this project
 

823
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,909
in this project
i'm basically building an island here

824
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
i'm basically building an island here
 

825
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,110
i'm basically building an island here
it's not just

826
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
it's not just
 

827
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,710
it's not just
not just a house or anything it's going

828
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
not just a house or anything it's going
 

829
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,149
not just a house or anything it's going
to be an island

830
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
to be an island
 

831
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,110
to be an island
there'll be grass and stuff uh the

832
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
there'll be grass and stuff uh the
 

833
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,029
there'll be grass and stuff uh the
courtyard

834
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039
courtyard
 

835
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,350
courtyard
this is where i'm planning the courtyard

836
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
this is where i'm planning the courtyard
 

837
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,870
this is where i'm planning the courtyard
right here

838
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
right here
 

839
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,909
right here
uh it'll be kind of like a garden area

840
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
uh it'll be kind of like a garden area
 

841
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,710
uh it'll be kind of like a garden area
there'll be flowers and trees and stuff

842
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
there'll be flowers and trees and stuff
 

843
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,750
there'll be flowers and trees and stuff
like that in it

844
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
like that in it
 

845
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,270
like that in it
just to look nice

846
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280

 

847
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,830

and i got other things planned for it

848
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:28,840

 

849
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,710

too

850
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
too
 

851
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,390
too
there'll be a fountain in the middle of

852
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
there'll be a fountain in the middle of
 

853
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,750
there'll be a fountain in the middle of
it i'm assuming

854
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760

 

855
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,669

so yeah i'm gonna make a square all

856
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
so yeah i'm gonna make a square all
 

857
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,510
so yeah i'm gonna make a square all
around

858
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
around
 

859
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,430
around
and then i gotta get grass over here too

860
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
and then i gotta get grass over here too
 

861
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,029
and then i gotta get grass over here too
so i need to find

862
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
so i need to find
 

863
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,710
so i need to find
i guess that's a pretty close spot to

864
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
i guess that's a pretty close spot to
 

865
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,149
i guess that's a pretty close spot to
get grass so i'll have to

866
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
get grass so i'll have to
 

867
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,070
get grass so i'll have to
bring that over here and start

868
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
bring that over here and start
 

869
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,630
bring that over here and start
grassing up this giant square i'm making

870
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
grassing up this giant square i'm making
 

871
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,830
grassing up this giant square i'm making
and this will just give us a nice

872
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
and this will just give us a nice
 

873
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,350
and this will just give us a nice
starting foundation to work off of

874
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360

 

875
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,830

check it out it's coming together

876
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
check it out it's coming together
 

877
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,029
check it out it's coming together
placing lots of blocks here i got a lot

placing lots of blocks here i got a lot
 

879
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:11,510
placing lots of blocks here i got a lot
of them

880
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
of them
 

881
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,430
of them
from the sea floor

882
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440

 

883
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,270

the water is deeper now in a lot of

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
the water is deeper now in a lot of
 

885
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,470
the water is deeper now in a lot of
places

886
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
places
 

887
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,270
places
but i was finding about 70 of the block

888
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
but i was finding about 70 of the block
 

889
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,310
but i was finding about 70 of the block
size gained from the

890
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
size gained from the
 

891
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,029
size gained from the
sea floor were actually sand and i need

892
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
sea floor were actually sand and i need
 

893
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,510
sea floor were actually sand and i need
soil

894
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
soil
 

895
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,750
soil
so instead i went to

896
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
so instead i went to
 

897
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,029
so instead i went to
over there where those pine trees are

898
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,039
over there where those pine trees are
 

899
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,990
over there where those pine trees are
next to the desert and i started just

900
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
next to the desert and i started just
 

901
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,310
next to the desert and i started just
harvesting soil

902
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
harvesting soil
 

903
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,029
harvesting soil
from that island that area over there is

904
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
from that island that area over there is
 

905
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,710
from that island that area over there is
kind of what i designated as

906
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
kind of what i designated as
 

907
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,909
kind of what i designated as
my feel free to wreck place

908
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
my feel free to wreck place
 

909
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,590
my feel free to wreck place
so that's where i'm going to get my sand

910
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600
so that's where i'm going to get my sand
 

911
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,950
so that's where i'm going to get my sand
from mostly and

912
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
from mostly and
 

913
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,990
from mostly and
from and i'll probably

914
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
from and i'll probably
 

915
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,990
from and i'll probably
bulldoze that island slowly as i need

916
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
bulldoze that island slowly as i need
 

917
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,570
bulldoze that island slowly as i need
resources

918
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:58,580

first square pretty plain right now
 

963
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,590
first square pretty plain right now
but it's like our blank canvas

964
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600

 

965
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,789

and this new lp i'm going to try to be

966
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
and this new lp i'm going to try to be
 

967
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,190
and this new lp i'm going to try to be
less

968
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
less
 

969
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,990
less

issue i felt i had

972
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
issue i felt i had
 

973
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,710
issue i felt i had
before i would plan things out

974
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
before i would plan things out
 

975
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,549
before i would plan things out
in too great of detail and then they

976
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
in too great of detail and then they
 

977
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,830
in too great of detail and then they
would

978
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
would
 

979
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,669
would
rarely work out because a patch would

980
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
rarely work out because a patch would
 

981
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,549
rarely work out because a patch would
mess them up or something

982
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
mess them up or something
 

983
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,430
mess them up or something
in this one i'm just gonna get a rough

984
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
in this one i'm just gonna get a rough
 

985
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,110
in this one i'm just gonna get a rough
idea of what i want to build and just go

986
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
idea of what i want to build and just go
 

987
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,070
idea of what i want to build and just go
ahead and build it

988
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
ahead and build it
 

989
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,470
ahead and build it
it might not be perfect but i'll figure

990
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
it might not be perfect but i'll figure
 

991
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,310
it might not be perfect but i'll figure
it out as i go along

992
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
it out as i go along
 

993
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,510
it out as i go along
and that way stuff will actually get

994
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,520
and that way stuff will actually get
 

995
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,590
and that way stuff will actually get
built quicker

996
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600

 

997
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,110

i'm hoping we'll see uh so i also

998
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
i'm hoping we'll see uh so i also
 

999
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,190
i'm hoping we'll see uh so i also
put up a path here for the dress to come

1000
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
put up a path here for the dress to come
 

1001
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,190
put up a path here for the dress to come
in

1002
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
in
 

1003
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,950
in
i could move it with pistons but

1004
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960

 

1005
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,909

it's just easier to make a soil path

1006
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
it's just easier to make a soil path
 

1007
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:53,430
it's just easier to make a soil path
build it and forget about it

1008
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440

 

1009
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,190

i've heard that you move faster if you

1010
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
i've heard that you move faster if you
 

1011
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,430
i've heard that you move faster if you
jump while you're dashing

1012
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
jump while you're dashing
 

1013
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,029
jump while you're dashing
slightly faster and yeah

1014
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
slightly faster and yeah
 

1015
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,870
slightly faster and yeah
this is all the soil i have left it's

1016
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
this is all the soil i have left it's
 

1017
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,230
this is all the soil i have left it's
not going to be quite enough so i'll

1018
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
not going to be quite enough so i'll
 

1019
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,029
not going to be quite enough so i'll
have to go get some more

1020
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
have to go get some more
 

1021
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,070
have to go get some more
in total i've used about 20 to 30

1022
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
in total i've used about 20 to 30
 

1023
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,230
in total i've used about 20 to 30
