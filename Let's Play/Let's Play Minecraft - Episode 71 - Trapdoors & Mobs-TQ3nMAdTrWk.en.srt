37
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,450
I'm not gonna be able to get the way I
wanted to just because I would have to

wanted to just because I would have to
 

39
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,910
wanted to just because I would have to
redo the storage room and everything and

00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
redo the storage room and everything and
 

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,179
redo the storage room and everything and
I'm not gonna do that this will be kind

I'm not gonna do that this will be kind
 

43
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,249
I'm not gonna do that this will be kind
of my test system and ideally I would

instead of having them all collect to
 

49
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,249
instead of having them all collect to
one point but we're gonna redo this so

50
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:31,259
one point but we're gonna redo this so
 

51
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,450
one point but we're gonna redo this so
that they all collect to one point

a new base far away from this one so
 

61
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,749
a new base far away from this one so

had to destroy all that glass but you

122
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:31,239
had to destroy all that glass but you
 

123

had to destroy all that glass but you
know sometimes you need to take a step

124
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,070
know sometimes you need to take a step
 

125
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,449
know sometimes you need to take a step
back to take two steps forward so this

126
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:37,459
back to take two steps forward so this
 

127
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,289
back to take two steps forward so this
is where the mob evader is and I just

128
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:41,299
is where the mob evader is and I just
 

129
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,580
is where the mob evader is and I just
kind of want to play around with this

130
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:42,590
kind of want to play around with this
 

131
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,610
kind of want to play around with this
first before I build anything major I

132
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:45,620
first before I build anything major I
 

133
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,580
first before I build anything major I
want to do a few test things one thing I

134
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:51,590
want to do a few test things one thing I
 

135
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,620
want to do a few test things one thing I
want to see is if spiders will fit

136
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:53,630
want to see is if spiders will fit
 

137
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,800
want to see is if spiders will fit
through the trapdoors if they're like

138
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:56,810
through the trapdoors if they're like
 

139
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,970
through the trapdoors if they're like
that so just give me a sec I'll get them

140
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:00,980
that so just give me a sec I'll get them
 

141
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,050
that so just give me a sec I'll get them
spawning and then we'll see alright I

142
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,060
spawning and then we'll see alright I
 

143
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:14,900
spawning and then we'll see alright I
think we have some spiders coming here

144
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:14,910

 

145
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:24,450

and they are stuck I think by the mob so

146
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:24,460
and they are stuck I think by the mob so
 

147
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,670
and they are stuck I think by the mob so
not by the doors

148
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:28,680
not by the doors
 

149
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,810

150
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:30,820
well that was dangerous
 

151
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:57,090
well that was dangerous
oh so it is by the doors yet they don't

152
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,100
oh so it is by the doors yet they don't
 

153
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:09,900
oh so it is by the doors yet they don't
seems to be able to fit a little kind of

154
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:09,910
seems to be able to fit a little kind of
 

155
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,210
seems to be able to fit a little kind of
hard to tell us all these guys but I put

156
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:15,220
hard to tell us all these guys but I put
 

157
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,740
hard to tell us all these guys but I put
them around and they haven't gone yet

158
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:16,750
them around and they haven't gone yet
 

159
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:26,760
them around and they haven't gone yet
oh okay so they don't as far as I can

oh okay so they don't as far as I can
 

161
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,990
oh okay so they don't as far as I can
tell I had it cleared there for a second

162
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,000
tell I had it cleared there for a second
 

163
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,440
tell I had it cleared there for a second
and we store enjoying so I'm assuming

164
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,450
and we store enjoying so I'm assuming
 

165
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:42,450
and we store enjoying so I'm assuming
it's not possible oh that guy got out

166
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:42,460
it's not possible oh that guy got out
 

167
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,200
it's not possible oh that guy got out
after a scalp and shot him through and

168
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,210
after a scalp and shot him through and
 

169
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:54,020
after a scalp and shot him through and
now he can't see me through the doors

170
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,030

 

171
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,960

time to go oh maybe it's this it's later

172
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:57,970
time to go oh maybe it's this it's later
 

173
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:17,240
time to go oh maybe it's this it's later
oh yeah he's after

174
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,250

 

175
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:25,890

holy crap okey yeah I'm only on easy

176
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:25,900
holy crap okey yeah I'm only on easy
 

177
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,240
holy crap okey yeah I'm only on easy
guys just really playing along sir got a

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,250
guys just really playing along sir got a
 

179
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,350
guys just really playing along sir got a
pressure plate

180
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
pressure plate
 

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,950
pressure plate
what's my sounded got a pressure plate

182
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
what's my sounded got a pressure plate
 

183
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,610
what's my sounded got a pressure plate
here on one side and they can get out

184
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:38,620
here on one side and they can get out
 

185
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:56,400
here on one side and they can get out
from that but it only well only seems to

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,410
from that but it only well only seems to
 

187
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,440
from that but it only well only seems to
be when the door is up like that they

188
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,450
be when the door is up like that they
 

189
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,970
be when the door is up like that they
don't seem to fit when it's down okay

190
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:02,980
don't seem to fit when it's down okay
 

191
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,920
don't seem to fit when it's down okay
I'm running the same test except for

192
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:04,930
I'm running the same test except for
 

193
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,110
I'm running the same test except for
tall mobs this time it's only two hi

194
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
tall mobs this time it's only two hi
 

195
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,620
tall mobs this time it's only two hi
there with the trap doors down I'm this

196
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:10,630
there with the trap doors down I'm this
 

197
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,270
there with the trap doors down I'm this
is the first one coming up I'm guessing

198
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,280
is the first one coming up I'm guessing
 

199
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,200
is the first one coming up I'm guessing
he can get through that yeah because

200
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,210
he can get through that yeah because
 

201
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,000
he can get through that yeah because
he's the same height as us and we can

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,010
he's the same height as us and we can
 

203
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:30,180
he's the same height as us and we can
get through that okay alright - Jen much

204
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,190
get through that okay alright - Jen much
 

205
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,880
get through that okay alright - Jen much
the same test just want to make sure

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:32,890
the same test just want to make sure
 

207
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,350
the same test just want to make sure
they can fit through that I'm pretty

208
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,360
they can fit through that I'm pretty
 

209
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,240
they can fit through that I'm pretty
sure they can because we can't as far as

210
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,250
sure they can because we can't as far as
 

211
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,250
sure they can because we can't as far as
I can tell tall mobs are exactly the

212
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,260
I can tell tall mobs are exactly the
 

213
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:49,950
I can tell tall mobs are exactly the
same as us yeah okay

214
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:49,960

 

215
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,190

so I need a way to separate the spiders

216
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,200
so I need a way to separate the spiders
 

217
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,040
so I need a way to separate the spiders
out I want to do that as soon as I can

218
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,050
out I want to do that as soon as I can
 

219
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,490
out I want to do that as soon as I can
here and I also want like a holding

220
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:00,500
here and I also want like a holding
 

221
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,970
here and I also want like a holding
system so for the purpose that if if I

222
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:06,980
system so for the purpose that if if I
 

223
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,000
system so for the purpose that if if I
don't want items to drop for my mobs

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,010
don't want items to drop for my mobs
 

225
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,160
don't want items to drop for my mobs
because items cause lag in your world if

226
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,170
because items cause lag in your world if
 

227
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,070
because items cause lag in your world if
I ever want to shut them off I want like

228
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,080
I ever want to shut them off I want like
 

229
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,930
I ever want to shut them off I want like
a holding system that will hold them all

230
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:16,940
a holding system that will hold them all
 

231
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,930
a holding system that will hold them all
in a clustered space where they won't

232
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:19,940
in a clustered space where they won't
 

233
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,530
in a clustered space where they won't
drown or die and then when I flip a

234
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:23,540
drown or die and then when I flip a
 

235
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,220
drown or die and then when I flip a
lever I want them to be free to go to

236
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,230
lever I want them to be free to go to
 

237
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,610
lever I want them to be free to go to
their killing chambers and so this is

238
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:30,620
their killing chambers and so this is
 

239
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,060
their killing chambers and so this is
kind of an experiment to make a spider

240
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,070
kind of an experiment to make a spider
 

241
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,060
kind of an experiment to make a spider
separator and a holding mechanism all in

242
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,070
separator and a holding mechanism all in
 

243
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,180
separator and a holding mechanism all in
one here this is the holding mechanism

244
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,190
one here this is the holding mechanism
 

245
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,840
one here this is the holding mechanism
believer in the back so I'm gonna have a

246
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:46,850
believer in the back so I'm gonna have a
 

247
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,800
believer in the back so I'm gonna have a
water source block here it'll push the

248
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:50,810
water source block here it'll push the
 

249
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,040
water source block here it'll push the
mobs diagonally to this point here and

250
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,050
mobs diagonally to this point here and
 

251
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,980
mobs diagonally to this point here and
I'm just gonna cause the water to flow

252
00:08:59,980 --> 00:08:59,990
I'm just gonna cause the water to flow
 

253
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,970
I'm just gonna cause the water to flow
all the way here so the tall mobs will

254
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:03,980
all the way here so the tall mobs will
 

255
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,370
all the way here so the tall mobs will
follow this path and they should get

256
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:06,380
follow this path and they should get
 

257
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,960
follow this path and they should get
stuck at this door here and then if it's

258
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:10,970
stuck at this door here and then if it's
 

259
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,850
stuck at this door here and then if it's
flipped open I'm not going to press any

260
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:12,860
flipped open I'm not going to press any
 

261
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,780
flipped open I'm not going to press any
arrows they'll continue on their way and

262
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:18,790
arrows they'll continue on their way and
 

263
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,930
arrows they'll continue on their way and
same with the spiders after that test we

264
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:22,940
same with the spiders after that test we
 

265
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,470
same with the spiders after that test we
did they shouldn't be able to fit in

266
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
did they shouldn't be able to fit in
 

267
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,590
did they shouldn't be able to fit in
this spot here assuming of course it's

268
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
this spot here assuming of course it's
 

269
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,090
this spot here assuming of course it's
only one high it'll be a water source

270
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,100
only one high it'll be a water source
 

271
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,720
only one high it'll be a water source
block here which should suck the spiders

272
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:37,730
block here which should suck the spiders
 

273
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,730
block here which should suck the spiders
in and the stair should hopefully cause

274
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:42,740
in and the stair should hopefully cause
 

275
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,010
in and the stair should hopefully cause
them to go up a block Oh actually you

276
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,020
them to go up a block Oh actually you
 

277
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,100
them to go up a block Oh actually you
don't want to block there we want one

278
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,110
don't want to block there we want one
 

279
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,580
don't want to block there we want one
here

280
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:52,590
here
 

281
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,290
here
so that the tall mobs can't get on that

282
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:55,300
so that the tall mobs can't get on that
 

283
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,020
so that the tall mobs can't get on that
stair because it's only one high space

284
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,030

 

285
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,320

so this should work I think and then at

286
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,330
so this should work I think and then at
 

287
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,100
so this should work I think and then at
this point here I'm gonna make spiders

288
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,110
this point here I'm gonna make spiders
 

289
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,980
this point here I'm gonna make spiders
swim up and drown and their items will

290
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:10,990
swim up and drown and their items will
 

291
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,760
swim up and drown and their items will
fall here diagonal stream pushes them to

292
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:14,770
fall here diagonal stream pushes them to
 

293
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,880
fall here diagonal stream pushes them to
this point and then I can do whatever I

294
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:17,890
this point and then I can do whatever I
 

295
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,780
this point and then I can do whatever I
want with them of course this is just a

296
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:21,790
want with them of course this is just a
 

297
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,070
want with them of course this is just a
test that's why I'm building it with

298
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,080
test that's why I'm building it with
 

299
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,550
test that's why I'm building it with
soil right now now this will be covered

300
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
soil right now now this will be covered
 

301
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,620
soil right now now this will be covered
of course that will be covered so I'm

302
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:34,630
of course that will be covered so I'm
 

303
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,540
of course that will be covered so I'm
just gonna set up a drowning thing here

304
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:36,550
just gonna set up a drowning thing here
 

305
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,390
just gonna set up a drowning thing here
and then I'll let some mobs in here to

306
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,400
and then I'll let some mobs in here to
 

307
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,350
and then I'll let some mobs in here to
see what happens

308
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,360
see what happens
 

309
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,990
see what happens
under a heavy load actually I kind of

310
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
under a heavy load actually I kind of
 

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,570
under a heavy load actually I kind of
messed up the spider thing here so I

312
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:48,580
messed up the spider thing here so I
 

313
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,140
messed up the spider thing here so I
made two holes instead with two signs

314
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,150
made two holes instead with two signs
 

315
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,080
made two holes instead with two signs
holding the water back still the

316
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,090
holding the water back still the
 

317
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,290
holding the water back still the
diagonal stream and then I place the

318
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,300
diagonal stream and then I place the
 

319
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,700
diagonal stream and then I place the
water above and there's two more signs

320
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:02,710
water above and there's two more signs
 

321
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,750
water above and there's two more signs
over here and I just need to put four

322
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:08,760
over here and I just need to put four
 

323
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,050
over here and I just need to put four
source blocks on top and that should

324
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,060
source blocks on top and that should
 

325
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,440
source blocks on top and that should
drown the spiders and cause their items

326
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,450
drown the spiders and cause their items
 

327
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:26,570
drown the spiders and cause their items
to get collected properly I hope

328
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:26,580

 

329
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,100

spiders are always the hardest to deal

330
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,110
spiders are always the hardest to deal
 

331
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:39,360
spiders are always the hardest to deal
with okay so just cover this and this is

332
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,370
with okay so just cover this and this is
 

333
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,970
with okay so just cover this and this is
just a test of course I maybe hold these

334
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:44,980
just a test of course I maybe hold these
 

335
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:55,949
just a test of course I maybe hold these
guys back okay all right so I'm gonna

336
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:55,959
guys back okay all right so I'm gonna
 

337
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,930
guys back okay all right so I'm gonna
let some up and see what happens here

338
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:00,940
let some up and see what happens here
 

339
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,540
let some up and see what happens here
comes the first set of mobs first test

340
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:05,550
comes the first set of mobs first test
 

341
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,190
comes the first set of mobs first test
I'm a little hole for the tall mobs to

342
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,200
I'm a little hole for the tall mobs to
 

343
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:15,389
I'm a little hole for the tall mobs to
fallen and they might drown though

344
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:15,399
fallen and they might drown though
 

345
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:27,300
fallen and they might drown though
that's one concern the spider seems fine

346
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,310
that's one concern the spider seems fine
 

347
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:37,019
that's one concern the spider seems fine
he's not drowning felt never mind let's

348
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:37,029
he's not drowning felt never mind let's
 

349
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:48,620
he's not drowning felt never mind let's
try flip this up see what happens

350
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:48,630

 

351
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:59,530

why is it this stuck there we go

352
00:12:59,530 --> 00:12:59,540

 

353
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,110

the spiders jamming these guys - that's

354
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,120
the spiders jamming these guys - that's
 

355
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:21,940
the spiders jamming these guys - that's
not good I hate spiders string came out

356
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:21,950
not good I hate spiders string came out
 

357
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:41,110
not good I hate spiders string came out
here now we're gonna let this get free

358
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
here now we're gonna let this get free
 

359
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,370
here now we're gonna let this get free
hopefully as it stands ill this does not

360
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:48,380
hopefully as it stands ill this does not
 

361
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,750
hopefully as it stands ill this does not
work can they actually move through the

362
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:52,760
work can they actually move through the
 

363
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:06,550
work can they actually move through the
corner Wow okay so I'm gonna rethink

364
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
corner Wow okay so I'm gonna rethink
 

365
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,980
corner Wow okay so I'm gonna rethink
this I might just do a spider separator

366
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:08,990
this I might just do a spider separator
 

367
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,640
this I might just do a spider separator
like doc damn did that seems to be the

368
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:12,650
like doc damn did that seems to be the
 

369
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,450
like doc damn did that seems to be the
best one I've seen so far the simplest

370
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:16,460
best one I've seen so far the simplest
 

371
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:24,180
best one I've seen so far the simplest
one oh there's another spider

372
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,190
one oh there's another spider
 

373
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,040
one oh there's another spider
okay I'm gonna watch this for a bit -

374
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,050

 

375
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,360

now one thing I do want to check out

376
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,370
now one thing I do want to check out
 

377
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,320
now one thing I do want to check out
though is how well this trap door whoops

378
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,330
though is how well this trap door whoops
 

379
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,490
though is how well this trap door whoops
the whole unit all mobs

380
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:37,500
the whole unit all mobs
 

381
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,290
the whole unit all mobs
this thing is loaded up really heavy so

382
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,300
this thing is loaded up really heavy so
 

383
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,490
this thing is loaded up really heavy so
I want to see if they can make it

384
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:43,500
I want to see if they can make it
 

385
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,380
I want to see if they can make it
through that I know the spiders are

386
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,390
through that I know the spiders are
 

387
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,320
through that I know the spiders are
gonna be in the way though but let's see

388
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,330
gonna be in the way though but let's see
 

389
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,500
gonna be in the way though but let's see
if some of them get through

390
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:51,510
if some of them get through
 

391
00:14:51,510 --> 00:15:01,790
if some of them get through
what's

392
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:01,800

 

393
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:13,200

that's pretty good ain't get jammed

394
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,210

 

395
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,380

those guys are jammed at the moment just

396
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,390
those guys are jammed at the moment just
 

397
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,720
those guys are jammed at the moment just
watch this a Fiat free though on their

398
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:18,730
watch this a Fiat free though on their
 

399
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,150
watch this a Fiat free though on their
own

400
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,160

 

401
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,050

ah it doesn't look like it's that's not

402
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,060
ah it doesn't look like it's that's not
 

403
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:40,580
ah it doesn't look like it's that's not
good so as a holding system that

404
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:40,590
good so as a holding system that
 

405
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,360
good so as a holding system that
trapdoor set up with the stream going

406
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,370
trapdoor set up with the stream going
 

407
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,370
trapdoor set up with the stream going
around a bend doesn't seem to work very

408
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:46,380
around a bend doesn't seem to work very
 

409
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,830
around a bend doesn't seem to work very
well if you have lots of mobs like this

410
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:50,840
well if you have lots of mobs like this
 

411
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:58,330
well if you have lots of mobs like this
because they will get stuck like that

412
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,340

 

413
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,500

okay there's something else I want to

414
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,510
okay there's something else I want to
 

415
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,120
okay there's something else I want to
test with trapdoors

416
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,130
test with trapdoors
 

417
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:07,220
test with trapdoors
I really doubt this will work but if it

418
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,230
I really doubt this will work but if it
 

419
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:13,390
I really doubt this will work but if it
does not or Jeb get a high-five for me

420
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:13,400
does not or Jeb get a high-five for me
 

421
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,940
does not or Jeb get a high-five for me
I'm wondering first of all I have like a

422
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:16,950
I'm wondering first of all I have like a
 

423
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,650
I'm wondering first of all I have like a
dark room here okay they let light in

424
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:23,660

 

425
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,710

okay that was a quick test I guess it

426
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:27,720
okay that was a quick test I guess it
 

427
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,010
okay that was a quick test I guess it
makes sense because they have holes in

428
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:30,020
makes sense because they have holes in
 

429
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,470
makes sense because they have holes in
the trapdoor I was thinking though it

430
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,480
the trapdoor I was thinking though it
 

431
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,710
the trapdoor I was thinking though it
would be cool if if it was dark in here

432
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
would be cool if if it was dark in here
 

433
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
would be cool if if it was dark in here
when it was closed and if they let light

434
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,490
when it was closed and if they let light
 

435
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,950
when it was closed and if they let light
in when it was open that would be a very

436
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:42,960
in when it was open that would be a very
 

437
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,050
in when it was open that would be a very
awesome feature especially for building

438
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,060
awesome feature especially for building
 

439
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,660
awesome feature especially for building
the cook house another thing I want to

440
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:50,670
the cook house another thing I want to
 

441
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,090
the cook house another thing I want to
figure out is under what conditions do

442
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,100
figure out is under what conditions do
 

443
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,590
figure out is under what conditions do
the mobs drown underneath trap doors so

444
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
the mobs drown underneath trap doors so
 

445
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,450
the mobs drown underneath trap doors so
I have solid water source blocks

446
00:16:59,450 --> 00:16:59,460
I have solid water source blocks
 

447
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:05,420
I have solid water source blocks
underneath these directly below I'm

448
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,430
underneath these directly below I'm
 

449
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:13,630
underneath these directly below I'm
assuming they will drown

450
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:13,640

 

451
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,569

hee-hee-hee-hee-hee centers

452
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:17,579
hee-hee-hee-hee-hee centers
 

453
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,539
hee-hee-hee-hee-hee centers
yeah okay I'm gonna try space the water

454
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:20,549
yeah okay I'm gonna try space the water
 

455
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,760
yeah okay I'm gonna try space the water
further I'm gonna try space of water

456
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:22,770
further I'm gonna try space of water
 

457
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,180
further I'm gonna try space of water
further apart and see what happens so

458
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,190

 

459
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,580

now I space the water one block so it

460
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:31,590
now I space the water one block so it
 

461
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:39,440
now I space the water one block so it
should be one level shower I think I'm

462
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,450
should be one level shower I think I'm
 

463
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:46,370
should be one level shower I think I'm
speaking English today so I'm guessing

464
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:46,380
speaking English today so I'm guessing
 

465
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,039
speaking English today so I'm guessing
they will still drown with this I think

466
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,049
they will still drown with this I think
 

467
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:57,620
they will still drown with this I think
it has to go one more but we'll see all

468
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:57,630
it has to go one more but we'll see all
 

469
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:03,860
it has to go one more but we'll see all
right we got a bunch of creepers let's

470
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:03,870
right we got a bunch of creepers let's
 

471
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,990
right we got a bunch of creepers let's
see what happens yeah they're still

472
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,000
see what happens yeah they're still
 

473
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,370
see what happens yeah they're still
drowning so I'm going to space it one

474
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,380
drowning so I'm going to space it one
 

475
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,180
drowning so I'm going to space it one
more and then I think it will work I'm

476
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,190
more and then I think it will work I'm
 

477
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:26,659
more and then I think it will work I'm
pretty sure so I figured out the answer

478
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:26,669
pretty sure so I figured out the answer
 

479
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:29,899
pretty sure so I figured out the answer
to my question here turns out I have to

480
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:29,909
to my question here turns out I have to
 

481
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,370
to my question here turns out I have to
move the water two more blocks yet and

482
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:33,380
move the water two more blocks yet and
 

483
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,169
move the water two more blocks yet and
so there's a water stream directly below

484
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:36,179
so there's a water stream directly below
 

485
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,710
so there's a water stream directly below
these trapdoors here and the mobs are

486
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:39,720
these trapdoors here and the mobs are
 

487
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,480
these trapdoors here and the mobs are
not suffocating being in the water so

488
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,490
not suffocating being in the water so
 

489
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,779
not suffocating being in the water so
water basically has eight depths at at

490
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:50,789
water basically has eight depths at at
 

491
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,020
water basically has eight depths at at
the source block here is level eight

492
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,030
the source block here is level eight
 

493
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,240
the source block here is level eight
seven over here six and then five

494
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,250
seven over here six and then five
 

495
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,649
seven over here six and then five
so if mobs are in water level five or

496
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:03,659
so if mobs are in water level five or
 

497
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,950
so if mobs are in water level five or
less four three two one they will not

498
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
less four three two one they will not
 

499
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,700
less four three two one they will not
drown if there is a block directly above

500
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:10,710
drown if there is a block directly above
 

501
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,950
drown if there is a block directly above
them

502
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:11,960
them
 

503
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,690
them
is what I figured out from this so

504
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:16,700
is what I figured out from this so
 

505
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,280
is what I figured out from this so
that's good to know

506
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,290

 

507
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,570

if you're wondering why I'm doing tests

508
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:22,580
if you're wondering why I'm doing tests
 

509
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,630
if you're wondering why I'm doing tests
like this I never used trapdoors in a

510
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,640
like this I never used trapdoors in a
 

511
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,180
like this I never used trapdoors in a
mob system yet and I plan on doing so in

512
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,190
mob system yet and I plan on doing so in
 

513
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,700
mob system yet and I plan on doing so in
the future so I just kind of want to

514
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:30,710
the future so I just kind of want to
 

515
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,400
the future so I just kind of want to
figure out how mobs react to the

516
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,410
figure out how mobs react to the
 

517
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,650
figure out how mobs react to the
trapdoors I did similar tests like this

518
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:38,660
trapdoors I did similar tests like this
 

519
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,570
trapdoors I did similar tests like this
when I was trying to figure out regular

520
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:40,580
when I was trying to figure out regular
 

521
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,600
when I was trying to figure out regular
doors and I just watched how they

522
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:43,610
doors and I just watched how they
 

523
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,560
doors and I just watched how they
reacted with them and by doing that I

524
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:47,570
reacted with them and by doing that I
 

525
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,680
reacted with them and by doing that I
was able to build mob junctions and

526
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:50,690
was able to build mob junctions and
 

527
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,040
was able to build mob junctions and
stuff like that so you can learn a lot

528
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,050
stuff like that so you can learn a lot
 

529
00:19:54,050 --> 00:20:02,040
stuff like that so you can learn a lot
just by doing little tests like this I

530
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,050

 

531
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,510

think the last test we're going to do

532
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:04,520
think the last test we're going to do
 

533
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,400
think the last test we're going to do
this video is I just want to see how

534
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,410
this video is I just want to see how
 

535
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,090
this video is I just want to see how
this works this is a spider separator

536
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,100
this works this is a spider separator
 

537
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,230
this works this is a spider separator
like Doc M built in his world I think

538
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
like Doc M built in his world I think
 

539
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,930
like Doc M built in his world I think
you did mention who you got the design

540
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:16,940
you did mention who you got the design
 

541
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,480
you did mention who you got the design
from but I don't recall it offhand but

542
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,490
from but I don't recall it offhand but
 

543
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,450
from but I don't recall it offhand but
it looks like a really cool way of doing

544
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:25,460
it looks like a really cool way of doing
 

545
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,920
it looks like a really cool way of doing
it so they come up there and there's

546
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:29,930
it so they come up there and there's
 

547
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,100
it so they come up there and there's
basically just a little gap for the tall

548
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,110
basically just a little gap for the tall
 

549
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,440
basically just a little gap for the tall
mobs to fall down and since it's only

550
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:35,450
mobs to fall down and since it's only
 

551
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,590
mobs to fall down and since it's only
too high they can't jump over it

552
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
too high they can't jump over it
 

553
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,310
too high they can't jump over it
so I want to see how this works

554
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320

 

555
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,120

hey there comes a bunch of moms oh man

556
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,130
hey there comes a bunch of moms oh man
 

557
00:20:49,130 --> 00:21:02,119
hey there comes a bunch of moms oh man
they're getting a fight Wow

558
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,129

 

559
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:11,029

help the door switch back my bad oh

560
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039

 

561
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,639

don't do that

562
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:13,649
don't do that
 

563
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:20,729
don't do that
well they hit a creeper okay well it

564
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:20,739
well they hit a creeper okay well it
 

565
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:26,219
well they hit a creeper okay well it
does seem to work my setup here is very

566
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:26,229
does seem to work my setup here is very
 

567
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:27,449
does seem to work my setup here is very
dangerous though because they keep

568
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:27,459
dangerous though because they keep
 

569
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:30,749
dangerous though because they keep
attacking each other and me but it seems

570
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:30,759
attacking each other and me but it seems
 

571
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,629
attacking each other and me but it seems
to work pretty good so I might end up

572
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:33,639
to work pretty good so I might end up
 

573
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:38,249
to work pretty good so I might end up
doing this style but I'm gonna play

574
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:38,259
doing this style but I'm gonna play
 

575
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,869
doing this style but I'm gonna play
around with a few other ideas yet I

576
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:39,879
around with a few other ideas yet I
 

577
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:46,139
around with a few other ideas yet I
think and yeah so that's it for this

578
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:46,149
think and yeah so that's it for this
 

579
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:48,299
think and yeah so that's it for this
episode guys it's been a while since

580
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:48,309
episode guys it's been a while since
 

581
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:52,499
episode guys it's been a while since
I've worked on this mob system you can

582
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:52,509
I've worked on this mob system you can
 

583
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:55,349
I've worked on this mob system you can
probably tell this already but I'm not a

584
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:55,359
probably tell this already but I'm not a
 

585
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,560
probably tell this already but I'm not a
very focused person I'm kind of all over

586
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:58,570
very focused person I'm kind of all over
 

587
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,829
very focused person I'm kind of all over
the place I have a hard time starting a

588
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:01,839
the place I have a hard time starting a
 

589
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:07,139
the place I have a hard time starting a
project and finishing it but that adds

590
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:07,149
project and finishing it but that adds
 

591
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:10,169
project and finishing it but that adds
to the variety of what I do in my LP

592
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:10,179
to the variety of what I do in my LP
 

593
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,529
to the variety of what I do in my LP
episodes but it also makes stuff take

594
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:13,539
episodes but it also makes stuff take
 

595
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,529
episodes but it also makes stuff take
forever to get done so kind of a good

596
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:16,539
forever to get done so kind of a good
 

597
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:21,449
forever to get done so kind of a good
and bad thing oh well but yeah thank you

598
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:21,459
and bad thing oh well but yeah thank you
 

599
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:25,799
and bad thing oh well but yeah thank you
for watching and I'll see you next time
