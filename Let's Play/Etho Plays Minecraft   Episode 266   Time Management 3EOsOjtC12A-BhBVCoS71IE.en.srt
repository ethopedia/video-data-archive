00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
controlled with redstone
 

175
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,589
controlled with redstone
um what we need to do

176
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
um what we need to do
 

177
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,309
um what we need to do
basically is just we're going to be

178
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
basically is just we're going to be
 

179
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,630
basically is just we're going to be
dropping zombies down this hole here

180
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
dropping zombies down this hole here
 

181
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,869
dropping zombies down this hole here
skeletons down this one and then

182
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
skeletons down this one and then
 

183
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,110
skeletons down this one and then
creepers down this one we just have to

184
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
creepers down this one we just have to
 

185
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,589
creepers down this one we just have to
run a tube all the way up from these

186
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
run a tube all the way up from these
 

187
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,589
run a tube all the way up from these
so let's go ahead and do that

188
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
so let's go ahead and do that
 

189
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,229
so let's go ahead and do that
and then at the bottom of this we're

190
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
and then at the bottom of this we're
 

191
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,990
and then at the bottom of this we're
going to have dispensers with lava

192
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
going to have dispensers with lava
 

193
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,309
going to have dispensers with lava
buckets in that will

194
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
buckets in that will
 

195
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,069
buckets in that will
incinerate them get them down to one hit

196
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
incinerate them get them down to one hit
 

197
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,909
incinerate them get them down to one hit
and then like creepers we can kill with

198
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
and then like creepers we can kill with
 

199
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,990
and then like creepers we can kill with
a looting sword and get

200
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
a looting sword and get
 

201
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,110
a looting sword and get
extra gun powder or that we're going to

202
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
extra gun powder or that we're going to
 

203
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,030
extra gun powder or that we're going to
set up with a record firm

204
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
set up with a record firm
 

205
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,150
set up with a record firm
feature where if we walk

206
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
feature where if we walk
 

207
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,870
feature where if we walk
between between a creeper

208
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
between between a creeper
 

209
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,110
between between a creeper
no we don't walk between we walk on the

210
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
no we don't walk between we walk on the
 

211
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,310
no we don't walk between we walk on the
side of

212
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
side of
 

213
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,510
side of
a creeper a creeper between

214
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
a creeper a creeper between
 

215
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,310
a creeper a creeper between
us and a skeleton there we go how do you

216
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
us and a skeleton there we go how do you
 

217
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,590
us and a skeleton there we go how do you
say that

218
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
say that
 

219
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,070
say that
um then the skeleton's gonna shoot the

220
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
um then the skeleton's gonna shoot the
 

221
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,870
um then the skeleton's gonna shoot the
creeper and

222
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
creeper and
 

223
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,550
creeper and
the creeper's gonna drop a record

224
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
the creeper's gonna drop a record
 

225
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,150
the creeper's gonna drop a record
because he dies in one hit

226
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
because he dies in one hit
 

227
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,909
because he dies in one hit
one hit that's that's what we're going

228
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
one hit that's that's what we're going
 

229
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,990
one hit that's that's what we're going
for here

230
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
for here
 

231
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,790
for here
so let me finish these tubes and i'll

232
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
so let me finish these tubes and i'll
 

233
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,310
so let me finish these tubes and i'll
did i miss

234
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
did i miss
 

235
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,430
did i miss
no that's right and i'll get back to you

236
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440

 

237
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,029

all right there we go so the tubes come

238
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
all right there we go so the tubes come
 

239
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,430
all right there we go so the tubes come
all the way down to the ground now

240
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
all the way down to the ground now
 

241
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,070
all the way down to the ground now
and i want the mobs to land on like this

242
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
and i want the mobs to land on like this
 

243
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,430
and i want the mobs to land on like this
level here

244
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
level here
 

245
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,189
level here
we'll have dispensers in the back with a

246
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
we'll have dispensers in the back with a
 

247
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,749
we'll have dispensers in the back with a
lava button in each of these

248
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
lava button in each of these
 

249
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,870
lava button in each of these
and i'm just running a line of redstone

250
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
and i'm just running a line of redstone
 

251
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,710
and i'm just running a line of redstone
back here to

252
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
back here to
 

253
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,469
back here to
to dispense and pick up the lava budgets

254
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
to dispense and pick up the lava budgets
 

255
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,590
to dispense and pick up the lava budgets
so this is a comparator clock delay

256
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
so this is a comparator clock delay
 

257
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,950
so this is a comparator clock delay
if this is powered

258
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960

 

259
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,670

it does that pulse thing we only wanted

260
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
it does that pulse thing we only wanted
 

261
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,550
it does that pulse thing we only wanted
to pick it up

262
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
to pick it up
 

263
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,070
to pick it up
or to put it out and then pick it up so

264
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
or to put it out and then pick it up so
 

265
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,870
or to put it out and then pick it up so
to do that it has to power on power off

266
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
to do that it has to power on power off
 

267
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,550
to do that it has to power on power off
power on power off

268
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
power on power off
 

269
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,310
power on power off
and the quickest you can do that is in

270
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
and the quickest you can do that is in
 

271
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,310
and the quickest you can do that is in
four ticks one tick

272
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
four ticks one tick
 

273
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,990
four ticks one tick
off one take on one take off one take on

274
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000

 

275
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,189

and then we need a mono stable circuit

276
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
and then we need a mono stable circuit
 

277
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,189
and then we need a mono stable circuit
to this

278
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199

 

279
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,749

let's see what am i doing here let's

280
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
let's see what am i doing here let's
 

281
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,430
let's see what am i doing here let's
make it go up one i'm just laying it out

282
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
make it go up one i'm just laying it out
 

283
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,230
make it go up one i'm just laying it out
rough to start off with here

284
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
rough to start off with here
 

285
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,870
rough to start off with here
and uh we're gonna make a skin for this

286
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
and uh we're gonna make a skin for this
 

287
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,749
and uh we're gonna make a skin for this
afterwards

288
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
afterwards
 

289
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,270
afterwards
i'm just i just want to get the redstone

290
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
i'm just i just want to get the redstone
 

291
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,309
i'm just i just want to get the redstone
figured out make sure it works

292
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
figured out make sure it works
 

293
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,590
figured out make sure it works
and something like this just really

294
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
and something like this just really
 

295
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,309
and something like this just really
quick and rough

296
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
quick and rough
 

297
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,870
quick and rough
so i get a button

298
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880

 

299
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,230

i like cat cat is a good record the best

300
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
i like cat cat is a good record the best
 

301
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,430
i like cat cat is a good record the best
record

302
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
record
 

303
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,790
record
dare i say

304
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
dare i say
 

305
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,990
dare i say
um okay yeah so i press this

that only go twice

308
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319

 

309
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,510

yeah hmm

310
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520

 

311

in
okay and then i

316
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
okay and then i
 

317
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,150
okay and then i
got three level budgets prepared i

318
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
got three level budgets prepared i
 

319
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,230
got three level budgets prepared i
actually don't have many records in my

320
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
actually don't have many records in my
 

321
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,510
actually don't have many records in my
lp world here maybe

322
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
lp world here maybe
 

323
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,110
lp world here maybe
four or five different ones tops uh

324
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
four or five different ones tops uh
 

325
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,029
four or five different ones tops uh
out of what is it 13 so a record firm

326
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
out of what is it 13 so a record firm
 

327
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,790
out of what is it 13 so a record firm
would actually be a nice thing to have

328
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
would actually be a nice thing to have
 

329
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,790
would actually be a nice thing to have
because i like listening to the records

330
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
because i like listening to the records
 

331
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,629
because i like listening to the records
i just don't have them and they're

332
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
i just don't have them and they're
 

333
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,950
i just don't have them and they're
spread out too like i don't have

334
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
spread out too like i don't have
 

335
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,550
spread out too like i don't have
four or five different ones here that's

336
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
four or five different ones here that's
 

337
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,990
four or five different ones here that's
throughout my whole world

338
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000

 

339
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,029

um okay dare we try this

340
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
um okay dare we try this
 

341
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,629
um okay dare we try this
with real lava like that that's what we

342
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
with real lava like that that's what we
 

343
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,070
with real lava like that that's what we
want

355
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,150
all this stuff by the way is going away
we don't have to worry about it

356
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
we don't have to worry about it
 

357
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,350
we don't have to worry about it

i i want to do it out of quartz but at
the same time i feel that might be

364
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
the same time i feel that might be
 

365
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,309
the same time i feel that might be
a mistake um i'm gonna go

366
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
a mistake um i'm gonna go
 

367
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,110
a mistake um i'm gonna go
back to the man cave get some quartz

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
back to the man cave get some quartz
 

369
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,270
back to the man cave get some quartz
uh hopefully i have quite a bit there

370
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
uh hopefully i have quite a bit there
 

371
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,469
uh hopefully i have quite a bit there
i'm not sure

372
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
i'm not sure
 

373
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,510
i'm not sure
if not i'm gonna have to go to the

374
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
if not i'm gonna have to go to the
 

375
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,070
if not i'm gonna have to go to the
nether and yet more and we'll try

376
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
nether and yet more and we'll try
 

377
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,469
nether and yet more and we'll try
come up with something cool looking here

378
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
come up with something cool looking here
 

379
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,270
come up with something cool looking here
or maybe

380
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
or maybe
 

381
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,710
or maybe
actually maybe we should just test this

382
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
actually maybe we should just test this
 

383
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,390
actually maybe we should just test this
out first

384
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
out first
 

385
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,110
out first
let's let's do that first yeah that's a

386
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
let's let's do that first yeah that's a
 

387
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,189
let's let's do that first yeah that's a
good idea

388
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
good idea
 

389
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,710

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,190
bit we just want to
maybe check this out first give it a

512
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
maybe check this out first give it a
 

513
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,150
maybe check this out first give it a
test

514
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
test
 

515
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,829
test
so let's go back up i finished the paths

516
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
so let's go back up i finished the paths
 

517
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,470
so let's go back up i finished the paths
the creeper path wasn't even open i had

518
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
the creeper path wasn't even open i had
 

519
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,910
the creeper path wasn't even open i had
a soil block

520
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
a soil block
 

521
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,949
a soil block
blocking it so even if the troopers

522
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
blocking it so even if the troopers
 

523
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,470
blocking it so even if the troopers
wanted to go to the right place they

524
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
wanted to go to the right place they
 

525
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,910
wanted to go to the right place they
wouldn't be able to

526
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920

 

527
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,430

let's check it out now the sorting

528
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
let's check it out now the sorting
 

529
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,509
let's check it out now the sorting
machine wasn't perfected yet

530
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
machine wasn't perfected yet
 

531
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,509
machine wasn't perfected yet
i haven't perfected it um

532
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
i haven't perfected it um
 

533
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,190
i haven't perfected it um
and it doesn't really need to be

534
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
and it doesn't really need to be
 

535
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,110
and it doesn't really need to be
perfected but i think i can

536
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
perfected but i think i can
 

537
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,030
perfected but i think i can
improve the accuracy a bit but we'll

538
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
improve the accuracy a bit but we'll
 

539
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,310
improve the accuracy a bit but we'll
just see

540
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
just see
 

541
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,590
just see
how well it does here so far it's good

542
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
how well it does here so far it's good
 

543
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,710
how well it does here so far it's good

560
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480

 

561
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,150

see how it does

562
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160

 

563
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,829

did we get a second creeper in there

564
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
did we get a second creeper in there
 

565
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,990
did we get a second creeper in there

567
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,750
that's not good oh
all right we got one in the proper place

568
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
all right we got one in the proper place
 

569
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,509
all right we got one in the proper place
finally

570
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519

 

571
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,470

the issue i was having before is i

572
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
the issue i was having before is i
 

573
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,910
the issue i was having before is i
either need

574
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
either need
 

575
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,829
either need
to give the creepers more place to run

576
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
to give the creepers more place to run
 

577
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,430
to give the creepers more place to run
or

578
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440

00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
get a second cat up there or something
 

581
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,350
get a second cat up there or something
so they

582
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
so they
 

583
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,870
so they

653
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,750

now i gotta rebuild i will be right back

654
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760

 

655
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,790

it's rebuilt and we have a few creepers

656
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
it's rebuilt and we have a few creepers
 

657
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,550
it's rebuilt and we have a few creepers
in with the skeletons but other than

658
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
in with the skeletons but other than
 

659
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,910
in with the skeletons but other than
that

660
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
that
 

661
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,189
that
we got it right we got water above

662
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
we got it right we got water above
 

663
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,269
we got it right we got water above
they land as gentle as a feather

664
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
they land as gentle as a feather
 

665
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,150
they land as gentle as a feather
so the only damage they're taking is

666
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
so the only damage they're taking is
 

667
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,189
so the only damage they're taking is
like

668
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
like
 

669
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,590
like
half a heart i think when they fall in

670
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
half a heart i think when they fall in
 

671
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,030
half a heart i think when they fall in
the sorter

672
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
the sorter
 

673
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,470
the sorter
other than that they should be at full

674
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
other than that they should be at full
 

675
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,310
other than that they should be at full
health and the idea is this

676
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
health and the idea is this
 

677
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,069
health and the idea is this
should take them down to one hit

678
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079

 

679
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,550

we don't want any of them to die we want

680
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
we don't want any of them to die we want
 

681
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,590
we don't want any of them to die we want
them to be down

682
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
them to be down
 

683
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,509
them to be down
to one hit possible

684
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519

 

685

713
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,590

this could be a first and of course not

714
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
this could be a first and of course not
 

715
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,189

um i'm going to shut it off though

720
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
um i'm going to shut it off though
 

721
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,509
um i'm going to shut it off though
before i try switch that

722
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519

 

723
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,749

you know i saw this my first instinct

724
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
you know i saw this my first instinct
 

725
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,230
you know i saw this my first instinct
was that it was jammed or broken somehow

726
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
was that it was jammed or broken somehow
 

727
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,590
was that it was jammed or broken somehow
but no turns out the room is just full

728
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
but no turns out the room is just full
 

729
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,269
but no turns out the room is just full
of silverfish blocks already so that

730
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
of silverfish blocks already so that
 

731
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,749
of silverfish blocks already so that
didn't take long at all that's good

732
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
didn't take long at all that's good
 

733
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,069
didn't take long at all that's good
um we'll have to move those some other

734
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
um we'll have to move those some other
 

735
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,110
um we'll have to move those some other
time

736
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
time
 

737
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,670
time
but for now we'll just disable this

738
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
but for now we'll just disable this
 

739
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,790
but for now we'll just disable this
since they can't

740
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
since they can't
 

741
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,710
since they can't
enter any more blocks we don't want them

742
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
enter any more blocks we don't want them
 

743
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,790
enter any more blocks we don't want them
spawning anymore

744
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
spawning anymore
 

745
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,590
spawning anymore
uh now let's work on the skin for this

746
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
uh now let's work on the skin for this
 

747
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,430
uh now let's work on the skin for this
thing because

748
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
thing because
 

749
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,350
thing because
you know the glass tubes they work and

750
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
you know the glass tubes they work and
 

751
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,909
you know the glass tubes they work and
everything but they don't look the best

752
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
everything but they don't look the best
 

753
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,909
everything but they don't look the best
so we're going to try we brought some

754
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
so we're going to try we brought some
 

755
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,590
so we're going to try we brought some
courts over already

756
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
courts over already
 

757
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,470
courts over already
and got our quartz i made some stairs

758
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
and got our quartz i made some stairs
 

759
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,750
and got our quartz i made some stairs
and some slabs

760
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760

cyan wool
 

765
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,270
cyan wool
and we'll try mix those in um

766
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
and we'll try mix those in um
 

767
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,270
and we'll try mix those in um
like personally even though i really

768
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
like personally even though i really
 

769
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,909
like personally even though i really
like the green wool like the lime green

770
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
like the green wool like the lime green
 

771
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,909
like the green wool like the lime green
i don't find it goes with quartz all

772
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
i don't find it goes with quartz all
 

773
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,110
i don't find it goes with quartz all
that great because

774
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
that great because
 

775
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,950
that great because
the the lime green is a really bright

776
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
the the lime green is a really bright
 

777
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,470
the the lime green is a really bright
color and the

778
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
color and the
 

779
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,110
color and the
quartz is a really bright color and they

780
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
quartz is a really bright color and they
 

781
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,750
quartz is a really bright color and they
just

782
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
just
 

783
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,830
just
they look really bright together but if

784
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
they look really bright together but if
 

785
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,909
they look really bright together but if
you pick a darker color like purple

786
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
you pick a darker color like purple
 

787
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,430
you pick a darker color like purple
or cyan it looks really good with quartz

788
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
or cyan it looks really good with quartz
 

789
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,270
or cyan it looks really good with quartz
um personally i prefer the cyan more

790
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
um personally i prefer the cyan more
 

791
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,270
um personally i prefer the cyan more
than purple

792
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
than purple
 

793
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,270
than purple
but we're already using that with the

794
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
but we're already using that with the
 

795
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,870
but we're already using that with the
library so maybe we should try the

796
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
library so maybe we should try the
 

797
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,909
library so maybe we should try the
purple

798
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
purple
 

799
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,350
purple

problems
 

829
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,510
problems
but yeah i'm going to try and prove my

830
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
but yeah i'm going to try and prove my
 

831
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,390
but yeah i'm going to try and prove my
skills here by doing something

832
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
skills here by doing something
 

833
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,789
skills here by doing something
i've never really been successful with

834
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
i've never really been successful with
 

835
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,909
i've never really been successful with
i'm going to try to

836
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
i'm going to try to
 

837
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,029
i'm going to try to
build something like and talk about

838
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
build something like and talk about
 

839
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,070
build something like and talk about
something else at the same

840
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
something else at the same
 

841
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,710
something else at the same
time like i can very easily narrate what

842
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
time like i can very easily narrate what
 

843
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,549
time like i can very easily narrate what
i'm doing like i'm placing torches right

844
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
i'm doing like i'm placing torches right
 

845
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,430
i'm doing like i'm placing torches right
now

846
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
now
 

847
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,470
now
now i'm looking at dispensers that's

848
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
now i'm looking at dispensers that's
 

849
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,310
now i'm looking at dispensers that's
really easy to do

850
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
really easy to do
 

851
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,430
really easy to do
but to talk about something else while

852
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
but to talk about something else while
 

853
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,270
but to talk about something else while
doing something creative or complex in

doing something creative or complex in
 

855
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,950
doing something creative or complex in
the game

856
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
the game
 

857
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,710
the game
very challenging it's like the brain

858
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
very challenging it's like the brain
 

859
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,870
very challenging it's like the brain
doesn't allow it

860
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
doesn't allow it
 

861
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,909
doesn't allow it
or at least not my brain but maybe with

862
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
or at least not my brain but maybe with
 

863
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,510
or at least not my brain but maybe with
practice it's possible so that's what

864
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
practice it's possible so that's what
 

865

perfectly
accurate like it's an estimate but i

910
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
accurate like it's an estimate but i
 

911
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,870

for example go on a video and see
exactly when people

it's about 10 years total minutes

960
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
it's about 10 years total minutes
 

961
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,070
it's about 10 years total minutes
that's like if everybody that watched my

962
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
that's like if everybody that watched my
 

963
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,070
that's like if everybody that watched my
video their total time was put together

964
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
video their total time was put together
 

965
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,630
video their total time was put together
it would be about 10 years

it would be about 10 years
 

967
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,990
it would be about 10 years
uh which that's a number to think about

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
uh which that's a number to think about
 

969
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,990

was wasting time
that's what we're going to talk about

988
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
that's what we're going to talk about
 

989
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,590
that's what we're going to talk about
here we're going to define what is

990
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
here we're going to define what is
 

991
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,270

993
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,270
wasting time
which is interesting because everybody

994
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280
which is interesting because everybody
 

995
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,830
which is interesting because everybody
has their own definition of it

996
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
has their own definition of it
 

997
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,830
has their own definition of it
even if it was wasting time though just

998
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
even if it was wasting time though just
 

999
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,669
even if it was wasting time though just
putting this out there

1000
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
putting this out there
 

1001
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,590
putting this out there
uh i'm sure people would waste their

1002
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
uh i'm sure people would waste their
 

1003
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,029
uh i'm sure people would waste their
time with something else so i don't feel

1004
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
time with something else so i don't feel
 

1005
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,510
time with something else so i don't feel
too bad on that

1006
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
too bad on that
 

1007
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,789
too bad on that
but here is the real

1008
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
but here is the real
 

1009
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,990
but here is the real
question what is wasting time

1010
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
question what is wasting time
 

1011
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,430
question what is wasting time
uh a lot of people they feel wasting

uh a lot of people they feel wasting
time is

1014

time is
 

1015
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,950
time is
if you're not doing anything productive

1016
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
if you're not doing anything productive

like if you're working
you're not wasting time but if you're

1020
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
you're not wasting time but if you're
 

1021
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,950
you're not wasting time but if you're
watching tv you are

1022
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960

1023
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,430
watching tv you are
um that's that's a very common view of

1024
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
um that's that's a very common view of
 

1025
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,230
um that's that's a very common view of
it

1026
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
it
 

1027
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,590
it
and this is something i thought about in

1028
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
and this is something i thought about in
 

1029
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,789
and this is something i thought about in
the past maybe you have as well

1030
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
the past maybe you have as well
 

1031
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,669
the past maybe you have as well
uh let's make this like a pillar

1032
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679

 

1033
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,870

see narrating so much easier

1034
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
see narrating so much easier
 

1035
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,110
see narrating so much easier
let's use the pillar blocks actually

1036
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
let's use the pillar blocks actually
 

1037
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,070
let's use the pillar blocks actually
um so personally my definition of

1038
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
um so personally my definition of
 

1039
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,830
um so personally my definition of
wasting time after

1040
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
wasting time after
 

1041
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,950
wasting time after

wait a minute i
 

1045
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,990
wait a minute i
thought about this before see this is

1046
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
thought about this before see this is
 

1047
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,830
thought about this before see this is
this is how i'm doing this i kind of

1048
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
this is how i'm doing this i kind of
 

1049
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,350
this is how i'm doing this i kind of
pre-thought what i was going to say and

1050
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
pre-thought what i was going to say and
 

1051

this like what if you're working
 

1107
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,269
this like what if you're working
you're making ten dollars an hour at

some job

1110
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
some job
 

1111
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,510
some job
but you could have another job where you

1112
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
but you could have another job where you
 

1113
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,909
but you could have another job where you
could be making twenty dollars an hour

1114
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
could be making twenty dollars an hour
 

1115
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,269
could be making twenty dollars an hour
you know uh let's pretend that job was

1116
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
you know uh let's pretend that job was
 

1117
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,710
you know uh let's pretend that job was
available and ready for you if you're

1118
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
available and ready for you if you're
 

1119
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,430

working those
 

1121
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,430
working those
ten hours for or for ten dollars an hour

1122
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
ten hours for or for ten dollars an hour

uh then you would be wasting your time
 

1125
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,029
uh then you would be wasting your time
because there's another job

1126
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
because there's another job
 

1127
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,950
because there's another job
available to you that you could be

1128
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
available to you that you could be
 

1129
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,549
available to you that you could be
making twenty dollars even though you're

1235
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,870

and after all my rambling and blabbling

1244
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
and after all my rambling and blabbling
 

1245
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,269

zombie skeleton creeper

1250
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320

 

1251
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,350

still works that's good items should

1252
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,360
still works that's good items should
 

1253
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,950
still works that's good items should
fall in the hoppers below i

1254
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
fall in the hoppers below i
 

1255
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,750
fall in the hoppers below i
i imagine we might have to do some

1256
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
i imagine we might have to do some
 

1257
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,430
i imagine we might have to do some
tweaking i'm not sure

1258
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
tweaking i'm not sure
 

1259
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,510
tweaking i'm not sure
and this is the wool around here the

1260
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
and this is the wool around here the
 

1261
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,110
and this is the wool around here the
idea is

1262
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
idea is
 

1263
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,510
idea is
this is going to be floor level here and

1264
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,520
this is going to be floor level here and
 

1265
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,549
this is going to be floor level here and
then you'll go down

1266
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
then you'll go down
 

1267
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,350
then you'll go down
this little bit um

1268
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360

 

1269
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,029

so i don't know if this is going to be

1270
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
so i don't know if this is going to be
 

1271
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,710
so i don't know if this is going to be
quartz over here or if we're going to

1272
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:50,720
quartz over here or if we're going to
 

1273
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,789
quartz over here or if we're going to
switch to something else like

1274
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
switch to something else like
 

1275
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,190
switch to something else like
stone brick i'm not sure

1276
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
stone brick i'm not sure
 

1277
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,830
stone brick i'm not sure
we have plenty of options but as a

1278
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
we have plenty of options but as a
 

1279
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,350
we have plenty of options but as a
centerpiece i think that looks good

1280
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
centerpiece i think that looks good
 

1281
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,269
centerpiece i think that looks good
and we should probably do some something

1282
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:03,279
and we should probably do some something
 

1283
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,630
and we should probably do some something
with the top of it too

1284
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:04,640
with the top of it too
 

1285
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,389
with the top of it too
later um let's go turn it on

1286
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
later um let's go turn it on
 

1287
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,190
later um let's go turn it on
see it working and then we'll try switch

1288
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
see it working and then we'll try switch
 

1289
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,630
see it working and then we'll try switch
it with purple

1290
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:12,640
it with purple
 

1291
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,750
it with purple
like i said we would

1292
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760

 

1293
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,389

just to be an idea oh

1294
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399

 

1295
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,630

oh no no no no i've done this before

1296
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
oh no no no no i've done this before
 

1297
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,830
oh no no no no i've done this before
this is not good

1298
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:28,840

 

1299
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,870

oh

1300
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
oh
 

1301
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,830
oh
when that skeleton fell my heart jumped

1302
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840

 

1303
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,990

i need a ladder ladders would be nice

1304
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,000
i need a ladder ladders would be nice
 

1305
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,830

1307
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,909
i can't enter pearl again i'll kill
myself

1308
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919

 

1309
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,510

okay i'm going to climb up since we're

1310
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
okay i'm going to climb up since we're
 

1311
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,430
okay i'm going to climb up since we're
recovering and we'll end our pearl over

1312
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
recovering and we'll end our pearl over
 

1313
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,510
recovering and we'll end our pearl over
it's a little easier that way

1314
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520

 

1315
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,789

ah but yeah thinking thinking about

1316
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,799
ah but yeah thinking thinking about
 

1317
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,389
ah but yeah thinking thinking about
wasting your time uh i thought about

1318
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
wasting your time uh i thought about
 

1319
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,110
wasting your time uh i thought about
some more and

1320
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
some more and
 

1321
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,549
some more and
after that twenty dollar an hour or ten

1322
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:04,559
after that twenty dollar an hour or ten
 

1323
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,350
after that twenty dollar an hour or ten
dollar an hour argument

1324
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
dollar an hour argument
 

1325
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,830
dollar an hour argument
you know i could technically i think

1326
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,840
you know i could technically i think
 

1327
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,190
you know i could technically i think
safely argue that

1328
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
safely argue that
 

1329
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,669
safely argue that
every moment of your life is a waste of

1330
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
every moment of your life is a waste of
 

1331
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,549

00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
time
 

1333
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,830
time
because there's always going to be that

1334
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
because there's always going to be that
 

1335
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,470
because there's always going to be that
opportunity

1336
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
opportunity
 

1337
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,789
opportunity
you're missing that you either choose

1338
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
you're missing that you either choose
 

1339

not to do or
 

1341
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,430
not to do or

maybe you don't even know about it like
 

1343
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,269
maybe you don't even know about it like
