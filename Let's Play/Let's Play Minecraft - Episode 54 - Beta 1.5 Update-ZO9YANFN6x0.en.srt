I think larger Otto's the best and we

38
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:06,990
I think larger Otto's the best and we
 

39
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,100
I think larger Otto's the best and we
have achievements I'm not one of the

40
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,110
have achievements I'm not one of the
 

41
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,980
have achievements I'm not one of the
most exciting features for me but I do

42
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:12,990
most exciting features for me but I do
 

43
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,530
most exciting features for me but I do
like it I'm not going to complain about

44
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:15,540
like it I'm not going to complain about
 

45
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,899
like it I'm not going to complain about
extra features to the game and it adds a

46
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:17,909
extra features to the game and it adds a
 

47
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,420
extra features to the game and it adds a
little bit of fun I like the way they

48
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,430
little bit of fun I like the way they
 

49
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,690
little bit of fun I like the way they
have them set up I think the way they're

50
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:23,700
have them set up I think the way they're
 

51
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,870
have them set up I think the way they're
set up they can keep adding more and

52
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
set up they can keep adding more and
 

53
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,490
set up they can keep adding more and
more achievements to it and make diagram

54

more achievements to it and make diagram
 

55
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,240
more achievements to it and make diagram
bigger so just have basic ones for now

56
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:35,250
bigger so just have basic ones for now
 

57
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,999
bigger so just have basic ones for now
and also we have statistics which I am

58
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:40,009
and also we have statistics which I am
 

59
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,730
and also we have statistics which I am
which I like a lot more I like to know

60
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:43,740
which I like a lot more I like to know
 

61
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,230
which I like a lot more I like to know
what I've been up to in the game I've

62
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
what I've been up to in the game I've
 

63
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,990
what I've been up to in the game I've
only played an hour since the patch came

64
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,000
only played an hour since the patch came
 

65
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,080
only played an hour since the patch came
out and part of that was while I was afk

66
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,090
out and part of that was while I was afk
 

67
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,649
out and part of that was while I was afk
so maybe half an hour

68
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:02,659

 

69
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:10,880

yeah lots of cool things and let's hit

70
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:10,890
yeah lots of cool things and let's hit
 

71
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,460
yeah lots of cool things and let's hit
down of course one thing now you need

72
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:15,470
down of course one thing now you need
 

73
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:22,580
down of course one thing now you need
solid bladders but when you craft

74
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:22,590
solid bladders but when you craft
 

75
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,500
solid bladders but when you craft
ladders now you'll get two instead of

76
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:24,510
ladders now you'll get two instead of
 

77
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,390
ladders now you'll get two instead of
one so kind of isn't a big deal one

78
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,400
one so kind of isn't a big deal one
 

79
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,300
one so kind of isn't a big deal one
thing I do not like though is you can no

80
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,310
thing I do not like though is you can no
 

81
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,020
thing I do not like though is you can no
longer jump and catch a ladder that's 3i

82
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,030

 

83
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,030

which is something I do a lot normally

84
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
which is something I do a lot normally
 

85
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,259
which is something I do a lot normally
because I think the part that climbs the

86
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:45,269
because I think the part that climbs the
 

87
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,620
because I think the part that climbs the
ladder now is your feet your lower half

88
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:48,630
ladder now is your feet your lower half
 

89
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:56,000
ladder now is your feet your lower half
so kind of unfortunate I've been talking

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,010
so kind of unfortunate I've been talking
 

91
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,460
so kind of unfortunate I've been talking
with the guy called Neutron like I said

92
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,470
with the guy called Neutron like I said
 

93
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,500
with the guy called Neutron like I said
his name right he was having trouble

94
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,510
his name right he was having trouble
 

95
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,160
his name right he was having trouble
with his mob system at one point for and

96
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,170
with his mob system at one point for and
 

97
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,910
with his mob system at one point for and
I am pretty sure everybody has been mine

98
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
I am pretty sure everybody has been mine
 

99
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,220
I am pretty sure everybody has been mine
still worked but I noticed the rate was

100
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,230
still worked but I noticed the rate was
 

101
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,039
still worked but I noticed the rate was
a lot lower and now it's back to normal

102
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,049
a lot lower and now it's back to normal
 

103
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,590
a lot lower and now it's back to normal
that's 1.5 so that's cool it's working

104
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:18,600
that's 1.5 so that's cool it's working
 

105
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,030
that's 1.5 so that's cool it's working
very fast again of course the highlight

106
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
very fast again of course the highlight
 

107
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,830
very fast again of course the highlight
of the patch is probably the new booster

108
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:24,840
of the patch is probably the new booster
 

109
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,319
of the patch is probably the new booster
stuff ah that's what I've been playing

110
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,329
stuff ah that's what I've been playing
 

111
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:38,030
stuff ah that's what I've been playing
around with mostly so one thing I really

112
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,040
around with mostly so one thing I really
 

113
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,830
around with mostly so one thing I really
like about these things is it's now

114
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
like about these things is it's now
 

115
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,420
like about these things is it's now
possible to have mine carts going around

116
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,430
possible to have mine carts going around
 

117
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,590
possible to have mine carts going around
in an infinite loop without stopping

118
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,600
in an infinite loop without stopping
 

119
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,960
in an infinite loop without stopping
before that was a real problem because

120
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:50,970
before that was a real problem because
 

121
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,240
before that was a real problem because
that's what I was trying to do with my

122
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,250
that's what I was trying to do with my
 

123
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,509
that's what I was trying to do with my
storage room here have an infinite loop

124
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
storage room here have an infinite loop
 

125
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,960
storage room here have an infinite loop
and even now when you log out you'll

126
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,970
and even now when you log out you'll
 

127
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,360
and even now when you log out you'll
notice the minecarts just on an open

128
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,370
notice the minecarts just on an open
 

129
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:09,379
notice the minecarts just on an open
track if you leave and come back that's

130
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:09,389
track if you leave and come back that's
 

131
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,960
track if you leave and come back that's
loading slow

132
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:13,970

 

133
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,580

why is that loading so slow it keeps

134
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:19,590
why is that loading so slow it keeps
 

135
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,560
why is that loading so slow it keeps
going so they added while they add it

136
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:24,570
going so they added while they add it
 

137
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,830
going so they added while they add it
but now in the world saves it saves a

138
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
but now in the world saves it saves a
 

139
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,590
but now in the world saves it saves a
the momentum of the my card in the file

140
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:30,600
the momentum of the my card in the file
 

141
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,370
the momentum of the my card in the file
so when it loads the file it still has

142
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,380
so when it loads the file it still has
 

143
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,500
so when it loads the file it still has
the same momentum and it doesn't stop

144
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,510
the same momentum and it doesn't stop
 

145
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,280
the same momentum and it doesn't stop
dead on the track which is very cool

146
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,290
dead on the track which is very cool
 

147
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,960
dead on the track which is very cool
so I'll be able to hook up my mana card

148
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:44,970
so I'll be able to hook up my mana card
 

149
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,830
so I'll be able to hook up my mana card
system really easily now oh this is

150
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840
system really easily now oh this is
 

151
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,510
system really easily now oh this is
going to become very useful for my

152
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:50,520
going to become very useful for my
 

153
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,240
going to become very useful for my
secret project as well which I will

154
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,250
secret project as well which I will
 

155
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,740
secret project as well which I will
hopefully get to eventually I guess I

156
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:00,750
hopefully get to eventually I guess I
 

157
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,950
hopefully get to eventually I guess I
may as well show you how to graph the

158
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:03,960
may as well show you how to graph the
 

159
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,430
may as well show you how to graph the
new stuff even though you've probably

160
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
new stuff even though you've probably
 

161
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,279
new stuff even though you've probably

been getting like leg spikes but the new
leg spikes are different somehow but

331
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,110

yes hello saplings were randomly

332
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,120
yes hello saplings were randomly
 

333
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,620
yes hello saplings were randomly
switched kind of like many patches ago

334
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:45,630
switched kind of like many patches ago
 

335

when the tree's leaves randomly switched

336
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:48,620
when the tree's leaves randomly switched
 

337
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:55,840
when the tree's leaves randomly switched
to the three different kinds of leaves

338
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:55,850

 

339
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,830

I'm going to skip ahead today all right

340
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:00,840
I'm going to skip ahead today all right
 

341
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,070
I'm going to skip ahead today all right
this is a little better right

342
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,080
this is a little better right
 

343
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:12,230
this is a little better right
all right yes much better

344

all right yes much better
 

345
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,800
all right yes much better
so the saplings there's now three kinds

346
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:17,810
so the saplings there's now three kinds
 

347
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,860
so the saplings there's now three kinds
and I don't have to set the normal kind

348
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:20,870
and I don't have to set the normal kind
 

349
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,460
and I don't have to set the normal kind
and grow them with bonemeal I can grow

350
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,470
and grow them with bonemeal I can grow
 

351
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,320
and grow them with bonemeal I can grow
them in any biome I'm pretty sure even

352
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,330
them in any biome I'm pretty sure even
 

353
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,970
them in any biome I'm pretty sure even
though they're normally biome specific

354
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:30,980
though they're normally biome specific
 

355
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:40,130
though they're normally biome specific
which is weird and so now you have three

356
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,140
which is weird and so now you have three
 

357
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,460
which is weird and so now you have three
types of renewable work you got three

358
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:43,470
types of renewable work you got three
 

359
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:50,420
types of renewable work you got three
types of renewable wood which is cool I

360
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:50,430
types of renewable wood which is cool I
 

361
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,360
types of renewable wood which is cool I
just found out like two weeks ago that

362
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,370
just found out like two weeks ago that
 

363
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,770
just found out like two weeks ago that
there's this dark wood here I didn't

364
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:57,780
there's this dark wood here I didn't
 

365
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,870
there's this dark wood here I didn't
know that I thought it was the same as

know that I thought it was the same as
 

367
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:08,450
know that I thought it was the same as
the regular wood but it's not because I

368
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:08,460
the regular wood but it's not because I
 

369
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,490
the regular wood but it's not because I
don't have any of these trees really in

are alpha trees still it's possible to
 

447
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,730
are alpha trees still it's possible to
do that to make trees like this sort of

and I'm going to mix it with the leaves
 

457
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,030
and I'm going to mix it with the leaves
from these type of trees it's actually

from these type of trees it's actually
 

459
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,519
from these type of trees it's actually
something I never see people do for some

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,990
creeper head out of wooden leaves for
some reason oh wait now yeah is showing

484
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,000
some reason oh wait now yeah is showing
 

485
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,360
some reason oh wait now yeah is showing
that that you can mix different leaves

486
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,370
that that you can mix different leaves
 

487
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,799
that that you can mix different leaves
with different types of wood so I have

488
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:19,809
with different types of wood so I have
 

489
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,840
with different types of wood so I have
this type of wood from these trees with

490
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:22,850
this type of wood from these trees with
 

491
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,970
this type of wood from these trees with
leaves from these type of trees and it's

492
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:27,980
leaves from these type of trees and it's
 

493
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,370
leaves from these type of trees and it's
possible to mix the three types of wood

494
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:30,380
possible to mix the three types of wood
 

495
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,590
possible to mix the three types of wood
with the three types of leaves I think

496
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:32,600
with the three types of leaves I think
 

497
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,750
with the three types of leaves I think
that was my point and also I want to

498
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
that was my point and also I want to
 

499
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,419
that was my point and also I want to
show you guys because this isn't very

500
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:40,429
show you guys because this isn't very
 

501
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:43,980
show you guys because this isn't very
this isn't done very often I don't think

502
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:43,990
this isn't done very often I don't think
 

503
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,200
this isn't done very often I don't think
that you can make shapes and stuff out

504
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,210
that you can make shapes and stuff out
 

505
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,650
that you can make shapes and stuff out
of leaves this way which is especially

506
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:50,660
of leaves this way which is especially
 

507
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,840
of leaves this way which is especially
useful if you're making gardens and

508
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:52,850
useful if you're making gardens and
 

509
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,419
useful if you're making gardens and
stuff and you want leaves shape

510
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:55,429
stuff and you want leaves shape
 

511
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,419
stuff and you want leaves shape
different in different ways make vines

512
00:17:58,419 --> 00:17:58,429
different in different ways make vines
 

513
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,770
different in different ways make vines
or whatever as long as you have wood

514
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:02,780
or whatever as long as you have wood
 

515
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,640
or whatever as long as you have wood
within I think 4 blocks of a leaf the

516
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,650
within I think 4 blocks of a leaf the
 

517
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,799
within I think 4 blocks of a leaf the
leaf will not die something like that so

518
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:11,809
leaf will not die something like that so
 

519
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,570
leaf will not die something like that so
you can place your wood blocks and then

520
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:13,580
you can place your wood blocks and then
 

521
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,900
you can place your wood blocks and then
grow trees and then kill the trees and

522
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:16,910
grow trees and then kill the trees and
 

523
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,400
grow trees and then kill the trees and
their leaves will stay that on the logs

524
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,410
their leaves will stay that on the logs
 

525
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:28,849
their leaves will stay that on the logs
you placed first yeah okay

526
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:28,859

 

527
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,680

something else I'm noticing now is that

528
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:31,690
something else I'm noticing now is that
 

529
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,119
something else I'm noticing now is that
these new saplings don't like to grow in

530
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:35,129
these new saplings don't like to grow in
 

531
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:43,409
these new saplings don't like to grow in
closed-off space as it seems and not as

532
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:43,419
closed-off space as it seems and not as
 

533
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,509
closed-off space as it seems and not as
well as the other type the normal type

534
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:45,519
well as the other type the normal type
 

535
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,659
well as the other type the normal type
of trees like they really don't want to

536
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:51,669
of trees like they really don't want to
 

537
00:18:51,669 --> 00:19:00,580
of trees like they really don't want to
grow

538
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:00,590

 

539
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,620

they might not be able to

540
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:02,630
they might not be able to
 

541
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,540
they might not be able to
oh it might be because my class blocks

542
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:04,550
oh it might be because my class blocks
 

543
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,730
oh it might be because my class blocks
are too low they might need more

544
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:06,740
are too low they might need more
 

545
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,150
are too low they might need more
vertical space I'll look into that more

546
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
vertical space I'll look into that more
 

547
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,180
vertical space I'll look into that more
later I guess alright now we can talk

548
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,190
later I guess alright now we can talk
 

549
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,020
later I guess alright now we can talk
about the new powered rails and the

550
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,030
about the new powered rails and the
 

551
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,550
about the new powered rails and the
detectors as you can see this card is

552
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:24,560
detectors as you can see this card is
 

553
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,460
detectors as you can see this card is
still going it has been for I think two

554
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:27,470
still going it has been for I think two
 

555
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,430
still going it has been for I think two
hours now on this loop keeps working

556
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:30,440
hours now on this loop keeps working
 

557
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,510
hours now on this loop keeps working
even if you log off so I see a lot of

558
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:34,520
even if you log off so I see a lot of
 

559
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:42,430
even if you log off so I see a lot of
potential in this the new tracks they

560
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:42,440
potential in this the new tracks they
 

561
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,130
potential in this the new tracks they
can't curve at the moment I don't know

562
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,140
can't curve at the moment I don't know
 

563
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,730
can't curve at the moment I don't know
if they ever will and you need to power

564
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:48,740
if they ever will and you need to power
 

565
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,150
if they ever will and you need to power
them with redstone in order for them to

566
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
them with redstone in order for them to
 

567
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,320
them with redstone in order for them to
propel the cart otherwise they act as

568
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,330
propel the cart otherwise they act as
 

569
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,310
propel the cart otherwise they act as
brakes if I push his cart over the brake

570
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,320
brakes if I push his cart over the brake
 

571
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,420
brakes if I push his cart over the brake
it'll stop pretty much pretty instantly

572
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:09,430

 

573
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,250

if you apply power to it when it's on

574
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:12,260
if you apply power to it when it's on
 

575
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:18,400
if you apply power to it when it's on
the powered rail nothing happens it

576
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,410
the powered rail nothing happens it
 

577
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,730
the powered rail nothing happens it
needs to be going at direction in order

578
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:21,740
needs to be going at direction in order
 

579
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,970
needs to be going at direction in order
for it to get boosted so what that means

580
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:27,980
for it to get boosted so what that means
 

581
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,010
for it to get boosted so what that means
is you still need some way to get the

582
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,020
is you still need some way to get the
 

583
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
is you still need some way to get the
carts going so we'll still probably need

584
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,030
carts going so we'll still probably need
 

585
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,540
carts going so we'll still probably need
to use door boosters or something like

586
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,550
to use door boosters or something like
 

587
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:40,450
to use door boosters or something like
that so the old way is not completely

588
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:40,460
that so the old way is not completely
 

589
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:54,730
that so the old way is not completely
lost and yeah it's a it's launched

590
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:54,740

 

591
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,710

but you'll notice it how far'd that go

592
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:57,720
but you'll notice it how far'd that go
 

593
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,470
but you'll notice it how far'd that go
one two three four five six seven eight

594
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
one two three four five six seven eight
 

595
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,850
one two three four five six seven eight
nine well ten tracks this one's going

596
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:04,860
nine well ten tracks this one's going
 

597
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,170
nine well ten tracks this one's going
one two three four five six seven eight

598
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,180
one two three four five six seven eight
 

599
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,600
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so this

600
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:14,610
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so this
 

601
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,550
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so this
one's going farther without being

602
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:16,560
one's going farther without being
 

603
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,910
one's going farther without being
boosted and so what that means is these

604
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:21,920
boosted and so what that means is these
 

605
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,940
boosted and so what that means is these
boosters do not instantly bring the card

606
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:25,950
boosters do not instantly bring the card
 

607
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,410
boosters do not instantly bring the card
up to speed so you'll need several of

608
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:30,420
up to speed so you'll need several of
 

609
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:40,820
up to speed so you'll need several of
them the mine card or the Minecraft Wiki

610
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:40,830
them the mine card or the Minecraft Wiki
 

611
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,680
them the mine card or the Minecraft Wiki
says like if you're in a cart up it

612
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:45,690
says like if you're in a cart up it
 

613
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,330
says like if you're in a cart up it
loses momentum a lot slower so if you're

614
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,340
loses momentum a lot slower so if you're
 

615
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,910
loses momentum a lot slower so if you're
in a cart to maintain maximum speed you

616
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:52,920
in a cart to maintain maximum speed you
 

617
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,410
in a cart to maintain maximum speed you
need to space the powered boosters 16

618
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,420
need to space the powered boosters 16
 

619
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,890
need to space the powered boosters 16
blocks apart for maximum speed and they

620
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:00,900
blocks apart for maximum speed and they
 

621
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,680
blocks apart for maximum speed and they
go up to 128 blocks in between each

622
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:06,690
go up to 128 blocks in between each
 

623
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:11,960
go up to 128 blocks in between each
other so to keep the car going at eight

624
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:11,970
other so to keep the car going at eight
 

625
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,550
other so to keep the car going at eight
blocks per second or whatever you need

626
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:13,560
blocks per second or whatever you need
 

627
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,030
blocks per second or whatever you need
them 16 blocks of parts well

628
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,040
them 16 blocks of parts well
 

629
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,420
them 16 blocks of parts well
one every 16 blocks that's that's fairly

630
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,430
one every 16 blocks that's that's fairly
 

631
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:27,500
one every 16 blocks that's that's fairly
reasonable I'd say but if you're out of

632
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,510
reasonable I'd say but if you're out of
 

633
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,410
reasonable I'd say but if you're out of
the cart they lose momentum a lot faster

634
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:30,420
the cart they lose momentum a lot faster
 

635
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,190
the cart they lose momentum a lot faster
a lot lot faster I think you need to

636
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,200
a lot lot faster I think you need to
 

637
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,570
a lot lot faster I think you need to
space some probably three or four blocks

638
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:41,580
space some probably three or four blocks
 

639
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,540
space some probably three or four blocks
of parts to keep the cart going at a

640
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:44,550
of parts to keep the cart going at a
 

641
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,300
of parts to keep the cart going at a
decent speed oh yeah another thing about

642
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,310
decent speed oh yeah another thing about
 

643
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:53,240
decent speed oh yeah another thing about
these which i think is pretty cool if

644
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,250
these which i think is pretty cool if
 

645
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,980
these which i think is pretty cool if
you apply power to the booster it

646
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,990
you apply power to the booster it
 

647
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,160
you apply power to the booster it
transfers to all adjacent ones

648
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,170
transfers to all adjacent ones
 

649
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,780
transfers to all adjacent ones
so this one torch is powering all these

650
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:03,790
so this one torch is powering all these
 

651
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,900
so this one torch is powering all these
boosters so that's cool I'm guessing it

652
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:08,910
boosters so that's cool I'm guessing it
 

653
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:15,750
boosters so that's cool I'm guessing it
goes for 16 blocks but I'm not sure the

654
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
goes for 16 blocks but I'm not sure the
 

655
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,150
goes for 16 blocks but I'm not sure the
best way of powering them probably is to

656
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,160
best way of powering them probably is to
 

657
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,550
best way of powering them probably is to
put the torch underneath the boosters

658
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:20,560
put the torch underneath the boosters
 

659
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,570
put the torch underneath the boosters
so let's hidden instead of on the side

660
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,580
so let's hidden instead of on the side
 

661
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:34,890
so let's hidden instead of on the side
and the detector rails they send out

662
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:34,900
and the detector rails they send out
 

663
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,590
and the detector rails they send out
power I think if you're in the cards and

664
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
power I think if you're in the cards and
 

665
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,430
power I think if you're in the cards and
go over them they don't detect empty

666
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
go over them they don't detect empty
 

667
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,650
go over them they don't detect empty
cards

668
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:42,660
cards
 

669
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,810
cards
so you still might need to use wooden

670
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:45,820
so you still might need to use wooden
 

671
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,450
so you still might need to use wooden
pressure plates for that if you need to

672
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:48,460
pressure plates for that if you need to
 

673
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,830
pressure plates for that if you need to
detect empty cards all they do detect

674
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
detect empty cards all they do detect
 

675
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:11,630
detect empty cards all they do detect
empty cards so very interesting mm-hmm

676
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:11,640

 

677
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,760

okay I'm going to get my thoughts

678
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:14,770
okay I'm going to get my thoughts
 

679
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,200
okay I'm going to get my thoughts
together a little bit here and then

680
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,210
together a little bit here and then
 

681
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,970
together a little bit here and then
they'll start talking some more the old

682
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:20,980
they'll start talking some more the old
 

683
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,550
they'll start talking some more the old
booster methods still work which is

684
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:23,560
booster methods still work which is
 

685
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:30,120
booster methods still work which is
great so old stations should still keep

686
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,130
great so old stations should still keep
 

687
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,010
great so old stations should still keep
working and old applications like Pez

688
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,020
working and old applications like Pez
 

689
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:40,380
working and old applications like Pez
dispensers and that still they'll still

690
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,390
dispensers and that still they'll still
 

691
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,750
dispensers and that still they'll still
probably be used but they might be done

692
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:42,760
probably be used but they might be done
 

693
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,780
probably be used but they might be done
a little differently now the test I'm

694
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:45,790
a little differently now the test I'm
 

695
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,830
a little differently now the test I'm
doing is just placing a minecart here

696
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:48,840
doing is just placing a minecart here
 

697
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,130
doing is just placing a minecart here
this is my third time doing this now and

698
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,140
this is my third time doing this now and
 

699
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:58,850
this is my third time doing this now and
all three times it ends up exactly here

700
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:58,860
all three times it ends up exactly here
 

701
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,350
all three times it ends up exactly here
that's how far it goes with that boost

702
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
that's how far it goes with that boost
 

703
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,840
that's how far it goes with that boost
so what I want to see is if it's going

704
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:06,850
so what I want to see is if it's going
 

705
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,920
so what I want to see is if it's going
to go farther

706
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:09,930

 

707
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:36,050

actually that's no I hate doing that

708
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,060

 

709
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,850

okay I'm going to just have one I'm

710
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:41,860
okay I'm going to just have one I'm
 

711
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,380
okay I'm going to just have one I'm
going to place one of these boosters

712
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:43,390
going to place one of these boosters
 

713
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,910
going to place one of these boosters
here now I see if it goes farther use

714
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:47,920
here now I see if it goes farther use
 

715
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,610
here now I see if it goes farther use
mixing the old booster system with the

716
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:50,620
mixing the old booster system with the
 

717
00:25:50,620 --> 00:26:06,150
mixing the old booster system with the
new the new tracks mmm looks about the

718
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,160
new the new tracks mmm looks about the
 

719
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,310
new the new tracks mmm looks about the
same to me so I think these things only

720
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,320
same to me so I think these things only
 

721
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,610
same to me so I think these things only
add momentum if if the carts lower going

722
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:17,620
add momentum if if the carts lower going
 

723
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,370
add momentum if if the carts lower going
slower than the maximum momentum that

724
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,380
slower than the maximum momentum that
 

725
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,910
slower than the maximum momentum that
they can apply and the old the old

726
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:26,920
they can apply and the old the old
 

727
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,560
they can apply and the old the old
boosters that make cards add momentum

728
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:31,570
boosters that make cards add momentum
 

729
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,650
boosters that make cards add momentum
higher than the maximum for these so I

730
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:34,660
higher than the maximum for these so I
 

731
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,270
higher than the maximum for these so I
think that's why I didn't go any further

732
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,280

 

733
00:26:40,280 --> 00:27:02,570

kind of interesting I called ham 464 it

734
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:02,580
kind of interesting I called ham 464 it
 

735
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,180
kind of interesting I called ham 464 it
just started during first time singing

736
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,190
just started during first time singing
 

737
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,070
just started during first time singing
it

738
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,080
it
 

739
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,330
it
little worried something Bad's gonna

740
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:09,340
little worried something Bad's gonna
 

741
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,580
little worried something Bad's gonna
happen

742
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:15,590

 

743
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,310

see like a line in the sky right down

744
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,320
see like a line in the sky right down
 

745
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,890
see like a line in the sky right down
here

746
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:20,900

 

747
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,740

one

748
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:22,750
one
 

749
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:29,520
one
down here too

750
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:29,530

 

751
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:37,200

it's pretty cool though I liked it

752
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,210

 

753
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,870

I was just in the middle of setting

754
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:39,880
I was just in the middle of setting
 

755
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:50,460
I was just in the middle of setting
something up and I just pray

756
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,470

 

757
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,639

yeah I think people still be using door

758
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:53,649
yeah I think people still be using door
 

759
00:27:53,649 --> 00:28:00,850
yeah I think people still be using door
boosters and stuff like that

760
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:00,860

 

761
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,639

originally you know I thought the way

762
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:04,649
originally you know I thought the way
 

763
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,739
originally you know I thought the way
they were going to implement these new

764
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:06,749
they were going to implement these new
 

765
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:12,989
they were going to implement these new
power rails was a

766
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:12,999

 

767
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:19,539

I really like the ring

768
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:19,549

 

769
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:23,229

I thought a cart would like go over to

770
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:23,239
I thought a cart would like go over to
 

771
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:25,960
I thought a cart would like go over to
the break and stop and then you could

772
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:25,970
the break and stop and then you could
 

773
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,530
the break and stop and then you could
hook up

774
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:28,540

 

775
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,830

a button to the power rail and when you

776
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
a button to the power rail and when you
 

777
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,510
a button to the power rail and when you
press the button it would send power to

778
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
press the button it would send power to
 

779
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,040
press the button it would send power to
it and then it would shoot the card off

780
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,050
it and then it would shoot the card off
 

781
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,640
it and then it would shoot the card off
that's how I thought it was gonna work

782
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,650
that's how I thought it was gonna work
 

783
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,320
that's how I thought it was gonna work
that would have been a lot simpler I

784
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,330
that would have been a lot simpler I
 

785
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,200
that would have been a lot simpler I
think but then it would have been only

786
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,210
think but then it would have been only
 

787
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:49,940
think but then it would have been only
one direction

788
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:49,950

 

789
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,149

but with door boosters

790
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:53,159
but with door boosters
 

791
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,380
but with door boosters
um

792
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,390

 

793
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,010

they have this slope here which is what

794
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,020
they have this slope here which is what
 

795
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,810
they have this slope here which is what
will

796
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:01,820
will
 

797
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,870
will
allow the carts to move forward

798
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:07,880

 

799
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,010

let's try this out I got one booster

800
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,020
let's try this out I got one booster
 

801
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,850
let's try this out I got one booster
here a booster here

802
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:14,860

 

803
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,560

I don't know what's gonna happen let's

804
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:16,570
I don't know what's gonna happen let's
 

805
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:27,160
I don't know what's gonna happen let's
see

806
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,170

 

807
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,190

to make it

808
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200

 

809
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,370

his barely got on the door

810
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:34,380
his barely got on the door
 

811

847
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,630
that if you can't do it I'm sure you can
something now but if you can't read that
