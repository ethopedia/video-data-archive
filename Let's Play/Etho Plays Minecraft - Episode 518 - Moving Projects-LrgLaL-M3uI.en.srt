is finally done just have to put a layer

38
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,260
is finally done just have to put a layer
 

39
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,260
is finally done just have to put a layer
leaves over this to finish it up so that

40
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,270
leaves over this to finish it up so that
 

41
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,810
leaves over this to finish it up so that
it has a bit of a bit more texture to it

42
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:14,820
it has a bit of a bit more texture to it
 

43
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,260
it has a bit of a bit more texture to it
than just having the clay here and I've

44
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,270
than just having the clay here and I've
 

45
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,359
than just having the clay here and I've
taken some some pauses in between

46
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:20,369
taken some some pauses in between
 

47
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,219
taken some some pauses in between
looking at it and I think it does look a

48
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:22,229
looking at it and I think it does look a
 

49
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,310
looking at it and I think it does look a
lot better with the leaves on actually

50
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
lot better with the leaves on actually
 

51
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,530
lot better with the leaves on actually
compared to the clay I don't have a

52
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:27,540
compared to the clay I don't have a
 

53
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,030
compared to the clay I don't have a
before-and-after for you but here's the

54
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
before-and-after for you but here's the
 

55
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,999
before-and-after for you but here's the
after now that it's all done look at

56
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:32,009
after now that it's all done look at
 

57
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,100
after now that it's all done look at
that oh snap finally got it done it was

58
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,110
that oh snap finally got it done it was
 

59
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,230
that oh snap finally got it done it was
actually a ridiculous amount of leaves

60
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,240
actually a ridiculous amount of leaves
 

61
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,149
actually a ridiculous amount of leaves
on this thing how how how big is this

62
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:41,159
on this thing how how how big is this
 

63
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,980
on this thing how how how big is this
area so we're at about a hundred and

64
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:45,990
area so we're at about a hundred and
 

65
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,980
area so we're at about a hundred and
fifteen here if we run all the way to

66
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:48,990
fifteen here if we run all the way to
 

67
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,719
fifteen here if we run all the way to
the other side cuz I felt like I just

68
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:50,729
the other side cuz I felt like I just
 

69
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,670
the other side cuz I felt like I just
dumped inventory after inventory on this

70
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:52,680
dumped inventory after inventory on this
 

71
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,350
dumped inventory after inventory on this
thing and it still wasn't done it still

72
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,360
thing and it still wasn't done it still
 

73
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,870
thing and it still wasn't done it still
wasn't done

74
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:55,880
wasn't done
 

75
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,810
wasn't done
115 all the way to about one about forty

76
00:01:59,810 --> 00:01:59,820
115 all the way to about one about forty
 

77
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,249
115 all the way to about one about forty
here okay and then this way we're about

78
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,259
here okay and then this way we're about
 

79
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,490
here okay and then this way we're about
minus 280 I'm gonna do some quick math

80
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:07,500
minus 280 I'm gonna do some quick math
 

81
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,040
minus 280 I'm gonna do some quick math
to figure out how many stacks of leaves

82
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,050
to figure out how many stacks of leaves
 

83
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,920
to figure out how many stacks of leaves
I actually dropped on this minus 280 all

84
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:12,930
I actually dropped on this minus 280 all
 

85
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,820
I actually dropped on this minus 280 all
the way to

86
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:13,830
the way to
 

87
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,600
the way to
you 2:05 okay so that's about 75 bucks

88
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:19,610
you 2:05 okay so that's about 75 bucks
 

89
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,540
you 2:05 okay so that's about 75 bucks
aha so it's 75 by 75 roughly switch is

90
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:25,550
aha so it's 75 by 75 roughly switch is
 

91
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,450
aha so it's 75 by 75 roughly switch is
5625 leaves that had to be placed plus I

92
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:29,460
5625 leaves that had to be placed plus I
 

93
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,830
5625 leaves that had to be placed plus I
did that with the clay as well so it's

94
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
did that with the clay as well so it's
 

95
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,160
did that with the clay as well so it's
like double that and then there's a

96
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,170
like double that and then there's a
 

97
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,690
like double that and then there's a
section that kind of pops out a little

98
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:35,700
section that kind of pops out a little
 

99
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,970
section that kind of pops out a little
bit over there so all in all it was

100
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:37,980
bit over there so all in all it was
 

101
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,050
bit over there so all in all it was
probably actually about six thousand or

102
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,060
probably actually about six thousand or
 

103
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,910
probably actually about six thousand or
so blocks so somewhere between 90 and

104
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
so blocks so somewhere between 90 and
 

105
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,170
so blocks so somewhere between 90 and
100 stacks of leaves went into this

106
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:47,180
100 stacks of leaves went into this
 

107
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,840
100 stacks of leaves went into this
uh-huh but it's not done unfortunately

108
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:50,850
uh-huh but it's not done unfortunately
 

109

111
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,460
we still got it we got to add the the
trees that connect up to the canopy

112
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:55,470
trees that connect up to the canopy
 

113
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,590
trees that connect up to the canopy
right now it's just floating still but

here which is kind of cool we'll
 

193
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,690
here which is kind of cool we'll
probably have to clean it up

kind of want to see it in action because
 

209
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,960
kind of want to see it in action because
I don't think we did much with it so

210
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:10,970
I don't think we did much with it so
 

211
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,280
I don't think we did much with it so
this is the buttons that started I'm

pretty sure let's just see if it works

214
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:15,630
pretty sure let's just see if it works
 

215
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,230
pretty sure let's just see if it works
at all so the way this works is it's

216
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240
at all so the way this works is it's
 

217
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,400
at all so the way this works is it's

supposed to send off the storage
 

219
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,360
supposed to send off the storage
minecarts to one of the three stations

220
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,370
minecarts to one of the three stations
 

221
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,810
minecarts to one of the three stations
we have set up around here oh did they

222

minecarts
 

237
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,570
minecarts
so that we know where we want them to

238
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:53,580
so that we know where we want them to
 

239
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,460
so that we know where we want them to
end up at the next station so goes from

240
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:55,470
end up at the next station so goes from
 

241
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,770
end up at the next station so goes from
left to right top to bottom sort of

242
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:57,780
left to right top to bottom sort of
 

243
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,060
left to right top to bottom sort of
thing so now let's press this again whoo

it actually works what what I thought we
had a lot left to do on this well not a

258
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:31,740
had a lot left to do on this well not a
 

259
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,870

lot a lot left but I thought there was

260
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
lot a lot left but I thought there was
 

261
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,180
lot a lot left but I thought there was
like one big problem

262
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,190
like one big problem
 

263
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,130
like one big problem
okay let's try send it to the next

264
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,140
okay let's try send it to the next
 

265
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,830
okay let's try send it to the next
station then maybe I just finished one

266
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
station then maybe I just finished one
 

267
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,120
station then maybe I just finished one
of the station's and I was supposed to

268
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,130
of the station's and I was supposed to
 

269
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,290
of the station's and I was supposed to
do the other ones and I never did

270
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,300
do the other ones and I never did
 

271
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,279
do the other ones and I never did
because this station is definitely

272
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,289
because this station is definitely
 

273
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,810
because this station is definitely
working

274
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:48,820

 

275
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:56,730

ooh okay there's a problem looks like

276
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:56,740
ooh okay there's a problem looks like
 

277
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,810
ooh okay there's a problem looks like
they can't fit through there why is this

278
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:00,820
they can't fit through there why is this
 

279
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,020
they can't fit through there why is this
here okay so that's part of a build I

280
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,030
here okay so that's part of a build I
 

281
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,500
here okay so that's part of a build I
meant to do that oh dear

282
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:12,510

 

283
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,760

okay could have been worse

284
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,770
okay could have been worse
 

285
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,380
okay could have been worse
so it's looking like the main thing we

286
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,390
so it's looking like the main thing we
 

287
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,270
so it's looking like the main thing we
need to do with this is just like get it

288
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
need to do with this is just like get it
 

289
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,430
need to do with this is just like get it
polished up I did it looking the way we

290
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
polished up I did it looking the way we
 

291
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,850
polished up I did it looking the way we
want make sure all the tracks are

292
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:25,860
want make sure all the tracks are
 

293
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,160
want make sure all the tracks are
working properly and there's a lot of

294
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,170
working properly and there's a lot of
 

295
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,960
working properly and there's a lot of
areas I've found where mobs will be able

296
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:30,970
areas I've found where mobs will be able
 

297
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,360
areas I've found where mobs will be able
to spawn or walk on the tracks and we

298
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,370
to spawn or walk on the tracks and we
 

299
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,890
to spawn or walk on the tracks and we
got to make sure that doesn't happen too

300
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:34,900
got to make sure that doesn't happen too
 

301
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,710
got to make sure that doesn't happen too
and if because if the minecarts run into

302
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:37,720
and if because if the minecarts run into
 

303
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,240
and if because if the minecarts run into
a mob or something that's gonna mess

304
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,250
a mob or something that's gonna mess
 

305
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,970
a mob or something that's gonna mess
everything up and the storage room is

306
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:41,980
everything up and the storage room is
 

307
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,890
everything up and the storage room is
basically useless if they go out of

308
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:43,900
basically useless if they go out of
 

309
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,080
basically useless if they go out of
order or anything like that they get

310
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,090
order or anything like that they get
 

311
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,270
order or anything like that they get
stuck on the track somewhere so we got a

312
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,280
stuck on the track somewhere so we got a
 

313
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,650
stuck on the track somewhere so we got a
we got to make sure that never happens

314
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:49,660
we got to make sure that never happens
 

315
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,040
we got to make sure that never happens
so I'm gonna replace the stone here with

316
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,050
so I'm gonna replace the stone here with
 

317
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,110
so I'm gonna replace the stone here with
brick and I think we'll put some

318
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
brick and I think we'll put some
 

319
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,000
brick and I think we'll put some
spotlights in the bottom so that uh can

320
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,010
spotlights in the bottom so that uh can
 

321
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,120
spotlights in the bottom so that uh can
we change that actually I think we can

322
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,130
we change that actually I think we can
 

323
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,680
we change that actually I think we can
so that my carts look nice and bright

324
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:04,690
so that my carts look nice and bright
 

325
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,630
so that my carts look nice and bright
when they're here uh-huh

326
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:06,640
when they're here uh-huh
 

327
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,280
when they're here uh-huh
so we have a lot of areas like this

328
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,290
so we have a lot of areas like this
 

329
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,320
so we have a lot of areas like this
where it's opened up and we gotta we

330
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,330
where it's opened up and we gotta we
 

331
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,120
where it's opened up and we gotta we
gotta seal it off make sure no mobs can

332
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,130
gotta seal it off make sure no mobs can
 

333
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,240
gotta seal it off make sure no mobs can
get in there land on the track get in

334
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,250
get in there land on the track get in
 

335
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,850
get in there land on the track get in
the way you know so we gotta try make

336
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:17,860
the way you know so we gotta try make
 

337
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,560
the way you know so we gotta try make
that look natural blend it into the

338
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:19,570
that look natural blend it into the
 

339
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,530
that look natural blend it into the
terrain and then we also have areas like

340
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:22,540
terrain and then we also have areas like
 

341
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,290
terrain and then we also have areas like
that over there where the tractors

342
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,300
that over there where the tractors
 

343
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,390
that over there where the tractors
passes out into the open which doesn't

344
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,400
passes out into the open which doesn't
 

345
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,830
passes out into the open which doesn't
look like a big deal but like a mop

346
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:28,840
look like a big deal but like a mop
 

347
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,420
look like a big deal but like a mop
could be up here and then just get

348
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,430
could be up here and then just get
 

349
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,770
could be up here and then just get
knocked down by another mob or something

350
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:31,780
knocked down by another mob or something
 

351
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,050
knocked down by another mob or something
land on the track and then a minecart

352
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,060
land on the track and then a minecart
 

353
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,089
land on the track and then a minecart
will run into it and mess everything up

354
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:36,099
will run into it and mess everything up
 

355
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,210
will run into it and mess everything up
so anything like that we have to deal

356
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,220
so anything like that we have to deal
 

357
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,560
so anything like that we have to deal
with so I'm going to build like a tunnel

358
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:40,570
with so I'm going to build like a tunnel
 

359
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,830
with so I'm going to build like a tunnel
here probably that will hopefully still

360
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:43,840
here probably that will hopefully still
 

361
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,970
here probably that will hopefully still
look decent but we'll be safe from from

362
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:47,980
look decent but we'll be safe from from
 

363
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,620
look decent but we'll be safe from from
mobs landing on it so I think we'll do

364
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:49,630
mobs landing on it so I think we'll do
 

365
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,710
mobs landing on it so I think we'll do
like some fences and then put a a top on

366
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
like some fences and then put a a top on
 

367
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,670
like some fences and then put a a top on
that and I also found some parts of the

368
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:56,680
that and I also found some parts of the
 

369
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,320
that and I also found some parts of the
track here that have these really long

370
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,330
track here that have these really long
 

371
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,840
track here that have these really long
stretches with no power rails for some

372
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:00,850
stretches with no power rails for some
 

373
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,370
stretches with no power rails for some
reason I must have been low when I

374
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:02,380
reason I must have been low when I
 

375
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,890
reason I must have been low when I
built these so I'm gonna make sure

376
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:04,900
built these so I'm gonna make sure
 

377
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,810
built these so I'm gonna make sure
they're they're solid filled we're gonna

378
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:06,820
they're they're solid filled we're gonna
 

379
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,550
they're they're solid filled we're gonna
need a whole bunch of glass for one part

380
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
need a whole bunch of glass for one part
 

381
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,440
need a whole bunch of glass for one part
of the tunnel there so I decided to hop

382
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,450
of the tunnel there so I decided to hop
 

383
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,510
of the tunnel there so I decided to hop
over to the super smelter and finally

384
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,520
over to the super smelter and finally
 

385
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,900
over to the super smelter and finally
clean it out so all the furnaces had a

386
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:15,910
clean it out so all the furnaces had a
 

387
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,760
clean it out so all the furnaces had a
bunch of drown mushroom blocks in

388
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:17,770
bunch of drown mushroom blocks in
 

389
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,140
bunch of drown mushroom blocks in
because that's what we were using as

390
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,150
because that's what we were using as
 

391
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,110
because that's what we were using as
fuel before this update now they don't

392
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,120
fuel before this update now they don't
 

393
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,910
fuel before this update now they don't
burn though so they were clogging up the

394
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
burn though so they were clogging up the
 

395
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,760
burn though so they were clogging up the
furnaces we had to take them out and get

396
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:26,770
furnaces we had to take them out and get
 

397
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,840
furnaces we had to take them out and get
a new fuel source and I decided let's go

398
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:30,850
a new fuel source and I decided let's go
 

399
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,320
a new fuel source and I decided let's go
for spruce planks is what we're gonna be

400
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,330
for spruce planks is what we're gonna be
 

401
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,790
for spruce planks is what we're gonna be
using for fuel I know a lot of you told

402
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:35,800
using for fuel I know a lot of you told
 

403
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,760
using for fuel I know a lot of you told
me to use kelp but we don't really want

404
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:38,770
me to use kelp but we don't really want
 

405
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,190
me to use kelp but we don't really want
like a long burning fuel cuz if there's

406
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
like a long burning fuel cuz if there's
 

407
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,460
like a long burning fuel cuz if there's
only one item in the furnaces it's

408
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,470
only one item in the furnaces it's
 

409
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,370
only one item in the furnaces it's
pretty wasteful unless it's really easy

410
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,380
pretty wasteful unless it's really easy
 

411
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,930
pretty wasteful unless it's really easy
to farm I haven't actually looked into

412
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:48,940
to farm I haven't actually looked into
 

413
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,350
to farm I haven't actually looked into
it too much to be honest and just so I

414
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,360
it too much to be honest and just so I
 

415
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,230
it too much to be honest and just so I
know this is the fuel spot I'm gonna put

416
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,240
know this is the fuel spot I'm gonna put
 

417
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,840
know this is the fuel spot I'm gonna put
that there cuz I just put some sand in

418
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:57,850
that there cuz I just put some sand in
 

419
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,900
that there cuz I just put some sand in
here thinking this is where I smelt it

420
00:09:59,900 --> 00:09:59,910
here thinking this is where I smelt it
 

421
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,520
here thinking this is where I smelt it
that's where we got a fuel it's okay

422
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:02,530
that's where we got a fuel it's okay
 

423
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,410
that's where we got a fuel it's okay
this is where we smell things over here

424
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:04,420
this is where we smell things over here
 

425
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,170
this is where we smell things over here
so let's let's get our sand we'll throw

426
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:07,180
so let's let's get our sand we'll throw
 

427
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,560
so let's let's get our sand we'll throw
that in here and make sure this still

428
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:10,570
that in here and make sure this still
 

429
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,010
that in here and make sure this still
works I think it should be fine though

430
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,020
works I think it should be fine though
 

431
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,300
works I think it should be fine though
it's been a while since I last used it

432
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,310
it's been a while since I last used it
 

433
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,820
it's been a while since I last used it
actually it's like when once you do like

434
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:17,830
actually it's like when once you do like
 

435
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,410
actually it's like when once you do like
a big load of glass or whatever it lasts

436
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,420
a big load of glass or whatever it lasts
 

437
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:25,310
a big load of glass or whatever it lasts
for a long time okay elevator stork's oh

is where we hope the ender pearl doesn't

464
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:25,970
is where we hope the ender pearl doesn't
 

465
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,590

hit the wall okay we made to the bottom

466
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
hit the wall okay we made to the bottom
 

467
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,370

excellent

468

excellent
 

469
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,960
excellent
get out of here cool so I think the

470
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:34,970
get out of here cool so I think the
 

471
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,360
get out of here cool so I think the
whole minecart track is enclosed now

472
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,370
whole minecart track is enclosed now
 

473
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,220
whole minecart track is enclosed now
there's like a vertical drop there we

474
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,230
there's like a vertical drop there we
 

475
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,530
there's like a vertical drop there we
had to seal off we got our tunnels

476
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:41,540
had to seal off we got our tunnels
 

477
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,070
had to seal off we got our tunnels
there's one over there and we got one

478
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:45,080
there's one over there and we got one
 

479
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,690
there's one over there and we got one
over there and there's one more over

480
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:46,700
over there and there's one more over
 

481
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,250
over there and there's one more over
there too

482
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,260
there too
 

483
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,530
there too
okay wait a minute here it looks like

484
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:50,540
okay wait a minute here it looks like
 

485
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,420
okay wait a minute here it looks like
there is actually a problem that needs

486
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,430
there is actually a problem that needs
 

487
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:58,750
there is actually a problem that needs
to be solved when we use this just

488
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:58,760
to be solved when we use this just
 

489
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,949
to be solved when we use this just
listen to the minecarts

490
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959

 

491
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,619

two of them go away to the next station

492
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:05,629
two of them go away to the next station
 

493
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,340
two of them go away to the next station
but for some reason a lot of them gets

494
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,350
but for some reason a lot of them gets
 

495
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,299
but for some reason a lot of them gets
stuck here like eight of them will get

496
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:13,309
stuck here like eight of them will get
 

497
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:16,059
stuck here like eight of them will get
stuck out of the den so I've got to

498
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:16,069
stuck out of the den so I've got to
 

499
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,949
stuck out of the den so I've got to
figure out why that's happening and fix

500
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:17,959
figure out why that's happening and fix
 

501
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,559
figure out why that's happening and fix
it we have one station that does work

502
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:20,569
it we have one station that does work
 

503
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,379
it we have one station that does work
and the other two don't but the one that

504
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:23,389
and the other two don't but the one that
 

505
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:26,710
and the other two don't but the one that
does work this is set to four here so

506
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
does work this is set to four here so
 

507
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,179
does work this is set to four here so
maybe that was a small little oversight

508
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:31,189
maybe that was a small little oversight
 

509
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:32,819
maybe that was a small little oversight
and maybe it'll work now we'll hope

510
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:32,829
and maybe it'll work now we'll hope
 

511
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:36,669
and maybe it'll work now we'll hope
without having to get really complicated

512
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:36,679
without having to get really complicated
 

513
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,980
without having to get really complicated
here let's try it again

514
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:41,990

 

515
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,760

oh I think they went way

516
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:47,770

 

517
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,650

no they didn't they're there jamm still

518
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:49,660
no they didn't they're there jamm still
 

519
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,480
no they didn't they're there jamm still
ok so that wasn't it it's something else

520
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,490
ok so that wasn't it it's something else
 

521
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,300
ok so that wasn't it it's something else
I guess there's no redstone controlling

522
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,310
I guess there's no redstone controlling
 

523
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,520
I guess there's no redstone controlling
these junctions like there's no I

524
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:56,530
these junctions like there's no I
 

525
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,720
these junctions like there's no I
thought there was like redstone torches

526
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:57,730
thought there was like redstone torches
 

527
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,570
thought there was like redstone torches
underneath or something no so they're

528
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:00,580
underneath or something no so they're
 

529
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,040
underneath or something no so they're
all they're all facing the wrong way

530
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,050
all they're all facing the wrong way
 

531
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,890
all they're all facing the wrong way
that's all it is so we gotta we gotta

532
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:04,900
that's all it is so we gotta we gotta
 

533
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,700
that's all it is so we gotta we gotta
flip them around so instead of

534
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:07,710
flip them around so instead of
 

535
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,570
flip them around so instead of
connecting to that rail it needs to

536
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,580
connecting to that rail it needs to
 

537
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,610
connecting to that rail it needs to
connect to that one might be a little

538
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:11,620
connect to that one might be a little
 

539
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,780
connect to that one might be a little
hard to do though cuz yeah the north's

540
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:15,790
hard to do though cuz yeah the north's
 

541
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,210
hard to do though cuz yeah the north's
or the default is to go into this one

542
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:18,220
or the default is to go into this one
 

543
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,310
or the default is to go into this one
right would you make it go that way if

544
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
right would you make it go that way if
 

545
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,280
right would you make it go that way if
we do that but then if we put this one

546
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,290
we do that but then if we put this one
 

547
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,830
we do that but then if we put this one
back it's facing the wrong way if we put

548
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:28,840
back it's facing the wrong way if we put
 

549
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,140
back it's facing the wrong way if we put
that there doesn't connect so this needs

550
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,150
that there doesn't connect so this needs
 

551
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,040
that there doesn't connect so this needs
then connect like this yes yes very good

552
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,050
then connect like this yes yes very good
 

553
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,930
then connect like this yes yes very good
and if this goes down then it's correct

554
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:36,940
and if this goes down then it's correct
 

555
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,750
and if this goes down then it's correct
and I want to check something out here

556
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
and I want to check something out here
 

557
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,650
and I want to check something out here
let's grab a track can we name a storage

558
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:43,660
let's grab a track can we name a storage
 

559
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,310
let's grab a track can we name a storage
minecart and have it keep the name so

560
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,320
minecart and have it keep the name so
 

561
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,110
minecart and have it keep the name so
let's let's say for example one of these

562
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
let's let's say for example one of these
 

563
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,610
let's let's say for example one of these
is gonna be our play chest let's call it

564
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:50,620
is gonna be our play chest let's call it
 

565
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,000
is gonna be our play chest let's call it
clay then after we place it does it keep

566
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,010
clay then after we place it does it keep
 

567
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,240
clay then after we place it does it keep
that name oh it does look at that yeah

568
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,250
that name oh it does look at that yeah
 

569
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,200
that name oh it does look at that yeah
that's probably what we would want to do

570
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,210
that's probably what we would want to do
 

571
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,560
that's probably what we would want to do
for the the storage system we're making

572
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:01,570
for the the storage system we're making
 

573
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,520
for the the storage system we're making
then to make it really fancy let's just

574
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,530
then to make it really fancy let's just
 

575
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,530
then to make it really fancy let's just
do a couple trial runs here before we

576
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:07,540
do a couple trial runs here before we
 

577
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,300
do a couple trial runs here before we
get that crazy because I think after we

578
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,310
get that crazy because I think after we
 

579
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,080
get that crazy because I think after we
break them it resets the name so you

580
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,090
break them it resets the name so you
 

581
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,610
break them it resets the name so you
just got to fill up this last little

582
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:14,620
just got to fill up this last little
 

583
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,850
just got to fill up this last little
column here we're gonna do five columns

584
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:17,860
column here we're gonna do five columns
 

585
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,180
column here we're gonna do five columns
of six I think is the plan so one two

586
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,190
of six I think is the plan so one two
 

587
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,450
of six I think is the plan so one two
three four five six okay so they're all

588
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:27,460
three four five six okay so they're all
 

589
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,040
three four five six okay so they're all
fully loaded and we're trapped up here

590
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,050
fully loaded and we're trapped up here
 

591
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,350
fully loaded and we're trapped up here
now get out here there's like no there's

592
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,360
now get out here there's like no there's
 

593
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,760
now get out here there's like no there's
no way for the mobs to get in but

594
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:35,770
no way for the mobs to get in but
 

595
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,050
no way for the mobs to get in but
there's no way for us to get out now

596
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,060
there's no way for us to get out now
 

597
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,660
there's no way for us to get out now
either okay so that's good we'll

598
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:39,670
either okay so that's good we'll
 

599
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,610
either okay so that's good we'll
probably have signs on the on the brick

600
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:41,620
probably have signs on the on the brick
 

601
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,900
probably have signs on the on the brick
here or something to see what's in the

602
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:42,910
here or something to see what's in the
 

603
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,310
here or something to see what's in the
chest as well

604
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
chest as well
 

605
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,600
chest as well
but let's give this a go so for the top

606
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,610
but let's give this a go so for the top
 

607
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,860
but let's give this a go so for the top
left I'm gonna put a torch here bottom

608
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:52,870
left I'm gonna put a torch here bottom
 

609
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,110
left I'm gonna put a torch here bottom
left we'll put on there just so we kind

610
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
left we'll put on there just so we kind
 

611
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,620
left we'll put on there just so we kind
of know that they keep the order after

612
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:58,630
of know that they keep the order after
 

613
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,970
of know that they keep the order after
we send them here you know because

614
00:14:59,970 --> 00:14:59,980
we send them here you know because
 

615
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,560
we send them here you know because
that's pretty important

616
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:01,570
that's pretty important
 

617
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,889
that's pretty important
and top right so after they arrive at

618
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:04,899
and top right so after they arrive at
 

619
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,300
and top right so after they arrive at
their next destination that should all

620
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,310
their next destination that should all
 

621
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,449
their next destination that should all
be the same is the fan

622
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:09,459
be the same is the fan
 

623
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,290
be the same is the fan
I guess those junctions there we're

624
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:13,300
I guess those junctions there we're
 

625
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,180
I guess those junctions there we're
getting updated by some redstone and

626
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,190
getting updated by some redstone and
 

627
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,460
getting updated by some redstone and
resetting constantly so I have to power

628
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,470
resetting constantly so I have to power
 

629
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,519
resetting constantly so I have to power
them with levers by the way but yeah

630
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:20,529
them with levers by the way but yeah
 

631

column thing we did and the first stop

636
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,360
column thing we did and the first stop
 

637
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,499
column thing we did and the first stop
is over here takes them a little bit of

638
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:31,509
is over here takes them a little bit of

order that is super cool though hey I

650
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,170
order that is super cool though hey I
 

651
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,449
order that is super cool though hey I
like that be so much easier to do

652
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:54,459
like that be so much easier to do
 

653
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,579

something like this with a chakra boxes

654
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:56,589
something like this with a chakra boxes
 

655
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,769
something like this with a chakra boxes
now though okay let's double check

656
00:15:58,769 --> 00:15:58,779
now though okay let's double check
 

657
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,120
now though okay let's double check
they're all in the right order top

658
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,130
they're all in the right order top
 

659
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,360
they're all in the right order top
rights and top flaps so I think they

660
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,370
rights and top flaps so I think they
 

661
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,129
rights and top flaps so I think they
maintained order let's go to the next

662
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:05,139
maintained order let's go to the next
 

663
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,819
maintained order let's go to the next
station and you can have as many

664
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:08,829
station and you can have as many
 

665
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:10,350
station and you can have as many
stations as you want what's design with

666
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,360
stations as you want what's design with
 

667
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,220
stations as you want what's design with
this idea so that's pretty cool Ian and

668
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,230
this idea so that's pretty cool Ian and
 

669
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,780
this idea so that's pretty cool Ian and
stack is amazing one on top of each

670
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:15,790
stack is amazing one on top of each
 

671
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,870
stack is amazing one on top of each
other as well the only real catch with

672
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
other as well the only real catch with
 

673
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,699
other as well the only real catch with
this is we can't we can't unload the

674
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:23,709
this is we can't we can't unload the
 

675
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:25,559
this is we can't we can't unload the
chunks while they're being transferred

676
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:25,569
chunks while they're being transferred
 

677
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,829
chunks while they're being transferred
if we do they'll get all messed up so we

678
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:28,839
if we do they'll get all messed up so we
 

679
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,480
if we do they'll get all messed up so we
got to make sure we don't close the game

680
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,490
got to make sure we don't close the game
 

681
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,170
got to make sure we don't close the game
or or move away too far after we hit the

do it one more time and now it pretty

860
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:47,860
do it one more time and now it pretty
 

861
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,710
do it one more time and now it pretty
much takes us back home so every time we

862
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:49,720
much takes us back home so every time we
 

863
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,150
much takes us back home so every time we
do it it divides by eight on our

864
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,160
do it it divides by eight on our
 

865
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,380
do it it divides by eight on our
coordinates so we're at minus 100 or at

866
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,390
coordinates so we're at minus 100 or at
 

867
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,340
coordinates so we're at minus 100 or at
least I think it divides by eight

868
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,350
least I think it divides by eight
 

869
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,320
least I think it divides by eight

we we got the blue walls you might be

922
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,110
we we got the blue walls you might be
 

923
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,260
we we got the blue walls you might be
thinking Etha why blue walls it's

924

thinking Etha why blue walls it's
because it's a blue flower farm we have

because it's a blue flower farm we have
to also write outside here we have blue

928
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:27,310
to also write outside here we have blue
 

929
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,420

takes too much effort so we're gonna do

944
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:49,900
takes too much effort so we're gonna do
 

945
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,980
takes too much effort so we're gonna do
that instead and then let's go for let's

946
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:52,990

dropper shoots an item into solid blocks
and then in the past they want an escape

1102
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:31,100
and then in the past they want an escape
 

1103
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,859
and then in the past they want an escape
from here but for some reason it's like

1104
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:32,869
from here but for some reason it's like
 

1105
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:35,830
from here but for some reason it's like
shooting out the corners now so what we

1106
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
shooting out the corners now so what we
 

1107
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,180
shooting out the corners now so what we
probably have to do is replace all these

1108
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:40,190
probably have to do is replace all these
 

1109
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,080
probably have to do is replace all these
elevators with like bubble streams and

1110
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,090
elevators with like bubble streams and
 

1111
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,539
elevators with like bubble streams and
then that should work so we we want like

1112
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:46,549
then that should work so we we want like
 

1113
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,419
then that should work so we we want like
soul sand here and water above to bring

1114
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:49,429
soul sand here and water above to bring
 

1115
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:51,369
soul sand here and water above to bring
it up here and then we'll just break out

1116
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:51,379
it up here and then we'll just break out
 

1117
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:55,119
it up here and then we'll just break out
all the glass in the middle but the

1118
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:55,129
all the glass in the middle but the
 

1119
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:56,649
all the glass in the middle but the
problem is then we got to redo some

1120
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:56,659
problem is then we got to redo some
 

1121
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,720
problem is then we got to redo some
redstone and just the way we got this

1122
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:58,730
redstone and just the way we got this
 

1123
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,489
redstone and just the way we got this
laid out we kind of built it pretty

1124
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:00,499
laid out we kind of built it pretty
 

1125
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:03,899
laid out we kind of built it pretty
compact it might be hard to make work

1126
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:03,909
compact it might be hard to make work
 

1127
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:06,220
compact it might be hard to make work
with all these elevators this is like

1128
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,230
with all these elevators this is like
 

1129
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,029
with all these elevators this is like
the easiest one but I'll mess around

1130
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:10,039
the easiest one but I'll mess around
 

1131
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,340
the easiest one but I'll mess around
with it we'll see what we can do well we

1132
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,350
with it we'll see what we can do well we
 

1133
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,139
with it we'll see what we can do well we
got one elevator working here and it's

1134
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:14,149
got one elevator working here and it's
 

1135
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,600
got one elevator working here and it's
the biggest one but it's kind of on its

1136
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:16,610
the biggest one but it's kind of on its
 

1137
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,639
the biggest one but it's kind of on its
own and then we got lots of space so it

1138
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:18,649
own and then we got lots of space so it
 

1139
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:21,070
own and then we got lots of space so it
was easy to do the other ones they're a

1140
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,080
was easy to do the other ones they're a
 

1141
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,440
was easy to do the other ones they're a
little bit more complicated but check it

1142
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:23,450
little bit more complicated but check it
 

1143
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,049
little bit more complicated but check it
out we put that in and it's way faster

1144
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:26,059
out we put that in and it's way faster
 

1145
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:29,080
out we put that in and it's way faster
than the old one too with the bubble

1146
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,090
than the old one too with the bubble
 

1147
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,820
than the old one too with the bubble
streams like it gets the top almost

1148
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:30,830
streams like it gets the top almost
 

1149
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,330
streams like it gets the top almost
instantly which would mean the search

1150
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:34,340
instantly which would mean the search
 

1151
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,220
instantly which would mean the search
engine would be faster if we use this

1152
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:36,230
engine would be faster if we use this
 

1153
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,119
engine would be faster if we use this
one

1154
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,129
one
 

1155
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:43,330
one
ah let's go where are we let's go back

1156
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:43,340
ah let's go where are we let's go back
 

1157
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,509
ah let's go where are we let's go back
to the top here I think those are going

1158
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:46,519
to the top here I think those are going
 

1159
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,039
to the top here I think those are going
into here yeah okay so there's three

1160
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,049
into here yeah okay so there's three
 

1161
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,190
into here yeah okay so there's three
other elevators though it's a problem

1162
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
other elevators though it's a problem
 

1163
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,680
other elevators though it's a problem
and one of them I did like super compact

1164
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:56,690
and one of them I did like super compact
 

1165
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,519
and one of them I did like super compact
where I combine two elevators together

1166
00:27:59,519 --> 00:27:59,529
where I combine two elevators together
 

1167
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:02,049
where I combine two elevators together
which is gonna make this ultra difficult

1168
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:02,059
which is gonna make this ultra difficult
 

1169
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,120
which is gonna make this ultra difficult
engine to change so there's one elevator

1170
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,130
engine to change so there's one elevator
 

1171
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,220
engine to change so there's one elevator
and it goes up to another elevator here

1172
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,230
and it goes up to another elevator here
 

1173
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,810
and it goes up to another elevator here
then which then it goes to the top I

1174
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:07,820
then which then it goes to the top I
 

1175
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,200
then which then it goes to the top I
think mixed in with a bunch of redstone

1176
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,210
think mixed in with a bunch of redstone
 

1177
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,900
think mixed in with a bunch of redstone
here too that's gonna be a little hard

1178
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:13,910
here too that's gonna be a little hard
 

1179
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,779
here too that's gonna be a little hard
to fix and then there's one here which

1180
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:16,789
to fix and then there's one here which
 

1181
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:19,659
to fix and then there's one here which
might be a little bit easier so this is

1182
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:19,669
might be a little bit easier so this is
 

1183
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:21,460
might be a little bit easier so this is
where we hope we don't spill water all

1184
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:21,470
where we hope we don't spill water all
 

1185
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:27,720
where we hope we don't spill water all
over a redstone you have this goes I

1186
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:27,730

 

1187
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,820

have a fortune pic I do let's use that

1188
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:30,830
have a fortune pic I do let's use that
 

1189
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:40,630
have a fortune pic I do let's use that
instead all right that should be good I

1190
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,640
instead all right that should be good I
 

1191
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,680
instead all right that should be good I
think we do this just to get it to go

1192
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:47,690
think we do this just to get it to go
 

1193
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,480
think we do this just to get it to go
over top the hoppers alright and then we

1194
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,490
over top the hoppers alright and then we
 

1195
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,120
over top the hoppers alright and then we
do that so it can't escape and I think

1196
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,130
do that so it can't escape and I think
 

1197
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:00,430
do that so it can't escape and I think
we got another elevator done maybe maybe

1198
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,440
we got another elevator done maybe maybe
 

1199
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,460
we got another elevator done maybe maybe
I really don't like putting water in

1200
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,470
I really don't like putting water in
 

1201
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,980
I really don't like putting water in
your your redstone it just freaks me out

1202
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:05,990
your your redstone it just freaks me out
 

1203
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,850
your your redstone it just freaks me out
guys you have no idea so I managed to

1204
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:09,860
guys you have no idea so I managed to
 

1205
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,950
guys you have no idea so I managed to
combine those two elevators together

1206
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:11,960
combine those two elevators together
 

1207
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,110
combine those two elevators together
again I did it with the hoppers though

1208
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,120
again I did it with the hoppers though
 

1209
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,600
again I did it with the hoppers though
so they only go into one dropper instead

1210
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:16,610
so they only go into one dropper instead
 

1211
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,980
so they only go into one dropper instead
of two different droppers like we had

1212
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:17,990
of two different droppers like we had
 

1213
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,210
of two different droppers like we had
before so one branch comes down or it

1214
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:22,220
before so one branch comes down or it
 

1215
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,180
before so one branch comes down or it
goes across here and down into here the

1216
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,190
goes across here and down into here the
 

1217
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,980
goes across here and down into here the
other one just goes across here into

1218
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:26,990
other one just goes across here into
 

1219
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:37,750
other one just goes across here into
that dropper so doesn't run at full

1220
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:37,760
that dropper so doesn't run at full
 

1221
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:46,720
that dropper so doesn't run at full
speed though hey wait wool ok but

1222
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:46,730
speed though hey wait wool ok but
 

1223
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,549
speed though hey wait wool ok but
nothing's flying out so that's kind of

1224
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
nothing's flying out so that's kind of
 

1225
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,190
nothing's flying out so that's kind of
the big thing right mm-hmm

1226
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,200
the big thing right mm-hmm
 

1227
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,110
the big thing right mm-hmm
and I just let's see if we can figure

1228
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,120
and I just let's see if we can figure
 

1229
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,270
and I just let's see if we can figure
out where that ended up

1230
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,280
out where that ended up
 

1231
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,970
out where that ended up
so the white wool and what do we use

1232
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:00,980
so the white wool and what do we use
 

1233
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,440
so the white wool and what do we use
stone brick should be together in here

1234
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,450
stone brick should be together in here
 

1235
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,320
stone brick should be together in here
yeah okay good I think that's where we

1236
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,330
yeah okay good I think that's where we
 

1237
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,340
yeah okay good I think that's where we
want it cool so maybe let's try this out

1238
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,350
want it cool so maybe let's try this out
 

1239
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,440
want it cool so maybe let's try this out
again I think it should be working now

1240
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,450
again I think it should be working now
 

1241
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,970
again I think it should be working now
so we have sand in here right

1242
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:17,980
so we have sand in here right
 

1243
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,070
so we have sand in here right
yes there's sand so let's search for

1244
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,080
yes there's sand so let's search for
 

1245
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,610
yes there's sand so let's search for
sand yeah now we find out we broke

1246
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:27,620
sand yeah now we find out we broke
 

1247
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,480
sand yeah now we find out we broke
everything

1248
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,490

 

1249
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,630

maybe well I think it ended up over here

1250
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
maybe well I think it ended up over here
 

1251
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,050
maybe well I think it ended up over here
actually yep okay I think it might

1252
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,060
actually yep okay I think it might
 

1253
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,950
actually yep okay I think it might
actually work again

1254
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
actually work again
 

1255
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,370
actually work again
uh oh okay we got some new leakage over

1256
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:42,380
uh oh okay we got some new leakage over
 

1257
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,780
uh oh okay we got some new leakage over
here now why did they why did that

1258
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:46,790
here now why did they why did that
 

1259
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,990
here now why did they why did that
happen oh man this thing is just just a

1260
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,000
happen oh man this thing is just just a
 

1261
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,090
happen oh man this thing is just just a
mess oh I wonder if I broke that over

1262
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,100
mess oh I wonder if I broke that over
 

1263
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,930
mess oh I wonder if I broke that over
there or did I just do that I kind of

1264
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:58,940
there or did I just do that I kind of
 

1265
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,400
there or did I just do that I kind of
messed around with the glass around this

1266
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,410
messed around with the glass around this
 

1267
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,320
messed around with the glass around this
area so maybe I opened it up so we can

1268
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,330
area so maybe I opened it up so we can
 

1269
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,000
area so maybe I opened it up so we can
escape now cuz I don't think that

1270
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,010
escape now cuz I don't think that
 

1271
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,540
escape now cuz I don't think that
happened the first time we used it

1272
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:07,550
happened the first time we used it
 

1273
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:14,830
happened the first time we used it
one more Oh bad jump we got it okay okay

1274
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:14,840
one more Oh bad jump we got it okay okay
 

1275
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,300
one more Oh bad jump we got it okay okay
so what are we gonna do to fix that I

1276
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,310
so what are we gonna do to fix that I
 

1277
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,600
so what are we gonna do to fix that I
think maybe if we just spam glass around

1278
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:19,610
think maybe if we just spam glass around
 

1279
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,780
think maybe if we just spam glass around
it a little bit more it'll be fine

1280
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:24,790

 

1281
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,770

so close so close to fixing it ah but I

1282
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:29,780
so close so close to fixing it ah but I
 

1283
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,300
so close so close to fixing it ah but I
don't think this is something we can get

1284
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:31,310
don't think this is something we can get
 

1285
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,080
don't think this is something we can get
around so the issue is this unit here is

1286
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,090
around so the issue is this unit here is
 

1287
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,240
around so the issue is this unit here is
the actual search engine there's two of

1288
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,250
the actual search engine there's two of
 

1289
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,500
the actual search engine there's two of
them in this thing and the one up there

1290
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:41,510
them in this thing and the one up there
 

1291
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,660
them in this thing and the one up there
is fine cuz there's glass above it but

1292
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:43,670
is fine cuz there's glass above it but
 

1293
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,690
is fine cuz there's glass above it but
this one we have a hopper above and they

1294
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:46,700
this one we have a hopper above and they
 

1295
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,260
this one we have a hopper above and they
changed hoppers so that they don't

1296
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,270
changed hoppers so that they don't
 

1297
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,510
changed hoppers so that they don't
occupy a full block anymore so you can

1298
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:52,520
occupy a full block anymore so you can
 

1299
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,960
occupy a full block anymore so you can
for example throw a block there when you

1300
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:55,970
for example throw a block there when you
 

1301
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,540
for example throw a block there when you
break this it stays on this ledge

1302
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:58,550
break this it stays on this ledge
 

1303
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,960
break this it stays on this ledge
because there's a bit of space there and

1304
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:00,970
because there's a bit of space there and
 

1305
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,550
because there's a bit of space there and
that's where the shocker boxes are

1306
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:03,560
that's where the shocker boxes are
 

1307
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,830
that's where the shocker boxes are
squeezing through now and that's causing

1308
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:08,840
squeezing through now and that's causing
 

1309
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,980
squeezing through now and that's causing
a lot of trouble so we need we need to

1310
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:11,990
a lot of trouble so we need we need to
 

1311
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,040
a lot of trouble so we need we need to
redesign this with the glass or

1312
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,050
redesign this with the glass or
 

1313
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,970
redesign this with the glass or
something solid above this area instead

1314
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:18,980
something solid above this area instead
 

1315
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,680
something solid above this area instead
of the hopper here and we can't just

1316
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:20,690
of the hopper here and we can't just
 

1317
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,260
of the hopper here and we can't just
move this hopper out of the way or to

1318
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,270
move this hopper out of the way or to
 

1319
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,030
move this hopper out of the way or to
take a different path because there's no

1320
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,040
take a different path because there's no
 

1321
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,430
take a different path because there's no
wiggle room like if we run it underneath

1322
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
wiggle room like if we run it underneath
 

1323
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,170
wiggle room like if we run it underneath
these hoppers it's gonna mess everything

1324
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,180
these hoppers it's gonna mess everything
 

1325
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,299
these hoppers it's gonna mess everything
up there's no space on

1326
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:31,309
up there's no space on
 

1327
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,129
up there's no space on
that side there's no space over here

1328
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:33,139
that side there's no space over here
 

1329
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:36,399
that side there's no space over here
there's no space over here so it's like

1330
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:36,409
there's no space over here so it's like
 

1331
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:40,149
there's no space over here so it's like
right in the heart of the machine so it

1332
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
right in the heart of the machine so it
 

1333
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,460
right in the heart of the machine so it
needs a total redesign to change the

1334
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:42,470
needs a total redesign to change the
 

1335
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,850
needs a total redesign to change the
layout pretty much well anyways guys we

1336
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:45,860
layout pretty much well anyways guys we
 

1337
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,739
layout pretty much well anyways guys we
gave it a good effort there at least we

1338
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:47,749
gave it a good effort there at least we
 

1339
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:48,549
gave it a good effort there at least we
know what's wrong

1340
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
know what's wrong
 

1341
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,840
