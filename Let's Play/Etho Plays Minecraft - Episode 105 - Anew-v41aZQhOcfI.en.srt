00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:17,530
and we got one of those kick-ass trees
 

163
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,240
and we got one of those kick-ass trees
up there cool world very cool I want to

of it

172
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:34,420
of it
 

173
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,790
of it
um yeah pre-release came out today

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:43,470
number two we got breeding and all that
 

177
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,490
number two we got breeding and all that
a few other changes we got hardcore mode

178
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,500
a few other changes we got hardcore mode
 

179
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,520
a few other changes we got hardcore mode
I tried that today I had no mobs

180
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,530
I tried that today I had no mobs
 

181
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,530
I tried that today I had no mobs
spawning so it's glitched a little bit

182
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:52,540
spawning so it's glitched a little bit
 

183
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,490
spawning so it's glitched a little bit
I'm guessing whatever you had your game

184
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:56,500
I'm guessing whatever you had your game
 

185
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm guessing whatever you had your game
set up before hardcore mode is what what

186
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,310
set up before hardcore mode is what what
 

187
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,300
set up before hardcore mode is what what
the game lacks should be set on but it's

188
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,310
the game lacks should be set on but it's
 

189
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,010
the game lacks should be set on but it's
a fun feature when it gets working

190
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:05,020
a fun feature when it gets working
 

191
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,020
a fun feature when it gets working
properly we'll be able to like one one

192
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,030
properly we'll be able to like one one
 

193
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,900
properly we'll be able to like one one
death in your game over world it's

194
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:12,910
death in your game over world it's
 

195
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:20,520
death in your game over world it's
deleted it's a pretty pretty fun idea so

196
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,530
deleted it's a pretty pretty fun idea so
 

197
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,740
deleted it's a pretty pretty fun idea so
in this new world I have kind of a new

198
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:22,750
in this new world I have kind of a new
 

199
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,260
in this new world I have kind of a new
plan I think it's going to be fun idea

let me know what you guys think of it
I'm going to start my first base

204
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,040
I'm going to start my first base
 

205
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm going to start my first base
underground we're going to live

206
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,110
underground we're going to live
 

207
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,430
underground we're going to live
underground not exclusively or anything

208
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
underground not exclusively or anything
 

209
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,930
underground not exclusively or anything
but just to get started yeah like like

210
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:39,940
but just to get started yeah like like
 

211
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,070
but just to get started yeah like like
this looks perfect yeah this is this is

212
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
this looks perfect yeah this is this is
 

213
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,630
this looks perfect yeah this is this is
exactly what I was looking for a nice

214
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,640
exactly what I was looking for a nice
 

215
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,770
exactly what I was looking for a nice
wide opening so we're going to live

216
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:49,780
wide opening so we're going to live
 

217
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,370
wide opening so we're going to live
underground and the plan is to make our

218
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,380
underground and the plan is to make our
 

219
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,150
underground and the plan is to make our
underground world epic and have like

220
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
underground world epic and have like
 

221
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,040
underground world epic and have like
mechanical stuff fit underground and to

222
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,050
mechanical stuff fit underground and to
 

223
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,920
mechanical stuff fit underground and to
move grass underground make farms that

224
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:01,930
move grass underground make farms that
 

225
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,530
move grass underground make farms that
kind of stuff you know I think it'll be

226
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:04,540
kind of stuff you know I think it'll be
 

227
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,740
kind of stuff you know I think it'll be
fun because Underground's in cave

228
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:07,750
fun because Underground's in cave
 

229
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,430
fun because Underground's in cave
systems kind of like a biome in itself

230
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,440
systems kind of like a biome in itself
 

231
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,610
systems kind of like a biome in itself
and in my opinion it's the best changes

232
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:14,620
and in my opinion it's the best changes
 

233
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,610
and in my opinion it's the best changes
in the new patches is the cave systems

234
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:17,620
in the new patches is the cave systems
 

235
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,100
in the new patches is the cave systems
there are a lot more interesting now so

236
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,110
there are a lot more interesting now so
 

237
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,480
there are a lot more interesting now so
I would love to live underground for for

238
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,490
I would love to live underground for for
 

239
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,219
I would love to live underground for for
at least the beginning of this

240
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:27,229
at least the beginning of this
 

241
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,020
at least the beginning of this
check this out we got iron already and

242
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,030
check this out we got iron already and
 

243
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,230
check this out we got iron already and
that's other thing I need resources so

244
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
that's other thing I need resources so
 

245
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,820
that's other thing I need resources so
it may as well build underground because

246
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:34,830
it may as well build underground because
 

247
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,830
it may as well build underground because
that's where we'll find them right and

248
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:38,840
that's where we'll find them right and
 

249
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,480
that's where we'll find them right and
we'll run into enemies and it'll be

250
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,490
we'll run into enemies and it'll be
 

251
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,749
we'll run into enemies and it'll be
exciting and stuff like that let's get

252
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:44,759
exciting and stuff like that let's get
 

253
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:52,820
exciting and stuff like that let's get
on to poops oh it is on bright ok the

254
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:52,830
on to poops oh it is on bright ok the
 

255
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,469
on to poops oh it is on bright ok the
other thing is I don't know if it's just

256
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
other thing is I don't know if it's just
 

257
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,149
other thing is I don't know if it's just
me but like ever since I've been playing

258
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:56,159
me but like ever since I've been playing
 

259
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,769
me but like ever since I've been playing
my draft like I could build a tree farm

260
00:06:59,769 --> 00:06:59,779
my draft like I could build a tree farm
 

261
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,119
my draft like I could build a tree farm
above ground somewhere and it would be

262
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:02,129
above ground somewhere and it would be
 

263
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,070
above ground somewhere and it would be
cool but then I would take the exact

264
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
cool but then I would take the exact
 

265
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,890
cool but then I would take the exact
same tree farm and build it underground

266
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:06,900
same tree farm and build it underground
 

267
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,679
same tree farm and build it underground
and somehow although all of a sudden it

268
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:09,689
and somehow although all of a sudden it
 

269
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,360
and somehow although all of a sudden it
would just be like 10 times cooler just

270
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,370
would just be like 10 times cooler just
 

271
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,129
would just be like 10 times cooler just
because it's underground for some reason

272
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:13,139
because it's underground for some reason
 

273
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,159
because it's underground for some reason
so that's another reason I want to build

274
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:16,169
so that's another reason I want to build
 

275
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,100
so that's another reason I want to build
underground stuff just seems cooler

276
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,110
underground stuff just seems cooler
 

277
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,499
underground stuff just seems cooler
somehow even though it might be the same

278
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:21,509
somehow even though it might be the same
 

279
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,170
somehow even though it might be the same
thing now we got more caves here oh we

280
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,180
thing now we got more caves here oh we
 

281
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,969
thing now we got more caves here oh we
get coal cool but it might just be me

282
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:28,979
get coal cool but it might just be me
 

283
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,920
get coal cool but it might just be me
but for some reason I think it's going

284
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:30,930
but for some reason I think it's going
 

285
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,619
but for some reason I think it's going
to be a lot of fun to build underground

286
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:35,629

 

287
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,149

alright so we got a bunch of coal now we

288
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:38,159
alright so we got a bunch of coal now we
 

289
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,329
alright so we got a bunch of coal now we
got a fair bit of iron and it looks like

290
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:41,339
got a fair bit of iron and it looks like
 

291
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,290
got a fair bit of iron and it looks like
this cave system goes deep and is pretty

292
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:45,300
this cave system goes deep and is pretty
 

293
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,879
this cave system goes deep and is pretty
