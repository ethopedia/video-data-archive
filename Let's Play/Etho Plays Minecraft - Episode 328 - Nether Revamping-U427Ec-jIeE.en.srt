some finishing work around here for the

40
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,070
some finishing work around here for the
 

41
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,679
some finishing work around here for the
last hour or two and I thought it might

42
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:12,689
last hour or two and I thought it might
 

43

because well show you some of the
 

47
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,890
because well show you some of the
decisions I'm making I guess so I've

48
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
decisions I'm making I guess so I've
 

49
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,410
decisions I'm making I guess so I've
been mostly focusing on this mushroom

50
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:24,420
been mostly focusing on this mushroom
 

51
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,469
been mostly focusing on this mushroom
farm and I added like green slime walls

52
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
farm and I added like green slime walls
 

53
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,359
farm and I added like green slime walls
there which I think looks pretty cool

54
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:32,369
there which I think looks pretty cool
 

55
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,550
there which I think looks pretty cool
from this side but this side not as much

56
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
from this side but this side not as much
 

57
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,929
from this side but this side not as much
I don't like it quite as much but I

58
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:38,939
I don't like it quite as much but I
 

59
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,319
I don't like it quite as much but I
think it's okay but then I started like

60
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:41,329
think it's okay but then I started like
 

61
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:43,490
think it's okay but then I started like
realizing I don't like these reeds

62
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:43,500
realizing I don't like these reeds
 

63
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,370
realizing I don't like these reeds
behind these fences so I decided to

64
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,380
behind these fences so I decided to
 

65
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,190
behind these fences so I decided to
change those out with slime blocks and I

66
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
change those out with slime blocks and I
 

67
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,690
change those out with slime blocks and I
changed it out like the wool I had up

68
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:50,700
changed it out like the wool I had up
 

69
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,460
changed it out like the wool I had up
there with slime blocks so this whole

70
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:52,470
there with slime blocks so this whole
 

71
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,550
there with slime blocks so this whole
place is like slime blocks now I got

72
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,560
place is like slime blocks now I got
 

73
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,850
place is like slime blocks now I got
carried away I think I think what we

74
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:58,860
carried away I think I think what we
 

75
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,230
carried away I think I think what we
should do is get rid of some of these

76
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
should do is get rid of some of these
 

77
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,090
should do is get rid of some of these
and I got some other colors here to try

78
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,100
and I got some other colors here to try
 

79
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,020
and I got some other colors here to try
out I got yellow orange brown it might

80
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,030
out I got yellow orange brown it might
 

81
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,490
out I got yellow orange brown it might
look a lot better if we get another

82
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:10,500
look a lot better if we get another
 

83
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,740
look a lot better if we get another
color in here

84
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:12,750
color in here
 

85
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,740
color in here
let's try these out let's do brown first

86
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:15,750
let's try these out let's do brown first
 

87
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,800
let's try these out let's do brown first
because I think that's the least likely

88
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:17,810
because I think that's the least likely
 

89
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,260
because I think that's the least likely
one will want to use it that works

90
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,270
one will want to use it that works
 

91
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,620
one will want to use it that works
definitely works but it's I don't know

92
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:26,630
definitely works but it's I don't know
 

93
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,660
definitely works but it's I don't know
it doesn't add anything to the room it's

94
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,670
it doesn't add anything to the room it's
 

95
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,610
it doesn't add anything to the room it's
this brown we already have a lot of

96
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:31,620
this brown we already have a lot of
 

97
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,980
this brown we already have a lot of
brown in here all right so this is what

98
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:33,990
brown in here all right so this is what
 

99
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,780
brown in here all right so this is what
I'm really deciding up between is the

100
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:35,790
I'm really deciding up between is the
 

101
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm really deciding up between is the
orange and the yellow

102
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,130
orange and the yellow
 

103
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,770
orange and the yellow
which I'm guessing yellow is gonna look

104
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:39,780
which I'm guessing yellow is gonna look
 

105
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,420
which I'm guessing yellow is gonna look
better but let's just see here good

106
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,430
better but let's just see here good
 

107
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,979
better but let's just see here good
orange and green are really good

108
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:45,989
orange and green are really good
 

109
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,900
orange and green are really good
together I definitely want to have the

110
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:47,910
together I definitely want to have the
 

111
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,490
together I definitely want to have the
slime blocks behind the fences I think

112
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:49,500
slime blocks behind the fences I think
 

113
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,100
slime blocks behind the fences I think
that looks so much better than the reeds

114
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,110
that looks so much better than the reeds
 

115
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,520
that looks so much better than the reeds
I think the recolor changed for one

116
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,530
I think the recolor changed for one
 

117
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,780
I think the recolor changed for one
thing I think that's why I don't like it

118
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:56,790
thing I think that's why I don't like it
 

119
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,280
thing I think that's why I don't like it
as much I don't remember being able to

120
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,290
as much I don't remember being able to
 

121
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,040
as much I don't remember being able to
see all this stone behind your before

122
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,050
see all this stone behind your before
 

123
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,570
see all this stone behind your before
either though orange not too bad I do

124
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:05,580
either though orange not too bad I do
 

125
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,400
either though orange not too bad I do
like that more than the brown but let's

126
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,410
like that more than the brown but let's
 

127
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,400
like that more than the brown but let's
go for the yellow oh you know what I

128
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,410
go for the yellow oh you know what I
 

129
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,830
go for the yellow oh you know what I
should be doing actually we gotta check

130
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:12,840
should be doing actually we gotta check
 

131
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,210
should be doing actually we gotta check
that from this side too because that's

132
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,220
that from this side too because that's
 

133
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,449
that from this side too because that's
pretty important yeah that's that's

134
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,459
pretty important yeah that's that's
 

135
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,850

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
yeah when a mushroom grows it activates
 

163
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
yeah when a mushroom grows it activates
that bud switch up there and then we can

164
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,130
that bud switch up there and then we can
 

165
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,800
that bud switch up there and then we can
make something happen and I haven't

166
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:12,810
make something happen and I haven't
 

167
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,620
make something happen and I haven't
really decided what I want to happen but

168
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:15,630
really decided what I want to happen but
 

169
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,170
really decided what I want to happen but
I think playing like a note note block

170
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,180
I think playing like a note note block
 

171
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,610
I think playing like a note note block
sequence would be pretty cool like a

172
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:19,620
sequence would be pretty cool like a
 

173
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,159
sequence would be pretty cool like a
little tune between four and eight note

174
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:22,169
little tune between four and eight note
 

175
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,890
little tune between four and eight note
blocks would be a good idea

176
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:25,900
blocks would be a good idea
 

177
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
blocks would be a good idea
I think I want to add the yellow up on

later on down the road I'm not really
 

221
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,200
later on down the road I'm not really
sure what we would put down here but I'm

222
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,210
sure what we would put down here but I'm
 

223
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,490
sure what we would put down here but I'm
sure eventually I'll think of something

224
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:31,500
sure eventually I'll think of something
 

225
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:39,659
sure eventually I'll think of something
this and trapdoors yeah alright anyway

226
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:39,669
this and trapdoors yeah alright anyway
 

227
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,790

I'm gonna do do some more work on this

228
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm gonna do do some more work on this
 

229
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,810
I'm gonna do do some more work on this
and we'll check it out

230
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:44,820

 

231
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,940

so I just discovered like something I

232
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:47,950
so I just discovered like something I
 

233
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,260
so I just discovered like something I
should have been doing all along in my

234
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,270
should have been doing all along in my
 

235
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,900
should have been doing all along in my
worlds here usually when I need leaves I

236
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:51,910
worlds here usually when I need leaves I
 

237
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,330
worlds here usually when I need leaves I
go up to the surface and like I'll grow

238
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,340
go up to the surface and like I'll grow
 

239
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,400
go up to the surface and like I'll grow
a tree I'll chop the leaves off of it

240
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,410
a tree I'll chop the leaves off of it
 

241
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,290
a tree I'll chop the leaves off of it
and I'll chop the trunk down then I'll

242
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,300
and I'll chop the trunk down then I'll
 

243
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,700
and I'll chop the trunk down then I'll
grow another tree and chop the leaves

244
00:05:59,700 --> 00:05:59,710
grow another tree and chop the leaves
 

245
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,070
grow another tree and chop the leaves
off growing up and the trunk and

246
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
off growing up and the trunk and
 

247
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,930
off growing up and the trunk and
whatever I do it one by one the trees

248
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:03,940
whatever I do it one by one the trees
 

249
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,279
whatever I do it one by one the trees
I've had this tree farm here forever

250
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:07,289
I've had this tree farm here forever
 

251
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:13,089
I've had this tree farm here forever
this is the way to do it

252
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:13,099

 

253
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:17,719

is so much better this is how you get

254
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:17,729
is so much better this is how you get
 

255
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,550
is so much better this is how you get
leaves oh my goodness

00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:43,409
be a dark spot just about done here I
 

267
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,320
be a dark spot just about done here I
got okay let's let's look at this so I

268
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,330
got okay let's let's look at this so I
 

269
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,320
got okay let's let's look at this so I
got lights hanging from the ceiling now

270
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,330
got lights hanging from the ceiling now
 

271
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,080
got lights hanging from the ceiling now
we got one one two three four of them

272
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,090
we got one one two three four of them
 

273
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,519
we got one one two three four of them
currently and I tried to like alternate

274
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:55,529
currently and I tried to like alternate
 

275
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,469
currently and I tried to like alternate
their heights so this one lowest and

276
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:57,479
their heights so this one lowest and
 

277
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,800
their heights so this one lowest and
then we got medium and then highest

278
00:06:59,800 --> 00:06:59,810
then we got medium and then highest
 

279
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,279
then we got medium and then highest
pretty cool and hit a bunch of lights in

282
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:06,599
the grass here like there's one over
 

283
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,749
the grass here like there's one over
there on the pillar I did some of these

00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
there on the pillar I did some of these
 

285
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,390
there on the pillar I did some of these
sneaky lights like this and we got those

286
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
sneaky lights like this and we got those
 

287
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,390
sneaky lights like this and we got those
in a few places I know there's one up

288
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:17,400
in a few places I know there's one up
 

289
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,579
in a few places I know there's one up
here to decide to put some fences along

290
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:22,589
here to decide to put some fences along
 

291
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:25,459
here to decide to put some fences along

the door going so wouldn't pressure

296
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:32,789
the door going so wouldn't pressure
 

297
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,089
the door going so wouldn't pressure
plate here and run through there's a

298
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:35,099
plate here and run through there's a
 

299
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,110
plate here and run through there's a
button on the other side and it's pretty

300
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
button on the other side and it's pretty
 

301
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,579
button on the other side and it's pretty
easy to open it if you're going to this

302
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:40,589
easy to open it if you're going to this
 

303
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:44,480
easy to open it if you're going to this
way like that I don't really want to put

304
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,490
way like that I don't really want to put
 

305
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,769
way like that I don't really want to put
pressure plates on the ground here so

306
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:45,779
pressure plates on the ground here so
 

307
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,610
pressure plates on the ground here so
that's why I did a button instead

308
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:48,620
that's why I did a button instead
 

309
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,390
that's why I did a button instead
because I don't think that was looking

310
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
because I don't think that was looking
 

311
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,500
because I don't think that was looking
very good and then inside

312
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,510
very good and then inside
 

313
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,810
very good and then inside

00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,490
did a bit of work here I got rid of the
fences on the top there and I put the

316
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500
fences on the top there and I put the
 

317
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,680
fences on the top there and I put the
yellow clay behind you got the yellow

318
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:00,690
yellow clay behind you got the yellow
 

319
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,590
yellow clay behind you got the yellow

at here I don't think I'm gonna be using

436
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:48,389
at here I don't think I'm gonna be using
 

437
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,639
at here I don't think I'm gonna be using
the rail system I don't know if I want

438
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:50,649
the rail system I don't know if I want
 

439
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,319
the rail system I don't know if I want
to tear it out I might use it I'm not

440
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:52,329
to tear it out I might use it I'm not
 

441
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:56,280
to tear it out I might use it I'm not
sure but I think mules is the way I want

442
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,290
sure but I think mules is the way I want
 

443
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,259
sure but I think mules is the way I want
to go because horses came out and that's

444
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:58,269
to go because horses came out and that's
 

445
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,019
to go because horses came out and that's
a really good way of getting around so

446
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:00,029
a really good way of getting around so
 

447
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:05,220
a really good way of getting around so
we might take that path but what I think

448
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,230
we might take that path but what I think
 

449
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,369
we might take that path but what I think
we should do I want to hook this up to

450
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:08,379
we should do I want to hook this up to
 

451
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:12,449
we should do I want to hook this up to
the portal network - which is gonna be

452
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:12,459
the portal network - which is gonna be
 

453
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:18,809
the portal network - which is gonna be
tough unless we move it mmm how could we

454
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:18,819
tough unless we move it mmm how could we
 

455
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,639
tough unless we move it mmm how could we
do this I almost want to set like a

456
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:20,649
do this I almost want to set like a
 

457
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,639
do this I almost want to set like a
portal up here and make stairs that wind

458
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:23,649
portal up here and make stairs that wind
 

459
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,280
portal up here and make stairs that wind
around and go up above here like to this

460
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,290
around and go up above here like to this
 

461
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,609
around and go up above here like to this
area on one of these sides instead of

462
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:29,619
area on one of these sides instead of
 

463
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:32,489
area on one of these sides instead of
making all four sides totally

464
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:32,499
making all four sides totally
 

465
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,980
making all four sides totally
symmetrical maybe we could do a

466
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:34,990
symmetrical maybe we could do a
 

467
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,569
symmetrical maybe we could do a
staircase to come up here

468
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:38,579
staircase to come up here
 

469
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,960
staircase to come up here
maybe and then we could like put a

470
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:42,970
maybe and then we could like put a
 

471
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,090
maybe and then we could like put a
piston elevator where this portal is

472
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,100
piston elevator where this portal is
 

473
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
piston elevator where this portal is
because I would like a quick way up to

474
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,110
because I would like a quick way up to
 

475
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,309
because I would like a quick way up to
the roof to so that might be the way to

476
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:50,319
the roof to so that might be the way to
 

477
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:59,579
the roof to so that might be the way to

478
00:11:59,579 --> 00:11:59,589
go so let's let's see it's I'm scared to
 

479
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,860
go so let's let's see it's I'm scared to
work on this because it's that big

480
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:01,870
work on this because it's that big
 

481
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,689
work on this because it's that big
project and I'm scared of big projects I

482
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:06,699
project and I'm scared of big projects I
 

483
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,079
project and I'm scared of big projects I
just I feel bad just like randomly

484
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,089
just I feel bad just like randomly
 

485
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:15,210

picking a spot here for a portal but I

486
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:15,220
picking a spot here for a portal but I
 

487
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,939
picking a spot here for a portal but I
think that's what I'm gonna do so we're

488
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:17,949
think that's what I'm gonna do so we're
 

489
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,699
think that's what I'm gonna do so we're
gonna move this portal to here and we're

490
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:20,709
gonna move this portal to here and we're
 

491
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,210
gonna move this portal to here and we're
gonna try have staircases that wrap

492
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,220
gonna try have staircases that wrap
 

493
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,840

around and go up there I think is the

494
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:27,850
around and go up there I think is the
 

495
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,769
around and go up there I think is the
way to do this and also I'll have to

496
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:31,779
way to do this and also I'll have to
 

497
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,980
way to do this and also I'll have to
have a path that goes around to here

498
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:34,990
have a path that goes around to here
 

499
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,329
have a path that goes around to here
because we still want to go off this

500
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:36,339
because we still want to go off this
 

501
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,519
because we still want to go off this
direction I also kind of regret making

direction I also kind of regret making
 

503
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,420
direction I also kind of regret making
tunnels

tunnels
 

505

tunnels
instead of like something more unique

506
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:45,910
instead of like something more unique
 

507
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,639
instead of like something more unique
like I just have a straight tunnel there

559
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,720
or not it's the question like I might
get rid of the one behind the portal

560
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:01,730
get rid of the one behind the portal
 

561

middle thing though for sure we should
 

567
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:17,079

the middle is to hook it up to the

572
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:21,709
the middle is to hook it up to the
 

573
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,139
the middle is to hook it up to the
portal network I have to do all this

574
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:23,149
portal network I have to do all this
 

575
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,079

redstone stuff to it and there's this
 

577
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:28,299
redstone stuff to it and there's this
not enough space if it's in the middle

578
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:28,309
not enough space if it's in the middle
 

579

we're gonna take this portal and we'll
 

609
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,699
we're gonna take this portal and we'll
move it back to the middle genius right

610
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:24,709
move it back to the middle genius right
 

611
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,480
move it back to the middle genius right
I know I know I do my best but we're

612
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,490
I know I know I do my best but we're
 

613
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,970
I know I know I do my best but we're
gonna put down lower like five blocks at

614
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:30,980
gonna put down lower like five blocks at
 

615
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,530
gonna put down lower like five blocks at
least down we might have some stairs

616
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:32,540
least down we might have some stairs
 

617
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,189
least down we might have some stairs
going downwards but what we also want to

618
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:36,199
going downwards but what we also want to
 

619
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,689
going downwards but what we also want to
have in this middle the reason why we

620
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:37,699
have in this middle the reason why we
 

621
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,759
have in this middle the reason why we
had to move the portal

622
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:39,769
had to move the portal
 

623
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,369
had to move the portal
besides needing room for redstone is we

624
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:42,379
besides needing room for redstone is we
 

625
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,919
besides needing room for redstone is we
also want to put an elevator to go up

626
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:44,929
also want to put an elevator to go up
 

627
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:48,369
also want to put an elevator to go up
here now the thing is there's no real

here now the thing is there's no real
 

629
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,280

good piston elevator I can put here

630
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,290
good piston elevator I can put here
 

631
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,230
good piston elevator I can put here
because piston elevators are usually an

00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,240
because piston elevators are usually an
 

633
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,600
because piston elevators are usually an
even number like they're a four by four

634
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,610
even number like they're a four by four
 

635
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,019
even number like they're a four by four
sort of thing and and we got like a 5 by

636
00:15:59,019 --> 00:15:59,029
sort of thing and and we got like a 5 by
 

637
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,200
sort of thing and and we got like a 5 by
5 here so what I decided to do

638
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,210
5 here so what I decided to do
 

639
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,490
5 here so what I decided to do
we're gonna do a minecart elevator

640
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:03,500
we're gonna do a minecart elevator
 

641
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,790
we're gonna do a minecart elevator
because that's that's an odd number type

642
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
because that's that's an odd number type
 

643
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
because that's that's an odd number type
of elevator the only one I can think of

644
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,050
of elevator the only one I can think of
 

645
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,910
of elevator the only one I can think of
actually so that's what we'll do and

646
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:12,920
actually so that's what we'll do and
 

647
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,530
actually so that's what we'll do and
they're actually really good and they're

648
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:14,540
they're actually really good and they're
 

649
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,420
they're actually really good and they're
really quick so it's probably even

650
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,430
really quick so it's probably even
 

651
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,100
really quick so it's probably even
better than a piston elevator in this

652
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,110
better than a piston elevator in this
 

653
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,560
better than a piston elevator in this
case I'm just saying this up temporarily

654
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:23,570
case I'm just saying this up temporarily
 

655
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,740
case I'm just saying this up temporarily
just as a guide of where I want to put

656
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:26,750
just as a guide of where I want to put
 

657
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,180
just as a guide of where I want to put
it all right so this I'm not sure if I'm

658
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,190
it all right so this I'm not sure if I'm
 

659
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,730
it all right so this I'm not sure if I'm
gonna keep with the dark oak let me know

660
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:33,740
gonna keep with the dark oak let me know
 

661
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,079
gonna keep with the dark oak let me know
you guys think do you like the dark oak

662
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:35,089
you guys think do you like the dark oak
 

663
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:37,150
you guys think do you like the dark oak
here or should we just keep it the

664
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,160
here or should we just keep it the
 

665
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,540
here or should we just keep it the
sandstone in the purple probably needs

666
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,550
sandstone in the purple probably needs
 

667
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,850
sandstone in the purple probably needs
to go higher that's a really short

668
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:44,860
to go higher that's a really short
 

669
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,170
to go higher that's a really short
doorway oh man wait a second here let me

670
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:50,180
doorway oh man wait a second here let me
 

671
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,060
doorway oh man wait a second here let me
go up a little bit more see where was it

672
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,070
go up a little bit more see where was it
 

673
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,190
go up a little bit more see where was it
it was here let's go up at least one

674
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,200
it was here let's go up at least one
 

675
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,829
it was here let's go up at least one
more all right that's better so yeah

676
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
more all right that's better so yeah
 

677
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,579
more all right that's better so yeah
what we'll do I got any slabs I don't

678
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:06,589
what we'll do I got any slabs I don't
 

679
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,919
what we'll do I got any slabs I don't
have any slide to make some slabs I'll

680
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:08,929
have any slide to make some slabs I'll
 

681
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,910
have any slide to make some slabs I'll
put these away there we go let's do a

682
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:12,920
put these away there we go let's do a
 

683
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,140
put these away there we go let's do a
ring like this

684
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,150
ring like this
 

685
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:20,260
ring like this
oh no no no cuz I moved it up a block

686
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,270
oh no no no cuz I moved it up a block
 

687
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,390
oh no no no cuz I moved it up a block
that's not the right spot let's put it

688
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
that's not the right spot let's put it
 

689
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,730
that's not the right spot let's put it
up one more higher because I'm gonna

690
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:24,740
up one more higher because I'm gonna
 

691
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,179
up one more higher because I'm gonna
move these up to you at this level here

692
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:28,189
move these up to you at this level here
 

693
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:36,100
move these up to you at this level here
and then we will probably do I think the

694
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,110
and then we will probably do I think the
 

695
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,110
and then we will probably do I think the
spots where I have ladders I'm gonna put

696
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,120
spots where I have ladders I'm gonna put
 

697
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,380
spots where I have ladders I'm gonna put
the lamps like this and we'll put the

698
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,390
the lamps like this and we'll put the
 

699
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,710
the lamps like this and we'll put the
ladders on the lamp facing this way I

700
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:47,720
ladders on the lamp facing this way I
 

701
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,470
ladders on the lamp facing this way I
guess we'll do and see minecart track

702
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:53,480
guess we'll do and see minecart track
 

703
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,460
guess we'll do and see minecart track
and we'll build this up the goal is to

704
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,470
and we'll build this up the goal is to
 

705
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,810
and we'll build this up the goal is to
build all the way to the top there

706
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:58,820
build all the way to the top there
 

707
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,640
build all the way to the top there
before I have to jump down here because

708
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,650
before I have to jump down here because
 

709
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,600
before I have to jump down here because
I have I have no way of getting back up

710
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:04,610
I have I have no way of getting back up
 

711
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,440
I have I have no way of getting back up
really so we can't mess this up oh

712
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,450
really so we can't mess this up oh
 

713
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,010
really so we can't mess this up oh
actually poor little pig men's man

714
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,020
actually poor little pig men's man
 

715
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,990
actually poor little pig men's man
they're running into places in there

716
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
they're running into places in there
 

717
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,630
they're running into places in there
suffocating

718
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
suffocating
 

719
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,740
suffocating
that'll fall down and sits on the ladder

720
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:18,750
that'll fall down and sits on the ladder
 

721
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,750
that'll fall down and sits on the ladder
atlases double-check that's an okay of a

722
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:20,760
atlases double-check that's an okay of a
 

723
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,750
atlases double-check that's an okay of a
height block it in though alright so

724
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
height block it in though alright so
 

725
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,700
height block it in though alright so
hopefully I can I can reach I can't

726
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:28,710
hopefully I can I can reach I can't
 

727
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,850
hopefully I can I can reach I can't
reach can I reach if I jump I cannot so

728
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:31,860
reach can I reach if I jump I cannot so
 

729
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,070
reach can I reach if I jump I cannot so
it's a little bit too tall let me lower

730
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
it's a little bit too tall let me lower
 

731
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,790
it's a little bit too tall let me lower
this one block after all or wait wait

732
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:37,800
this one block after all or wait wait
 

733
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,490
this one block after all or wait wait
wait before I stop what if I have a half

734
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:40,500
wait before I stop what if I have a half
 

735
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,300
wait before I stop what if I have a half
slab here then I can get in if I jump

736
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,310
slab here then I can get in if I jump
 

737
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,540
slab here then I can get in if I jump
hmm is that good enough to I want to do

738
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:50,550
hmm is that good enough to I want to do
 

739
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:56,240
hmm is that good enough to I want to do
it that way oh I wanted to try something

740
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,250
it that way oh I wanted to try something
 

741
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,940
it that way oh I wanted to try something
here second I take a lot of fall damage

742
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:00,950
here second I take a lot of fall damage
 

743
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,470
here second I take a lot of fall damage
not too bad I could put a slime block at

744
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,480
not too bad I could put a slime block at
 

745
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:12,110
not too bad I could put a slime block at
the bottom to you I think we'll keep it

746
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,120
the bottom to you I think we'll keep it
 

747
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,200
the bottom to you I think we'll keep it
like this okay that's fine alright let's

748
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,210
like this okay that's fine alright let's
 

749
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,930
like this okay that's fine alright let's
go back up good we still made it and

750
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:17,940
go back up good we still made it and
 

751
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,540
go back up good we still made it and
then every there I should use this it's

752
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,550
then every there I should use this it's
 

753
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,950
then every there I should use this it's
every three blocks we need another

754
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:27,960
every three blocks we need another
 

755
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:36,140
every three blocks we need another
ladder so one two three ladder then one

756
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,150
ladder so one two three ladder then one
 

757
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:43,460
ladder so one two three ladder then one
two three next ladder will be there oh

758
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,470
two three next ladder will be there oh
 

759
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,650
two three next ladder will be there oh
wow look it actually matched up with the

760
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:45,660
wow look it actually matched up with the
 

761
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,140
wow look it actually matched up with the
stone there oh that's gonna make this a

762
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,150
stone there oh that's gonna make this a
 

763
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,130
stone there oh that's gonna make this a
lot easier I'd even think of that

764
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:51,140
lot easier I'd even think of that
 

765
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,630
lot easier I'd even think of that
alright and anyway so you get the idea

766
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
alright and anyway so you get the idea
 

767
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,460
alright and anyway so you get the idea
I'm gonna go ahead and do this I also

768
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:58,470
I'm gonna go ahead and do this I also
 

769
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm gonna go ahead and do this I also
want to light up these lamps I'll

770
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,050
want to light up these lamps I'll
 

771
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,920
want to light up these lamps I'll
probably just put a lever on like that

772
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:02,930
probably just put a lever on like that
 

773
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,300
probably just put a lever on like that
that's the reason I'm putting them here

774
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,310
that's the reason I'm putting them here
 

775
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,830
that's the reason I'm putting them here
so it's not completely dark in this

776
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:06,840
so it's not completely dark in this
 

777
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,560
so it's not completely dark in this
tunnel

778
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:08,570
tunnel
 

779
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:14,570
tunnel
cool cool very good I got the elevator

780
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:14,580
cool cool very good I got the elevator
 

781
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,600
cool cool very good I got the elevator
all done here up to the gold farm anyway

782
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:17,610
all done here up to the gold farm anyway
 

783
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,840
all done here up to the gold farm anyway
so let's give it a try

784
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:19,850
so let's give it a try
 

785
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,480
so let's give it a try
show you how it is hold right click

786
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,490
show you how it is hold right click
 

787
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,419
show you how it is hold right click
takes us up to here I got a hold up when

788
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:27,429
takes us up to here I got a hold up when
 

789
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:33,060
takes us up to here I got a hold up when
I exit otherwise I fall down so drop

790
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,070
I exit otherwise I fall down so drop
 

791
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,029
I exit otherwise I fall down so drop
down very very safely the ladders catch

792
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:36,039
down very very safely the ladders catch
 

793
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,399
down very very safely the ladders catch
you it's pretty cool it's nice and quick

794
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:40,409
you it's pretty cool it's nice and quick
 

795
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:45,960
you it's pretty cool it's nice and quick
and oh I got stuck there I would like to

796
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:45,970
and oh I got stuck there I would like to
 

797
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,509
and oh I got stuck there I would like to
eventually make it go all the way up to

798
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:48,519
eventually make it go all the way up to
 

799
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,600
eventually make it go all the way up to
the top of the nether like up why 250 or

800
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:51,610
the top of the nether like up why 250 or
 

801
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,330
the top of the nether like up why 250 or
so but I got a punch another hole into

802
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:54,340
so but I got a punch another hole into
 

803
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,680
so but I got a punch another hole into
the bedrock like right there which I

804
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:57,690
the bedrock like right there which I
 

805
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,730
the bedrock like right there which I
hope that still works by the way I

806
00:20:59,730 --> 00:20:59,740
hope that still works by the way I
 

807
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,659
hope that still works by the way I
haven't tried it in last few batches so

808
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:03,669
haven't tried it in last few batches so
 

809
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,060
haven't tried it in last few batches so
there's another thing I can do too if I

810
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,070
there's another thing I can do too if I
 

811
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,159
there's another thing I can do too if I
want to a quick way down I can just get

812
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:08,169
want to a quick way down I can just get
 

813
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,960
want to a quick way down I can just get
into one of these carts and a hole press

814
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:09,970
into one of these carts and a hole press
 

815
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,080
into one of these carts and a hole press
shift and they'll drop me down so it's

816
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,090
shift and they'll drop me down so it's
 

817
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,230
shift and they'll drop me down so it's
like a quick fall so I might put some

818
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,240
like a quick fall so I might put some
 

819
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,749
like a quick fall so I might put some
slime blocks or something there to this

820
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:18,759
slime blocks or something there to this
 

821
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,690
slime blocks or something there to this
I'll dress up later it's a bit plain at

822
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:21,700
I'll dress up later it's a bit plain at
 

823
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,720
I'll dress up later it's a bit plain at
the moment but I brought in a friend

824
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:24,730
the moment but I brought in a friend
 

825
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,129
the moment but I brought in a friend
here too so I'll have a mix of horses

826
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:29,139
here too so I'll have a mix of horses
 

827
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:30,810
here too so I'll have a mix of horses
and mules I believe like if I got to

828
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:30,820
and mules I believe like if I got to
 

829
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,450
and mules I believe like if I got to
carry stuff I'll grab my mule if I need

830
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:33,460
carry stuff I'll grab my mule if I need
 

831
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,310
carry stuff I'll grab my mule if I need
all I just want to get somewhere quickly

832
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,320
all I just want to get somewhere quickly
 

833
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,779
all I just want to get somewhere quickly
I'll use a horse sort of thing and we

834
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:39,789
I'll use a horse sort of thing and we
 

835
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,659
I'll use a horse sort of thing and we
got to make stalls for these guys so I

836
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:42,669
got to make stalls for these guys so I
 

837
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,350
got to make stalls for these guys so I
brought some string and some wool

838
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
brought some string and some wool
 

839
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,669
brought some string and some wool
probably the best like the most

840
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
probably the best like the most
 

841
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,149
probably the best like the most
convenient way I can do this is to set

842
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:51,159
convenient way I can do this is to set
 

843
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:55,369
convenient way I can do this is to set
up let's see where do I want to do it

844
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:55,379
up let's see where do I want to do it
 

845
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:59,730
up let's see where do I want to do it
set up some some of the carpets traps

846
00:21:59,730 --> 00:21:59,740
set up some some of the carpets traps
 

847
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,850
set up some some of the carpets traps
for the the mules and horses see the

848
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:02,860
for the the mules and horses see the
 

849
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,119
for the the mules and horses see the
diagonal is right there the midpoint

850
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,129
diagonal is right there the midpoint
 

851
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:09,840
diagonal is right there the midpoint
would be right here okay so let's let's

852
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:09,850
would be right here okay so let's let's
 

853
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,899
would be right here okay so let's let's
use that as our midpoint I want it at

854
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:12,909
use that as our midpoint I want it at
 

855
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,359
use that as our midpoint I want it at
least like two mules two horses but we

856
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:15,369
least like two mules two horses but we
 

857
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,499
least like two mules two horses but we
might want more than that

858
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:16,509
might want more than that
 

859
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:23,970
might want more than that
we'll see let's you know what let's

860
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:23,980
we'll see let's you know what let's
 

861
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,570
we'll see let's you know what let's
let's just try a like a one by one for

862
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:27,580
let's just try a like a one by one for
 

863
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,609
let's just try a like a one by one for
the for the mule why should know because

864
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:29,619
the for the mule why should know because
 

865
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,019
the for the mule why should know because
they're bigger than a one by one we need

866
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:31,029
they're bigger than a one by one we need
 

867
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:33,869
they're bigger than a one by one we need
at least a two by two we should probably

868
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:33,879
at least a two by two we should probably
 

869
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,970
at least a two by two we should probably
do it three by three

870
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:35,980
do it three by three
 

871
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:43,139
do it three by three
so this and we will put we could either

872
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:43,149
so this and we will put we could either
 

873
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:46,139
so this and we will put we could either
make it go down or up make it go down

874
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:46,149
make it go down or up make it go down
 

875
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:51,000
make it go down or up make it go down
I'll look like this will you make it go

876
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,010
I'll look like this will you make it go
 

877
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,620
I'll look like this will you make it go
up let's see

878
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:55,630
up let's see
 

879
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,190
up let's see
you'd have string oh wait no no I need a

880
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
you'd have string oh wait no no I need a
 

881
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,620
you'd have string oh wait no no I need a
bigger day let's let's extend it out

882
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:04,630
bigger day let's let's extend it out
 

883
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,960
bigger day let's let's extend it out
like this

884
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:05,970
like this
 

885
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,680
like this
we'll do a 4x4 area I guess yeah we'll

886
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:10,690
we'll do a 4x4 area I guess yeah we'll
 

887
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:19,560
we'll do a 4x4 area I guess yeah we'll
put string down like this all around and

888
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:19,570
put string down like this all around and
 

889
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,240
put string down like this all around and
then we will put the carpet above that I

890
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,250
then we will put the carpet above that I
 

891
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:30,720
then we will put the carpet above that I
like so hopefully this is okay and then

892
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:30,730
like so hopefully this is okay and then
 

893
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,980
like so hopefully this is okay and then
these we will probably want to change

894
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:31,990
these we will probably want to change
 

895
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,049
these we will probably want to change
out with stairs mmm don't have the

896
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:37,059
out with stairs mmm don't have the
 

897
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:43,200
out with stairs mmm don't have the
stairs let's get the stairs alright how

898
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,210
stairs let's get the stairs alright how
 

899
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,200
stairs let's get the stairs alright how
does that look yeah it's not too bad I

900
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,210
does that look yeah it's not too bad I
 

901
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,419
does that look yeah it's not too bad I
like that so then what I got to do is

902
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:48,429
like that so then what I got to do is
 

903
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:51,930
like that so then what I got to do is
dig at least three maybe I think it

904
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:51,940
dig at least three maybe I think it
 

905
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,690
dig at least three maybe I think it
might be four blocks below the string oh

906
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:54,700
might be four blocks below the string oh
 

907
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,129
might be four blocks below the string oh
it broke I hit the string I must stay at

908
00:23:59,129 --> 00:23:59,139
it broke I hit the string I must stay at
 

909
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,769
it broke I hit the string I must stay at
the string like so and that will make it

910
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:01,779
the string like so and that will make it
 

911
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,720
the string like so and that will make it
so the the horses and mules won't want

912
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:03,730
so the the horses and mules won't want
 

913
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,870
so the the horses and mules won't want
to cross this carpet border because

914
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
to cross this carpet border because
 

915
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,419
to cross this carpet border because
they'll think it's a drop and they won't

916
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:09,429
they'll think it's a drop and they won't
 

917
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,460
they'll think it's a drop and they won't
want to take fall damage so let me go

918
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:11,470
want to take fall damage so let me go
 

919
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,919
want to take fall damage so let me go
ahead and do that and we will try it out

920
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:13,929
ahead and do that and we will try it out
 

921
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:19,350
ahead and do that and we will try it out
okay should be good to go I got a four

922
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
okay should be good to go I got a four
 

923
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,299
okay should be good to go I got a four
block drop under the carpet here all

924
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:21,309
block drop under the carpet here all
 

925
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,659
block drop under the carpet here all
around it let's cover this up and we

926
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:24,669
around it let's cover this up and we
 

927
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:27,120
around it let's cover this up and we
will try it out with our buddy here so

928
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,130
will try it out with our buddy here so
 

929
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,810
will try it out with our buddy here so
we should be able to pretty easily just

930
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:29,820
we should be able to pretty easily just
 

931
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,769
we should be able to pretty easily just
go up hop off oh I missed it I want it

932
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:34,779
go up hop off oh I missed it I want it
 

933
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,330
go up hop off oh I missed it I want it
to be super convenient like I really

934
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:36,340
to be super convenient like I really
 

935
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,860
to be super convenient like I really
didn't have to try too hard to get him

936
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:37,870
didn't have to try too hard to get him
 

937
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,639
didn't have to try too hard to get him
oh I pushed him off okay so maybe I do

938
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:41,649
oh I pushed him off okay so maybe I do
 

939
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:47,310
oh I pushed him off okay so maybe I do
have to whoa getting a little bit of lag

940
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,320
have to whoa getting a little bit of lag

throw junk together and build a tiny
base I personally like that when you

1098
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,040
base I personally like that when you
 

1099
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,790
base I personally like that when you
one big bait main base where you stored

1100
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:15,800
one big bait main base where you stored
 

1101
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,460
one big bait main base where you stored
all your resources neatly on the new

1102
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:18,470
all your resources neatly on the new
 

1103
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,620
all your resources neatly on the new
server all you do is build as fast as he

1104
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:20,630
server all you do is build as fast as he
 

1105
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,240
server all you do is build as fast as he
can while other people wait for the

1106
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,250
can while other people wait for the
 

1107
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,700
can while other people wait for the
right chance to rate you he means I

1108
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:24,710
right chance to rate you he means I
 

1109
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,010
right chance to rate you he means I
think that you and the mine crackers

1110
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,020
think that you and the mine crackers
 

1111
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,900
think that you and the mine crackers
have an awesome server but I was

1112
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:28,910
have an awesome server but I was
 

1113
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,940
have an awesome server but I was
wondering if you can do it like - how it

1114
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:30,950
wondering if you can do it like - how it
 

1115
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,730
wondering if you can do it like - how it
was before I think he means like how we

1116
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:33,740
was before I think he means like how we
 

1117
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,000
was before I think he means like how we
were a build building focused server so

1118
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,010
were a build building focused server so
 

1119
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,380
were a build building focused server so
yeah I wanted to address this because

1120
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,390
yeah I wanted to address this because
 

1121
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,090
yeah I wanted to address this because
there's almost certainly gonna be some

1122
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:40,100
there's almost certainly gonna be some
 

1123
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,280
there's almost certainly gonna be some
changes with feed the beast coming up I

1124
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,290
changes with feed the beast coming up I
 

1125
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,080
changes with feed the beast coming up I
don't know exactly what those are gonna

1126
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,090
don't know exactly what those are gonna
 

1127
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,250
don't know exactly what those are gonna
be but we found out we can't we might

1128
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:48,260
be but we found out we can't we might
 

1129
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,920
be but we found out we can't we might
not be able to keep ICBM and Flan's mod

1130
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:50,930
not be able to keep ICBM and Flan's mod
 

1131
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,000
not be able to keep ICBM and Flan's mod
in our mod pack which are that the two

1132
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,010
in our mod pack which are that the two
 

1133
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,900
in our mod pack which are that the two
main like fighting packs like ICBM has

1134
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:58,910
main like fighting packs like ICBM has
 

1135
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,640
main like fighting packs like ICBM has
those rockets I've been using a lot in

1136
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:00,650
those rockets I've been using a lot in
 

1137
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,790
those rockets I've been using a lot in
the grenades and all that cool stuff and

1138
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:03,800
the grenades and all that cool stuff and
 

1139

00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:08,810
there's airplanes and tanks and stuff
 

1143
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:12,940
there's airplanes and tanks and stuff
and since the whole focus of our series

1144
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:12,950
and since the whole focus of our series
 

1145
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,470
and since the whole focus of our series
is fighting and we're losing our two

1146
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:17,480
is fighting and we're losing our two
 

1147
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,400
is fighting and we're losing our two
main fighting packs yeah that's that's a

1148
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:21,410
main fighting packs yeah that's that's a
 

1149
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,310
main fighting packs yeah that's that's a
big deal so either we're gonna get a

1150
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
big deal so either we're gonna get a
 

1151
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,530
big deal so either we're gonna get a
different fighting pack that's more

1152
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:26,540
different fighting pack that's more
 

1153
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,870
different fighting pack that's more
stable that's the reason they're there

1154
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
stable that's the reason they're there
 

1155
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,240
stable that's the reason they're there
kind of unstable and the feed the beast

1156
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,250
kind of unstable and the feed the beast
 

1157
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,100
kind of unstable and the feed the beast
guys don't have the time - or the

1158
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,110
guys don't have the time - or the
 

1159
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,410
guys don't have the time - or the
manpower not really well time and

1160
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:38,420
manpower not really well time and
 

1161
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,990
manpower not really well time and
manpower to keep those up-to-date for us

1162
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:43,000
manpower to keep those up-to-date for us
 

1163
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,140
manpower to keep those up-to-date for us
so either we get it a new fighting pack

1164
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,150
so either we get it a new fighting pack
 

1165
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,050
so either we get it a new fighting pack
which there are not many of those or we

1166
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,060
which there are not many of those or we
 

1167
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,840
which there are not many of those or we
somehow get those working or we focus on

1168
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:55,850
somehow get those working or we focus on
 

1169
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,340
somehow get those working or we focus on
being a build server which would

1170
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,350
being a build server which would
 

1171
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,130

possibly means we reset the map I'm not

1172
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,140
possibly means we reset the map I'm not
 

1173
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,020
possibly means we reset the map I'm not
entirely sure but for my past experience

1174
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,030
entirely sure but for my past experience
 

1175
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,080
entirely sure but for my past experience
with feed the beast like I had a lot of

1176
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,090
with feed the beast like I had a lot of
 

1177
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,780
with feed the beast like I had a lot of
trouble recording the season before this

1178
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:13,790
trouble recording the season before this
 

1179
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,680
trouble recording the season before this
like a lot the server was laggy it was

1180
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:17,690
like a lot the server was laggy it was
 

1181
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,690
like a lot the server was laggy it was
constantly thrashing and when it would

1182
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:19,700
constantly thrashing and when it would
 

1183
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,640
constantly thrashing and when it would
crash I had no control like I couldn't

1184
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:24,650
crash I had no control like I couldn't
 

1185
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,799
crash I had no control like I couldn't
do anything about it after it like

1186
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:26,809
do anything about it after it like
 

1187
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:28,960
do anything about it after it like
secured and hopefully he'd be around and

1188
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:28,970
secured and hopefully he'd be around and
 

1189
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,909
secured and hopefully he'd be around and
get it back up that modpack was a lot

1190
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
get it back up that modpack was a lot
 

1191
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,590
get it back up that modpack was a lot
more stable than the one we're currently

1192
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,600
more stable than the one we're currently
 

1193
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,930
more stable than the one we're currently
using so I may go and do a single-player

1194
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:40,940
using so I may go and do a single-player
 

1195
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,149
using so I may go and do a single-player
feed the beast thing but it it depends

1196
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:43,159
feed the beast thing but it it depends
 

1197
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:46,840
feed the beast thing but it it depends
on like if the other mine crackers do

1198
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:46,850
on like if the other mine crackers do
 

1199
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,220
on like if the other mine crackers do
feed the beast and they're they're

1200
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,230
feed the beast and they're they're
 

1201
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,220
feed the beast and they're they're
active with it I I can put up with lake

1202
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,230
active with it I I can put up with lake
 

1203
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,789
active with it I I can put up with lake
leg and that stuff but if if they're

1204

stuck there alone
 

1209
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,799
stuck there alone
doing my thing on a lady server that

doing my thing on a lady server that
 

1211
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:02,529
