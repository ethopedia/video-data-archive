farm
uh this is a big project it's taking me

10
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
uh this is a big project it's taking me
 

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,269
uh this is a big project it's taking me
a long time i admit it

12
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
a long time i admit it
 

13
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,790
a long time i admit it

00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
getting getting it done though so i was
 

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,029
getting getting it done though so i was
working on this today the holding area

16
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
working on this today the holding area
 

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,830
working on this today the holding area
got a little bit done

18
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
got a little bit done
 

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,229
got a little bit done
here um

20
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
here um
 

21
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,549
here um
yeah so we got the design figured out

22
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
yeah so we got the design figured out
 

23
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,630
yeah so we got the design figured out
for the crushing and

24
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
for the crushing and
 

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,110
for the crushing and
everything big thing now is just wiring

26
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
everything big thing now is just wiring
 

27
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,389
everything big thing now is just wiring
it all up

28
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
it all up
 

29
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,630
it all up
and what i've done is i've run two

30
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
and what i've done is i've run two
 

31
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,229
and what i've done is i've run two
buttons here

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
buttons here
 

33
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,910
buttons here
one on the left one on the right

34
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
one on the left one on the right
 

35
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,189
one on the left one on the right
and uh i decided to hide all the wiring

36
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
and uh i decided to hide all the wiring
 

37
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,069
and uh i decided to hide all the wiring
in the ceiling

38
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
in the ceiling
 

39
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,630
in the ceiling
hopefully so this is all going to be

40
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
hopefully so this is all going to be
 

41
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,630
hopefully so this is all going to be
covered up so you won't see it

42
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
covered up so you won't see it
 

43
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,069
covered up so you won't see it
most likely and

44
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
most likely and
 

45
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,150
most likely and
there's this side profile of it so the

46
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
there's this side profile of it so the
 

47
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,229
there's this side profile of it so the
button

48
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
button
 

49
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,310
button
goes this torch then up to that one and

50
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
goes this torch then up to that one and
 

51
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,670
goes this torch then up to that one and
then all the way up there

52
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
then all the way up there
 

53
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,789
then all the way up there
same on the other side

54
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799

 

55
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,070

and then this piston is kind of on its

56
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
and then this piston is kind of on its
 

57
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,870
and then this piston is kind of on its
own this is a crushing one

58
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
own this is a crushing one
 

59
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,109
own this is a crushing one
that goes down and gets inside the blaze

60
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
that goes down and gets inside the blaze
 

61
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,910
that goes down and gets inside the blaze
heads and

62
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
heads and
 

63
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,590
heads and
suffocates them and then this piston

64
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
suffocates them and then this piston
 

65
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,950
suffocates them and then this piston
and this one are the gates

66
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
and this one are the gates
 

67
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,910
and this one are the gates
this moves this last block so they can't

68
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
this moves this last block so they can't
 

69
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,270
this moves this last block so they can't
fall down

70
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
fall down
 

71
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,830
fall down
and that one cuts off the lava so those

72
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
and that one cuts off the lava so those
 

73
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,830
and that one cuts off the lava so those
two are hooked together

74
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
two are hooked together
 

75
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,469
two are hooked together
on that line over there the crusher ones

76
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
on that line over there the crusher ones
 

77
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,469
on that line over there the crusher ones
on that line over there so

78
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479

 

79
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,469

made a little way to get back to get up

80
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
made a little way to get back to get up
 

81
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,830
made a little way to get back to get up
here and

82
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
here and
 

83
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,030
here and
now i just need to

84
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
now i just need to
 

85
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,870
now i just need to
do the wiring here so there's going to

86
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
do the wiring here so there's going to
 

87
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,190
do the wiring here so there's going to
be two hours snore latches i need

88
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
be two hours snore latches i need
 

89
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,630
be two hours snore latches i need
and a long timer it's going to take up a

90
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
and a long timer it's going to take up a
 

91
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,230
and a long timer it's going to take up a
bit of space so that's why i want to

92
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
bit of space so that's why i want to
 

93
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,109
bit of space so that's why i want to
hide it in the ceiling to keep it as

94
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
hide it in the ceiling to keep it as
 

95
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,030
hide it in the ceiling to keep it as
sleek as possible down below here so it

96
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
sleek as possible down below here so it
 

97
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,310
sleek as possible down below here so it
looks good

98
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
looks good

they
 

133
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,949
they
stop suffocating that's where the head

134
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
stop suffocating that's where the head
 

135
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,390
stop suffocating that's where the head
their head will be in that spot there

which is nice
 

167
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,470
which is nice
and i've kind of shown this wiring

168
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
and i've kind of shown this wiring
 

169
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,309
and i've kind of shown this wiring
before so i don't know how much detail i

170
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
before so i don't know how much detail i
 

171
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,949
before so i don't know how much detail i

there's a few slight changes from my

176
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
there's a few slight changes from my
 

177
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,190
there's a few slight changes from my
blaze farm tutorial though

178
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
blaze farm tutorial though
 

179
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,309
blaze farm tutorial though
so this is the left button input right

180
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
so this is the left button input right
 

181
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,030
so this is the left button input right
here

182
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
here
 

183
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,710
here
and this is the right button left button

184
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
and this is the right button left button
 

185
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,350
and this is the right button left button
goes to an arsenal latch here

186
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
goes to an arsenal latch here
 

187
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,390
goes to an arsenal latch here
which controls that

188
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
which controls that
 

189
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,830
which controls that
gate so pressing the left button

190
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
gate so pressing the left button
 

191
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,949
gate so pressing the left button
closes the gate and then this is the

192
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
closes the gate and then this is the
 

193
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,070
closes the gate and then this is the
right button

194
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
right button
 

195
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,149
right button
when you hit the right button it opens

196
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
when you hit the right button it opens
 

197
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,509
when you hit the right button it opens
it

198
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
it
 

199
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,309
it
and that this is where it goes down to

200
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
and that this is where it goes down to
 

201
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,190
and that this is where it goes down to
the gate there

202
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
the gate there
 

203
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,189

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
the glass block for them to stand on so
 

215
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,189
the glass block for them to stand on so
it comes down to there

216
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
it comes down to there
 

217
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,189
it comes down to there
and actually i never really showed the

218
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
and actually i never really showed the
 

219
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,469
and actually i never really showed the
wiring

220
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
wiring
 

221
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,310
wiring
it's just uh

222
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320

 

223
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,310

just wire there straight to that goes

224
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
just wire there straight to that goes
 

225
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,390
just wire there straight to that goes
down to a

226
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
down to a
 

227
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,150
down to a
torch here and then to that one which

228
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
torch here and then to that one which
 

229
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,230
torch here and then to that one which
powers that piston

230
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
powers that piston
 

231
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,990
powers that piston
i can add a repeater here if i want to

232
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
i can add a repeater here if i want to
 

233
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,510
i can add a repeater here if i want to
sync them

234
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
sync them
 

235
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,629
sync them
don't know if i will or not

236
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
don't know if i will or not
 

237
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,230
don't know if i will or not
okay and then the other rs nor latch

238
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
okay and then the other rs nor latch
 

239
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,670
okay and then the other rs nor latch
controls the crusher which is uh over

240
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
controls the crusher which is uh over
 

241
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,550
controls the crusher which is uh over
here this is a crusher one

242
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
here this is a crusher one
 

243
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,469
here this is a crusher one
um and that's the output to it to that

244
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
um and that's the output to it to that
 

245
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,550
um and that's the output to it to that
one piston right there

246
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
one piston right there
 

247
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,909
one piston right there
that's what this wire goes down to so

248
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
that's what this wire goes down to so
 

249
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,550
that's what this wire goes down to so
hit the left button powers this goes to

250
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
hit the left button powers this goes to
 

251
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,150
hit the left button powers this goes to
that

252
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
that
 

253
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,629
that
and then it activates this long delay

254
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
and then it activates this long delay
 

255
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,189
and then it activates this long delay
here

256
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199

 

257
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,790

and then it shuts off after that time

258
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
and then it shuts off after that time
 

259
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,469
and then it shuts off after that time
goes by so this is that

260
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
goes by so this is that
 

261
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,110
goes by so this is that
new pulse sustainer i showed you about

262
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
new pulse sustainer i showed you about
 

263
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,870
new pulse sustainer i showed you about
five episodes ago

264
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
five episodes ago
 

265
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,310
five episodes ago
i was really remember i was really

266
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
i was really remember i was really
 

267
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,710
i was really remember i was really
excited about it because

268
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
excited about it because
 

269
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,629
excited about it because
i will probably use it a lot and i have

270
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
i will probably use it a lot and i have
 

271
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,230
i will probably use it a lot and i have
used it in this blaze farm so

272
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
used it in this blaze farm so
 

273
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,629
used it in this blaze farm so
instead of these repeaters being four

274
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
instead of these repeaters being four
 

275
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,469
instead of these repeaters being four
ticks each they're actually eight

276
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
ticks each they're actually eight
 

277
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,590
ticks each they're actually eight
with this setup it doubles their length

278
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
with this setup it doubles their length
 

279
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,110
with this setup it doubles their length
so in my other blaze farm i think i used

280
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
so in my other blaze farm i think i used
 

281
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,189
so in my other blaze farm i think i used
23 repeaters or 27 maybe

282
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
23 repeaters or 27 maybe
 

283
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,430
23 repeaters or 27 maybe
this i'll be able to use about half as

284
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
this i'll be able to use about half as
 

285
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,309
this i'll be able to use about half as
many so

286
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
many so
 

287
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,189
many so
be a lot smaller amount of space i need

288
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
be a lot smaller amount of space i need
 

289
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,110
be a lot smaller amount of space i need
for it

290
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
for it
 

291
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,189
for it
but this is not fine tuned yet i might

292
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
but this is not fine tuned yet i might
 

293
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,150
but this is not fine tuned yet i might
have to add a few

294
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
have to add a few
 

295
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,189
have to add a few
more here yet or remove a few

296
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
more here yet or remove a few
 

297
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,870
more here yet or remove a few
i'm not sure yet i can i know already

298
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
i'm not sure yet i can i know already
 

299
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,469
i'm not sure yet i can i know already
that this isn't set up right because

300
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
that this isn't set up right because
 

301
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,070
that this isn't set up right because
just an example of the fine tuning

302
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
just an example of the fine tuning
 

303
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,710
just an example of the fine tuning
that's not right

304
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
that's not right
 

305
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,710
that's not right
this crusher piston seems to be coming

306
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
this crusher piston seems to be coming
 

307
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,749
this crusher piston seems to be coming
down before

308
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
down before
 

309
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,790
down before
the gates close

310
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800

 

311
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,870

which is bad because if that was to

312
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
which is bad because if that was to
 

313
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,350
which is bad because if that was to
happen it would push the blaze down

314
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360

 

315
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,230

into where this glass block glow where

316
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
into where this glass block glow where
 

317
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,830
into where this glass block glow where
it goes

318
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
it goes
 

319
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,870
it goes
because it's not there yet so we need to

320
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
because it's not there yet so we need to
 

321
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,110
because it's not there yet so we need to
add a little bit more delay to that

322
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120

 

323
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,590

and uh once i fine-tune all this i'll

324
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
and uh once i fine-tune all this i'll
 

325
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,990
and uh once i fine-tune all this i'll
probably show it to you one more time

326
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000

 

327
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,110

so yeah i can just make this longer and

328
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
so yeah i can just make this longer and
 

329
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,469
so yeah i can just make this longer and
maybe add a few more i don't know

330
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479

 

331
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,309

alright so the blades are falling down

332
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
alright so the blades are falling down
 

333
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,150
alright so the blades are falling down
they're getting pushed over to the lava

334
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160

 

335
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,550

then they swim up and this is where

336
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
then they swim up and this is where
 

337
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,390
then they swim up and this is where
they're collecting

338
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
they're collecting
 

339
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,230
they're collecting
and i've adjusted the timing i think i

340
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
and i've adjusted the timing i think i
 

341
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,430
and i've adjusted the timing i think i
got it pretty close

342
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
got it pretty close
 

343
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,870
got it pretty close
to right now got 39

344
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
to right now got 39
 

345
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,230
to right now got 39
in there i'll probably have to use

346
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
in there i'll probably have to use
 

347
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,029
in there i'll probably have to use
splash potions or else a stone sword or

348
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
splash potions or else a stone sword or
 

349
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,629
splash potions or else a stone sword or
something with this because they

350
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
something with this because they
 

351
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,230
something with this because they
do take a bit of damage from the pistons

352
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
do take a bit of damage from the pistons
 

353
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,749
do take a bit of damage from the pistons
although it might be because i don't

354
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
although it might be because i don't
 

355
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,990
although it might be because i don't
have that set up properly yet i need to

356
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
have that set up properly yet i need to
 

357
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,189
have that set up properly yet i need to
add a regulator

358
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
add a regulator
 

359
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,749
add a regulator
to the conveyor belt there because we're

360
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
to the conveyor belt there because we're
 

361
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,670
to the conveyor belt there because we're
losing a lot of them

362
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
losing a lot of them
 

363
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,309
losing a lot of them
from suffocation you see they're they're

364
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
from suffocation you see they're they're
 

365
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,990
from suffocation you see they're they're
dying right there

366
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
dying right there
 

367
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,589
dying right there
so we need to control that a little bit

368
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
so we need to control that a little bit
 

369
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,070
so we need to control that a little bit
better but anyway here is an example of

370
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
better but anyway here is an example of
 

371
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,950
better but anyway here is an example of
it working

372
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960

 

373
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,390

we will lose a few from this

374
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400

 

375
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,550

and this should take them all down to

376
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
and this should take them all down to
 

377
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,430
and this should take them all down to
one hit all the ones that survive i hope

378
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440

 

379
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,550

yeah so it's pretty cool

380
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
yeah so it's pretty cool
 

381
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,189
yeah so it's pretty cool
and uh i do have this open i'm not sure

382
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
and uh i do have this open i'm not sure
 

383
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,430
and uh i do have this open i'm not sure
if i'm gonna leave it open

384
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
if i'm gonna leave it open
 

385
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,189
if i'm gonna leave it open
oh this guy has a little bit more health

386
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
oh this guy has a little bit more health
 

387
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,510
oh this guy has a little bit more health
doesn't he

388
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
doesn't he
 

389
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,830
doesn't he
i think one of them snuck up as the gate

390
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
i think one of them snuck up as the gate
 

391
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,710
i think one of them snuck up as the gate
closed

392
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720

 

393
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,310

it's hard to tell that is another issue

394
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
it's hard to tell that is another issue
 

395
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,070
it's hard to tell that is another issue
i seem to be having the xp

396
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
i seem to be having the xp
 

397
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,350
i seem to be having the xp
orbs are falling through the glass

398
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360

 

399
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,070

i might have to lower the lava block

400
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
i might have to lower the lava block
 

401
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,709
i might have to lower the lava block
over there

402
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
over there
 

403
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,230
over there
down one more just so

404
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240

 

405
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,949

it they definitely won't burn in it

406
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
it they definitely won't burn in it
 

407
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,230
it they definitely won't burn in it
because i'm a little worried about that

408
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
because i'm a little worried about that
 

409
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,630
because i'm a little worried about that
or change this glass block to something

410
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
or change this glass block to something
 

411
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,630
or change this glass block to something
else so that doesn't happen

412
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640

 

413
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,710

but yeah splash potions would definitely

414
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
but yeah splash potions would definitely
 

415
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,389
but yeah splash potions would definitely
make this better

416
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399

 

417
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,670

and then when you're ready for the next

418
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
and then when you're ready for the next
 

419
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,230
and then when you're ready for the next
ones just hit that

420
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240

 

421
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,350

and uh yeah

422
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
and uh yeah
 

423
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,790
and uh yeah
so they can see you for a little bit

424
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
so they can see you for a little bit
 

425
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,509
so they can see you for a little bit
that's why they get the flames

426
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
that's why they get the flames
 

427
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,990
that's why they get the flames
if i block that up or put a block in

428
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
if i block that up or put a block in
 

429
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,630
if i block that up or put a block in
front of this

430
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
front of this
 

431
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,389
front of this
i won't have that problem there is

432
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
i won't have that problem there is
 

433
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,070
i won't have that problem there is
actually a piston right below

434
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
actually a piston right below
 

435
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,269
actually a piston right below
this at the moment i'm just not

436
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
this at the moment i'm just not
 

437
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,070
this at the moment i'm just not
using it

438
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
using it
 

439
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:45,990
using it
it's pretty cool i like it

440
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000

 

441
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,630

it's gonna be very cool once i get it

442
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
it's gonna be very cool once i get it
 

443
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,389
it's gonna be very cool once i get it
all working perfectly

444
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399

 

445
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,590

anyway one more last quick look

446
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
anyway one more last quick look
 

447
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,110
anyway one more last quick look
up here i just

448
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
up here i just
 

449
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,790
up here i just
in case anybody does care about the

450
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
in case anybody does care about the
 

451
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,190
in case anybody does care about the
redstone i added three more

452
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
redstone i added three more
 

453
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,110
redstone i added three more
repeaters here for a total of one two

454
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
repeaters here for a total of one two
 

455
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,389
repeaters here for a total of one two
three four five six

456
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
three four five six
 

457
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,949
three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven well

458
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
seven eight nine ten eleven well
 

459
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,829
seven eight nine ten eleven well
i think twelve and then

460
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
i think twelve and then
 

461
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,310
i think twelve and then
yeah twelve main ones

462
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
yeah twelve main ones
 

463
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,590
yeah twelve main ones
all set to four and then i had to

464
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
all set to four and then i had to
 

465
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,190
all set to four and then i had to
put uh two repeaters here because

466
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
put uh two repeaters here because
 

467
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,269
put uh two repeaters here because
uh the crusher kept activating before

468
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
uh the crusher kept activating before
 

469
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,310
uh the crusher kept activating before
the gates

470
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
the gates
 

471
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,150
the gates
which was a problem

472
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160

 

473
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,350

all right so next task is to control

474
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
all right so next task is to control
 

475
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,509
all right so next task is to control
that a little bit better and i also need

476
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
that a little bit better and i also need
 

477
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,069
that a little bit better and i also need
to

478
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
to
 

479
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,590
to
connect the light on off

480
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
connect the light on off
 

481
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,230
connect the light on off
lighting thing of these two together

482
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
lighting thing of these two together
 

483
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,750
lighting thing of these two together
because right now they're separate and i

484
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
because right now they're separate and i
 

485
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,230
because right now they're separate and i
have to go up here

486
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
have to go up here
 

487
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,269
have to go up here
and manually flip the lever to shut them

488
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
and manually flip the lever to shut them
 

489
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,269
and manually flip the lever to shut them
off

490
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
off
 

491
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,430
off
and it would be nice if i have a switch

492
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
and it would be nice if i have a switch
 

493
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,990
and it would be nice if i have a switch
down here somewhere that i can just

494
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
down here somewhere that i can just
 

495
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,150
down here somewhere that i can just
flip to turn them both on or off

496
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160

 

497
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,910

okay i've been at this for another hour

498
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
okay i've been at this for another hour
 

499
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,550
okay i've been at this for another hour
or so here's another update

500
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
or so here's another update
 

501
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,230
or so here's another update
i did replace that glass block with the

502
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
i did replace that glass block with the
 

503
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,509
i did replace that glass block with the
sandstone one so we'll see if that helps

504
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519

 

505
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,949

getting very laggy about 53 there

506
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959

 

507
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,949

we're just checking to see if the xp

508
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
we're just checking to see if the xp
 

509
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,990
we're just checking to see if the xp
will fall

510
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
will fall
 

511
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,949
will fall
down like it was before and gets stuck

512
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
down like it was before and gets stuck
 

513
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,710
down like it was before and gets stuck
in the lava or something dumb

514
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720

 

515
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,350

so that could be pretty bad

516
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360

 

517
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,269

oh i really wish i had a splash potion

518
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279

 

519
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,990

oh it looks like it's falling down again

520
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
oh it looks like it's falling down again
 

521
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,710
oh it looks like it's falling down again
you see how it's kind of popping up

522
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
you see how it's kind of popping up
 

523
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,430
you see how it's kind of popping up
um worried about that

524
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440

 

525
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,030

so weird when you have them all clumped

526
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
so weird when you have them all clumped
 

527
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,470
so weird when you have them all clumped
together like this and you hit them you

528
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
together like this and you hit them you
 

529
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,829
together like this and you hit them you
can't really tell if you're

530
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
can't really tell if you're
 

531
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,590
can't really tell if you're
killing them or not

532
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600

 

533
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,150

i'm not quite sure why that is

534
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160

 

535
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,590

there we go does any xp gonna go

536
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
there we go does any xp gonna go
 

537
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,110
there we go does any xp gonna go
into us when we get closer here

538
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
into us when we get closer here
 

539
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,790
into us when we get closer here
no okay that's good it might have uh

540
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
no okay that's good it might have uh
 

541
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,629
no okay that's good it might have uh
fixed it having the sandstone here

542
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639

 

543
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,750

uh but in other news

544
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
uh but in other news
 

545
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,550
uh but in other news
i have also lowered that one lava block

546
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
i have also lowered that one lava block
 

547
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,629
i have also lowered that one lava block
down one just in case

548
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
down one just in case
 

549
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,430
down one just in case
that is a problem and uh should keep

550
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
that is a problem and uh should keep
 

551
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,750
that is a problem and uh should keep
them from being able to see us

552
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
them from being able to see us
 

553
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,110
them from being able to see us
as easily too because it'll be i noticed

554
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
as easily too because it'll be i noticed
 

555
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,910
as easily too because it'll be i noticed
they were kind of

556
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
they were kind of
 

557
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,710
they were kind of
jumping up and you could see their eyes

558
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
jumping up and you could see their eyes
 

559
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,030
jumping up and you could see their eyes
like before this other lava team down

560
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040

 

561
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,310

all right and i've added some character

562
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
all right and i've added some character
 

563
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,870
all right and i've added some character
to this

564
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
to this
 

565
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,470
to this
i kind of like it kind of sticks out

566
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
i kind of like it kind of sticks out
 

567
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,910
i kind of like it kind of sticks out
same with over here and i have even

568
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
same with over here and i have even
 

569
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,389
same with over here and i have even
added an on off switch down here

570
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399

 

571
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,790

for both sides which is great

572
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800

 

573
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,069

maybe i'll get rid of these guys and

574
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
maybe i'll get rid of these guys and
 

575
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,310
maybe i'll get rid of these guys and
then we'll continue

576
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320

 

577
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,710

all right that's better so this button

578
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
all right that's better so this button
 

579
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,990
all right that's better so this button
here

580
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
here
 

581
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,069
here
goes up there

582
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
goes up there
 

583
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,110
goes up there
and connects to a t

584
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
and connects to a t
 

585
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,710
and connects to a t
flip flop

586
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720

 

587
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,829

over here

588
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839

 

589
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,269

you can see the torch is behind there it

590
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
you can see the torch is behind there it
 

591
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,550
you can see the torch is behind there it
goes up into that block there

592
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
goes up into that block there
 

593
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,750
goes up into that block there
and it it's powered right now that turns

594
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
and it it's powered right now that turns
 

595
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,509
and it it's powered right now that turns
it off so it's a supercharged t

596
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
it off so it's a supercharged t
 

597
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,470
it off so it's a supercharged t
flip flop so it's a little bit quicker

598
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
flip flop so it's a little bit quicker
 

599
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,590
flip flop so it's a little bit quicker
and then

600
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
and then
 

601
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,150
and then
it's when this switches it sends power

602
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
it's when this switches it sends power
 

603
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,829
it's when this switches it sends power
to

604
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
to
 

605
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,629
to
that direction and then also runs over

606
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
that direction and then also runs over
 

607
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,670
that direction and then also runs over
this top here

608
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
this top here
 

609
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,790
this top here
to there so

610
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
to there so
 

611
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,829
to there so
pretty simple you can control it from

612
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
pretty simple you can control it from
 

613
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,550
pretty simple you can control it from
below here i'm thinking

614
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
below here i'm thinking
 

615
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,030
below here i'm thinking
i'm trying i don't want to get into the

616
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
i'm trying i don't want to get into the
 

617
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,509
i'm trying i don't want to get into the
pattern of you only using sandstone here

618
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
pattern of you only using sandstone here
 

619
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,069
pattern of you only using sandstone here
so

620
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079

 

621
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,269

we're going to try and make this pretty

622
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
we're going to try and make this pretty
 

623
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,189
we're going to try and make this pretty
close to it we're going to start using

624
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
close to it we're going to start using
 

625
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,470
close to it we're going to start using
some wood

626
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
some wood
 

627
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,430
some wood
it's thinking that maybe putting leaves

628
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
it's thinking that maybe putting leaves
 

629
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,590
it's thinking that maybe putting leaves
uh for the top here maybe

630
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
uh for the top here maybe
 

631
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,110
uh for the top here maybe
would be cool or have uh maybe cross

632
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
would be cool or have uh maybe cross
 

633
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,030
would be cool or have uh maybe cross
sections with leaves

634
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
sections with leaves
 

635
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,069
sections with leaves
in between the crosses

636
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
in between the crosses
 

637
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,870
in between the crosses
uh up here i have modified that room

638
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
uh up here i have modified that room
 

639
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,590
uh up here i have modified that room
again

640
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
again
 

641
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,189
again
and those i know i said we weren't going

642
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
and those i know i said we weren't going
 

643
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,389
and those i know i said we weren't going
to go up there but we're going to go up

644
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
to go up there but we're going to go up
 

645
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,550
to go up there but we're going to go up
there again one more time

646
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
there again one more time
 

647
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,670
there again one more time
so it's all stone just to gas proof it

648
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
so it's all stone just to gas proof it
 

649
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,750
so it's all stone just to gas proof it
because i don't want anything to happen

650
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
because i don't want anything to happen
 

651
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,030
because i don't want anything to happen
because i'll never

652
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
because i'll never
 

653
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,590
because i'll never
remember how to fix it probably and

654
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
remember how to fix it probably and
 

655
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,790
remember how to fix it probably and
yeah so when this is all done

656
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
yeah so when this is all done
 

657
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,389
yeah so when this is all done
that stone will all be covered with

658
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
that stone will all be covered with
 

659
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,629
that stone will all be covered with
something so

660
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
something so
 

661
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,910
something so
don't worry about that it's not going to

662
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
don't worry about that it's not going to
 

663
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,550
don't worry about that it's not going to
be gray and same with this wiring

664
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
be gray and same with this wiring
 

665
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,110
be gray and same with this wiring
over here i'll probably wrap something

666
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
over here i'll probably wrap something
 

667
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,389
over here i'll probably wrap something
around it

668
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
around it
 

669
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,470
around it
to hide it and over here

670
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
to hide it and over here
 

671
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,590
to hide it and over here
although it does look kind of cool

672
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
although it does look kind of cool
 

673
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,509
although it does look kind of cool
without it even but yeah

674
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
without it even but yeah
 

675
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,110
without it even but yeah
when i was building it i was very

676
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
when i was building it i was very
 

677
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,670
when i was building it i was very
careful not to

678
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
careful not to
 

679
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,829
careful not to
make one side different than the other

680
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
make one side different than the other
 

681
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,829
make one side different than the other
just in case i didn't cover it

682
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
just in case i didn't cover it
 

683
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,590
just in case i didn't cover it
i wanted it to look symmetrical

684
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
i wanted it to look symmetrical
 

685
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,470
i wanted it to look symmetrical
and yeah turned out really well

686
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480

 

687
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,069

so now paths will go to the right there

688
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
so now paths will go to the right there
 

689
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,790
so now paths will go to the right there
and to the left

690
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800

 

691
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,470

gotta hook up the netherwart farm

692
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
gotta hook up the netherwart farm
 

693
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,590
gotta hook up the netherwart farm
somewhere or farms

694
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
somewhere or farms
 

695
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,749
somewhere or farms
uh over here i'm not entirely sure what

696
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
uh over here i'm not entirely sure what
 

697
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,269
uh over here i'm not entirely sure what
i'm gonna do

698
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
i'm gonna do
 

699
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,189
i'm gonna do
i was thinking about doing a zombie

700
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
i was thinking about doing a zombie
 

701
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,670
i was thinking about doing a zombie
pigman farm too and just have an exact

702
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
pigman farm too and just have an exact
 

703
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,710
pigman farm too and just have an exact
copy of that on this side

704
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
copy of that on this side
 

705
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,710
copy of that on this side
the same spacing and everything so it

706
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
the same spacing and everything so it
 

707
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,710
the same spacing and everything so it
looks symmetrical

708
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
looks symmetrical
 

709
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,949
looks symmetrical
but i don't know we do also need to

710
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
but i don't know we do also need to
 

711
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,509
but i don't know we do also need to
get a portal somewhere and

712
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519

 

713
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,430

a minecart track maybe

714
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440

 

715
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,509

but yeah i'm gonna there's gonna be

716
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
but yeah i'm gonna there's gonna be
 

717
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,189
but yeah i'm gonna there's gonna be
grass and stuff and trees

718
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
grass and stuff and trees
 

719
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,430
grass and stuff and trees
when this is all done so it's not gonna

720
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
when this is all done so it's not gonna
 

721
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,910
when this is all done so it's not gonna
be all red like this

722
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
be all red like this
 

723
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,350
be all red like this
i know that's why people don't like the

724
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
i know that's why people don't like the
 

725
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,069
i know that's why people don't like the
nether this is probably my most hated

726
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
nether this is probably my most hated
 

727
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,629
nether this is probably my most hated
block this texture right here

728
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
block this texture right here
 

729
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,030
block this texture right here
and it's a shame the whole nether is

730
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
and it's a shame the whole nether is
 

731
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,310
and it's a shame the whole nether is
made out of it pretty much

732
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320

 

733
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,150

and i'm sure a lot of people share that

734
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
and i'm sure a lot of people share that
 

735
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,670
and i'm sure a lot of people share that
feeling so

736
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
feeling so
 

737
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,350
feeling so
yeah you really get a feeling of the

738
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
yeah you really get a feeling of the
 

739
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,430
yeah you really get a feeling of the
size when you look at it from down here

740
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
size when you look at it from down here
 

741
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,829
size when you look at it from down here
it's uh it's a big project

742
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
it's uh it's a big project
 

743
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,269
it's uh it's a big project
hey it's a big project that's why it's

744
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
hey it's a big project that's why it's
 

745
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,269
hey it's a big project that's why it's
taken so

746
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
taken so
 

747
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,350
taken so
stinking long to finish it

748
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360

 

749
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,669

and everything seems to not want to work

750
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679

 

751
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,789

so i have to keep working at it keep

752
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
so i have to keep working at it keep
 

753
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,069
so i have to keep working at it keep
fixing it and there's only one thing

754
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
fixing it and there's only one thing
 

755
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,230
fixing it and there's only one thing
left to do and that's to add a regulator

756
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
left to do and that's to add a regulator
 

757
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,189
left to do and that's to add a regulator
here

758
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
here
 

759
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,390
here
so it's getting late here

760
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
so it's getting late here
 

761
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,510
so it's getting late here
i might give it a shot we'll see

762
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
i might give it a shot we'll see
 

763
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,029
i might give it a shot we'll see
uh yeah i'll try it out

764
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
uh yeah i'll try it out
 

765
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,710
uh yeah i'll try it out
hopefully i can finish it if i finish

766
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
hopefully i can finish it if i finish
 

767
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,630
hopefully i can finish it if i finish
that this is all done pretty much and

768
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
that this is all done pretty much and
 

769
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,350
that this is all done pretty much and
just

770
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
just
 

771
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,830
just
fine tuning and finishing touches

772
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
fine tuning and finishing touches
 

773
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,070
fine tuning and finishing touches
afterwards

774
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080

 

775
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,510

all right so i was looking at that over

776
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
all right so i was looking at that over
 

777
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,909
all right so i was looking at that over
there and it seems like there's one spot

778
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
there and it seems like there's one spot
 

779
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,750
there and it seems like there's one spot
where i can sneak a piston in

780
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
where i can sneak a piston in
 

781
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,870
where i can sneak a piston in
right over here and uh

782
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
right over here and uh
 

783
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,789
right over here and uh
can control the fall area

784
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
can control the fall area
 

785
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,390
can control the fall area
so to make a gate basically

786
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
so to make a gate basically
 

787
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,549
so to make a gate basically
and if it's like this they won't be able

788
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
and if it's like this they won't be able
 

789
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,470
and if it's like this they won't be able
to fall down and if it's like that

790
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
to fall down and if it's like that
 

791
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,110
to fall down and if it's like that
they can so we're gonna test to see

792
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
they can so we're gonna test to see
 

793
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,230
they can so we're gonna test to see
what happens if we close that off and we

794
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
what happens if we close that off and we
 

795
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,830
what happens if we close that off and we
have a bunch of blades in there

796
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
have a bunch of blades in there
 

797
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,549
have a bunch of blades in there
if uh they start going crazy or if they

798
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
if uh they start going crazy or if they
 

799
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,110
if uh they start going crazy or if they
neatly fall into that hole

800
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120

 

801
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,590

i'm not really oh yeah so used to going

802
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
i'm not really oh yeah so used to going
 

803
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,789
i'm not really oh yeah so used to going
up there

804
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799

 

805
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:42,950

okay so hopefully we're still in range

806
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
okay so hopefully we're still in range
 

807
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,270
okay so hopefully we're still in range
i think uh

808
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280

 

809
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,110

maybe a few problems with this i don't

810
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
maybe a few problems with this i don't
 

811
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,470
maybe a few problems with this i don't
know

812
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
know
 

813
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,950
know
if this does work

814
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960

 

815
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,630

right because they won't stay on so

816
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
right because they won't stay on so
 

817
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,310
right because they won't stay on so
it'll constantly

818
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
it'll constantly
 

819
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,190
it'll constantly
pulse like that

820
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200

 

821
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,830

they're not taking damage but that is

822
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:08,840

 

823
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,150

annoying

824
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160

 

825
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:21,830

i don't know how else to do it really

826
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840

 

827
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,150

and then you still have problems

828
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160

 

829
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,950

i don't know

830
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960

 

831
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,830

this is such a tough thing to figure out

832
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
this is such a tough thing to figure out
 

833
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,470
this is such a tough thing to figure out
i would have to hook it up uh

834
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
i would have to hook it up uh
 

835
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,150
i would have to hook it up uh
maybe on a clock i don't really want to

836
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
maybe on a clock i don't really want to
 

837
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,549
maybe on a clock i don't really want to
use a clock but i might have to

838
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
use a clock but i might have to
 

839
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,390
use a clock but i might have to
or it would probably be the simplest way

840
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,400
or it would probably be the simplest way
 

841
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,549
or it would probably be the simplest way
of doing this

842
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
of doing this
 

843
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,950
of doing this
all right let me think about this

844
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960

 

845
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,750

what could be done maybe is uh get rid

846
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
what could be done maybe is uh get rid
 

847
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,630
what could be done maybe is uh get rid
of those first

848
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
of those first
 

849
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,909
of those first
two pressure plates here

850
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
two pressure plates here
 

851
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,430
two pressure plates here
starting ones and

852
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440

 

853
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,270

by default have it like that so they

854
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
by default have it like that so they
 

855
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,350
by default have it like that so they
fall into that holding area right over

856
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
fall into that holding area right over
 

857
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,630
fall into that holding area right over
there

858
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
there
 

859
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,310
there
and then when you're ready to send them

860
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
and then when you're ready to send them
 

861
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,310
and then when you're ready to send them
through have it so

862
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
through have it so
 

863
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,310
through have it so
this one goes back first and then

864
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
this one goes back first and then
 

865
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,470
this one goes back first and then
right after that one pushes

866
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480

 

867
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,909

that'll push him over one block and then

868
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
that'll push him over one block and then
 

869
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,669
that'll push him over one block and then
have this one push right after that

870
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
have this one push right after that
 

871
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,029
have this one push right after that
again

872
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
again
 

873
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,390
again
and then that one over there retract one

874
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
and then that one over there retract one
 

875
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,750
and then that one over there retract one
more time

876
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
more time
 

877
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,270
more time
and that should uh push him through

878
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
and that should uh push him through
 

879
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,630
and that should uh push him through
and then you would just have to

880
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
and then you would just have to
 

881
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,710
and then you would just have to
alternate between

882
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720
alternate between
 

883
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,070
alternate between
this one and that one back and forth

884
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
this one and that one back and forth
 

885
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,350
this one and that one back and forth
every

886
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
every
 

887
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,190
every
few seconds or so and it should be

888
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
few seconds or so and it should be
 

889
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,310
few seconds or so and it should be
good

890
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320

 

891
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,270

yeah probably the best method that i can

892
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
yeah probably the best method that i can
 

893
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,310
yeah probably the best method that i can
think of

894
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
think of
 

895
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,909
think of
so i will try it hopefully

896
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
so i will try it hopefully
 

897
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,510
so i will try it hopefully
and we'll see what happens

898
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520

 

899
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,990

i think this is gonna work i think it

900
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
i think this is gonna work i think it
 

901
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,110
i think this is gonna work i think it
will got the pressure plates gone

902
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
will got the pressure plates gone
 

903
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,990
will got the pressure plates gone
see they're gathering 14

904
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000

 

905
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,710

or so in here it's getting really laggy

906
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
or so in here it's getting really laggy
 

907
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,630
or so in here it's getting really laggy
uh this one is inverted

908
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
uh this one is inverted
 

909
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,350
uh this one is inverted
so it's holding them back in there

910
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
so it's holding them back in there
 

911
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,510
so it's holding them back in there
because that's extended right now

912
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,520
because that's extended right now
 

913
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,870
because that's extended right now
the other one is on a delay

914
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
the other one is on a delay
 

915
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,070
the other one is on a delay
okay and uh oh nuts they saw me

916
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
okay and uh oh nuts they saw me
 

917
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,149
okay and uh oh nuts they saw me
they can see you through the pistons

918
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
they can see you through the pistons
 

919
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,789
they can see you through the pistons
here i think

920
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799

 

921
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,630

okay well i might mess some of these

922
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
okay well i might mess some of these
 

923
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,070
okay well i might mess some of these
guys up

924
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
guys up
 

925
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,830
guys up
but uh

926
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840

 

927
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,270

yeah i messed them up

928
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280

 

929
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,669

okay well try this again without them

930
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
okay well try this again without them
 

931
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,570
okay well try this again without them
seeing me i guess

932
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:02,580

 

933
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,870

[Music]

934
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
[Music]
 

935
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,430
[Music]
okay we got a bunch there again and i

936
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
okay we got a bunch there again and i
 

937
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,669
okay we got a bunch there again and i
guess we'll try it one last time

938
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
guess we'll try it one last time
 

939
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,990
guess we'll try it one last time
but i don't think it's gonna work it

940
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
but i don't think it's gonna work it
 

941
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,830
but i don't think it's gonna work it
seems like it should like

942
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
seems like it should like
 

943
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,950
seems like it should like
that retracts that one pushes

944
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
that retracts that one pushes
 

945
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,430
that retracts that one pushes
them over one block then that one pushes

946
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
them over one block then that one pushes
 

947
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,149
them over one block then that one pushes
them again

948
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
them again
 

949
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,110
them again
onto the pressure plate and then that

950
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
onto the pressure plate and then that
 

951
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,470
onto the pressure plate and then that
one retracts again

952
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
one retracts again
 

953
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,149
one retracts again
and resets it seems like it's

954
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
and resets it seems like it's
 

955
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,830
and resets it seems like it's
done right but it just they glitch

956
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
done right but it just they glitch
 

957
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,070
done right but it just they glitch
through the pistons

958
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080

 

959
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,510

oh you know why because it's you're

960
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
oh you know why because it's you're
 

961
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,350
oh you know why because it's you're
getting shot from

962
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
getting shot from
 

963
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,750
getting shot from
pressing against each other

964
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760

 

965
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,350

ah it's kind of same issue as having

966
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
ah it's kind of same issue as having
 

967
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,070
ah it's kind of same issue as having
with the silverfish

968
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
with the silverfish
 

969
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,390
with the silverfish
glitching through blocks and stuff

970
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400

 

971
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,789

which is a little discouraging i'm a

972
00:22:58,789 --> 00:22:58,799
which is a little discouraging i'm a
 

973
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,029
which is a little discouraging i'm a
little out of ideas at the moment so

974
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
little out of ideas at the moment so
 

975
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,789
little out of ideas at the moment so
i'll probably have to leave this for

976
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
i'll probably have to leave this for
 

977
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,950
i'll probably have to leave this for
today

978
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
today
 

979
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,990
today
um if i ever did this again i would

980
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
um if i ever did this again i would
 

981
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,070
um if i ever did this again i would
never make a conveyor belt like this as

982
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
never make a conveyor belt like this as
 

983
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,909
never make a conveyor belt like this as
much as i love it like it's really cool

984
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
much as i love it like it's really cool
 

985
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,510
much as i love it like it's really cool
and everything

986
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
and everything
 

987
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,950
and everything
it sounds and looks cool but it's just

988
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
it sounds and looks cool but it's just
 

989
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,230
it sounds and looks cool but it's just
full of problems

990
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240

 

991
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,029

anytime you push a mob with pistons it's

992
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039

 

993
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,310

i don't know you're gonna have problems

994
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
i don't know you're gonna have problems
 

995
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,110
i don't know you're gonna have problems
so i better shut that off before it

996
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
so i better shut that off before it
 

997
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,310
so i better shut that off before it
crashes my game uh i guess

998
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
crashes my game uh i guess
 

999
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,470
crashes my game uh i guess
i gotta go to sleep here so

1000
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
i gotta go to sleep here so
 

1001
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,750
i gotta go to sleep here so
we're gonna end it got a lot done

1002
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
we're gonna end it got a lot done
 

1003
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,750
we're gonna end it got a lot done
but i'll have to think about what to do

1004
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
but i'll have to think about what to do
 

1005
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,830
but i'll have to think about what to do
about that i don't want to tear it out

1006
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
about that i don't want to tear it out
 

1007
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,990
about that i don't want to tear it out
either but

1008
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000

 

1009
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,269

i don't know don't know i'll have to

1010
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:57,279
i don't know don't know i'll have to
 

1011
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,190
i don't know don't know i'll have to
think about it

1012
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
think about it
 

1013
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,310
think about it
but this is really cool and works really

1014
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
but this is really cool and works really
 

1015
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,549
but this is really cool and works really
well too

1016
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559

 

1017
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,070

they're all they're all gonna die from

1018
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
they're all they're all gonna die from
 

1019
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,510
they're all they're all gonna die from
the piston damage

1020
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520

 

1021
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,510

okay well i will

1022
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
okay well i will
 

1023
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,470
okay well i will
talk to you guys later i guess and uh

1024
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
talk to you guys later i guess and uh
 

1025
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,870
talk to you guys later i guess and uh
