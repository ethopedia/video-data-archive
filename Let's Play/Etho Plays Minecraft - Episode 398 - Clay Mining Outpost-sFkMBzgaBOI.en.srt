come here and I mined for a little bit

162
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:07,389
come here and I mined for a little bit
 

163
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,659
come here and I mined for a little bit
my pick breaks or runs low and then I

164
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:09,669
my pick breaks or runs low and then I
 

165
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:12,839
my pick breaks or runs low and then I
got nothing else to or nothing here to

166
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:12,849
got nothing else to or nothing here to
 

167
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,390
got nothing else to or nothing here to
repair it or no other picks nearby so I

168
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,400
repair it or no other picks nearby so I
 

169
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,699
repair it or no other picks nearby so I
have to go all the way back home and

170
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:17,709
have to go all the way back home and
 

171
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,899
have to go all the way back home and
it's sort of annoying and we're gonna

172
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:21,909
it's sort of annoying and we're gonna
 

173
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,529
it's sort of annoying and we're gonna
try to make it look cool to hopefully

174
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:24,539
try to make it look cool to hopefully
 

175
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,839
try to make it look cool to hopefully
put some support beams there I made a

176
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:27,849
put some support beams there I made a
 

177
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,300
put some support beams there I made a
bunch of fences if you put those across

178
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,310
bunch of fences if you put those across
 

179
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,659
bunch of fences if you put those across
I want to put some leaves down here kind

180
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:33,669
I want to put some leaves down here kind
 

181
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:34,740
I want to put some leaves down here kind
of but I don't know if they would make

182
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:34,750
of but I don't know if they would make
 

183
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,520
of but I don't know if they would make
sense here I'm going to put safety rails

184
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:38,530
sense here I'm going to put safety rails
 

185
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,730
sense here I'm going to put safety rails
across here too and then the portal is

186
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:41,740
across here too and then the portal is
 

187
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,100
across here too and then the portal is
going to be down here as well so we can

188
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,110
going to be down here as well so we can
 

189
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,810
going to be down here as well so we can
load up storage minecarts push them

190
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:45,820
load up storage minecarts push them
 

191
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,339
load up storage minecarts push them
through the portal they'll go on the

192
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:47,349
through the portal they'll go on the
 

193
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:50,700
through the portal they'll go on the
track on the other side right to the man

194
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:50,710
track on the other side right to the man
 

195
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,700
track on the other side right to the man
cave basically and we won't really have

196
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:53,710
cave basically and we won't really have
 

197
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,450
cave basically and we won't really have
to do much to make that happen but

198
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:57,460
to do much to make that happen but
 

199
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,679
to do much to make that happen but
anyway I'm going to do

200
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:58,689
anyway I'm going to do
 

201
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,779
anyway I'm going to do
this off-camera and I'll show you the

202
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:00,789
this off-camera and I'll show you the
 

203
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:04,679
this off-camera and I'll show you the
finished product hopefully okay guys so

204
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:04,689
finished product hopefully okay guys so
 

205
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,119
finished product hopefully okay guys so
I just about got this thing done and

206
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:06,129
I just about got this thing done and
 

207
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:08,669
I just about got this thing done and
it's turning out fantastic if I do say

208
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:08,679
it's turning out fantastic if I do say
 

209
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,249
it's turning out fantastic if I do say
so myself very happy with it it's just

210
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:11,259
so myself very happy with it it's just
 

211
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,289
so myself very happy with it it's just
about done I just got to figure out a

212
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:13,299
about done I just got to figure out a
 

213
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:16,709
about done I just got to figure out a
couple more things yet and I thought I'd

214
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:16,719
couple more things yet and I thought I'd
 

215
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,439
couple more things yet and I thought I'd
figure out the unloading system with you

216
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,449
figure out the unloading system with you
 

217
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,589
figure out the unloading system with you
guys so to get the clay out of the

218
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:22,599
guys so to get the clay out of the
 

219
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,209
guys so to get the clay out of the
storage minecart I thought it might just

220
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:24,219
storage minecart I thought it might just
 

221
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,939
storage minecart I thought it might just
be easiest to Ram it into it cactus

222
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:26,949
be easiest to Ram it into it cactus
 

223
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:29,809
be easiest to Ram it into it cactus
we'll see if we can make that happen and

224
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:29,819
we'll see if we can make that happen and
 

225
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,419
we'll see if we can make that happen and
what happens if we do that I'm worried

226
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:33,429
what happens if we do that I'm worried
 

227
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:37,290
what happens if we do that I'm worried
stuff will get destroyed but I'm not

228
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,300
stuff will get destroyed but I'm not
 

229
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,790
stuff will get destroyed but I'm not
sure okay so we're gonna have like a

230
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:41,800
sure okay so we're gonna have like a
 

231
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,339
sure okay so we're gonna have like a
water stream down here you'll see it in

232
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:44,349
water stream down here you'll see it in
 

233
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,540
water stream down here you'll see it in
a second but there's basically going to

234
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,550
a second but there's basically going to
 

235
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,449
a second but there's basically going to
be a water screen below kind of want all

236
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:48,459
be a water screen below kind of want all
 

237
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:53,149
be a water screen below kind of want all
the items to fall in there somehow oops

238
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:53,159
the items to fall in there somehow oops
 

239
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,399
the items to fall in there somehow oops
there goes the cactus so let's see what

240
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:56,409
there goes the cactus so let's see what
 

241
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,139
there goes the cactus so let's see what
happens with the items here I brought a

242
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:58,149
happens with the items here I brought a
 

243
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,299
happens with the items here I brought a
storage minecart we're gonna put on the

244
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:00,309
storage minecart we're gonna put on the
 

245
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,519
storage minecart we're gonna put on the
track Ram it into the cactus hopefully

246
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:02,529
track Ram it into the cactus hopefully
 

247
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,459
track Ram it into the cactus hopefully
it even hits the cactus it might not all

248
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:05,469
it even hits the cactus it might not all
 

249
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,199
it even hits the cactus it might not all
right okay for items that's that's

250
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,209
right okay for items that's that's
 

251
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,679
right okay for items that's that's
probably good for right now

252
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:09,689
probably good for right now
 

253
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:15,299
probably good for right now
BAM all right because there's no way I'd

254
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:15,309
BAM all right because there's no way I'd
 

255
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,549
BAM all right because there's no way I'd
like there's no way to pick up a storage

256
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:17,559
like there's no way to pick up a storage
 

257
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:23,629
like there's no way to pick up a storage
minecart right so I have to destroy it

258
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:23,639
minecart right so I have to destroy it
 

259
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,399
minecart right so I have to destroy it
that didn't work so well they kind of

260
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:26,409
that didn't work so well they kind of
 

261
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:27,629
that didn't work so well they kind of
flew everywhere I don't think anything

262
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:27,639
flew everywhere I don't think anything
 

263
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,719
flew everywhere I don't think anything
got destroyed though let's try this

264
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:30,729
got destroyed though let's try this
 

265
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,179
got destroyed though let's try this
again I blocked all the spots except to

266
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:33,189
again I blocked all the spots except to
 

267
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,249
again I blocked all the spots except to
the left here is the only airspace

268
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:35,259
the left here is the only airspace
 

269
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,259
the left here is the only airspace
so hopefully the items go that way

270
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:37,269
so hopefully the items go that way
 

271
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,029
so hopefully the items go that way
instead of all over the place this time

272
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
instead of all over the place this time
 

273
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,309
instead of all over the place this time
I don't want them to go on this track

274
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:41,319
I don't want them to go on this track
 

275
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:48,689
I don't want them to go on this track
here for sure ah darn it the minecart

here for sure ah darn it the minecart
 

277
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,459
here for sure ah darn it the minecart
landed on the track I think the items

278
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:50,469
landed on the track I think the items
 

279
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:56,879
landed on the track I think the items
got destroyed yeah they did that's not

280
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:56,889
got destroyed yeah they did that's not
 

281
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,770
got destroyed yeah they did that's not
good at all

282
00:06:59,770 --> 00:06:59,780

 

283
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,170

instead
 

289
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,719
instead
this minecart is totally filled up with

290
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:08,729
this minecart is totally filled up with
 

291

295
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,719
here dispenser with arrows in we're
going to have to shoot it twice to break

296
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:17,729
going to have to shoot it twice to break
 

297
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,629
going to have to shoot it twice to break

whoa okay did not expect that is the
 

301
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:32,080
whoa okay did not expect that is the
clay actually here it is oh that's weird

302
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,090

 

303
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,749

okay let me try this again I was not

okay let me try this again I was not
 

305
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,149
okay let me try this again I was not
expecting that I think we'll have to

306
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:38,159
expecting that I think we'll have to
 

307
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:42,980
expecting that I think we'll have to
block up the corners too apparently it

308
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:42,990
block up the corners too apparently it
 

309
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,640
block up the corners too apparently it
can escape that this time I got the

310
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:46,650
can escape that this time I got the
 

311
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,610
can escape that this time I got the
corners totally blocked off let's hope

it twice and bam this game this game is
 

319
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,510
it twice and bam this game this game is
so truly so why is it doing that I

320
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
so truly so why is it doing that I
 

321
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,610
so truly so why is it doing that I
wonder is it because it's in the hopper

322
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:09,620
wonder is it because it's in the hopper
 

323
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,149
wonder is it because it's in the hopper
maybe you know what I'm gonna try I

324
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:13,159
maybe you know what I'm gonna try I
 

325
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,370
maybe you know what I'm gonna try I
think maybe because the hoppers a bit

326
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,380
think maybe because the hoppers a bit
 

327
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,529
think maybe because the hoppers a bit
strange I'm gonna just put a rail on top

328
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:18,539
strange I'm gonna just put a rail on top
 

329
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,560
strange I'm gonna just put a rail on top
of it and see if that does anything cuz

330
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,570
of it and see if that does anything cuz
 

331
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,089
of it and see if that does anything cuz
it shouldn't be able to get out of there

332
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:23,099
it shouldn't be able to get out of there
 

333
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,300
it shouldn't be able to get out of there
like am I crazy

334
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,310
like am I crazy
 

335
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:31,700
like am I crazy
this is totally enclosed oh man rail on

336
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:31,710
this is totally enclosed oh man rail on
 

337
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,760
this is totally enclosed oh man rail on
the hopper now let's see if this works

338
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:33,770
the hopper now let's see if this works
 

339
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,730
the hopper now let's see if this works
Bam Bam stay inside you stupid dang no

340
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:39,740

 

341
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,069

okay alright we're not unloading it this

342
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:43,079
okay alright we're not unloading it this
 

343
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,040
okay alright we're not unloading it this
way I don't like this at all I could

344
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,050
way I don't like this at all I could
 

345
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,600
way I don't like this at all I could
probably make it work if I'd a bit more

346
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:47,610
probably make it work if I'd a bit more
 

347
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,230
probably make it work if I'd a bit more
airspace around it but it's just turning

348
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,240
airspace around it but it's just turning
 

349
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,530
airspace around it but it's just turning
into an issue so what we'll probably do

350
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:54,540
into an issue so what we'll probably do
 

351
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,180
into an issue so what we'll probably do
is just make it sit on a hopper and

352
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,190
is just make it sit on a hopper and
 

353
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,650
is just make it sit on a hopper and
unload that way so this is it guys I

354
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:00,660
unload that way so this is it guys I
 

355
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,010
unload that way so this is it guys I
have finished it I am exhausted I had

simple project until I actually start
 

367
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,110
simple project until I actually start
doing it and then it's like what have I

because I had issues with unloader as

378
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:32,340
because I had issues with unloader as
 

379
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,880

you saw and a few things I built I had
 

381
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,930
you saw and a few things I built I had
to rebuild because they were in the

let's go check it out guys and see the

390
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:47,340
let's go check it out guys and see the
 

391
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,320
let's go check it out guys and see the
clay mining outpost then get set up now

392
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,330
clay mining outpost then get set up now
 

393
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:56,000
clay mining outpost then get set up now
alright so right off the bat this portal

394
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,010
alright so right off the bat this portal
 

395
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,100
alright so right off the bat this portal
is a huge improvement because we were

396
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,110
is a huge improvement because we were
 

397
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,560
is a huge improvement because we were
spotting above-ground before and I have

398
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:00,570
spotting above-ground before and I have
 

399
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,270
spotting above-ground before and I have
to like find the beach in go down the

400
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,280
to like find the beach in go down the
 

401
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,480
to like find the beach in go down the
hole to get where we need it to be now

402
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,490
hole to get where we need it to be now
 

403
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,700
hole to get where we need it to be now
it's all very convenient we're here

404
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:07,710
it's all very convenient we're here
 

405
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,090
it's all very convenient we're here
already got lots of tracks going on here

406
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,100
already got lots of tracks going on here
 

407
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,690
already got lots of tracks going on here
and yeah this is the basic look of it

408
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:14,700
and yeah this is the basic look of it
 

409
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,970
and yeah this is the basic look of it
it's nothing fancy but I think it looks

410
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:16,980
it's nothing fancy but I think it looks
 

411
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,710
it's nothing fancy but I think it looks
cool oh I forgot to close this wait a

412
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:21,720
cool oh I forgot to close this wait a
 

413
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,640
cool oh I forgot to close this wait a
second let's get the proper look before

414
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:25,650
second let's get the proper look before
 

415
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,630
second let's get the proper look before
we continue the door there we go oh so

416
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:29,640
we continue the door there we go oh so
 

417
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,350
we continue the door there we go oh so
much better million times better already

418
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
much better million times better already
 

419
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,630
much better million times better already
so probably the best way to demonstrates

420
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:35,640
so probably the best way to demonstrates
 

421
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,550
so probably the best way to demonstrates
or to tell you how this all works is

422
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:37,560
or to tell you how this all works is
 

423
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,610
or to tell you how this all works is
just go do it right so let's go get this

424
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:40,620
just go do it right so let's go get this
 

425
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,000
just go do it right so let's go get this
on get the show on the road we have two

426
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,010
on get the show on the road we have two
 

427
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,710
on get the show on the road we have two
dispensers here one is for storage

428
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:45,720
dispensers here one is for storage
 

429
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,080
dispensers here one is for storage
minecarts one for regular ones what you

430
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,090
minecarts one for regular ones what you
 

431
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,210
minecarts one for regular ones what you
would do is hit that for a storage one

432
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,220
would do is hit that for a storage one
 

433
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,760
would do is hit that for a storage one
could it send out as many as you want

434
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:52,770
could it send out as many as you want
 

435
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,850
could it send out as many as you want
there's like lots of space here for

436
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:55,860
there's like lots of space here for
 

437
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,840
there's like lots of space here for
buffer um then when we send out as many

438
00:10:59,840 --> 00:10:59,850
buffer um then when we send out as many
 

439
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,519
buffer um then when we send out as many
storage mine cards as we want we go

440
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:02,529
storage mine cards as we want we go
 

441
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,449
storage mine cards as we want we go
our own empty one here and we can keep

442
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:06,459
our own empty one here and we can keep
 

443
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,489
our own empty one here and we can keep
extending this tract as far as we want

444
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:08,499
extending this tract as far as we want
 

445
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,710
extending this tract as far as we want
like if we mine up all the clay in one

446
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
like if we mine up all the clay in one
 

447
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,239
like if we mine up all the clay in one
area we can just keep going further and

448
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:12,249
area we can just keep going further and
 

449
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:15,420
area we can just keep going further and
further no problem all that stuff there

450
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:15,430
further no problem all that stuff there
 

451
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,989
further no problem all that stuff there
works the same and it doesn't get

452
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:18,999
works the same and it doesn't get
 

453
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:22,470
works the same and it doesn't get
affected by us moving right so what we

454
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
affected by us moving right so what we
 

455
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,590
affected by us moving right so what we
would do is let's just line up some clay

456
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
would do is let's just line up some clay
 

457
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,309
would do is let's just line up some clay
I guess show you how this works which I

458
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:29,319
I guess show you how this works which I
 

459
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,600
I guess show you how this works which I
did a few different colors here too

460
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,610
did a few different colors here too
 

461
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,660
did a few different colors here too
because we have items' sorters look and

462
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:33,670
because we have items' sorters look and
 

463
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,119
because we have items' sorters look and
make sure I don't break the track we got

464
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:36,129
make sure I don't break the track we got
 

465
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:39,299
make sure I don't break the track we got
items sort sorters that sort the colors

466
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:39,309
items sort sorters that sort the colors
 

467
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:41,420
items sort sorters that sort the colors
which is really nice and convenient too

468
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:41,430
which is really nice and convenient too
 

469
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,530
which is really nice and convenient too
otherwise I think I still have some here

470
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,540
otherwise I think I still have some here
 

471
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,239
otherwise I think I still have some here
this was my old set up by those two

472
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:48,249
this was my old set up by those two
 

473
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,769
this was my old set up by those two
double chests

474
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:49,779
double chests
 

475
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,989
double chests

we're ready to go back we just push it
on the track and grab our own empty one

502
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,160
on the track and grab our own empty one
 

503
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,710
on the track and grab our own empty one
and we go back to

504

let me and hop out here there's a cart
 

511
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,759
let me and hop out here there's a cart
pickup station so there's a switch on

512
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:48,769
pickup station so there's a switch on
 

513
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,489
pickup station so there's a switch on
the track here when it comes back hits

514
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:51,499
the track here when it comes back hits
 

515
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,730
the track here when it comes back hits
this detector rail it goes this way

516
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:53,740
this detector rail it goes this way
 

517
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,470
this detector rail it goes this way
right now this storage minecart is

518
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
right now this storage minecart is
 

519
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,610
right now this storage minecart is
unloading up here and it might take a

520
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:00,620
unloading up here and it might take a
 

521
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,009
unloading up here and it might take a
little while let's just go see where the

522
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:03,019
little while let's just go see where the
 

523
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,350
little while let's just go see where the
items are going first I guess so we've

524
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
items are going first I guess so we've
 

525
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,799
items are going first I guess so we've
got the item filters here lights light

526
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:08,809
got the item filters here lights light
 

527
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,150
got the item filters here lights light
colored clay or white clay yeah white

528
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
colored clay or white clay yeah white
 

529
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,009
colored clay or white clay yeah white
then we got the light grey brown yellow

530
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:18,019
then we got the light grey brown yellow
 

531
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,689
then we got the light grey brown yellow
orange red and then finally we have the

532
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:22,699
orange red and then finally we have the
 

533
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,299
orange red and then finally we have the
hardened clay this one's not actually

534
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:25,309
hardened clay this one's not actually
 

535
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:29,799
hardened clay this one's not actually
being sorted because it's last one so

536
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:29,809
being sorted because it's last one so
 

537
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,809
being sorted because it's last one so
there's seven natural colors in the Mesa

538
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:33,819
there's seven natural colors in the Mesa
 

539
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,980
there's seven natural colors in the Mesa
like you don't get light blue here or

540
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:35,990
like you don't get light blue here or
 

541
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,129
like you don't get light blue here or
anything like that obviously okay so I

542
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:39,139
anything like that obviously okay so I
 

543
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:42,879
anything like that obviously okay so I
decide to do the minecart unloading like

544
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:42,889
decide to do the minecart unloading like
 

545
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,759
decide to do the minecart unloading like
I usually do just on a hopper goes into

546
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:45,769
I usually do just on a hopper goes into
 

547
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:50,049
I usually do just on a hopper goes into
a dropper here if there's items in this

548
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:50,059
a dropper here if there's items in this
 

549
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,259
a dropper here if there's items in this
it activates this clock and sends it a

550
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:53,269
it activates this clock and sends it a
 

551
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,790
it activates this clock and sends it a
pulse every time and this minecart stays

552
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:57,800
pulse every time and this minecart stays
 

553
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,679
pulse every time and this minecart stays
here until this wire turns on there's

554
00:13:59,679 --> 00:13:59,689
here until this wire turns on there's
 

555
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:02,650
here until this wire turns on there's
like a comparator that checks if items

556
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:02,660
like a comparator that checks if items
 

557
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,249
like a comparator that checks if items
are going through this hopper once it's

558
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:06,259
are going through this hopper once it's
 

559
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,829
are going through this hopper once it's
empty that turns on goes down the track

560
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:08,839
empty that turns on goes down the track
 

561
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,400
empty that turns on goes down the track
as well and I ended up using a cactus to

562
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,410
as well and I ended up using a cactus to
 

563
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,290
as well and I ended up using a cactus to
break it here because I got a break it's

564
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:14,300
break it here because I got a break it's
 

565
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,829
break it here because I got a break it's
somehow right you can't pick up storage

566
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
somehow right you can't pick up storage
 

567
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,590
somehow right you can't pick up storage
minecarts in any way regular mine carts

568
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:20,600
minecarts in any way regular mine carts
 

569
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,660
minecarts in any way regular mine carts
you can you can break them and and put

570
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,670
you can you can break them and and put
 

571
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,129
you can you can break them and and put
them into storage but you got to

572
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:24,139
them into storage but you got to
 

573
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,249
them into storage but you got to
recombine the chest and the minecart

574
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:26,259
recombine the chest and the minecart
 

575
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,720
recombine the chest and the minecart
unless I'm overlooking something and

576
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:28,730
unless I'm overlooking something and
 

577
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,579
unless I'm overlooking something and
forgot that they added a feature or

something happens to me sometimes but

580
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,470
something happens to me sometimes but
 

581
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,900
something happens to me sometimes but
I'm pretty sure you can't pick up

582
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:34,910
I'm pretty sure you can't pick up
 

583
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,019
I'm pretty sure you can't pick up
storage my cards so I just decide to

584
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:37,029
storage my cards so I just decide to
 

585
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,210
storage my cards so I just decide to
send them to this chest here we got

586
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,220
send them to this chest here we got
 

587
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,379
send them to this chest here we got
extra tracks if we ever need to extend

588
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:43,389
extra tracks if we ever need to extend
 

589
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,879
extra tracks if we ever need to extend
how far we're mining like if we mine out

590
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:45,889
how far we're mining like if we mine out
 

591
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:51,049
how far we're mining like if we mine out
an area we can just go further all right

592
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:51,059
an area we can just go further all right
 

593
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,499
an area we can just go further all right
cool so yeah then I got everything

594
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:54,509
cool so yeah then I got everything
 

595
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,859
cool so yeah then I got everything
color-coded here ends up in these chests

596
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:57,869
color-coded here ends up in these chests
 

597
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:01,279
color-coded here ends up in these chests
each color has three double chests of

598
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,289
each color has three double chests of
 

599
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:03,649
each color has three double chests of
storage so that is quite a bit way

600
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:03,659
storage so that is quite a bit way
 

601
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,229
storage so that is quite a bit way
better than just a couple random chests

602
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:06,239
better than just a couple random chests
 

603
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,619
better than just a couple random chests
place down like I had there a long time

604
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:09,629
place down like I had there a long time
 

605
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,799
place down like I had there a long time
before I fill these up I think and then

606
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:12,809
before I fill these up I think and then
 

607
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,169
before I fill these up I think and then
the over here is for the regular

608
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:15,179
the over here is for the regular
 

609
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,619
the over here is for the regular
hardened clay I have nine double chests

610
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:18,629
hardened clay I have nine double chests
 

611
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:19,999
hardened clay I have nine double chests
for that because I think that's the most

612
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:20,009
for that because I think that's the most
 

613
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:22,159

here even how does it work well we kind

634
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:56,339
here even how does it work well we kind
 

635
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,159
here even how does it work well we kind
of saw it earlier you can do a trick

636
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:58,169
of saw it earlier you can do a trick
 

637
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:01,579
of saw it earlier you can do a trick
where it falls between a diagonal with

638
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:01,589
where it falls between a diagonal with
 

639
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,359
where it falls between a diagonal with
minecarts I'm sure most of you know it

640
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:04,369
minecarts I'm sure most of you know it
 

641
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:07,039
minecarts I'm sure most of you know it
so yeah dispensers up here it shoots

642
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:07,049
so yeah dispensers up here it shoots
 

643
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,639
so yeah dispensers up here it shoots
minecart up here goes down through the

644
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:10,649
minecart up here goes down through the
 

645
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:16,459
minecart up here goes down through the
crack and can I break this I going to

646
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:16,469
crack and can I break this I going to
 

647
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:19,129
crack and can I break this I going to
wreck anything I can do that yeah so it

648
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:19,139
wreck anything I can do that yeah so it
 

649
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,429
wreck anything I can do that yeah so it
just falls in between the log and this

650
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:22,439
just falls in between the log and this
 

651
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,719
just falls in between the log and this
piece of clay diagonally very cool got

652
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:26,729
piece of clay diagonally very cool got
 

653
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:29,629
piece of clay diagonally very cool got
empty carts grab whatever colors we want

654
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:29,639
empty carts grab whatever colors we want
 

655
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,469
empty carts grab whatever colors we want
from here load up our carts as many as

656
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:33,479
from here load up our carts as many as
 

657
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:36,409
from here load up our carts as many as
we need to and just push it through the

658
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:36,419
we need to and just push it through the
 

659
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,679
we need to and just push it through the
portal and you saw when we entered here

660
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:39,689
portal and you saw when we entered here
 

661
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,169
portal and you saw when we entered here
we had the slanted track so it

662
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:41,179
we had the slanted track so it
 

663
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,959
we had the slanted track so it
automatically goes onto the track and

664
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:43,969
automatically goes onto the track and
 

665
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:48,499
automatically goes onto the track and
over to our nether hub so very cool I'm

666
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:48,509
over to our nether hub so very cool I'm
 

667
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,859
over to our nether hub so very cool I'm
very happy with this I do kind of want

668
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:51,869
very happy with this I do kind of want
 

669
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:54,529
very happy with this I do kind of want
to set up three of these outposts is the

670
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:54,539
to set up three of these outposts is the
 

671
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,649
to set up three of these outposts is the
thing so this was like the trial one I

672
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:57,659
thing so this was like the trial one I
 

673
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,699
thing so this was like the trial one I
want one for my sand and sandstone

674
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:01,709
want one for my sand and sandstone
 

675
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:04,039
want one for my sand and sandstone
collection in the desert and I also want

676
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,049
collection in the desert and I also want
 

677
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:04,569
collection in the desert and I also want
one for

678

one for
 

679
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,000
one for
or just my general mining I do like for

680
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,010
or just my general mining I do like for
 

681
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,409
or just my general mining I do like for
redstone in that this was a lot of work

682
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:11,419
redstone in that this was a lot of work
 

683
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:15,189
redstone in that this was a lot of work
though so I don't know if I'm going to

684
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
though so I don't know if I'm going to
 

685
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,210
though so I don't know if I'm going to

too just for for the funds of it
 

689
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,009
too just for for the funds of it
sometimes I'm I'm collecting blocks I

690
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:27,019
sometimes I'm I'm collecting blocks I
 

691
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:30,490
sometimes I'm I'm collecting blocks I
like to listen to music or whatever but

692
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:30,500
like to listen to music or whatever but
 

693
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,490
like to listen to music or whatever but
anyways guys we are over here now at the

694
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:33,500
anyways guys we are over here now at the
 

695
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,060
anyways guys we are over here now at the
arena believe it or not this is what I

696
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,070
arena believe it or not this is what I
 

697
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,180
arena believe it or not this is what I
was working on today it's like it oh you

698
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,190
was working on today it's like it oh you
 

699
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,310
was working on today it's like it oh you
know what I want to try some clay blocks

700
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
know what I want to try some clay blocks
 

701
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,500
know what I want to try some clay blocks
for the floor when I go check my storage

702
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,510
for the floor when I go check my storage
 

703
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,940
for the floor when I go check my storage
and we got none and then well one thing

704
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:48,950
and we got none and then well one thing
 

705
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,620
and we got none and then well one thing
led to another and we we built the clay

706
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:50,630
led to another and we we built the clay
 

707
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,139
led to another and we we built the clay
mining outpost today instead so I

708
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:53,149
mining outpost today instead so I
 

709
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:55,000
mining outpost today instead so I
figured we probably want a light block

710
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,010
figured we probably want a light block
 

711
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,320
figured we probably want a light block
for the floor here I'm going to try the

712
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,330
for the floor here I'm going to try the
 

713
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,310
for the floor here I'm going to try the
white clay and the light gray goes

714
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
white clay and the light gray goes
 

715
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,139
white clay and the light gray goes
pretty good with this and also the brown

716
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:02,149
pretty good with this and also the brown
 

717
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:05,889
pretty good with this and also the brown
goes really good with that I find and we

718
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:05,899
goes really good with that I find and we
 

719
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:09,190
goes really good with that I find and we
got lots of them so might try those out

720
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200
got lots of them so might try those out
 

721
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,320
got lots of them so might try those out
and see if we can make it a pattern or

722
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,330
and see if we can make it a pattern or
 

723
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,149
and see if we can make it a pattern or
something I think it's going to be very

724
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:13,159
something I think it's going to be very
 

725
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,659
something I think it's going to be very
plain if we just do solid white I don't

726
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:16,669
plain if we just do solid white I don't
 

727
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,220
plain if we just do solid white I don't
want to build anything out of wood or

728
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,230
want to build anything out of wood or
 

729
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,169
want to build anything out of wood or
dirt or anything like that because the

730
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:20,179
dirt or anything like that because the
 

731
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,470
dirt or anything like that because the
stuff is going to get blown up regularly

732
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
stuff is going to get blown up regularly
 

733
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,769
stuff is going to get blown up regularly
from the creepers here and minimize the

734
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:26,779
from the creepers here and minimize the
 

735
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:32,440
from the creepers here and minimize the
damage if possible okay guys so this is

736
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:32,450
damage if possible okay guys so this is
 

737
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,149
damage if possible okay guys so this is
where you come in I really need your

738
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:34,159
where you come in I really need your
 

739
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,169
where you come in I really need your
help picking colors and stuff so it's

740
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:38,179
help picking colors and stuff so it's
 

741
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,539
help picking colors and stuff so it's
been trying different blocks for the

742
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:40,549
been trying different blocks for the
 

743
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,909
been trying different blocks for the
walls I do like the floor I think

744
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:42,919
walls I do like the floor I think
 

745
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,009
walls I do like the floor I think
White's white clay makes a really good

746
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:45,019
White's white clay makes a really good
 

747
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:48,700
White's white clay makes a really good
floor I'm not a huge fan of the pinkish

748
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:48,710
floor I'm not a huge fan of the pinkish
 

749
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,480
floor I'm not a huge fan of the pinkish
tint to it but I think it's okay still

750
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:51,490
tint to it but I think it's okay still
 

751
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,139
tint to it but I think it's okay still
so I've got a nice bright floor put the

752
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:56,149
so I've got a nice bright floor put the
 

753
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:58,899
so I've got a nice bright floor put the
light gray trim around it I think that's

754
00:18:58,899 --> 00:18:58,909
light gray trim around it I think that's
 

755
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:00,879
light gray trim around it I think that's
good I might put a pattern in the floor

756
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:00,889
good I might put a pattern in the floor
 

757
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,070
good I might put a pattern in the floor
though I don't know is it too plain as

758
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,080
though I don't know is it too plain as
 

759
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,769
though I don't know is it too plain as
it is if we put a pattern in the floor

760
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:05,779
it is if we put a pattern in the floor
 

761
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,210
it is if we put a pattern in the floor
it's got to be something easy to copy

762
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:07,220
it's got to be something easy to copy
 

763
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,889
it's got to be something easy to copy
because if it gets blown up I got to

764
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:08,899
because if it gets blown up I got to
 

765
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:14,200
because if it gets blown up I got to
replace it rights might also go with

766
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,210
replace it rights might also go with
 

767
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,539
replace it rights might also go with
sandstone but it's a little bit weaker

768
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:16,549
sandstone but it's a little bit weaker
 

769
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,100
sandstone but it's a little bit weaker
than hardened clay

770
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,110
than hardened clay
 

771
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,610
than hardened clay
um I think this is good anyway

772
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:21,620
um I think this is good anyway
 

773
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,350
um I think this is good anyway
we got these different wall colors I'm

774
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
we got these different wall colors I'm
 

775
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,660
we got these different wall colors I'm
trying to decide what blocks to use I do

776
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:25,670
trying to decide what blocks to use I do
 

777
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,669
trying to decide what blocks to use I do
think Brown goes pretty good with it but

778
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
think Brown goes pretty good with it but
 

779
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,900
think Brown goes pretty good with it but
I don't know if I'd want it for a wall

780
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:28,910
I don't know if I'd want it for a wall
 

781
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,840
I don't know if I'd want it for a wall
it's kind of dark and good make a good

782
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:31,850
it's kind of dark and good make a good
 

783
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:38,470
it's kind of dark and good make a good
ceiling we got red got stone brick heart

784
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
ceiling we got red got stone brick heart
 

785
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,450

and clay just the regular stuff here

786
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:40,460
and clay just the regular stuff here
 

787
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,490
and clay just the regular stuff here
let's try a couple other colors let me

788
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:42,500
let's try a couple other colors let me
 

789
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,520
let's try a couple other colors let me
know which one you think is best or what

the green I don't really think it goes
well with these blocks and then I did

828
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:46,850
well with these blocks and then I did
 

829
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,600
well with these blocks and then I did
cyan here which I think does go with

this was my favorite actually I'm
 

843
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,870
this was my favorite actually I'm
surprised because I thought the dark was

844
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:07,880
surprised because I thought the dark was
 

845
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,159
surprised because I thought the dark was
going to be bad but as I think about it

846
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:11,169
going to be bad but as I think about it
 

847
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,340
going to be bad but as I think about it
um our focus is going to be on the

848
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:15,350
um our focus is going to be on the
 

849
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,799
um our focus is going to be on the
combat right so we almost want the whole

850
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:17,809
combat right so we almost want the whole
 

851
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,770
combat right so we almost want the whole
arena around us to be dark and like this

852
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:20,780
arena around us to be dark and like this
 

853
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,020
arena around us to be dark and like this
is the highlight here we want this as

854
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,030
is the highlight here we want this as
 

855
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,060
is the highlight here we want this as
bright as possible so the white is

856
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,070
bright as possible so the white is
 

857
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,120
bright as possible so the white is
really good for that and then our eyes

858
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,130
really good for that and then our eyes
 

859
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,880
really good for that and then our eyes
won't really focus on the outside

860
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:30,890
won't really focus on the outside
 

861
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,130

one of the main reasons it exists even
 

895
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,000
one of the main reasons it exists even
is because on the old world I spent so

896
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,010
is because on the old world I spent so
 

897
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,660

what I would do I'd wait for night time
 

903
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,210
what I would do I'd wait for night time

had to wait till nighttime stir so that

916
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,240
had to wait till nighttime stir so that
 

917
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,730
had to wait till nighttime stir so that
when I would start recording and be a

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:42,740
when I would start recording and be a
 

919
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,300
when I would start recording and be a
brand-new day and I'd have a full 10

brand-new day and I'd have a full 10
 

921

minutes or whatever right so I made the
 

923
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,890
minutes or whatever right so I made the
man cave one of the big reasons was

924
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:50,900
man cave one of the big reasons was
 

925
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,530
man cave one of the big reasons was
because day and night just doesn't

926
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:53,540
because day and night just doesn't
 

927

because day and night just doesn't
matter in here most the time I don't
