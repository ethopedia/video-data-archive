for sure when we can this wood will
 

283
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,930
for sure when we can this wood will
become dark wood so we'll just put down

284
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:09,940
become dark wood so we'll just put down
 

285

comes out so let's
 

295
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,570
comes out so let's
probably what we'll use for the crazy

296
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:30,580
probably what we'll use for the crazy
 

297
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,550
probably what we'll use for the crazy
way are those in the game already I'm so

they're not okay I think we will have
the stairs as well so if we got to do

304
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:42,589
the stairs as well so if we got to do
 

305
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:44,680
the stairs as well so if we got to do
crazy stair stuff that this is probably

306
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:44,690
crazy stair stuff that this is probably
 

307
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,960
crazy stair stuff that this is probably
what we'll use maybe even the light as

308
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:48,970
what we'll use maybe even the light as
 

309
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:55,960
what we'll use maybe even the light as
well what else did I want to try these

310
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:55,970
well what else did I want to try these
 

311
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,840
well what else did I want to try these
we might use this stuff mixed with snow

312
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:00,850
we might use this stuff mixed with snow
 

313
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,980
we might use this stuff mixed with snow
they look pretty good together

314
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:02,990
they look pretty good together
 

315
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,870
they look pretty good together
I don't know how we would use it exactly

316
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
I don't know how we would use it exactly
 

317
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,310
I don't know how we would use it exactly
this would be easier to use yeah we do

318
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,320
this would be easier to use yeah we do
 

319
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,530
this would be easier to use yeah we do
that we'd probably still use regular

320
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:11,540
that we'd probably still use regular
 

321
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,570
that we'd probably still use regular
fences over here's a rail so let's just

322
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:16,580
fences over here's a rail so let's just
 

323
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:29,880
fences over here's a rail so let's just
see how that would look passable okay

324
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:29,890
see how that would look passable okay
 

325
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,840
see how that would look passable okay
fence is there then I probably want to

326
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:34,850

with light blue is a common suggestion

368
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,360
with light blue is a common suggestion
 

369
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,480
with light blue is a common suggestion
with working with snow because they go

370
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,490
with working with snow because they go
 

371
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,640
with working with snow because they go
together really well if we do the winter

372
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:54,650
together really well if we do the winter
 

373
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,850
together really well if we do the winter
theme we cannot use sandstone at all

374
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:57,860
theme we cannot use sandstone at all
 

375
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,220
theme we cannot use sandstone at all
that's something we've learnt in the

376
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,230
that's something we've learnt in the
 

377
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,160
that's something we've learnt in the
past from my old ice base can't use it

378
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,170
past from my old ice base can't use it
 

379
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,560
past from my old ice base can't use it
not allowed if we go with the winter

380
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:05,570
not allowed if we go with the winter
 

381
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:15,300
not allowed if we go with the winter
theme black black would kind of work

382
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,310
theme black black would kind of work
 

383
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,580
theme black black would kind of work
anyway we would have to experiment and

384
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,590
anyway we would have to experiment and
 

385
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,940
anyway we would have to experiment and
pick different bright wool colors to

386
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:21,950
pick different bright wool colors to
 

387
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,340
pick different bright wool colors to
highlight things I guess I want this

388
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,350
highlight things I guess I want this
 

389
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,960
highlight things I guess I want this
stuff back let's head back up though

390
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:30,970

 

391
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,290

I hope we have mmm I hope I'm just

392
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:35,300
I hope we have mmm I hope I'm just
 

393
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,400
I hope we have mmm I hope I'm just
thinking I hope I don't waste too much

394
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,410
thinking I hope I don't waste too much
 

395
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,290
thinking I hope I don't waste too much
time with this because I wanted to do a

396
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:38,300
time with this because I wanted to do a
 

397
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,990
time with this because I wanted to do a
few other things today even though it is

398
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,000
few other things today even though it is
 

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,590
few other things today even though it is
getting a little late here right so we

400
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:44,600
getting a little late here right so we
 

401
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,630
getting a little late here right so we
would probably have a highlight there we

402
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:46,640
would probably have a highlight there we
 

403
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,460
would probably have a highlight there we
might have one on this side as well and

404
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:48,470
might have one on this side as well and
 

405
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,050
might have one on this side as well and
then in the middle that I think ice

406
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,060
then in the middle that I think ice
 

407
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,430
then in the middle that I think ice
could go with ice that way we can hop

408
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:54,440
could go with ice that way we can hop
 

409
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,070
could go with ice that way we can hop
around here real quick that would be

410
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,080
around here real quick that would be
 

411
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,290
around here real quick that would be
kind of cool um and same with at the

412
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,300
kind of cool um and same with at the
 

413
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,120
kind of cool um and same with at the
main floor level here I would want ice

414
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,130
main floor level here I would want ice
 

415
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,030
main floor level here I would want ice
going around so I can I can speed jump

416
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
going around so I can I can speed jump
 

417
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,430
going around so I can I can speed jump
all around if we go with the winter

418
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
all around if we go with the winter
 

419
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,220
all around if we go with the winter
theme so imagine it make it happen in

420
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,230
theme so imagine it make it happen in
 

421
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,600
theme so imagine it make it happen in
your head okay could also go with the

422
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:19,610
your head okay could also go with the
 

423
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,760
your head okay could also go with the
regular wood theme that I usually do

424
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:21,770
regular wood theme that I usually do
 

425
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,210
regular wood theme that I usually do
which we don't sort of already saw if we

426
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:25,220
which we don't sort of already saw if we
 

427
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,460
which we don't sort of already saw if we
do that I would want to probably use

428
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,470
do that I would want to probably use
 

429
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,660
do that I would want to probably use
this kind of wood although we could do

430
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:34,670
this kind of wood although we could do
 

431
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,780
this kind of wood although we could do
the dark wood as well and these would

432
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:40,790
the dark wood as well and these would
 

433
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,300
the dark wood as well and these would
get switched with either wooden planks

434
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,310
get switched with either wooden planks
 

435
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,559
get switched with either wooden planks
some color or sandstone I'm not going to

436
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:51,569
some color or sandstone I'm not going to
 

437
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:53,110
some color or sandstone I'm not going to
tear them down though just to show that

438
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
tear them down though just to show that
 

439
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,710
tear them down though just to show that
we would do fences around here we would

440
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:57,720
we would do fences around here we would
 

441
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,160
we would do fences around here we would
also try to mimic the old storage room

442
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,170
also try to mimic the old storage room
 

443
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,050
also try to mimic the old storage room
if we went with this theme so maybe a

444
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,060
if we went with this theme so maybe a
 

445
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,710
if we went with this theme so maybe a
checkered floor water features in the

446
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
checkered floor water features in the
 

447
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,529
checkered floor water features in the
corners or something just for decoration

448
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:09,539
corners or something just for decoration
 

449
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:15,169
corners or something just for decoration
like we did before then this ground

450
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:15,179
like we did before then this ground
 

451
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:21,319
like we did before then this ground
would be grass most likely or else would

452
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,329
would be grass most likely or else would
 

453
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:28,720
would be grass most likely or else would
grass or wood I know I brought something

454
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:28,730

 

455
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,740

again I don't want to spend a whole lot

456
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:30,750
again I don't want to spend a whole lot
 

457
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,770
again I don't want to spend a whole lot
of time with this we would probably

458
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:33,780
of time with this we would probably
 

459
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,570
of time with this we would probably
still do a highlight here may it may be

460
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:35,580
still do a highlight here may it may be
 

461
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,659
still do a highlight here may it may be
out of wood or something to transition

462
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:38,669
out of wood or something to transition
 

463
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,070
out of wood or something to transition
from the sandstone if we go with

464
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
from the sandstone if we go with
 

465
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,840
from the sandstone if we go with
sandstone yeah you get the idea or we

466
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:47,850
sandstone yeah you get the idea or we
 

467
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,010
sandstone yeah you get the idea or we
could go with an industrial theme if we

468
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,020
could go with an industrial theme if we
 

469
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,919
could go with an industrial theme if we
go with the industrial theme maybe real

470
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:57,929
go with the industrial theme maybe real
 

471
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:59,590
go with the industrial theme maybe real
quick

472
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
quick
 

473
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,570
quick
instead of having wood around here this

474
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:05,580
instead of having wood around here this
 

475
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,840
instead of having wood around here this
would be like maybe stone bricks or

476
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:08,850
would be like maybe stone bricks or
 

477
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:18,909
would be like maybe stone bricks or
stone this stuff would be iron fences I

478
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:18,919
stone this stuff would be iron fences I
 

479
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,690
stone this stuff would be iron fences I
don't know what I would do for the

480
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:20,700
don't know what I would do for the
 

481
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,889
don't know what I would do for the
ground probably just a different type of

482
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:24,899
ground probably just a different type of
 

483
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,720
ground probably just a different type of
stone from whatever I use for the border

484
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:26,730
stone from whatever I use for the border
 

485
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,240
stone from whatever I use for the border
and whatever I use for the border I will

486
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,250
and whatever I use for the border I will
 

487
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,169
and whatever I use for the border I will

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,250
dispensers all along if you want one
 

549
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,080

the block type that was in the dispenser
 

555
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:46,159
the block type that was in the dispenser
so something like that you know for all

556
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:46,169
so something like that you know for all
 

557
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:47,870
so something like that you know for all
all the different types of blocks if

558
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:47,880
all the different types of blocks if
 

559
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,539
all the different types of blocks if
it's if it was an item that can be

560
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:50,549
it's if it was an item that can be
 

561
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,400
it's if it was an item that can be
represented with a block you I had a

562
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,410
represented with a block you I had a
 

563
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,570
represented with a block you I had a
sign above that said what it was and

564
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:55,580
sign above that said what it was and
 

565
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,540
sign above that said what it was and
then above that I also had displayed to

566
00:20:59,540 --> 00:20:59,550
then above that I also had displayed to
 

567
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,120
then above that I also had displayed to
try to get as close as I could to what

568
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,130
try to get as close as I could to what
 

569
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,210

was in it

570
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:03,220
was in it
 

571
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,180
was in it
if it wasn't a full block so I would

572
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,190
if it wasn't a full block so I would
 

573
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,740
if it wasn't a full block so I would
like to do that again with this storage

574
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:07,750
like to do that again with this storage
 

575
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,070
like to do that again with this storage
room I really like that the problem I'm

576
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,080
room I really like that the problem I'm
 

577

having now is how do I do the extra
 

579
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,840

580
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:18,850
storage the reason why I'm so happy
 

581
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,570

about this still is you can actually

582
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:21,580
about this still is you can actually
 

583
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,850
about this still is you can actually
shift click into dispensers now before

584
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:23,860
shift click into dispensers now before
 

585
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,610
shift click into dispensers now before
you couldn't and that always drove me

586
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:26,620
you couldn't and that always drove me
 

587
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,190
you couldn't and that always drove me
crazy so this is this is still a good

588
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
crazy so this is this is still a good
 

589
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,490
crazy so this is this is still a good
thing I think and I love having a block

590
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:32,500
thing I think and I love having a block
 

591
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,700
thing I think and I love having a block
display for for what's in the storage

592
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:35,710
display for for what's in the storage
 

593
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,670
display for for what's in the storage
unit so I'll do that again but yeah the

594
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:41,680
unit so I'll do that again but yeah the
 

595
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,260
unit so I'll do that again but yeah the
way I did before is I had a checker

596
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,270
way I did before is I had a checker
 

597
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,340
way I did before is I had a checker
pattern of chess don't think that's

598
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,350
pattern of chess don't think that's
 

599
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,660
pattern of chess don't think that's
going to work anymore because they

600
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:48,670
going to work anymore because they
 

601
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,030
going to work anymore because they
changed the chest block it's not a full

602
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,040
changed the chest block it's not a full
 

603
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,070
changed the chest block it's not a full
block anymore it gets sunk in like that

604
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,080
block anymore it gets sunk in like that
 

605
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:06,570
block anymore it gets sunk in like that
sadly that's the way I did before what

606
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:06,580
sadly that's the way I did before what
 

607
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:18,260
sadly that's the way I did before what
should we do now let's see I don't know

608
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,270

 

609
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,310

well how high can we reach and reach

610
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,320
well how high can we reach and reach
 

611
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,880
well how high can we reach and reach
that one I think we could reach one more

612
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:26,890
that one I think we could reach one more
 

613
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:33,770
that one I think we could reach one more
up yet that's what it looks like yeah

614
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:33,780
up yet that's what it looks like yeah
 

615
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,310
up yet that's what it looks like yeah
that's a stretch though so three blocks

616
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
that's a stretch though so three blocks
 

617
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,180
that's a stretch though so three blocks
above our display block we can reach if

618
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,190
above our display block we can reach if
 

619
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:49,050
above our display block we can reach if
we need to mmm I don't want to use

620
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,060
we need to mmm I don't want to use
 

621
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,970
we need to mmm I don't want to use
storage minecarts I don't trust them

622
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:50,980
storage minecarts I don't trust them
 

623
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:57,480
storage minecarts I don't trust them
sometimes your stuff just disappears all

624
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:57,490
sometimes your stuff just disappears all
 

625
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:03,830
sometimes your stuff just disappears all
right what we could try to do is maybe

626
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840

 

627
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,350

now we can actually staff chess either

628
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
now we can actually staff chess either
 

629
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,170
now we can actually staff chess either
have double chests above this is just

630
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:13,180
have double chests above this is just
 

631
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,600
have double chests above this is just
first like additional storage beyond the

632
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:15,610
first like additional storage beyond the
 

633
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,980
first like additional storage beyond the
dispenser because these don't

634
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:16,990
dispenser because these don't
 

635
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:22,350
dispenser because these don't
a whole lot if we do that thing is then

636
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,360
a whole lot if we do that thing is then
 

637
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,150
a whole lot if we do that thing is then
we can't put a chest next to it so we

638
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,160
we can't put a chest next to it so we
 

639
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
we can't put a chest next to it so we
could either checkered the double chests

640
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,170
could either checkered the double chests
 

641
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,890
could either checkered the double chests
like one there then one there one there

642
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:28,900
like one there then one there one there
 

643
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,540
like one there then one there one there
one there one there

644
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:30,550
one there one there
 

645
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,380
one there one there
or we could space this stuff one block

646
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:34,390
or we could space this stuff one block
 

647
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,390
or we could space this stuff one block
apart from each other and stack them

648
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
apart from each other and stack them
 

649
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:44,360
apart from each other and stack them
straight up like that I don't know ah

650
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,370
straight up like that I don't know ah
 

651
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,730
straight up like that I don't know ah
how do we do it if we go with this

652
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:47,740
how do we do it if we go with this
 

653
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,080
how do we do it if we go with this
method we might have to do a different

654
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,090
method we might have to do a different
 

655
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:55,230
method we might have to do a different
method because mmm actually you know you

656
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,240
method because mmm actually you know you
 

657
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,730
method because mmm actually you know you
don't sink down when you walk on these

658
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:56,740
don't sink down when you walk on these
 

659
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,720
don't sink down when you walk on these
do you let's check our why it doesn't

660
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:00,730
do you let's check our why it doesn't
 

661
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,669
do you let's check our why it doesn't
seem like you sink down you still it

662
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:02,679
seem like you sink down you still it
 

663
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,010
seem like you sink down you still it
still counts as a full block just looks

664
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,020
still counts as a full block just looks
 

665
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:12,270
still counts as a full block just looks
like less um what else now I'm going to

666
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,280
like less um what else now I'm going to
 

667
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,549
like less um what else now I'm going to
point this out though this is like a

668
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
point this out though this is like a
 

669
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,320
point this out though this is like a
main room here but it's going to branch

670
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,330
main room here but it's going to branch
 

671
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,430
main room here but it's going to branch
off to other things like farms and my

672
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:20,440
off to other things like farms and my
 

673
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,660
off to other things like farms and my
bedroom and it's also going to branch

674
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:24,670
bedroom and it's also going to branch
 

675
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,990
bedroom and it's also going to branch
off to a warehouse type storage area so

676
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
off to a warehouse type storage area so
 

677
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,880
off to a warehouse type storage area so
this is just going to be general storage

678
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:29,890
this is just going to be general storage
 

679
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,060
this is just going to be general storage
it's going to have a fair bit of every

680
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,070
it's going to have a fair bit of every
 

681
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,940
it's going to have a fair bit of every
item in this room all around but then

682
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:35,950
item in this room all around but then
 

683
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,090
item in this room all around but then
there's also going to be another bulk

684
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,100
there's also going to be another bulk
 

685
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,460
there's also going to be another bulk
storage room attached to this that will

686
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:43,470
storage room attached to this that will
 

687
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,080
storage room attached to this that will
have plenty of space for like

688
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,090
have plenty of space for like
 

689
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,290
have plenty of space for like
cobblestone because I'm sure we'll have

690
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:48,300
cobblestone because I'm sure we'll have
 

691
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,720
cobblestone because I'm sure we'll have
way more than we could ever fit

692
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:50,730
way more than we could ever fit
 

693
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,100
way more than we could ever fit
conveniently in here so this is just to

694
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,110
conveniently in here so this is just to
 

695
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,770
conveniently in here so this is just to
hold a fair bit of every item so a

696
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:58,780
hold a fair bit of every item so a
 

697
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,919
hold a fair bit of every item so a
double chest or two would be plenty ooh

698
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:03,929

 

699
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:08,910

so that's one thing to think about okay

700
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:08,920
so that's one thing to think about okay
 

701
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,770
so that's one thing to think about okay
I've been brainstorming this a little

702
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:10,780
I've been brainstorming this a little
 

703
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,990
I've been brainstorming this a little
bit and I thought of a better way of

704
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,000
bit and I thought of a better way of
 

705
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,110
bit and I thought of a better way of
doing the exact same thing what I could

706
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
doing the exact same thing what I could
 

707
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,180
doing the exact same thing what I could
do is have my display block at the

708
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,190
do is have my display block at the
 

709
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,380
do is have my display block at the
bottom all right then I could put the

710
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:25,390
bottom all right then I could put the
 

711
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,549
bottom all right then I could put the
dispenser here if I if I want a

712
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:29,559
dispenser here if I if I want a
 

713
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,350
dispenser here if I if I want a
dispenser I might not

714
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
dispenser I might not
 

715
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:39,230
dispenser I might not
I might change my mind and that works

716
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,240
I might change my mind and that works
 

717
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,370
I might change my mind and that works
right and I can still access it and fill

718
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:44,380
right and I can still access it and fill
 

719
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,910
right and I can still access it and fill
it toward order click on it like that so

720
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:47,920
it toward order click on it like that so
 

721
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,650
it toward order click on it like that so
that's good and then above that I could

722
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:49,660
that's good and then above that I could
 

723
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,890
that's good and then above that I could
have chests all the way so that would

724
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:52,900
have chests all the way so that would
 

725
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,500
have chests all the way so that would
give me two extra spots and behind the

726
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:55,510
give me two extra spots and behind the
 

727
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,110
give me two extra spots and behind the
chest I can put lighting so I can keep

728
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,120
chest I can put lighting so I can keep
 

729
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,860
chest I can put lighting so I can keep
it pretty bright that way so one two

730
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:01,870
it pretty bright that way so one two
 

731
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,700
it pretty bright that way so one two
three four five up to five chests I

732
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:04,710
three four five up to five chests I
 

733
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,440
three four five up to five chests I
could either do a solid five it would be

734
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,450
could either do a solid five it would be
 

735
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,810
could either do a solid five it would be
overkill probably or while I could also

736
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:15,820
overkill probably or while I could also
 

737
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,700
overkill probably or while I could also
just do single chests and then that

738
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:17,710
just do single chests and then that
 

739
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,909
just do single chests and then that
would only be three or five I mean five

740
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:20,919
would only be three or five I mean five
 

741
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:23,640
would only be three or five I mean five
chests which would be about the right

742
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:23,650
chests which would be about the right
 

743
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,799
chests which would be about the right
number I would need but we can go as far

744
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:28,809
number I would need but we can go as far
 

745
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:30,539
number I would need but we can go as far
back as we want so we may as well do

746
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:30,549
back as we want so we may as well do
 

747
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,640
back as we want so we may as well do
double chests I think they don't look

748
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,650
double chests I think they don't look
 

749
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,850
double chests I think they don't look
quite as good but double the storage is

750
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:35,860
quite as good but double the storage is
 

751
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,750
quite as good but double the storage is
hard to beat but yeah we can do a

752
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:42,760
hard to beat but yeah we can do a
 

753
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,070
hard to beat but yeah we can do a
checker pattern up type thing and then

754
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,080
checker pattern up type thing and then
 

755
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:57,680
checker pattern up type thing and then
in between ah

756
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:57,690

 

757
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,990

maybe like that have like a double chest

758
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000
maybe like that have like a double chest
 

759
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
maybe like that have like a double chest
here and here that would be two of them

760
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:01,710
here and here that would be two of them
 

761
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,720
here and here that would be two of them
plus the dispenser then like that in

762
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:05,730
plus the dispenser then like that in
 

763
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,730
plus the dispenser then like that in
between we would put like an upside down

764
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:10,740
between we would put like an upside down
 

765
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,040
between we would put like an upside down
stare of whatever theme we're going with

766
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,050
stare of whatever theme we're going with
 

767
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,690
stare of whatever theme we're going with
I have any stairs around I want to try

768
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:17,700
I have any stairs around I want to try
 

769
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,460
I have any stairs around I want to try
this that would be enough storage to

770
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,470
this that would be enough storage to
 

771
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,260
this that would be enough storage to
double chests is plenty plus the

772
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,270
double chests is plenty plus the
 

773
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,900
double chests is plenty plus the
dispenser we'd be good yeah because if

774
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:29,910
dispenser we'd be good yeah because if
 

775
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,720
dispenser we'd be good yeah because if
we use a stair it'll look like a full

776
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:32,730
we use a stair it'll look like a full
 

777
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,440
we use a stair it'll look like a full
block it's going to be the wrong way

778
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,450
block it's going to be the wrong way
 

779
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,140
block it's going to be the wrong way
right yeah you have to do it from behind

780
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,150
right yeah you have to do it from behind
 

781
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,990
right yeah you have to do it from behind
we'd have to put these in first to be

782
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,000
we'd have to put these in first to be
 

783
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,350
we'd have to put these in first to be
little painful to construct but I have

784
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,360
little painful to construct but I have
 

785
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:56,870
little painful to construct but I have
plenty of time to make it right then you

786
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
plenty of time to make it right then you
 

787
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,720
plenty of time to make it right then you
could also put signs on these in between

788
00:27:59,720 --> 00:27:59,730
could also put signs on these in between
 

789
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,790
could also put signs on these in between
blocks that could be cool so if we go

790
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:01,800
blocks that could be cool so if we go
 

791
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,750
blocks that could be cool so if we go
with a wood theme we have wood stairs if

792
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
with a wood theme we have wood stairs if
 

793
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,750
with a wood theme we have wood stairs if
we go with an industrial theme we have

794
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
we go with an industrial theme we have
 

795
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,440
we go with an industrial theme we have
stone stairs there's cobblestone ones if

796
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:12,450
stone stairs there's cobblestone ones if
 

797
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,140
stone stairs there's cobblestone ones if
we go with the snow theme I guess we

798
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,150
we go with the snow theme I guess we
 

799
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,300
we go with the snow theme I guess we
would have to use dark wood stairs when

800
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:20,310
would have to use dark wood stairs when
 

801
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,190
would have to use dark wood stairs when
they come out to do that that could be

802
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,200
they come out to do that that could be
 

803
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,030
they come out to do that that could be
cool I like this idea a lot more then we

804
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,040
cool I like this idea a lot more then we
