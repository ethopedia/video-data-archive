00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,290
welcome back to our let's play series
 

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,790
welcome back to our let's play series
once again and oh man we got we got a

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
once again and oh man we got we got a
 

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,500
once again and oh man we got we got a
project planned for today so last

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:18,510
project planned for today so last
 

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,679
project planned for today so last
episode we we caught this guest we're

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:21,689
episode we we caught this guest we're
 

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:22,910
episode we we caught this guest we're
trying to make a tree farm write an

12
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:22,920
trying to make a tree farm write an
 

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,609
trying to make a tree farm write an
automatic tree farm we set up a system

14
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:25,619
automatic tree farm we set up a system
 

15
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,170
automatic tree farm we set up a system
here to automatically collect the wood

16
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,180
here to automatically collect the wood
 

17
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,880
here to automatically collect the wood
and it seems like it's going to work out

18
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:28,890
and it seems like it's going to work out
 

19
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,840
and it seems like it's going to work out
pretty good I would say it might might

20
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:32,850
pretty good I would say it might might
 

21
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,340
pretty good I would say it might might
be a little bit slow but we'll see once

22
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:34,350
be a little bit slow but we'll see once
 

23
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,560
be a little bit slow but we'll see once
we get it up and running like I'm

24
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:36,570
we get it up and running like I'm
 

25
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,940
we get it up and running like I'm
worried the gas might take a little

26
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:37,950
worried the gas might take a little
 

27
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,180
worried the gas might take a little
little while to harvest the wood but

28
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,190
little while to harvest the wood but
 

29
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,760
little while to harvest the wood but
we'll see might not be an issue but

30
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:43,770
we'll see might not be an issue but
 

31
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,290
we'll see might not be an issue but
today what we're going to try to do is

32
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,300
today what we're going to try to do is
 

33
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,790
today what we're going to try to do is
finish up the second half of this and

34
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
finish up the second half of this and
 

35
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,430
finish up the second half of this and
actually build the tree farm it's kind

36
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
actually build the tree farm it's kind
 

37
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,709
actually build the tree farm it's kind
of important so yeah the idea is we're

38
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:51,719
of important so yeah the idea is we're
 

39
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,819
of important so yeah the idea is we're
gonna have to stand here I tried to turn

40
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:55,829
gonna have to stand here I tried to turn
 

41
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,410
gonna have to stand here I tried to turn
the sounds down it's still very loud

42
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:57,420
the sounds down it's still very loud
 

43
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,540
the sounds down it's still very loud
isn't it down we go okay I'm gonna get

44
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:02,550
isn't it down we go okay I'm gonna get
 

45
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,539
isn't it down we go okay I'm gonna get
creeper so many times today I know it so

46
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:05,549
creeper so many times today I know it so
 

47
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,149
creeper so many times today I know it so
I got my hostile mob sounds at at one

48
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
I got my hostile mob sounds at at one
 

49
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,260
I got my hostile mob sounds at at one
which is never a good idea yeah we're

50
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,270
which is never a good idea yeah we're
 

51
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,060
which is never a good idea yeah we're
going to be standing here and idea is we

52
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,070
going to be standing here and idea is we
 

53
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,090
going to be standing here and idea is we
want to start harvesting trees or

54
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,100
want to start harvesting trees or
 

55
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,219
want to start harvesting trees or
growing trees

56
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:21,229

 

57
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:27,080

so I guess we need like a dispenser this

58
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,090
so I guess we need like a dispenser this
 

59
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,660
so I guess we need like a dispenser this
that shooting bone meal at saplings we

60
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:29,670
that shooting bone meal at saplings we
 

61
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,850
that shooting bone meal at saplings we
plant so we were just told right-click

62
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:31,860
plant so we were just told right-click
 

63
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,520
plant so we were just told right-click
right tree would automatically grow

64
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,530
right tree would automatically grow
 

65
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,310
right tree would automatically grow
automatically get moved and and stuff

66
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
automatically get moved and and stuff
 

67
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,830
automatically get moved and and stuff
and then when it's gone we automatically

68
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
and then when it's gone we automatically
 

69
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,030
and then when it's gone we automatically
plant another one that's we're holding

70
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
plant another one that's we're holding
 

71
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,350
plant another one that's we're holding
right click that's going to get annoying

72
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,360
right click that's going to get annoying
 

73
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,609
right click that's going to get annoying
but yeah this seems like the spot we

74
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:46,619
but yeah this seems like the spot we
 

75
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,639
but yeah this seems like the spot we
want the dirt to do that

76
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:49,649
want the dirt to do that
 

77
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,710
want the dirt to do that
honestly I don't really know what I'm

78
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:51,720
honestly I don't really know what I'm
 

79
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,889
honestly I don't really know what I'm
doing here we're going to try to figure

80
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:54,899
doing here we're going to try to figure
 

81
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,630
doing here we're going to try to figure
it out as we go once again today I've

82
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
it out as we go once again today I've
 

83
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,370
it out as we go once again today I've
never built a tree farm like this before

84
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:58,380
never built a tree farm like this before
 

85
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,160
never built a tree farm like this before
so yeah it's a little out of my

86
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,170
so yeah it's a little out of my
 

87
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,399
so yeah it's a little out of my
experienced range but we're going to try

88
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:04,409
experienced range but we're going to try
 

89
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,980
experienced range but we're going to try
and make it work with the five single

90
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:06,990
and make it work with the five single
 

91
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,639
and make it work with the five single
tree type so no dark oak because that's

92
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:10,649
tree type so no dark oak because that's
 

93
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,210
tree type so no dark oak because that's
a double 2x2 but I think we can do the

94
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,220
a double 2x2 but I think we can do the
 

95
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,309
a double 2x2 but I think we can do the
other five maybe not acacia because they

96
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
other five maybe not acacia because they
 

97
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,710
other five maybe not acacia because they
grow kind of funny but we'll see we'll

98
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
grow kind of funny but we'll see we'll
 

99
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,610
grow kind of funny but we'll see we'll
see I guess the first thing we got to

100
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:22,620
see I guess the first thing we got to
 

101
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,440
see I guess the first thing we got to
figure out though is how tall do we

102
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,450
figure out though is how tall do we
 

103
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,850
figure out though is how tall do we
actually want these trees to grow

104
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:25,860
actually want these trees to grow
 

105
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,300
actually want these trees to grow
because you can stop trees from growing

106
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,310
because you can stop trees from growing
 

107
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,759
because you can stop trees from growing
certain height by how how tall your

108
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:31,769
certain height by how how tall your
 

109
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:34,490
certain height by how how tall your
ceiling is let's see what this does

110
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:34,500
ceiling is let's see what this does
 

111
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,560
ceiling is let's see what this does
this is gonna be the biggest trouble

112
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:36,570
this is gonna be the biggest trouble
 

113
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,440
this is gonna be the biggest trouble
tree right here acacia likes to give

114
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,450
tree right here acacia likes to give
 

115
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,550
tree right here acacia likes to give
people trouble oh look at that that is

116
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,560
people trouble oh look at that that is
 

117
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,150
people trouble oh look at that that is
terrible yeah ideally we want it to grow

118
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,160
terrible yeah ideally we want it to grow
 

119
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,259
terrible yeah ideally we want it to grow
straight up like a proper tree but I

120
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:51,269
straight up like a proper tree but I
 

121
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,580
straight up like a proper tree but I
don't know if that's going to happen I

122
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:52,590
don't know if that's going to happen I
 

123
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,640
don't know if that's going to happen I
do know quite a bit about tree rules

124
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:55,650
do know quite a bit about tree rules
 

125
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,640
do know quite a bit about tree rules
like how they can and can't grow but we

126
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,650
like how they can and can't grow but we
 

127
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,170
like how they can and can't grow but we
will have to figure out a few things

128
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:00,180
will have to figure out a few things
 

129
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,699
will have to figure out a few things
here this one grew all over the place

130
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:04,709
here this one grew all over the place
 

131
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,160
here this one grew all over the place
what happens if we block it if we force

132
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,170
what happens if we block it if we force
 

133
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,430
what happens if we block it if we force
it to stay a certain size or in a

134
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
it to stay a certain size or in a
 

135
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,539
it to stay a certain size or in a
certain area actually I think you can

136
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:17,549
certain area actually I think you can
 

137
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,949
certain area actually I think you can
just do it with one column right so is

138
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:21,959
just do it with one column right so is
 

139
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,220
just do it with one column right so is
this going to grow now

140
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,230

 

141
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,110

mmm doesn't seem to like that very much

142
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
mmm doesn't seem to like that very much
 

143
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:37,380
mmm doesn't seem to like that very much
oh no no no yeah I won't grow at all now

144
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,390
oh no no no yeah I won't grow at all now
 

145
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,020
oh no no no yeah I won't grow at all now
okay so we just learnt a new tree rule

146
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,030
okay so we just learnt a new tree rule
 

147
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,050
okay so we just learnt a new tree rule
what about if we space it one block away

148
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,060

 

149
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,309

one block away and let's see what

150
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
one block away and let's see what
 

151
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,160
one block away and let's see what
happens now

152
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,170
happens now
 

153
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,789
happens now
alright there's going to be a lot of

154
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:51,799
alright there's going to be a lot of
 

155
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,320
alright there's going to be a lot of
this trial and error to figure out the

156
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,330
this trial and error to figure out the
 

157
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,610
this trial and error to figure out the
ideal okay that was not bad it did still

158
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:57,620
ideal okay that was not bad it did still
 

159
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,509
ideal okay that was not bad it did still
branch though maybe let's do that all

160
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
branch though maybe let's do that all
 

161
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,940
branch though maybe let's do that all
around now let's put some blocks there

162
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:06,950
around now let's put some blocks there
 

163
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,720
around now let's put some blocks there
so four blocks tall all around one block

164
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:10,730
so four blocks tall all around one block
 

165
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,309
so four blocks tall all around one block
away from it's still grew crooked come

166
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:15,319
away from it's still grew crooked come
 

167
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,900
away from it's still grew crooked come
on trees okay so check this out

168
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:19,910
on trees okay so check this out
 

169
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,789
on trees okay so check this out
something weird has happened now I built

170
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:21,799
something weird has happened now I built
 

171
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,350
something weird has happened now I built
this up even taller it was four blocks

172
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
this up even taller it was four blocks
 

173
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,870
this up even taller it was four blocks
tall before now it's six blocks tall so

174
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:25,880
tall before now it's six blocks tall so
 

175
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,210
tall before now it's six blocks tall so
basically goes all the way up now right

176
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:28,220
basically goes all the way up now right
 

177
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,730
basically goes all the way up now right
it was able to grow before when it was

178
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:30,740
it was able to grow before when it was
 

179
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,770
it was able to grow before when it was
four blocks tall but not now that it's

180
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:32,780
four blocks tall but not now that it's
 

181
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,159
four blocks tall but not now that it's
six even though it still has the same

182
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,169
six even though it still has the same
 

183
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,129
six even though it still has the same
3x3 footprint do you know why it's not

184
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:39,139
3x3 footprint do you know why it's not
 

185
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,969
3x3 footprint do you know why it's not
growing now I think it's because it

186
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:42,979
growing now I think it's because it
 

187
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,490
growing now I think it's because it
requires like a five by five area for

188
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,500
requires like a five by five area for
 

189
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,620
requires like a five by five area for
the foliage for the leaves you know and

190
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:47,630
the foliage for the leaves you know and
 

191
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,060
the foliage for the leaves you know and
we took that away let's see if it'll

192
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,070
we took that away let's see if it'll
 

193
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,250
we took that away let's see if it'll
grow at five I don't think it's going to

194
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,260
grow at five I don't think it's going to
 

195
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,839
grow at five I don't think it's going to
grow at five so I think it wants maybe

196
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:00,849
grow at five so I think it wants maybe
 

197
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,040
grow at five so I think it wants maybe
that's two blocks from the ceiling I

198
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,050
that's two blocks from the ceiling I
 

199
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,379
that's two blocks from the ceiling I
think it needs three three blocks tall

200
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:05,389
think it needs three three blocks tall
 

201
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,890
think it needs three three blocks tall
and a five by five so now it might grow

202
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:08,900
and a five by five so now it might grow
 

203
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,279
and a five by five so now it might grow
again now that it's four by four again

204
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:12,289
again now that it's four by four again
 

205
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,610
again now that it's four by four again
or four tall yeah there we go that's

206
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:15,620
or four tall yeah there we go that's
 

207
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,969
or four tall yeah there we go that's
like the minimum so it needs a three

208
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:18,979
like the minimum so it needs a three
 

209
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,870
like the minimum so it needs a three
block tall spacing for the foilage by

210
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
block tall spacing for the foilage by
 

211
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,140
block tall spacing for the foilage by
the looks of it okay let's do another

212
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,150
the looks of it okay let's do another
 

213
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,020
the looks of it okay let's do another
test so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 tall

214
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,030
test so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 tall
 

215
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,570
test so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 tall
blockers here and 3 blocks of free space

216
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:31,580
blockers here and 3 blocks of free space
 

217
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,270
blockers here and 3 blocks of free space
above that for the leaves and it's a 5

218
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,280
above that for the leaves and it's a 5
 

219
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,670
above that for the leaves and it's a 5
by 5 area so if my theory is correct it

220
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:36,680
by 5 area so if my theory is correct it
 

221
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,670
by 5 area so if my theory is correct it
should be able to grow

222
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
should be able to grow
 

223
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,670
should be able to grow
in this area let's try it again but uh

224
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:44,680
in this area let's try it again but uh
 

225
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,170
in this area let's try it again but uh
but it's still corrected Oh No

226
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,180
but it's still corrected Oh No
 

227
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,400
but it's still corrected Oh No
yeah I don't know if we're going to be

228
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,410
yeah I don't know if we're going to be
 

229
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,939
yeah I don't know if we're going to be
able to grow these acacia ones okay so

230
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:54,949
able to grow these acacia ones okay so
 

231
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,469
able to grow these acacia ones okay so
I've been doing a bunch of testing here

232
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
I've been doing a bunch of testing here
 

233
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,040
I've been doing a bunch of testing here
I'm trying to find the ideal height and

234
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,050
I'm trying to find the ideal height and
 

235
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,840
I'm trying to find the ideal height and
like setup for this so I got 5 tall

236
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:01,850
like setup for this so I got 5 tall
 

237
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,629
like setup for this so I got 5 tall
blockers now and three block space above

238
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
blockers now and three block space above
 

239
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,779
blockers now and three block space above
that which seems pretty good see if you

240
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:07,789
that which seems pretty good see if you
 

241
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,700
that which seems pretty good see if you
make it too tall then the oak trees

242
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:09,710
make it too tall then the oak trees
 

243
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,680
make it too tall then the oak trees
start branching I think we're safe at

244
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:11,690
start branching I think we're safe at
 

245
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,670
start branching I think we're safe at
this height with them far as I can tell

246
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
this height with them far as I can tell
 

247
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,010
this height with them far as I can tell
oh if you go too short though you have a

248
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,020
oh if you go too short though you have a
 

249
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,629
oh if you go too short though you have a
problem where the bonemeal doesn't want

250
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
problem where the bonemeal doesn't want
 

251
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,760
problem where the bonemeal doesn't want
to work and you waste a lot of bone meal

252
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:24,770
to work and you waste a lot of bone meal
 

253
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,310
to work and you waste a lot of bone meal
and also you don't get very much per

254
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,320
and also you don't get very much per
 

255
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,590
and also you don't get very much per
harvest which is not not a good thing

256
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
harvest which is not not a good thing
 

257
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,860
harvest which is not not a good thing
either

258
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:31,870

 

259
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,000

yeah this bone eels struggling a little

260
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,010
yeah this bone eels struggling a little
 

261
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,050
yeah this bone eels struggling a little
bit but it's not too bad

262
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,060
bit but it's not too bad
 

263
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,790
bit but it's not too bad
1 2 3 4 5 6 6 tall again this seems to

264
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:39,800
1 2 3 4 5 6 6 tall again this seems to
 

265
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,439
1 2 3 4 5 6 6 tall again this seems to
work with the jungle trees with the

266
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:41,449
work with the jungle trees with the
 

267
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:43,629
work with the jungle trees with the
birch trees the oak trees I was having a

268
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:43,639
birch trees the oak trees I was having a
 

269
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,750
birch trees the oak trees I was having a
little trouble with the spruce ones and

270
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:45,760
little trouble with the spruce ones and
 

271
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,580
little trouble with the spruce ones and
I've decided we're not doing acacia this

272
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:48,590
I've decided we're not doing acacia this
 

273
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,120
I've decided we're not doing acacia this
is going to be too much hassle from what

274
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,130
is going to be too much hassle from what
 

275
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,980
is going to be too much hassle from what
I can tell I can't stop it from

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:53,990
I can tell I can't stop it from
 

277
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,310
I can tell I can't stop it from
branching I can't figure out how to if

278
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,320
branching I can't figure out how to if
 

279
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,379
branching I can't figure out how to if
there even is a way there probably isn't

280
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:01,389
there even is a way there probably isn't
 

281
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,939
there even is a way there probably isn't
alright yeah that's $6 see the birch

282
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:03,949
alright yeah that's $6 see the birch
 

283
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:06,430
alright yeah that's $6 see the birch
tree grew beautifully there spruce tree

284
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,440
tree grew beautifully there spruce tree
 

285
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,439
tree grew beautifully there spruce tree
though I don't know maybe I was just

286
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:08,449
though I don't know maybe I was just
 

287
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,180
though I don't know maybe I was just
getting unlucky but I can't get it to do

288
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,190
getting unlucky but I can't get it to do
 

289
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:16,330
getting unlucky but I can't get it to do
its thing yeah Bert the spruce tree tis

290
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:16,340
its thing yeah Bert the spruce tree tis
 

291
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,969
its thing yeah Bert the spruce tree tis
not like that maybe we'll try expand the

292
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,979
not like that maybe we'll try expand the
 

293
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:25,000
not like that maybe we'll try expand the
top here or not maybe not maybe it still

294
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,010
top here or not maybe not maybe it still
 

295
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,409
top here or not maybe not maybe it still
doesn't like that mmm okay I got to

296
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:29,419
doesn't like that mmm okay I got to
 

297
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,450
doesn't like that mmm okay I got to
figure it out here and we have a very

298
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:31,460
figure it out here and we have a very
 

299
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,850
figure it out here and we have a very
interesting design choice to make with

300
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:33,860
interesting design choice to make with
 

301
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,520
interesting design choice to make with
our tree farm here so out of the six

302
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,530
our tree farm here so out of the six
 

303
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,219
our tree farm here so out of the six
different types of trees oak trees will

304
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:39,229
different types of trees oak trees will
 

305
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,980
different types of trees oak trees will
grow in a one by one it's the only one

306
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:41,990
grow in a one by one it's the only one
 

307
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,490
grow in a one by one it's the only one
that does it and it's amazing like if we

308
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:45,500
that does it and it's amazing like if we
 

309
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,690
that does it and it's amazing like if we
wanted to do oh it branched ohh

310
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:50,700

 

311
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,020

that would be fine though I think if we

312
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,030
that would be fine though I think if we
 

313
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,750
that would be fine though I think if we
want the ultimate simplistic tree farm

314
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:56,760
want the ultimate simplistic tree farm
 

315
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,080
want the ultimate simplistic tree farm
oak trees are the way to go is all we

316
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,090
oak trees are the way to go is all we
 

317
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,850
oak trees are the way to go is all we
would need to do is like put a regular

318
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:01,860
would need to do is like put a regular
 

319
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,420
would need to do is like put a regular
Pistons over there push it aside and

320
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,430
Pistons over there push it aside and
 

321
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,990
Pistons over there push it aside and
that's it no double extend there is no

322
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
that's it no double extend there is no
 

323
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,880
that's it no double extend there is no
triple extenders or anything crazy like

324
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:10,890
triple extenders or anything crazy like
 

325
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,550
triple extenders or anything crazy like
that to move the wood out of the out of

326
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,560
that to move the wood out of the out of
 

327
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,700
that to move the wood out of the out of
the way light doesn't get any better

328
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:16,710
the way light doesn't get any better
 

329
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,210
the way light doesn't get any better
than that

330
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,220
than that
 

331
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,000
than that
but it's only oak wood if we want to go

332
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,010
but it's only oak wood if we want to go
 

333
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,050
but it's only oak wood if we want to go
up a step to a three by three footprints

334
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,060
up a step to a three by three footprints
 

335
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:30,490
up a step to a three by three footprints
then we can grow acacia jungle and birch

336
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:30,500
then we can grow acacia jungle and birch
 

337
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,060
then we can grow acacia jungle and birch
all right

338
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,070
all right
 

339
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,040
all right
Taoiseach though they do that branching

340
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,050
Taoiseach though they do that branching
 

341
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,480
Taoiseach though they do that branching
thing so we would don't actually want to

342
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,490
thing so we would don't actually want to
 

343
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,300
thing so we would don't actually want to
grow them so that has other problems but

344
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,310
grow them so that has other problems but
 

345
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,010
grow them so that has other problems but
if we want to grow spruce trees we need

346
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,020
if we want to grow spruce trees we need
 

347
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,050
if we want to grow spruce trees we need
a five by five footprint and that

348
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,060
a five by five footprint and that
 

349
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,220
a five by five footprint and that
complicates things a lot so I'm still

350
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,230
complicates things a lot so I'm still
 

351
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,560
complicates things a lot so I'm still
thinking what do we want to do here like

352
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,570
thinking what do we want to do here like
 

353
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,940
thinking what do we want to do here like
that's why the spruce wasn't growing it

354
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:49,950
that's why the spruce wasn't growing it
 

355
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,380
that's why the spruce wasn't growing it
needs a five by five we only had a three

356
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,390
needs a five by five we only had a three
 

357
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,660
needs a five by five we only had a three
by three when we were testing it

358
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:53,670
by three when we were testing it
 

359
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,950
by three when we were testing it
previously actually I just had an idea

360
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:57,960
previously actually I just had an idea
 

361
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,410
previously actually I just had an idea
let's do one or two more tests here see

362
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,420
let's do one or two more tests here see
 

363
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,120
let's do one or two more tests here see
if I understand my tree rules like I

364
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,130
if I understand my tree rules like I
 

365
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:07,310
if I understand my tree rules like I
think I do let's let's grow this yeah

366
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,320
think I do let's let's grow this yeah
 

367
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,740
think I do let's let's grow this yeah
okay so if I understand this right like

368
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:09,750
okay so if I understand this right like
 

369
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,210
okay so if I understand this right like
we're blocking the trees from growing

370
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,220
we're blocking the trees from growing
 

371
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,590
we're blocking the trees from growing
using these stone blocks I'm pretty sure

372
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,600
using these stone blocks I'm pretty sure
 

373
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,290
using these stone blocks I'm pretty sure
wood and leaves get ignored though so if

374
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,300
wood and leaves get ignored though so if
 

375
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,210
wood and leaves get ignored though so if
if I'm not mistaken we can still grow

376
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,220
if I'm not mistaken we can still grow
 

377
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,650
if I'm not mistaken we can still grow
another tree here even though it's being

378
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:21,660
another tree here even though it's being
 

379
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,200
another tree here even though it's being
blocked by this wood and the leaves

380
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,210
blocked by this wood and the leaves
 

381
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,760
blocked by this wood and the leaves
above still check yeah so that grew no

382
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:28,770
above still check yeah so that grew no
 

383
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,390
above still check yeah so that grew no
problem

384
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:29,400
problem
 

385
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,840
problem
so maybe maybe let's grab our pistons

386
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:34,850
so maybe maybe let's grab our pistons
 

387
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,400
so maybe maybe let's grab our pistons
all right so I'll tell you what my idea

388
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,410
all right so I'll tell you what my idea
 

389
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,240
all right so I'll tell you what my idea
is sticky ones regular ones if we just

390
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,250
is sticky ones regular ones if we just
 

391
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,360
is sticky ones regular ones if we just
do oak trees like this the very simple

392
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,370
do oak trees like this the very simple
 

393
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,570
do oak trees like this the very simple
way to do it is just to have regular

394
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:47,580
way to do it is just to have regular
 

395
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,720
way to do it is just to have regular
Pistons that push the wood aside right

396
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:49,730
Pistons that push the wood aside right
 

397
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,610
Pistons that push the wood aside right
push it this way that's all you got to

398
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:52,620
push it this way that's all you got to
 

399
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,640
push it this way that's all you got to
do if we want to upgrade to handle both

400
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:55,650
do if we want to upgrade to handle both
 

401
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,830
do if we want to upgrade to handle both
the jungle and the birch trees though

402
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:57,840
the jungle and the birch trees though
 

403
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,140
the jungle and the birch trees though
the three by three footprints then we

404
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,150
the three by three footprints then we
 

405
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,850
the three by three footprints then we
need double extenders and all that kind

406
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:01,860
need double extenders and all that kind
 

407
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,560
need double extenders and all that kind
of stuff which makes things a lot more

408
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:03,570
of stuff which makes things a lot more
 

409
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,220
of stuff which makes things a lot more
messy

410
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,230
messy
 

411
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,890
messy
and less and less we can do a trick

412
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:08,900
and less and less we can do a trick
 

413
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,070
and less and less we can do a trick
which I'm hoping we can what if we just

414
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,080
which I'm hoping we can what if we just
 

415
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,600
which I'm hoping we can what if we just
use wood blocks for our building so if

416
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:17,610
use wood blocks for our building so if
 

417
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,510
use wood blocks for our building so if
we go sticky pistons with wood over here

418
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:20,520
we go sticky pistons with wood over here
 

419
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,460
we go sticky pistons with wood over here
it might still be able to grow and then

420
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,470
it might still be able to grow and then
 

421
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,430
it might still be able to grow and then
we can still push the the wood aside

422
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,440
we can still push the the wood aside
 

423
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,310
we can still push the the wood aside
with a single single piston you know we

424
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,320
with a single single piston you know we
 

425
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,400
with a single single piston you know we
don't need double extenders we'll give

426
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,410
don't need double extenders we'll give
 

427
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,610
don't need double extenders we'll give
it a try okay so that means all this has

428
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:37,620
it a try okay so that means all this has
 

429
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,530
it a try okay so that means all this has
to go away now if we plant a jungle tree

430
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:42,540
to go away now if we plant a jungle tree
 

431
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,920
to go away now if we plant a jungle tree
here if it ignores this wood it should

432
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:45,930
here if it ignores this wood it should
 

433
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,760
here if it ignores this wood it should
grow oh this has to go to make sure we

434
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:49,770
grow oh this has to go to make sure we
 

435
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:56,200
grow oh this has to go to make sure we
do it right it's going to grow grow oh

436
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,210
do it right it's going to grow grow oh
 

437
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,170
do it right it's going to grow grow oh
come on it's not growing oh it did grow

438
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,180
come on it's not growing oh it did grow
 

439
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,210
come on it's not growing oh it did grow
it grew yes

440
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,220
it grew yes
 

441
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:09,350
it grew yes
Oh baby okay we might be able to Oh the

442
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
Oh baby okay we might be able to Oh the
 

443
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,060
Oh baby okay we might be able to Oh the
gastrous sauce for sight it's fine it's

444
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,070
gastrous sauce for sight it's fine it's
 

445
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,300
gastrous sauce for sight it's fine it's
fine

446
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,310
fine
 

447
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,370
fine
yeah we might be able to simplify this

448
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,380
yeah we might be able to simplify this
 

449
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,010
yeah we might be able to simplify this
quite a bit then because basically

450
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,020
quite a bit then because basically
 

451
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,750
quite a bit then because basically
that's going to push that tree over and

452
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
that's going to push that tree over and
 

453
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,150
that's going to push that tree over and
then when it retracts its back into

454
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
then when it retracts its back into
 

455
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,240
then when it retracts its back into
position it's going or the wood on the

456
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,250
position it's going or the wood on the
 

457
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,370
position it's going or the wood on the
right and the left here this will be

458
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,380
right and the left here this will be
 

459
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,040
right and the left here this will be
wood as well I think we're good with

460
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,050
wood as well I think we're good with
 

461
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,710
wood as well I think we're good with
that

462
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:29,720
that
 

463
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,720
that
so we might still upgrade this to handle

464
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:32,730
so we might still upgrade this to handle
 

465
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,760
so we might still upgrade this to handle
spruce trees as well with the five by

466
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:34,770
spruce trees as well with the five by
 

467
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,490
spruce trees as well with the five by
five footprints we would have to switch

468
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:37,500
five footprints we would have to switch
 

469
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,650
five footprints we would have to switch
this over to double extenders but we we

470
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:39,660
this over to double extenders but we we
 

471
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,240
this over to double extenders but we we
wouldn't need triple extenders like I

472
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,250
wouldn't need triple extenders like I
 

473
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,190
wouldn't need triple extenders like I
thought originally so that's quite the

474
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
thought originally so that's quite the
 

475
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,930
thought originally so that's quite the
improvement but let's see if we can get

476
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:44,940
improvement but let's see if we can get
 

477
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,450
improvement but let's see if we can get
this working first it's coming along

478
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:47,460
this working first it's coming along
 

479
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,670
this working first it's coming along
here I think maybe what we'll try next

480
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
here I think maybe what we'll try next
 

481
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,520
here I think maybe what we'll try next
is figure out how to detect when the

482
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:52,530
is figure out how to detect when the
 

483
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,380
is figure out how to detect when the
tree grows so let's just make sure that

484
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,390
tree grows so let's just make sure that
 

485
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:59,180
tree grows so let's just make sure that
still is a thing in the game oh sure to

486
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,190
still is a thing in the game oh sure to
 

487
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,220
still is a thing in the game oh sure to
plant it that first

488
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,230
plant it that first
 

489
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,690
plant it that first
all right so Oh what oh because it I'm

490
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:05,700
all right so Oh what oh because it I'm
 

491
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,300
all right so Oh what oh because it I'm
an idiot yeah okay now we place now we

492
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,310
an idiot yeah okay now we place now we
 

493
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,460
an idiot yeah okay now we place now we
place this okay now when this grows

494
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,470
place this okay now when this grows
 

495
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,970
place this okay now when this grows
let's see if that piston extends it does

496
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:16,980
let's see if that piston extends it does
 

497
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,720
let's see if that piston extends it does
good

498
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:17,730
good
 

499
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,879
good
so can detect when trees grow let's see

500
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:24,889
so can detect when trees grow let's see
 

501
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:31,609
so can detect when trees grow let's see
if we have a repeater or comparator

502
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:31,619
if we have a repeater or comparator
 

503
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:36,530
if we have a repeater or comparator
facing this way and that is powered can

504
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:36,540
facing this way and that is powered can
 

505
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,349
facing this way and that is powered can
we detect that below this dirt block I

506
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:39,359
we detect that below this dirt block I
 

507
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,939
we detect that below this dirt block I
wonder let's put a put let's put a

508
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:43,949
wonder let's put a put let's put a
 

509
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:46,460
wonder let's put a put let's put a
piston here let's try this out I'm not

510
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:46,470
piston here let's try this out I'm not
 

511
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,799
piston here let's try this out I'm not
sure if the sash you're going to work

512
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:50,809

 

513
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:57,199

yeah okay no all right I didn't think so

514
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:57,209
yeah okay no all right I didn't think so
 

515
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,530
yeah okay no all right I didn't think so
it is powered though but we would need

516
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:00,540
it is powered though but we would need
 

517
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,369
it is powered though but we would need
to we would need to like constantly

518
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:04,379
to we would need to like constantly
 

519
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:07,039
to we would need to like constantly
update it to check if the tree actually

520
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,049
update it to check if the tree actually
 

521
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:09,970
update it to check if the tree actually
grew and then it would react

522
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:09,980
grew and then it would react
 

523
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,409
grew and then it would react
you know honestly this seems like a dumb

524
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:12,419
you know honestly this seems like a dumb
 

525
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:14,210
you know honestly this seems like a dumb
idea to me at first but it's actually

526
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,220
idea to me at first but it's actually
 

527
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,039
idea to me at first but it's actually
pretty good because we're constantly

528
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,049
pretty good because we're constantly
 

529
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:18,429
pretty good because we're constantly
spamming this bonemeal thing anyways

530
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:18,439
spamming this bonemeal thing anyways
 

531
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,609
spamming this bonemeal thing anyways
amazed we'll take advantage of that so

532
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:21,619
amazed we'll take advantage of that so
 

533
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,869
amazed we'll take advantage of that so
we don't actually want to send a

534
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:23,879
we don't actually want to send a
 

535
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,939
we don't actually want to send a
redstone signal to this we just want it

536
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:25,949
redstone signal to this we just want it
 

537
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:28,220
redstone signal to this we just want it
to update so it can tell when it's but

538
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,230
to update so it can tell when it's but
 

539
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,599
to update so it can tell when it's but
powered so if we have a repeater or even

540
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:32,609
powered so if we have a repeater or even
 

541
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:35,299
powered so if we have a repeater or even
redstone running sideways not into the

542
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:35,309
redstone running sideways not into the
 

543
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:39,229
redstone running sideways not into the
piston just beside it it will check if

544
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:39,239
piston just beside it it will check if
 

545
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,019
piston just beside it it will check if
there's a piece of wood there or not

546
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:41,029
there's a piece of wood there or not
 

547
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,909
there's a piece of wood there or not
because we're very limited on space with

548
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:43,919
because we're very limited on space with
 

549
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,999
because we're very limited on space with
this we can't just put like redstone on

550
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:50,009
this we can't just put like redstone on
 

551
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,499
this we can't just put like redstone on
this other side because we have the

552
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:51,509
this other side because we have the
 

553
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,150
this other side because we have the
dropper here and there's going to be

554
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,160
dropper here and there's going to be
 

555
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,679
dropper here and there's going to be
wood here and wood here we need power

556
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:54,689
wood here and wood here we need power
 

557
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,739
wood here and wood here we need power
here we need like five sides this is one

558
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:57,749
here we need like five sides this is one
 

559
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:01,429
here we need like five sides this is one
way of sneaking it in and if it's gone

560
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:01,439
way of sneaking it in and if it's gone
 

561
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:07,489
way of sneaking it in and if it's gone
should retracts yeah I just sucked up a

562
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:07,499
should retracts yeah I just sucked up a
 

563
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:09,319
should retracts yeah I just sucked up a
little mechanism here now so basically

564
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:09,329
little mechanism here now so basically
 

565
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,059
little mechanism here now so basically
when that piston extends it pushes a

566
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:11,069
when that piston extends it pushes a
 

567
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:13,489
when that piston extends it pushes a
redstone block now which goes to a

568
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:13,499
redstone block now which goes to a
 

569
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,759
redstone block now which goes to a
monostable circuits shortens lengths to

570
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:16,769
monostable circuits shortens lengths to
 

571
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,590
monostable circuits shortens lengths to
the pulse to two ticks

572
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,600
the pulse to two ticks
 

573
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,559
the pulse to two ticks
very important to set the Sun to goes up

574
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:21,569
very important to set the Sun to goes up
 

575
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,989
very important to set the Sun to goes up
to all the Pistons here that push the

576
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:23,999
to all the Pistons here that push the
 

577
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,659
to all the Pistons here that push the
tree out of the way and since it only

578
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:26,669
tree out of the way and since it only
 

579
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,369
tree out of the way and since it only
works when it's a full block that

580
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:28,379
works when it's a full block that
 

581
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,820
works when it's a full block that
transmits redstone

582
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:30,830
transmits redstone
 

583
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,080
transmits redstone
this does not cause it to happen when

584
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,090
this does not cause it to happen when
 

585
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,350
this does not cause it to happen when
you place the sapling it's only when

586
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,360
you place the sapling it's only when
 

587
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,640
you place the sapling it's only when
actually grows automatically pushes it

588
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:40,650
actually grows automatically pushes it
 

589
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,730
actually grows automatically pushes it
away and retracts the other other thing

590
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:43,740
away and retracts the other other thing
 

591
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,960
away and retracts the other other thing
so it's very nice

592
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:44,970
so it's very nice
 

593
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,980
so it's very nice
really happy with that yeah then just

594
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:48,990
really happy with that yeah then just
 

595
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,660
really happy with that yeah then just
double check in here that might series

596
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,670
double check in here that might series
 

597
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,750
double check in here that might series
correct it does keep going it's really

598
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
correct it does keep going it's really
 

599
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,610
correct it does keep going it's really
important so we're going to want to hook

600
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:55,620
important so we're going to want to hook
 

601
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,130
important so we're going to want to hook
this up to our leaf crusher as well so

602
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,140
this up to our leaf crusher as well so
 

603
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,890
this up to our leaf crusher as well so
we get saplings back that way we don't

604
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:00,900
we get saplings back that way we don't
 

605
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,730
we get saplings back that way we don't
run out okay so here's the deal guys

606
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:04,740
run out okay so here's the deal guys
 

607
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,990
run out okay so here's the deal guys
I know what you're thinking right now

608
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
I know what you're thinking right now
 

609
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,630
I know what you're thinking right now
you're like oh man II so he's got to

610
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:08,640
you're like oh man II so he's got to
 

611
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,790
you're like oh man II so he's got to
figure it out he knows what he's doing

612
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
figure it out he knows what he's doing
 

613
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,190
figure it out he knows what he's doing
it's home stretch right now right this

614
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,200
it's home stretch right now right this
 

615
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,640
it's home stretch right now right this
is a tree so we know and love but no we

616
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:16,650
is a tree so we know and love but no we
 

617
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,620
is a tree so we know and love but no we
got a couple problems to figure out here

618
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:18,630
got a couple problems to figure out here
 

619
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,460
got a couple problems to figure out here
and I really have no clue because it's

620
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,470
and I really have no clue because it's
 

621
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,290
and I really have no clue because it's
something I've never dealt with in all

622
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
something I've never dealt with in all
 

623
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,060
something I've never dealt with in all
my time working with pistons and and

624
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,070
my time working with pistons and and
 

625
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,310
my time working with pistons and and
that kind of stuff we got to convert

626
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
that kind of stuff we got to convert
 

627
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,970
that kind of stuff we got to convert
from this wall of tree stuff into a

628
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:31,980
from this wall of tree stuff into a
 

629
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,470
from this wall of tree stuff into a
single line now and we also kind of want

630
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
single line now and we also kind of want
 

631
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,780
single line now and we also kind of want
to have a buffer which I'll explain so

632
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:38,790
to have a buffer which I'll explain so
 

633
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,990
to have a buffer which I'll explain so
basically we need to convert from that

634
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
basically we need to convert from that
 

635
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,610
basically we need to convert from that
wall to a line how do we do that it's

636
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:46,620
wall to a line how do we do that it's
 

637
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,470
wall to a line how do we do that it's
easy to go from a line to a wall and

638
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
easy to go from a line to a wall and
 

639
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,500
easy to go from a line to a wall and
then to a tube but to go in reverse I

640
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:51,510
then to a tube but to go in reverse I
 

641
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,980
then to a tube but to go in reverse I
have no clue I have no clue and if we

642
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:54,990
have no clue I have no clue and if we
 

643
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,329
have no clue I have no clue and if we
don't move the wood out of the way we

644
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:56,339
don't move the wood out of the way we
 

645
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,480
don't move the wood out of the way we
can't grow another tree so yeah I'm

646
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:02,490
can't grow another tree so yeah I'm
 

647
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,000
can't grow another tree so yeah I'm
gonna have to just goof around with this

648
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,010
gonna have to just goof around with this
 

649
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,140
gonna have to just goof around with this
for a bit I'm not sure well I guess one

650
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,150
for a bit I'm not sure well I guess one
 

651
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,420
for a bit I'm not sure well I guess one
thing is clear to me with this now we

652
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,430
thing is clear to me with this now we
 

653
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,700
thing is clear to me with this now we
can't use smart pistons like we have

654
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:13,710
can't use smart pistons like we have
 

655
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,640
can't use smart pistons like we have
here because what will happen if the

656
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,650
here because what will happen if the
 

657
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,530
here because what will happen if the
ghast hasn't removed the wood here and

658
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:18,540
ghast hasn't removed the wood here and
 

659
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,770
ghast hasn't removed the wood here and
it tries to push another piece of wood

660
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:21,780
it tries to push another piece of wood
 

661
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,460
it tries to push another piece of wood
there when there's no space for it you

662
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,470
there when there's no space for it you
 

663
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,620
there when there's no space for it you
know the block goes here can't it can't

664
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:27,630
know the block goes here can't it can't
 

665
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,170
know the block goes here can't it can't
push it there because it's blocked this

666
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,180
push it there because it's blocked this
 

667
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,360
push it there because it's blocked this
will never ever move again if we use a

668
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,370
will never ever move again if we use a
 

669
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,550
will never ever move again if we use a
smart distance so we have to use a clock

670
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
smart distance so we have to use a clock
 

671
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,949
smart distance so we have to use a clock
instead but if there's a block here make

672
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:39,959
instead but if there's a block here make
 

673
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,560
instead but if there's a block here make
a clock run

674
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,570
a clock run
 

675
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,960
a clock run
well I ended up making a pretty weird

676
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:44,970
well I ended up making a pretty weird
 

677
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,090
well I ended up making a pretty weird
little piston contraption here but it

678
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,100
little piston contraption here but it
 

679
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,230
little piston contraption here but it
should do the trick

680
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
should do the trick
 

681
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,120
should do the trick
one of the most important things about

682
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,130
one of the most important things about
 

683
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,790
one of the most important things about
it is I wanted to have a furnace or

684
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
it is I wanted to have a furnace or
 

685
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,590
it is I wanted to have a furnace or
obsidian or something that doesn't get

686
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600
obsidian or something that doesn't get
 

687
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,190
obsidian or something that doesn't get
moved by the piston over there that if

688
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,200
moved by the piston over there that if
 

689
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,110
moved by the piston over there that if
it did it would wreck the redstone and

690
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,120
it did it would wreck the redstone and
 

691
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,750
it did it would wreck the redstone and
you know it'd make a big line of logs

692
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:02,760
you know it'd make a big line of logs
 

693
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,400
you know it'd make a big line of logs
over here that we don't want that kind

694
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,410
over here that we don't want that kind
 

695
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,710
over here that we don't want that kind
of thing so to make it work since we

696
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
of thing so to make it work since we
 

697
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,360
of thing so to make it work since we
don't really have enough sides to do it

698
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:08,370
don't really have enough sides to do it
 

699
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,110
don't really have enough sides to do it
I went above so if there's a block above

700
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,120
I went above so if there's a block above
 

701
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,730
I went above so if there's a block above
this redstone torch it powers this

702
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:13,740
this redstone torch it powers this
 

703
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,490
this redstone torch it powers this
piston makes this come out which unlocks

704
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:16,500
piston makes this come out which unlocks
 

705
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,370
piston makes this come out which unlocks
this clock allows it to run which makes

706
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:19,380
this clock allows it to run which makes
 

707
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,140
this clock allows it to run which makes
this piston extend alright it's a little

708
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,150
this piston extend alright it's a little
 

709
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,910
this piston extend alright it's a little
bit weird so right now there is a piston

710
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:28,920
bit weird so right now there is a piston
 

711
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,670
bit weird so right now there is a piston
or a block in front of this piston you

712
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:31,680
or a block in front of this piston you
 

713
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,110
or a block in front of this piston you
can see this clock is running so it's

714
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
can see this clock is running so it's
 

715
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,930
can see this clock is running so it's
waiting for its opportunity to extend

716
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:35,940
waiting for its opportunity to extend
 

717
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,970
waiting for its opportunity to extend
right now so if the gas blows up one of

718
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:37,980
right now so if the gas blows up one of
 

719
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,380
right now so if the gas blows up one of
these blocks it'll automatically fill in

720
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,390
these blocks it'll automatically fill in
 

721
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,130
these blocks it'll automatically fill in
that space and now this is ready to go

722
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,140
that space and now this is ready to go
 

723
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,330
that space and now this is ready to go
it stops running the clock until another

724
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:49,340
it stops running the clock until another
 

725
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,020
it stops running the clock until another
block goes into place and I think that's

726
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,030
block goes into place and I think that's
 

727
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,480
block goes into place and I think that's
the way to do it still haven't figured

728
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,490
the way to do it still haven't figured
 

729
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,140
the way to do it still haven't figured
out this wall issue though all right so

730
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,150
out this wall issue though all right so
 

731
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,490
out this wall issue though all right so
I thought about it for a little bit here

732
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:01,500
I thought about it for a little bit here
 

733
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,530
I thought about it for a little bit here
I've came up with a method I don't know

734
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:03,540
I've came up with a method I don't know
 

735
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,770
I've came up with a method I don't know
if this is exactly a great method

736
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:05,780
if this is exactly a great method
 

737
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,820
if this is exactly a great method
there's probably something even more

738
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:07,830
there's probably something even more
 

739
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,370
there's probably something even more
clever that could be done but I call it

740
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,380
clever that could be done but I call it
 

741
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,310
clever that could be done but I call it
the sandwich machine this is what it

742
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,320
the sandwich machine this is what it
 

743
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,710
the sandwich machine this is what it
does so basically we got a double

744
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:15,720
does so basically we got a double
 

745
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,420
does so basically we got a double
extender on the top one on the bottom

746
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,430
extender on the top one on the bottom
 

747
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,240
extender on the top one on the bottom
and then the sideways one to push it

748
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,250
and then the sideways one to push it
 

749
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,610
and then the sideways one to push it
sideways because we're dealing with

750
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:22,620
sideways because we're dealing with
 

751
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,340
sideways because we're dealing with
exactly five blocks of wood here or less

752
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,350
exactly five blocks of wood here or less
 

753
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,830
exactly five blocks of wood here or less
this should work out pretty good um

754
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
this should work out pretty good um
 

755
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,870
this should work out pretty good um
let's try it out so put this here put

756
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
let's try it out so put this here put
 

757
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,840
let's try it out so put this here put
this here put this here do

758
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:35,850
this here put this here do
 

759
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,770
this here put this here do
oh wait yeah that's right we're gonna

760
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:39,780
oh wait yeah that's right we're gonna
 

761
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,720
oh wait yeah that's right we're gonna
have to move all this stuff down one

762
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:41,730
have to move all this stuff down one
 

763
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,250
have to move all this stuff down one
block though everything we built over

764
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,260
block though everything we built over
 

765
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,930
block though everything we built over
here ah lame I hate when that happens

766
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:47,940
here ah lame I hate when that happens
 

767
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,690
here ah lame I hate when that happens
down and I think in one this is where

768
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:50,700
down and I think in one this is where
 

769
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,260
down and I think in one this is where
the new dirt block should go it was over

770
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,270
the new dirt block should go it was over
 

771
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,760
the new dirt block should go it was over
it was over here before so we got to

772
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:58,770
it was over here before so we got to
 

773
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,799
it was over here before so we got to
move down and and to the right here

774
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:00,809
move down and and to the right here
 

775
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:01,940
move down and and to the right here
otherwise I don't think we're going to

776
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:01,950
otherwise I don't think we're going to
 

777
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,039
otherwise I don't think we're going to
be able to reach it from this pressure

778
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:04,049
be able to reach it from this pressure
 

779
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,180
be able to reach it from this pressure
plate like where we have to stand yeah

780
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,190
plate like where we have to stand yeah
 

781
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,580
plate like where we have to stand yeah
so that's the new plan yeah let's try

782
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:10,590
so that's the new plan yeah let's try
 

783
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,480
so that's the new plan yeah let's try
this out though okay so this is going to

784
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:14,490
this out though okay so this is going to
 

785
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,950
this out though okay so this is going to
be hat this is going to have to be

786
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:15,960
be hat this is going to have to be
 

787
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,230
be hat this is going to have to be
activated five times before we're ready

788
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
activated five times before we're ready
 

789
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,030
activated five times before we're ready
for the next three is the thing but as

790
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,040
for the next three is the thing but as
 

791
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,130
for the next three is the thing but as
you can see seems to do the trick all

792
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,140
you can see seems to do the trick all
 

793
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,539
you can see seems to do the trick all
right the good thing about it is we do

794
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:32,549
right the good thing about it is we do
 

795
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:35,870
right the good thing about it is we do
have furnace protection so that the wood

796
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:35,880
have furnace protection so that the wood
 

797
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,430
have furnace protection so that the wood
isn't going to move any further this

798
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
isn't going to move any further this
 

799
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,590
isn't going to move any further this
direction this these furnaces stop it

800
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
direction this these furnaces stop it
 

801
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,560
direction this these furnaces stop it
from being pushed the downside is we

802
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:42,570
from being pushed the downside is we
 

803
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,270
from being pushed the downside is we
have no way of detecting when it's done

804
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,280
have no way of detecting when it's done
 

805
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,740
have no way of detecting when it's done
like when it's in the state where

806
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:45,750
like when it's in the state where
 

807
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,750
like when it's in the state where
there's no more wood left in in the

808
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
there's no more wood left in in the
 

809
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,330
there's no more wood left in in the
sandwich machine when we're ready for

810
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:50,340
sandwich machine when we're ready for
 

811
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,530
sandwich machine when we're ready for
the next tree so I don't really know how

812
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:54,540
the next tree so I don't really know how
 

813
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,210
the next tree so I don't really know how
to handle that just yet either oh yeah I

814
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,220
to handle that just yet either oh yeah I
 

815
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,680
to handle that just yet either oh yeah I
should probably show you the Redstone

816
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:00,690
should probably show you the Redstone
 

817
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,600
should probably show you the Redstone
for this too just in case some of you

818
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:02,610
for this too just in case some of you
 

819
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,880
for this too just in case some of you
guys are trying to copy this tree farm

820
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:04,890
guys are trying to copy this tree farm
 

821
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,220
guys are trying to copy this tree farm
for some reason you might have a little

822
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,230
for some reason you might have a little
 

823
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,650
for some reason you might have a little
trouble on this so this is a sticky

824
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:09,660
trouble on this so this is a sticky
 

825
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,110
trouble on this so this is a sticky
piston regular piston we've got to tick

826
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,120
piston regular piston we've got to tick
 

827
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,510
piston regular piston we've got to tick
delay down here going to the bottom one

828
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:16,520
delay down here going to the bottom one
 

829
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,960
delay down here going to the bottom one
goes up we got one ticker over there and

830
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:19,970
goes up we got one ticker over there and
 

831
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,230
goes up we got one ticker over there and
it goes up here we activate the power

832
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
it goes up here we activate the power
 

833
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,299
it goes up here we activate the power
from down down below here this is the

834
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:26,309
from down down below here this is the
 

835
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,780
from down down below here this is the
button we pressed okay so it goes across

836
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:29,790
button we pressed okay so it goes across
 

837
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,039
button we pressed okay so it goes across
and that's a one tick the leg goes up

838
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:34,049
and that's a one tick the leg goes up
 

839
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,860
and that's a one tick the leg goes up
and then down to the sideways one with a

840
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:36,870
and then down to the sideways one with a
 

841
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,720
and then down to the sideways one with a
4 tick delay and up to the top there

842
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:40,730
4 tick delay and up to the top there
 

843
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,700
4 tick delay and up to the top there
this will stack up real quick I think

844
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:43,710
this will stack up real quick I think
 

845
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,000
this will stack up real quick I think
this is on one yeah it just climbs up

846
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,010
this is on one yeah it just climbs up
 

847
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,610
this is on one yeah it just climbs up
here one tick delay to the top piston

848
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:49,620
here one tick delay to the top piston
 

849
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,799
here one tick delay to the top piston
and I got furnaces on the top and bottom

850
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:51,809
and I got furnaces on the top and bottom
 

851
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,100
and I got furnaces on the top and bottom
here so these don't move either aha

852
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,110
here so these don't move either aha
 

853
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,190
here so these don't move either aha
alright so I moved everything guys and

854
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,200
alright so I moved everything guys and
 

855
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,789
alright so I moved everything guys and
rebuilt it all that that sucked but I

856
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:01,799
rebuilt it all that that sucked but I
 

857
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,430
rebuilt it all that that sucked but I
got it done I kept like rebuilding it

858
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:04,440
got it done I kept like rebuilding it
 

859
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,350
got it done I kept like rebuilding it
incorrectly and then I had to redo it

860
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,360
incorrectly and then I had to redo it
 

861
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,240
incorrectly and then I had to redo it
and redo it and oh my goodness I did

862
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,250
and redo it and oh my goodness I did
 

863
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,800
and redo it and oh my goodness I did
ended up tearing everything down like I

864
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:10,810
ended up tearing everything down like I
 

865
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,290
ended up tearing everything down like I
tried to like just shift everything over

866
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:13,300
tried to like just shift everything over
 

867
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,220
tried to like just shift everything over
and somehow I messed up so I just tore

868
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,230
and somehow I messed up so I just tore
 

869
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,820
and somehow I messed up so I just tore
it all down redid it and I think you

870
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:20,830
it all down redid it and I think you
 

871
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,410
it all down redid it and I think you
know we got the heart of this thing done

872
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:22,420
know we got the heart of this thing done
 

873
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,880
know we got the heart of this thing done
right only thing that's missing is the

874
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:25,890
right only thing that's missing is the
 

875
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,760
right only thing that's missing is the
the leaf cutter the leaf chopper thing

876
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:29,770
the leaf cutter the leaf chopper thing
 

877
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,200
the leaf cutter the leaf chopper thing
that crushes the leaves so we get

878
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,210
that crushes the leaves so we get
 

879
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,030
that crushes the leaves so we get
saplings and we need some way of

880
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,040
saplings and we need some way of
 

881
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,970
saplings and we need some way of
delivering one sapling to us every time

882
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:35,980
delivering one sapling to us every time
 

883
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,330
delivering one sapling to us every time
we grow a tree so that we don't run out

884
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:39,340
we grow a tree so that we don't run out
 

885
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,940
we grow a tree so that we don't run out
when we're afk probably just need a

886
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:41,950
when we're afk probably just need a
 

887
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,800
when we're afk probably just need a
dropper to do that honestly pretty

888
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:43,810
dropper to do that honestly pretty
 

889
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,050
dropper to do that honestly pretty
simple thing that the leaf crusher is

890
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,060
simple thing that the leaf crusher is
 

891
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,880
simple thing that the leaf crusher is
going to be the toughest thing to do on

892
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:47,890
going to be the toughest thing to do on
 

893
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,530
going to be the toughest thing to do on
this yet and I'm happy with this like

894
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:52,540
this yet and I'm happy with this like
 

895
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,870
this yet and I'm happy with this like
like this for what its gonna do it

896
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
like this for what its gonna do it
 

897
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,430
like this for what its gonna do it
really doesn't take up a lot of space

898
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:56,440
really doesn't take up a lot of space
 

899
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,300
really doesn't take up a lot of space
right I think that's pretty cool but

900
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,310
right I think that's pretty cool but
 

901
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,510
right I think that's pretty cool but
talk is cheap let's try it out see if it

902
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
talk is cheap let's try it out see if it
 

903
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,200
talk is cheap let's try it out see if it
actually works

904
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,210
actually works
 

905
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,420
actually works
oh yeah and I connected this clock we're

906
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,430
oh yeah and I connected this clock we're
 

907
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,100
oh yeah and I connected this clock we're
going to try this I connected this clock

908
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,110
going to try this I connected this clock
 

909
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:14,040
going to try this I connected this clock
thing to this sandwich maker all right

910
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,050
thing to this sandwich maker all right
 

911
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,760
thing to this sandwich maker all right
with a little bit of a delay so every

912
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:17,770
with a little bit of a delay so every
 

913
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,920
with a little bit of a delay so every
time this tries to advance a block

914
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:19,930
time this tries to advance a block
 

915
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,080
time this tries to advance a block
forward it's going to try to move that

916
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,090
forward it's going to try to move that
 

917
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,290
forward it's going to try to move that
one forward as well and it's it's like

918
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,300
one forward as well and it's it's like
 

919
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,250
one forward as well and it's it's like
vacuuming the the tree towards the gas

920
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:29,260
vacuuming the the tree towards the gas
 

921
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,140
vacuuming the the tree towards the gas
shooter thinger anyways I connected this

922
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,150
shooter thinger anyways I connected this
 

923
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,540
shooter thinger anyways I connected this
repeater to the pressure plate we stand

924
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:36,550
repeater to the pressure plate we stand
 

925
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,430
repeater to the pressure plate we stand
on and also oh that's not going to work

926
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
on and also oh that's not going to work
 

927
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,810
on and also oh that's not going to work
darn this redstone is facing the wrong

928
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:42,820
darn this redstone is facing the wrong
 

929
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,680
darn this redstone is facing the wrong
way let's take this out then put that in

930
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:46,690
way let's take this out then put that in
 

931
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,520
way let's take this out then put that in
there okay that opens the trapdoor off

932
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,530
there okay that opens the trapdoor off
 

933
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,660
there okay that opens the trapdoor off
this way then it goes to this to our

934
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:53,670
this way then it goes to this to our
 

935
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,210
this way then it goes to this to our
bone meal dispenser and the detector

936
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:57,220
bone meal dispenser and the detector
 

937
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,200
bone meal dispenser and the detector
thing down there yeah let's try it let's

938
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,210
thing down there yeah let's try it let's
 

939
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,350
thing down there yeah let's try it let's
just try it we'll see what happens grab

940
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:04,360
just try it we'll see what happens grab
 

941
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,380
just try it we'll see what happens grab

946
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
hey we're safe I hope and can we reach
 

947
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,520
hey we're safe I hope and can we reach
we can reach oh no we got leaves in our

948
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:21,530
we can reach oh no we got leaves in our
 

949
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,580
we can reach oh no we got leaves in our
face uh-oh

950
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,590
face uh-oh
 

951
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,680
face uh-oh
that might be a problem well I could

952
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:32,690
that might be a problem well I could
 

953
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,450
that might be a problem well I could
just put like a sign or something that

954
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:34,460
just put like a sign or something that
 

955
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,990
just put like a sign or something that
would block it yeah cuz if that happens

956
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
would block it yeah cuz if that happens
 

957
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,600
would block it yeah cuz if that happens
then we can't replay kind of an issue so

958
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,610
then we can't replay kind of an issue so
 

959
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,970
then we can't replay kind of an issue so
where's it at right now has it reached

960
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:45,980
where's it at right now has it reached
 

961
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:54,640
where's it at right now has it reached
the thing here not yet okay oh we have

962
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:54,650
the thing here not yet okay oh we have
 

963
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:01,720
the thing here not yet okay oh we have
branch branches are bad I plant one more

964
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:01,730
branch branches are bad I plant one more
 

965
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,990
branch branches are bad I plant one more
see what happens it's still good

966
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,000
see what happens it's still good
 

967
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,890
see what happens it's still good
actually uh yeah it's gonna jam I don't

968
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:11,900
actually uh yeah it's gonna jam I don't
 

969
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,690
actually uh yeah it's gonna jam I don't
actually have a way of making this go oh

970
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:18,700

 

971
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,720

oh I guess fire is still an issue need

972
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:22,730
oh I guess fire is still an issue need
 

973
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,160
oh I guess fire is still an issue need
more trapdoors so I think that failed

974
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,170
more trapdoors so I think that failed
 

975
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,350
more trapdoors so I think that failed
because I forgot to connect the tree

976
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
because I forgot to connect the tree
 

977
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,140
because I forgot to connect the tree
growth detector thingamajig over here to

978
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,150
growth detector thingamajig over here to
 

979
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,650
growth detector thingamajig over here to
the sandwich maker part of this they

980
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:35,660
the sandwich maker part of this they
 

981
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,440
the sandwich maker part of this they
kick off the chain reaction I think that

982
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:38,450
kick off the chain reaction I think that
 

983
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,060
kick off the chain reaction I think that
has to happen so we have to connect it

984
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,070
has to happen so we have to connect it
 

985
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,400
has to happen so we have to connect it
to over here somewhere so I'm going to

986
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,410
to over here somewhere so I'm going to
 

987
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:50,250
to over here somewhere so I'm going to
run a wire between the two yeah perfect

988
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:50,260
run a wire between the two yeah perfect
 

989
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:58,390
run a wire between the two yeah perfect
Rapids if we delay this Oh

990
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400

 

991
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,820

is that good that might be bad I'm not

992
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:06,830
is that good that might be bad I'm not
 

993
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,170
is that good that might be bad I'm not
sure if that's a good or bad it might

994
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:08,180
sure if that's a good or bad it might
 

995
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,620
sure if that's a good or bad it might
have locked my whole thing yeah well

996
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:11,630
have locked my whole thing yeah well
 

997
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,400
have locked my whole thing yeah well
here's the here's the test if we take

998
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,410
here's the here's the test if we take
 

999
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,970
here's the here's the test if we take
one of these out okay it did retract

1000
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:18,980
one of these out okay it did retract
 

1001
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,640
one of these out okay it did retract
everything retracted right oh we still

1002
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:24,650
everything retracted right oh we still
 

1003
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,680
everything retracted right oh we still
have a block here though okay let's go

1004
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:29,690
have a block here though okay let's go
 

1005
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,690
have a block here though okay let's go
again here guys I just tried one tree

1006
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:31,700
again here guys I just tried one tree
 

1007
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,169
again here guys I just tried one tree
and it worked in it it was amazing

1008
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:34,179
and it worked in it it was amazing
 

1009
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,700
and it worked in it it was amazing
let's see if we can keep it going so we

1010
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:36,710
let's see if we can keep it going so we
 

1011
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,640
let's see if we can keep it going so we
have eight logs in there right now I put

1012
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:39,650
have eight logs in there right now I put
 

1013
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,890
have eight logs in there right now I put
a trapdoor there I really want to put a

1014
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:41,900
a trapdoor there I really want to put a
 

1015
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,840
a trapdoor there I really want to put a
trapdoor here so it stops the leaves

1016
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:43,850
trapdoor here so it stops the leaves
 

1017
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,640
trapdoor here so it stops the leaves
from spawning in our face but it gets

1018
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:48,650
from spawning in our face but it gets
 

1019
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,440
from spawning in our face but it gets
triggered by this pressure plate I don't

1020
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:50,450
triggered by this pressure plate I don't
 

1021
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,650
triggered by this pressure plate I don't
know if I like that let's try it without

1022
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:53,660
know if I like that let's try it without
 

1023
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:00,010
know if I like that let's try it without
it right now okay let's do the thing

1024
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,020
it right now okay let's do the thing
 

1025
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:06,610
it right now okay let's do the thing
here okay here's our big moments steel

1026
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:06,620
here okay here's our big moments steel
 

1027
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,400
here okay here's our big moments steel
tree look we'll just do one tree nothing

1028
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,410
tree look we'll just do one tree nothing
 

1029
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,330
tree look we'll just do one tree nothing
crazy

1030
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:11,340
crazy
 

1031
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,360
crazy
yeah it still grew in our face can't see

1032
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,370
yeah it still grew in our face can't see
 

1033
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,129
yeah it still grew in our face can't see
anything but you see that is activating

1034
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:18,139
anything but you see that is activating
 

1035
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:20,960
anything but you see that is activating
and get activated all the way like we

1036
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:20,970
and get activated all the way like we
 

1037
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:28,220
and get activated all the way like we
want let's try it again yep see ya it is

1038
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,230
want let's try it again yep see ya it is
 

1039
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:37,970
want let's try it again yep see ya it is
gone it is going oh man okay we just

1040
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:37,980
gone it is going oh man okay we just
 

1041
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,149
gone it is going oh man okay we just
gotta get these leaves out of our face

1042
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
gotta get these leaves out of our face
 

1043
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,009
gotta get these leaves out of our face
that's the only flaw at the moment it's

1044
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:46,019
that's the only flaw at the moment it's
 

1045
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,100
that's the only flaw at the moment it's
not jamming I'm amazed I did not think

1046
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,110
not jamming I'm amazed I did not think
 

1047
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,739
not jamming I'm amazed I did not think
it was going to work the first tried it

1048
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:51,749
it was going to work the first tried it
 

1049
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:53,299
it was going to work the first tried it
didn't work the first try but like I

1050
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:53,309
didn't work the first try but like I
 

1051
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,759
didn't work the first try but like I
thought it was gonna take a lot more

1052
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:54,769
thought it was gonna take a lot more
 

1053
00:26:54,769 --> 00:27:01,399
thought it was gonna take a lot more
fiddling around with this 23 alright how

1054
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:01,409
fiddling around with this 23 alright how
 

1055
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:04,359
fiddling around with this 23 alright how
do we stop delete these leaves guys

1056
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:04,369
do we stop delete these leaves guys
 

1057
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:10,609
do we stop delete these leaves guys
they're so annoying um I try to assign

1058
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:10,619
they're so annoying um I try to assign
 

1059
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:13,639
they're so annoying um I try to assign
the thing is the sign really gets in our

1060
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:13,649
the thing is the sign really gets in our
 

1061
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:15,139
the thing is the sign really gets in our
face as well like if we put one there

1062
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:15,149
face as well like if we put one there
 

1063
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:17,749
face as well like if we put one there
nah we have to have like a sideways

1064
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:17,759
nah we have to have like a sideways
 

1065
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,899
nah we have to have like a sideways
thing so even if the trap door opens

1066
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:20,909
thing so even if the trap door opens
 

1067
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,600
thing so even if the trap door opens
sideways like this I think it's fine

1068
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:22,610
sideways like this I think it's fine
 

1069
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,529
sideways like this I think it's fine
probably want to go in the other way

1070
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:24,539
probably want to go in the other way
 

1071
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,359
probably want to go in the other way
though so we can we and look over that

1072
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:26,369
though so we can we and look over that
 

1073
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:29,869
though so we can we and look over that
direction at stop the leaves from going

1074
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:29,879
direction at stop the leaves from going
 

1075
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:32,160
direction at stop the leaves from going
in our face

1076
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,170
in our face
 

1077
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,720
in our face
but we still have the spotting in our

1078
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:34,730
but we still have the spotting in our
 

1079
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,530
but we still have the spotting in our
path here

1080
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:35,540
path here
 

1081
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:41,530
path here
I wonder if oh we got to be careful it

1082
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:41,540
I wonder if oh we got to be careful it
 

1083
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,710
I wonder if oh we got to be careful it
might not keep up as well

1084
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:43,720
might not keep up as well
 

1085
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:54,420
might not keep up as well
if that happens another tree will grow

1086
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:54,430

 

1087
00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:00,330

might not be fast enough at the moment

1088
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,340

 

1089
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,040

or we have to add some way of making it

1090
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,050
or we have to add some way of making it
 

1091
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,280
or we have to add some way of making it
wait because we're going to be afk we

1092
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,290
wait because we're going to be afk we
 

1093
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,930
wait because we're going to be afk we
can't like choose one can place the

1094
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:07,940
can't like choose one can place the
 

1095
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:21,430
can't like choose one can place the
sapling here oh oh oh no alright alright

1096
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
sapling here oh oh oh no alright alright
 

1097
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,480
sapling here oh oh oh no alright alright
so we we got it kind of working kind of

1098
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,490
so we we got it kind of working kind of
 

1099
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,100
so we we got it kind of working kind of
works needs some work yet though well

1100
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,110
works needs some work yet though well
 

1101
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,170
works needs some work yet though well
anyways guys we're gonna have to call

1102
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,180

that out now the redstone runs three

1174
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:02,420
that out now the redstone runs three
 

1175
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,660
that out now the redstone runs three
blocks instead of just two

1176
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:04,670
blocks instead of just two
 

1177
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:09,850
blocks instead of just two
um and now it holds 41 items in here

um and now it holds 41 items in here
 

1179
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,540

fills up to 64 it it will not send the

1182
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:16,520
fills up to 64 it it will not send the
 

1183
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,770
fills up to 64 it it will not send the
signal for blocks which is the key to

1184
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:20,780
signal for blocks which is the key to
 

1185
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,840
signal for blocks which is the key to
this so no matter how full we fill it

1186
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:22,850
this so no matter how full we fill it
 

1187
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,330
this so no matter how full we fill it

items we throw into the Nexus if we

1198
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:40,400
items we throw into the Nexus if we
 

1199
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,980
items we throw into the Nexus if we
overfill the chest it's not going to

1200
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:41,990
overfill the chest it's not going to
 

1201
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,800
overfill the chest it's not going to
mess up and also today I added in an

1202
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:44,810
mess up and also today I added in an
 

1203
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,440
mess up and also today I added in an
overflow thing here it looks really

1204
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,450
overflow thing here it looks really
 

1205
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,380
overflow thing here it looks really
nasty at the moment but yeah if

1206
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:50,390
nasty at the moment but yeah if
 

1207
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,900
nasty at the moment but yeah if
something can't get filtered into the

1208
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:52,910
something can't get filtered into the
 

1209
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,350
something can't get filtered into the
system it will end up in that chest so

1210
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:56,360
system it will end up in that chest so
 

1211
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,240
system it will end up in that chest so
those will eventually end up here after

1212
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,250
those will eventually end up here after
 

1213
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,070
those will eventually end up here after
