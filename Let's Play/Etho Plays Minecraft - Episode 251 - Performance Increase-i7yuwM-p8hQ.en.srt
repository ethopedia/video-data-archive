and then have that go in front of me and
 

101
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,910
and then have that go in front of me and
then the space between the chicken cart

102
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:06,920
then the space between the chicken cart
 

103
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,540
then the space between the chicken cart
and my carts will tell where where to

104
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,550
and my carts will tell where where to
 

105
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,440
and my carts will tell where where to
stop at my stations that was kind of the

106

stop at my stations that was kind of the
 

107
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,860
stop at my stations that was kind of the
plan with this but was I was working on

108
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:17,870
plan with this but was I was working on
 

109
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,600
plan with this but was I was working on
that just before the redstone update

110
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,610
that just before the redstone update
 

111
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,130
that just before the redstone update
really took off and people kind of just

112
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,140
really took off and people kind of just
 

113
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,340
really took off and people kind of just
told me to wait before I start getting

114
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,350
told me to wait before I start getting
 

115
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,509
told me to wait before I start getting
too deep into here because it would

116
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
too deep into here because it would
 

117
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,240
too deep into here because it would
really really suck if I had if I put all

118
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,250
really really suck if I had if I put all
 

119
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,729
really really suck if I had if I put all
this work into it and then was not happy

120
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:30,739
this work into it and then was not happy
 

121
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,259
this work into it and then was not happy
with it afterwards and that was a good

122
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:32,269
with it afterwards and that was a good
 

123
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,380
with it afterwards and that was a good
call because yeah there's there's new

124
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,390
call because yeah there's there's new
 

125
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,240
call because yeah there's there's new
and better ways of doing what I wanted

and better ways of doing what I wanted
 

127
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,759
and better ways of doing what I wanted
to do now let the redstone update has

128
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:39,769
to do now let the redstone update has

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,390
determine where to stop instead I can
 

147
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,430
determine where to stop instead I can
encode information in my rail line by

148
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:11,440
encode information in my rail line by
 

149
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,270
encode information in my rail line by
like each star

150
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
like each star

down my rail line I didn't have a unique
 

153
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,500
down my rail line I didn't have a unique
item ID so if I have hoppers under the

154
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,510
item ID so if I have hoppers under the
 

155
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,590
item ID so if I have hoppers under the
rail and I put an item in the storage

156
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
rail and I put an item in the storage
 

157
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,010
rail and I put an item in the storage
carts only if it matches the items in

158
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,020
carts only if it matches the items in
 

159
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,440
carts only if it matches the items in
the hopper I have below will it send out

160
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,450
the hopper I have below will it send out
 

161
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,680
the hopper I have below will it send out
a pulse and tell tell my station that

162
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:32,690
a pulse and tell tell my station that
 

163
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,760
a pulse and tell tell my station that
I'm going to that one sort of you know

164
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:36,770
I'm going to that one sort of you know
 

165
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,010
I'm going to that one sort of you know
what I mean I didn't explain that too

166
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,020
what I mean I didn't explain that too
 

167
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,670
what I mean I didn't explain that too
well did I oh well I tried yeah we can

168
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:42,680
well did I oh well I tried yeah we can
 

169
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,340
well did I oh well I tried yeah we can
use we can have like so many different

170
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,350
use we can have like so many different
 

171
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,380
use we can have like so many different
stops with my new plan here just using

172
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,390
stops with my new plan here just using
 

173
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,730
stops with my new plan here just using
hoppers and each unique item we use can

174
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:51,740
hoppers and each unique item we use can
 

175
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,770
hoppers and each unique item we use can
represent a different stop in our track

176
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:53,780
represent a different stop in our track
 

177
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,000
represent a different stop in our track
and then also since there's going to be

178
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,010
and then also since there's going to be
 

179
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,820
and then also since there's going to be
a problem with mine carts accumulating

180
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:00,830
a problem with mine carts accumulating
 

181
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,600
a problem with mine carts accumulating
it at different stops and and not being

182
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:04,610
it at different stops and and not being
 

183
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,540
it at different stops and and not being
able to distribute them properly another

184
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:07,550
able to distribute them properly another
 

185
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,100
able to distribute them properly another
thing we can do is put extra storage

186
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,110
thing we can do is put extra storage
 

187
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,409
thing we can do is put extra storage
mine carts inside of our storage

188
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:14,419
mine carts inside of our storage
 

189
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:22,960
mine carts inside of our storage
minecart oh that's right and and have

190
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:22,970
minecart oh that's right and and have
 

191
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,050
minecart oh that's right and and have
those get distributed as well as it

192
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,060
those get distributed as well as it
 

193
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,000
those get distributed as well as it
moves from station to station if in if a

194
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,010
moves from station to station if in if a
 

195
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,800
moves from station to station if in if a
station needs it it can drop some off as

196
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:32,810
station needs it it can drop some off as
 

197
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,120
station needs it it can drop some off as
it goes by but yeah that's kind of a

198
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,130
it goes by but yeah that's kind of a
 

199
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,560
it goes by but yeah that's kind of a
plan but the problem with doing it this

200
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,570
plan but the problem with doing it this
 

201
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,409
plan but the problem with doing it this
way is I'm going to have to use gold or

202
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:41,419
way is I'm going to have to use gold or
 

203
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,960
way is I'm going to have to use gold or
power rails instead of normal rails and

204
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:43,970
power rails instead of normal rails and
 

205
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,690
power rails instead of normal rails and
I just want to do a quick test before we

206
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:46,700
I just want to do a quick test before we
 

207
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,130
I just want to do a quick test before we
get going with the plan to see if I can

208
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,140
get going with the plan to see if I can
 

209
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,290
get going with the plan to see if I can
get away with skipping on the power

210
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:53,300
get away with skipping on the power
 

211
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,000
get away with skipping on the power
rails a little bit so I don't have to do

212
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,010
rails a little bit so I don't have to do
 

213
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,060
rails a little bit so I don't have to do
it solid power rails all the way down

214
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,070
it solid power rails all the way down
 

215
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:04,020
it solid power rails all the way down
try space it out and see how it compares

216
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,030

 

217
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,490

next be nom-nom-nom-nom-nom

218
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:08,500

 

219
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,610

hmm

220
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:09,620
hmm
 

221
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,200
hmm
so you're saying Jeff did it huh Jeff

222
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,210
so you're saying Jeff did it huh Jeff
 

223
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:20,460
so you're saying Jeff did it huh Jeff
did it he looks innocent but that guy I

224
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,470
did it he looks innocent but that guy I
 

225
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,140
did it he looks innocent but that guy I
don't trust that guy anymore all right

226
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,150
don't trust that guy anymore all right
 

227
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,190
don't trust that guy anymore all right
well at least it's

228
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,200
well at least it's
 

229
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,740
well at least it's
back to normal now we know what's going

230
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:29,750
back to normal now we know what's going
 

231
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:37,480
back to normal now we know what's going
on all right here we go this is our

232
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,490
on all right here we go this is our
 

233
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,790
on all right here we go this is our
experiment we are trying to see just how

234
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:39,800
experiment we are trying to see just how
 

235
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,860
experiment we are trying to see just how
cheaply candy with power rails because

236
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:41,870
cheaply candy with power rails because
 

237
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,010
cheaply candy with power rails because
they're kind of expensive unique gold to

238
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,020
they're kind of expensive unique gold to
 

239
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,050
they're kind of expensive unique gold to
make power rails so we want to use as

240
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,060
make power rails so we want to use as
 

241
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,410
make power rails so we want to use as
few as possible I know it'll work if I

242
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:50,420
few as possible I know it'll work if I
 

243
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,510
few as possible I know it'll work if I
have solid power rails all along now I

244
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:52,520
have solid power rails all along now I
 

245
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,550
have solid power rails all along now I
want to see if I can have one every

246
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
want to see if I can have one every
 

247
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,590
want to see if I can have one every
second track so the idea is to have one

248
00:06:59,590 --> 00:06:59,600
second track so the idea is to have one
 

249
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,300
second track so the idea is to have one
empty cart and I'll be in the other one

250
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,310
empty cart and I'll be in the other one
 

251
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:07,990
empty cart and I'll be in the other one
and see if it can keep up oh that looks

252
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
and see if it can keep up oh that looks
 

253
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
and see if it can keep up oh that looks
good

254
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,250
good
 

255
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,070
good
it might even be a little bit faster

256
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
it might even be a little bit faster
 

257
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,160
it might even be a little bit faster
than me let's ride this for a little bit

258
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,170
than me let's ride this for a little bit
 

259
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,370
than me let's ride this for a little bit
see if it gets ahead of us I think it is

260
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:18,380
see if it gets ahead of us I think it is
 

261
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,250
see if it gets ahead of us I think it is
actually here than me

262
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,260

 

263
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,410

because technically I think this should

264
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:25,420
because technically I think this should
 

265
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,290
because technically I think this should
be slower than us

266
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,300

 

267
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,600

that is really weird I was not expecting

268
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:32,610
that is really weird I was not expecting
 

269
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,920
that is really weird I was not expecting
that

270
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:36,930

 

271
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,300

yeah okay so we can actually skip every

272
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,310
yeah okay so we can actually skip every
 

273
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,940
yeah okay so we can actually skip every
every second track here for sure I'm

274
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:44,950
every second track here for sure I'm
 

275
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,580
every second track here for sure I'm
going to change it for every third let's

276
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:47,590
going to change it for every third let's
 

277
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,400
going to change it for every third let's
even get away with that okay we're going

278
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,410
even get away with that okay we're going
 

279
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,370
even get away with that okay we're going
down to every third block now we're

280
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,380
down to every third block now we're
 

281
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,930
down to every third block now we're
going to keep doing this until we notice

282
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:57,940
going to keep doing this until we notice
 

283
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,960
going to keep doing this until we notice
the empty car going slower than us

284
00:07:59,960 --> 00:07:59,970
the empty car going slower than us
 

285
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,220
the empty car going slower than us
assuming that happens maybe something

286
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,230
assuming that happens maybe something
 

287
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,410
assuming that happens maybe something
change with minecarts again it's keeping

288
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:07,420
change with minecarts again it's keeping
 

289
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,040
change with minecarts again it's keeping
up pretty good

290
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,050
up pretty good
 

291
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,070
up pretty good
oh it's like it it's switches going

292
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,080
oh it's like it it's switches going
 

293
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,840
oh it's like it it's switches going
other direction faster than when I'm in

294
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:12,850
other direction faster than when I'm in
 

295
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,720
other direction faster than when I'm in
it because it doesn't doesn't seem like

296
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:15,730
it because it doesn't doesn't seem like
 

297
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,960
it because it doesn't doesn't seem like
it goes all the way up to the Cobble but

298
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:18,970
it goes all the way up to the Cobble but
 

299
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,120
it goes all the way up to the Cobble but
with me it does

300
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,130

 

301
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,340

that's why it's getting a little bit

302
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,350
that's why it's getting a little bit
 

303
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,480
that's why it's getting a little bit
ahead of us otherwise it would be the

304
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,490
ahead of us otherwise it would be the
 

305
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,720
ahead of us otherwise it would be the
same speed-up t-shirt I'm going to

306
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:28,730
same speed-up t-shirt I'm going to
 

307
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,190
same speed-up t-shirt I'm going to
spread it out even further and we are at

308
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
spread it out even further and we are at
 

309
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,580
spread it out even further and we are at
four blocks now this is the turning

310
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,590
four blocks now this is the turning
 

311
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,640
four blocks now this is the turning
point I tried it out already

312
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:38,650
point I tried it out already
 

313
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,880
point I tried it out already
OOP four blocks seems to be too far

314
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:42,890
OOP four blocks seems to be too far
 

315
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:49,150
OOP four blocks seems to be too far
apart now because what happens is keeps

316
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,160
apart now because what happens is keeps
 

317
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,460
apart now because what happens is keeps
up just about but we're getting a little

318
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,470
up just about but we're getting a little
 

319
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,950
up just about but we're getting a little
bit of a ahead of it the only reason it

320
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:53,960
bit of a ahead of it the only reason it
 

321
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,470
bit of a ahead of it the only reason it
kind of stays even with me is because it

322
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
kind of stays even with me is because it
 

323
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,180
kind of stays even with me is because it
turns around faster than us but you can

324
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,190
turns around faster than us but you can
 

325
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,610
turns around faster than us but you can
see I'm slightly gaining on it

326
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:05,620

 

327
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,010

ever ever so slightly so I'll probably

328
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,020
ever ever so slightly so I'll probably
 

329
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,590
ever ever so slightly so I'll probably
just keep it at its three-block distance

330
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
just keep it at its three-block distance
 

331
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,310
just keep it at its three-block distance
between each of them just to be safe but

332
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,320
between each of them just to be safe but
 

333
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
between each of them just to be safe but
that's good to know that's that's a huge

334
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,330
that's good to know that's that's a huge
 

335
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,940
that's good to know that's that's a huge
savings that's like three times less

336
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:20,950
savings that's like three times less
 

337
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,770
savings that's like three times less
power rails will need and I'm trying

338
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:25,780
power rails will need and I'm trying
 

339
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,750
power rails will need and I'm trying
five now just out of curiosity see how

340
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
five now just out of curiosity see how
 

341
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,460
five now just out of curiosity see how
big of a difference it makes keep it up

342
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,470
big of a difference it makes keep it up
 

343
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,140
big of a difference it makes keep it up
oh oh

344
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,150

 

345
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,890

yeah see we have this big initial push

346
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:38,900
yeah see we have this big initial push
 

347
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,660
yeah see we have this big initial push
when we launched it and it keeps up

348
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:40,670
when we launched it and it keeps up
 

349
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,910
when we launched it and it keeps up
until we get like up to here and then

350
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,920
until we get like up to here and then
 

351
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,180
until we get like up to here and then
you can see it falls back way to bits as

352
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,190
you can see it falls back way to bits as
 

353
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,980
you can see it falls back way to bits as
it loses its momentum that's that big

354
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:50,990
it loses its momentum that's that big
 

355
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:57,670
it loses its momentum that's that big
difference now you know what guys when I

356
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
difference now you know what guys when I
 

357
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,530
difference now you know what guys when I
was recording that last little bit I

358
00:09:59,530 --> 00:09:59,540
was recording that last little bit I
 

359
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,810
was recording that last little bit I
noticed something you see those

360
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:01,820
noticed something you see those
 

361
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,900
noticed something you see those
mountains over there you can see them

362
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:04,910
mountains over there you can see them
 

363
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,250
mountains over there you can see them
they're actually visible like they're

364
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,260
they're actually visible like they're
 

365
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,870
they're actually visible like they're
there they're rendered so I'm kind of

366
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:13,880
there they're rendered so I'm kind of
 

367
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,050
there they're rendered so I'm kind of
curious like I've changed things with my

368
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,060
curious like I've changed things with my
 

369
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,970
curious like I've changed things with my
recording here so I'm kind of curious

370
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:18,980
recording here so I'm kind of curious
 

371
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,790
recording here so I'm kind of curious
just to see how well it's doing and you

372
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:21,800
just to see how well it's doing and you
 

373
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,640
just to see how well it's doing and you
can see I relaunched my minecraft here

374
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:24,650
can see I relaunched my minecraft here
 

375
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,940
can see I relaunched my minecraft here
now I'm using the four gigs of RAM my

376
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:27,950
now I'm using the four gigs of RAM my
 

377
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,519
now I'm using the four gigs of RAM my
computer actually has 16 gigs so it's

378
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:30,529
computer actually has 16 gigs so it's
 

379
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,750
computer actually has 16 gigs so it's
not a problem for me to give it more RAM

380
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
not a problem for me to give it more RAM
 

381
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,430
not a problem for me to give it more RAM
because that I never use 16 gigs that's

382
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:36,440
because that I never use 16 gigs that's
 

383
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,170
because that I never use 16 gigs that's
that's way overkill for anything I'm

384
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:38,180
that's way overkill for anything I'm
 

385
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,210
that's way overkill for anything I'm
doing um yeah I think before like when I

386
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,220
doing um yeah I think before like when I
 

387
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,400
doing um yeah I think before like when I
when I would if I was to stand there and

388
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,410
when I would if I was to stand there and
 

389
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,840
when I would if I was to stand there and
record I don't think those would

390
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:46,850
record I don't think those would
 

391
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,300
record I don't think those would
actually load and render so let's go do

392
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,310
actually load and render so let's go do
 

393
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,850
actually load and render so let's go do
a little stress test real quick here and

394
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:51,860
a little stress test real quick here and
 

395
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,240
a little stress test real quick here and
just see how things keep up the other

396
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,250
just see how things keep up the other
 

397
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,500
just see how things keep up the other
thing I'm noticing is when I go to

398
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:56,510
thing I'm noticing is when I go to
 

399
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:01,420
thing I'm noticing is when I go to
record well so that's not loaded see

400
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,430
record well so that's not loaded see
 

401
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,949
record well so that's not loaded see
throw load if we wait here a little bit

402
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
throw load if we wait here a little bit
 

403
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,090
throw load if we wait here a little bit
it might be too far away another thing

404
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,100
it might be too far away another thing
 

405
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,510
it might be too far away another thing
is when I when I go to record now very

406
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:10,520
is when I when I go to record now very
 

407
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,210
is when I when I go to record now very
rarely will it go down to 15 frames that

408
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,220
rarely will it go down to 15 frames that
 

409
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,360
rarely will it go down to 15 frames that
was a big problem was having before like

410
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,370
was a big problem was having before like
 

411
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,430
was a big problem was having before like
I have it locked at 30 but if it can't

412
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,440
I have it locked at 30 but if it can't
 

413
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,840
I have it locked at 30 but if it can't
do 30 it'll do 15 if you can do more

414
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:22,850
do 30 it'll do 15 if you can do more
 

415
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:30,100
do 30 it'll do 15 if you can do more
than 30 and you'll go up to 60 hmm you

416
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,110
than 30 and you'll go up to 60 hmm you
 

417
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,540
than 30 and you'll go up to 60 hmm you
know actually you know what's a good

leave home and then we'll try go the
 

427
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,699
leave home and then we'll try go the
storage room and just try it

428
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:44,709
storage room and just try it
 

429
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,990
storage room and just try it
but yeah I'm definitely noticing a

430
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,000
but yeah I'm definitely noticing a
 

431
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400
but yeah I'm definitely noticing a
difference it seems to be a bit better

432
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,410
difference it seems to be a bit better
 

433
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,850
difference it seems to be a bit better
now

434
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:48,860
now
 

435
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,550
now
when it comes to recording

436
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:53,560
