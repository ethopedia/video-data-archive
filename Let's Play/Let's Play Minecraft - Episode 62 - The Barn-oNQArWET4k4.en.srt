hey guys Etha here thank you for joining
me again um I have been working on this

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:10,920
me again um I have been working on this
 

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,240
me again um I have been working on this
and I've been having a lot of trouble

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,250
and I've been having a lot of trouble
 

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,359
and I've been having a lot of trouble
making it look good so um I thought hey

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:20,369
making it look good so um I thought hey
 

9
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,160
making it look good so um I thought hey
why not start recording now so people

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,170
why not start recording now so people
 

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,259
why not start recording now so people
can watch me fail at building something

12
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:26,269
can watch me fail at building something
 

13
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:31,880
can watch me fail at building something
I'm working on the barn I've finally

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:31,890
I'm working on the barn I've finally
 

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,799
I'm working on the barn I've finally
figured out pretty much how I'm going to

16
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:33,809
figured out pretty much how I'm going to
 

17
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,080
figured out pretty much how I'm going to
do it roughly in my head but obviously

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,090
do it roughly in my head but obviously
 

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,000
do it roughly in my head but obviously
the fine details like this are not going

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,010
the fine details like this are not going
 

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,520
the fine details like this are not going
so well I decided to make it raised off

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:49,530
so well I decided to make it raised off
 

23
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,189
so well I decided to make it raised off
the ground about five blocks or so just

24
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:52,199
the ground about five blocks or so just
 

25
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,740
the ground about five blocks or so just
so it's a little bit to offer a little

26
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:57,750
so it's a little bit to offer a little
 

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,110
so it's a little bit to offer a little
bit of variation and Heights and stuff

28
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
bit of variation and Heights and stuff
 

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,149
bit of variation and Heights and stuff
it's nice but yeah so this is going to

30
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,159
it's nice but yeah so this is going to
 

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,510
it's nice but yeah so this is going to
be a walk way to get up into the barn

32
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
be a walk way to get up into the barn
 

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,190
be a walk way to get up into the barn
I'm going to have a balcony round it and

34
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm going to have a balcony round it and
 

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,969
I'm going to have a balcony round it and
when I say barn I don't mean like a

36
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:15,979
when I say barn I don't mean like a
 

37
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,399
when I say barn I don't mean like a
traditional sense of the word I was

38
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:19,409
traditional sense of the word I was
 

39
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,990
traditional sense of the word I was
thinking about making one of those nice

40
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
thinking about making one of those nice
 

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,200
thinking about making one of those nice
big red barn type buildings like an

42
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,210
big red barn type buildings like an
 

43
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,230
big red barn type buildings like an
actual red barn but I don't know if I am

44
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:27,240
actual red barn but I don't know if I am
 

45
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,270
actual red barn but I don't know if I am
really good enough to do that so I'm

46
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
really good enough to do that so I'm
 

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,810
really good enough to do that so I'm
just going to be basically building a

48
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:32,820
just going to be basically building a
 

49
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,890
just going to be basically building a
wooden building and calling it a barn

50
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:35,900
wooden building and calling it a barn
 

51
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,649
wooden building and calling it a barn
and I'm going to skip ahead to day so we

52
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:39,659
and I'm going to skip ahead to day so we
 

53
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:47,960
and I'm going to skip ahead to day so we
can see all right much better so another

54
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:47,970
can see all right much better so another
 

55
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,490
can see all right much better so another
reason I can't build a red barn is I

56
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,500
reason I can't build a red barn is I
 

57
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,429
reason I can't build a red barn is I
don't have that much red dye or that

58
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:52,439
don't have that much red dye or that
 

59
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,069
don't have that much red dye or that
much wool so probably just be like a

60
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
much wool so probably just be like a
 

61
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,830
much wool so probably just be like a
normal type of building probably a

62
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
normal type of building probably a
 

63
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,200
normal type of building probably a
little bit strange of course I'm

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,210
little bit strange of course I'm
 

65
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,999
little bit strange of course I'm
planning on maybe moving the ocean out

66
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:08,009
planning on maybe moving the ocean out
 

67
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,609
planning on maybe moving the ocean out
further so there's probably going to be

68
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:10,619
further so there's probably going to be
 

69
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,710
further so there's probably going to be
a drop down here and they'll be like

70
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
a drop down here and they'll be like
 

71
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,760
a drop down here and they'll be like
land here

72
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:13,770
land here
 

73
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,340
land here
or something yeah but let's get the work

74
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,350
or something yeah but let's get the work
 

75
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,570
or something yeah but let's get the work
here this is going to be mostly a

76
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:20,580
here this is going to be mostly a
 

77
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:29,030
here this is going to be mostly a
building episode I was trying to mix

78
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
building episode I was trying to mix
 

79
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,950
building episode I was trying to mix
some wood and stuff into this so it one

80
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:30,960
some wood and stuff into this so it one
 

81
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,110
some wood and stuff into this so it one
so it would look a little bit better but

82
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
so it would look a little bit better but
 

83
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
so it would look a little bit better but
I think it's actually making it look

84
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,530
I think it's actually making it look
 

85
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,830
I think it's actually making it look
worse and I've got these windows that

86
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
worse and I've got these windows that
 

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,630
worse and I've got these windows that
stick out like I like now I'm going to

88
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
stick out like I like now I'm going to
 

89
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,900
stick out like I like now I'm going to
be using those a lot I think let's build

90
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:50,910
be using those a lot I think let's build
 

91
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,540
be using those a lot I think let's build
another one actually I think I want one

92
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,550
another one actually I think I want one
 

93
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:04,370
another one actually I think I want one
right here just a small 2x2 window I

94
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:04,380
right here just a small 2x2 window I
 

95
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:15,590
right here just a small 2x2 window I
think okay and maybe one on the other

96
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:15,600
think okay and maybe one on the other
 

97
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,260
think okay and maybe one on the other
side too would be nice this is gonna be

98
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,270
side too would be nice this is gonna be
 

99
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,820
side too would be nice this is gonna be
like a building episode I don't know if

100
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:19,830
like a building episode I don't know if
 

101
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:36,190
like a building episode I don't know if
I set that already oops yeah okay I

102
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,200
I set that already oops yeah okay I
 

103
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,440
I set that already oops yeah okay I
don't know if I should you know I think

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,450
don't know if I should you know I think
 

105
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,960
don't know if I should you know I think
I'm just going to build out a solid

106
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm just going to build out a solid
 

107
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,970
I'm just going to build out a solid
planks because mixing these two is not

108
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:46,980
planks because mixing these two is not
 

109
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,390
planks because mixing these two is not
working out for me too well that's kind

110
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,400
working out for me too well that's kind
 

111
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,890
working out for me too well that's kind
of what I did with my tree farm and

112
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:54,900
of what I did with my tree farm and
 

113
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,380
of what I did with my tree farm and
cactus farm I just made it solid and I

114
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,390
cactus farm I just made it solid and I
 

115
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:17,310
cactus farm I just made it solid and I
don't think it looks too bad

116
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,320

 

117
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:39,670

okay looks pretty weird that's alright I

118
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
okay looks pretty weird that's alright I
 

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,940
okay looks pretty weird that's alright I
can keep tweaking it until it looks

120
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:41,950
can keep tweaking it until it looks
 

121
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,910
can keep tweaking it until it looks
proper I kind of think I need this to

122
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:45,920
proper I kind of think I need this to
 

123
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,120
proper I kind of think I need this to
come out more I'll probably be a glass

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,130
come out more I'll probably be a glass
 

125
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,990
come out more I'll probably be a glass
roof over this and the balcony is going

126
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,000
roof over this and the balcony is going
 

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:10,090
roof over this and the balcony is going
to be here I extend it one more I kind

128
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,100
to be here I extend it one more I kind
 

129
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,890
to be here I extend it one more I kind
of want the balcony at least two or

130
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:11,900
of want the balcony at least two or
 

131
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:20,200
of want the balcony at least two or
three wide okay I'm going to extend it

132
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,210
three wide okay I'm going to extend it
 

133
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:31,530
three wide okay I'm going to extend it
one more and I think I'm going to place

134
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:31,540
one more and I think I'm going to place
 

135
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,010
one more and I think I'm going to place
the building here

136
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,020
the building here
 

137
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,420
the building here
so there might be doors right where I am

138
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,430
so there might be doors right where I am
 

139
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,090
so there might be doors right where I am
here I should probably figure out the

140
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,100
here I should probably figure out the
 

141
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,900
here I should probably figure out the
dimensions I actually have a very

142
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:43,910
dimensions I actually have a very
 

143
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,200
dimensions I actually have a very
specific plan that I haven't tested but

144
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,210
specific plan that I haven't tested but
 

145
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,960
specific plan that I haven't tested but
I think it'll work something I'm going

146
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:49,970
I think it'll work something I'm going
 

147
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,580
I think it'll work something I'm going
to try to do with the sheep and cows I

148
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:53,590
to try to do with the sheep and cows I
 

149
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,990
to try to do with the sheep and cows I
kind of figure out something cool when I

150
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
kind of figure out something cool when I
 

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,970
kind of figure out something cool when I
was building the record while attempting

152
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:57,980
was building the record while attempting
 

153
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,100
was building the record while attempting
to build the record studio a long time

154
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,110
to build the record studio a long time
 

155
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,490
to build the record studio a long time
ago a neat little trick that I'm going

156
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:03,500
ago a neat little trick that I'm going
 

157
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,370
ago a neat little trick that I'm going
to implement into the barn and I'm not

158
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,380
to implement into the barn and I'm not
 

159
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:19,559
to implement into the barn and I'm not
going to tell you what it is just yet

160
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:19,569

 

161
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,550

yeah okay I got to figure out the

162
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,560
yeah okay I got to figure out the
 

163
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,460
yeah okay I got to figure out the
dimensions so I think it's gotta be

164
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,470
dimensions so I think it's gotta be
 

165
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,100
dimensions so I think it's gotta be
minimum 15 by 15 and how does that

166
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,110
minimum 15 by 15 and how does that
 

167
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:42,790
minimum 15 by 15 and how does that
compare with my storage room let's see 1

168
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
compare with my storage room let's see 1
 

169
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,999
compare with my storage room let's see 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

170
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:51,009

 

171
00:06:51,009 --> 00:07:02,279

yeah that's pretty small

172
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:02,289

 

173
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:09,159

maybe I will make it bigger okay well

174
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:09,169
maybe I will make it bigger okay well
 

175
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,740
maybe I will make it bigger okay well
I'm going to lay the base for the floor

176
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:13,750
I'm going to lay the base for the floor
 

177
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,969
I'm going to lay the base for the floor
Allen once I figure out what the

178
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:15,979
Allen once I figure out what the
 

179
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,379
Allen once I figure out what the
dimensions are and I'll do that off

180
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:17,389
dimensions are and I'll do that off
 

181
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,499
dimensions are and I'll do that off
camera and then we will hopefully start

182
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:20,509
camera and then we will hopefully start
 

183
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:32,820
camera and then we will hopefully start
building some stuff in it right okay so

184
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:32,830
building some stuff in it right okay so
 

185
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:41,080
building some stuff in it right okay so
looking pretty ugly yeah you know what I

186
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,090
looking pretty ugly yeah you know what I
 

187
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,269
looking pretty ugly yeah you know what I
like about wood if you ever build

188
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:43,279
like about wood if you ever build
 

189
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:50,850
like about wood if you ever build
something so horrendous so ugly that you

190
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:50,860
something so horrendous so ugly that you
 

191
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,350
something so horrendous so ugly that you
can't believe you built that that it's

192
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
can't believe you built that that it's
 

193
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,240
can't believe you built that that it's
the stupidest thing you've ever seen you

194
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,250
the stupidest thing you've ever seen you
 

195
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:02,050
the stupidest thing you've ever seen you
can just simply light on fire but this

196
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,060
can just simply light on fire but this
 

197
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,050
can just simply light on fire but this
is going to stay as strange and dumb as

198
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,060
is going to stay as strange and dumb as
 

199
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,839
is going to stay as strange and dumb as
it looks I will make it work somehow

200
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:10,849

 

201
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:18,999

because this is how I want it actually

202
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,009

 

203
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,800

this is not going to make a whole lot of

204
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:21,810
this is not going to make a whole lot of
 

205
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,279
this is not going to make a whole lot of
sense

206
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,289
sense
 

207
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,839

347
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,300
it out it looks like a pretty
interesting game a lot of people call it

348
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,310
interesting game a lot of people call it
 

349
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,090
interesting game a lot of people call it
a 2-d minecraft and it is in a lot of

350
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,100
a 2-d minecraft and it is in a lot of
 

351
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,270
a 2-d minecraft and it is in a lot of
ways but it really is a completely

352
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,280
ways but it really is a completely
 

353
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,730
ways but it really is a completely
different game so it's not really fair

354
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:07,740
different game so it's not really fair
 

355
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,160
different game so it's not really fair
to call it that there's lots of things I

356
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,170
to call it that there's lots of things I
 

357
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,460
to call it that there's lots of things I
like about it there's a few things I

358
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,470
like about it there's a few things I
 

359
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,800
like about it there's a few things I
don't quite like about it but all in all

360
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:18,810
don't quite like about it but all in all
 

361
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,480
don't quite like about it but all in all
it looks like a pretty good game it

362
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,490
it looks like a pretty good game it
 

363
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,480
it looks like a pretty good game it
might be a little bit linear like I

364
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:23,490
might be a little bit linear like I
 

365
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,500
might be a little bit linear like I
might get tired of it but overall I

366
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:27,510
might get tired of it but overall I
 

367
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,390
might get tired of it but overall I
think it's definitely worth the 10 bucks

368
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:29,400
think it's definitely worth the 10 bucks
 

369
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,650
think it's definitely worth the 10 bucks
or whatever it it's going to be and I

370
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:33,660
or whatever it it's going to be and I
 

371
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,240
or whatever it it's going to be and I
think I'll have a lot of fun playing it

372
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,250

 

373
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,250

so yeah let me know if you guys think I

374
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,260
so yeah let me know if you guys think I
 

375
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,300
so yeah let me know if you guys think I
should make an LP on it either way I'll

376
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,310
should make an LP on it either way I'll
 

377
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:52,190
should make an LP on it either way I'll
probably buy it and I look forward to

378
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,200
probably buy it and I look forward to
 

379
00:13:52,200 --> 00:14:10,100
probably buy it and I look forward to
playing it 5 ok so this is coming

380
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,110
playing it 5 ok so this is coming
 

381
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,090
playing it 5 ok so this is coming
together I probably won't be all planks

382
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,100
together I probably won't be all planks
 

383
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,800
together I probably won't be all planks
like it is right now I'll probably

384
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:15,810
like it is right now I'll probably
 

385
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,500
like it is right now I'll probably
switch the flooring to include some

386
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,510
switch the flooring to include some
 

387
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:24,020
switch the flooring to include some
sandstone and some logs and it'll look a

388
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,030
sandstone and some logs and it'll look a
 

389
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,020
sandstone and some logs and it'll look a
lot better when it's done I'm sure but

390
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,030
lot better when it's done I'm sure but
 

391
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,390
lot better when it's done I'm sure but
this is just temporary there's going to

392
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,400
this is just temporary there's going to
 

393
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,940
this is just temporary there's going to
be something special on this side here

394
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:31,950
be something special on this side here
 

395
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:41,710
be something special on this side here
so I'm going to leave that for now

396
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:41,720

 

397
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:51,400

it's actually a pretty complicated build

398
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,410

 

399
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:58,960

00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:58,970
one two three four five six seven eight
 

401
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,280
one two three four five six seven eight
don't know why I doubt it I could have

402
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,290
don't know why I doubt it I could have
 

403
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:09,100
don't know why I doubt it I could have
just looked at the numbers one two three

404
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,110
just looked at the numbers one two three
 

405
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:26,509
just looked at the numbers one two three

417
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,970
what any of this stuff is for I'll
probably explain it in a lot of detail

418
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:46,980
probably explain it in a lot of detail
 

419
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,420
probably explain it in a lot of detail
next episode I don't think I really have

420
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:50,430
next episode I don't think I really have
 

421
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,790
next episode I don't think I really have
time to get into it this episode so

422
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
time to get into it this episode so
 

423
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,870
time to get into it this episode so
that's why I'm not really saying

424
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:53,880
that's why I'm not really saying
 

425
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,059
that's why I'm not really saying
anything

426
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:55,069
anything
 

427
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,840
anything
because I kind of want it to be

428
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:56,850

surprised too and to leave you wondering
 

431
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,960
surprised too and to leave you wondering
because this probably looks really

432
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:02,970
because this probably looks really
 

433
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:16,880
because this probably looks really
strange to you at the moment

434
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:16,890

but it might take a while but function
 

471
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,149
but it might take a while but function
comes first

472
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:13,159
comes first
 

473
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:21,039
comes first
and then looks come second and I'm

474
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,049
and then looks come second and I'm
 

475
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,529
and then looks come second and I'm
really hoping my plan with these

00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:23,539
really hoping my plan with these
 

477
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,629
