guys let's get this going here so I went
 

193
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,070
guys let's get this going here so I went
through and I found out where I want to

194
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,080
through and I found out where I want to
 

195
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,710
through and I found out where I want to
position the mushrooms if we have eight

196
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:17,720
position the mushrooms if we have eight
 

197
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,030
position the mushrooms if we have eight
of them so everywhere I put a brown

198

of them so everywhere I put a brown
 

199
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,210
of them so everywhere I put a brown
mushroom is where I marked so that means

200
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,220
mushroom is where I marked so that means
 

201
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,040
mushroom is where I marked so that means
like each of these needs a seven by

202
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,050
like each of these needs a seven by
 

203

whoops 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 so we got to

264
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:10,690
whoops 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 so we got to
 

265
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,379
whoops 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 so we got to
get rid of one one block with so I think

266
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:13,389
get rid of one one block with so I think
 

267
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,290

we're going to put a wall right here and

268
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,300
we're going to put a wall right here and
 

269
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,209
we're going to put a wall right here and
then we'll have to shave this all this

270
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:18,219
then we'll have to shave this all this
 

271
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:22,529
then we'll have to shave this all this
stone down and put a wall here let's

272
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:22,539
stone down and put a wall here let's
 

273
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:27,300
stone down and put a wall here let's
just mark this side that didn't go in

274
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,310
just mark this side that didn't go in
 

275
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,680
just mark this side that didn't go in
the right place now goes here okay

276
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:33,690
the right place now goes here okay
 

277
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,900
the right place now goes here okay
so I had an idea for a look for the

278
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:35,910
so I had an idea for a look for the
 

279
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,910
so I had an idea for a look for the
walls alright let's try that out first

280
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:37,920
walls alright let's try that out first
 

281
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,620
walls alright let's try that out first
or no no no you know what we got to do

282
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:39,630
or no no no you know what we got to do
 

283
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,350
or no no no you know what we got to do
first let's get I brought some grass

284
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
first let's get I brought some grass
 

285
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,850
first let's get I brought some grass
we're gonna try grass blocks and just

286
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:43,860
we're gonna try grass blocks and just
 

287
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,940
we're gonna try grass blocks and just
see what it looks like but we got to got

288
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:46,950
see what it looks like but we got to got
 

289
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,160
see what it looks like but we got to got
to get that growing pretty quickly it

290
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,170
to get that growing pretty quickly it
 

291
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,190
to get that growing pretty quickly it
takes forever start off with that

292
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,200
takes forever start off with that
 

293
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,250
takes forever start off with that
I think the slime farm is above here I

294
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:55,260
I think the slime farm is above here I
 

295
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,040
I think the slime farm is above here I
think that's why we're doing so many

296
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,050
think that's why we're doing so many
 

297
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,800
think that's why we're doing so many
just it's probably going through two or

298
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:00,810
just it's probably going through two or
 

299
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,450
just it's probably going through two or
three slime chunks alright so we get

300
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:05,460
three slime chunks alright so we get
 

301
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,770
three slime chunks alright so we get
some grass going in time it should grow

302
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:09,780
some grass going in time it should grow
 

303
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,560
some grass going in time it should grow
and fill us out if we like it we'll keep

304
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,570
and fill us out if we like it we'll keep
 

305
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,420
and fill us out if we like it we'll keep
it if not we'll do something else over

306
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,430
it if not we'll do something else over
 

307
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,840
it if not we'll do something else over
here it's still desert over here really

308
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:19,850
here it's still desert over here really
 

309
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,670
here it's still desert over here really
over here is forest though yeah that's a

310
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680
over here is forest though yeah that's a
 

311
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,310
over here is forest though yeah that's a
better green ok yeah so the look for the

312
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,320
better green ok yeah so the look for the
 

313
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,260
better green ok yeah so the look for the
walls I want to try out I brought

314
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,270

 

315
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,600

our X now we can finally build for reals

370
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:38,339
our X now we can finally build for reals
 

371
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,739
our X now we can finally build for reals
so I was thinking going up three blocks

372
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:41,749
so I was thinking going up three blocks
 

373
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,519
so I was thinking going up three blocks
let's try it out

374
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:43,529
let's try it out
 

375
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:50,259
let's try it out
Oh much better much much better I guess

376
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:50,269
Oh much better much much better I guess
 

377
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:52,399
Oh much better much much better I guess
yeah I think it's going to have to be an

378
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,409
yeah I think it's going to have to be an
 

379
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,519
yeah I think it's going to have to be an
even number because seven by seven I

380
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:57,529
even number because seven by seven I
 

381
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:03,859
even number because seven by seven I
think we have to have a 2 wide post

382
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:03,869
think we have to have a 2 wide post
 

383
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:08,119
think we have to have a 2 wide post
before the next one let's just see how

384
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:08,129
before the next one let's just see how
 

385
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:08,779
before the next one let's just see how
this looks

386

this looks
 

387
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:17,359
this looks
we can change it to later okay something

here so let's get our ice will probably
 

407
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,879
here so let's get our ice will probably
hide some lighting back here to maybe

408
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:57,889
hide some lighting back here to maybe
 

409

with different materials though so I'm
 

435
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,470
with different materials though so I'm
going to try the dark wood and then we

436
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:57,480
going to try the dark wood and then we
 

437
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,540
going to try the dark wood and then we
might try out planks and maybe a few

438
00:12:59,540 --> 00:12:59,550
might try out planks and maybe a few
 

439
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,250
might try out planks and maybe a few
other things okay I set up a little

440
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,260
other things okay I set up a little
 

441
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,629
other things okay I set up a little
example of what it would look like with

442
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:05,639
example of what it would look like with
 

443
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,569

this fenced area look like it's really

508
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:54,660
this fenced area look like it's really
 

509
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,439
this fenced area look like it's really
bright because the trim is darker than

bright because the trim is darker than
 

511
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:02,600
bright because the trim is darker than
the fence color and that's kind of what

512
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:02,610
the fence color and that's kind of what
 

513
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,329
the fence color and that's kind of what
I'm going for here so we'll do the

514
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:05,339
I'm going for here so we'll do the
 

515
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,360
I'm going for here so we'll do the
spruce planks we might want to change

516
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,370
spruce planks we might want to change
 

517
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,400
spruce planks we might want to change
this also instead of making it too wide

518
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,410
this also instead of making it too wide
 

519
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,800
this also instead of making it too wide
here maybe you make it six blocks for

520
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:12,810
here maybe you make it six blocks for
 

521
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,439
here maybe you make it six blocks for
the fence and then just the one one

522
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:15,449
the fence and then just the one one
 

523
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,970
the fence and then just the one one
white thing

524
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:19,980

 

525
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,450

and the final choice was drumroll please

526
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:23,460
and the final choice was drumroll please
 

527
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,770
and the final choice was drumroll please
did that that the spruce wood there we

528
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:27,780
did that that the spruce wood there we
 

529
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,140
did that that the spruce wood there we
go I think it looks pretty good as

530
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,150
go I think it looks pretty good as
 

531
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,990

messing around with the these pillars in

532
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,000
messing around with the these pillars in
 

533
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,370
messing around with the these pillars in
the middle different stair patterns and

534
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,380
the middle different stair patterns and
 

535
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,490
the middle different stair patterns and
then I decide I should not do that

536
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:39,500
then I decide I should not do that
 

537
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,610
then I decide I should not do that
do you know why because then the fences

538
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:43,620
do you know why because then the fences
 

539
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,430
do you know why because then the fences
don't connect so that was a bad idea but

540
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:46,440
don't connect so that was a bad idea but
 

541
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,980
don't connect so that was a bad idea but
yeah it's worth a shot anyway and I went

542
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:51,990
yeah it's worth a shot anyway and I went
 

543
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,190
yeah it's worth a shot anyway and I went
back behind here I made everything to my

544
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,200
back behind here I made everything to my
 

545
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,790
back behind here I made everything to my
OCD acceptance level I made everything

546
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
OCD acceptance level I made everything
 

547
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
OCD acceptance level I made everything
stone I still have to change these

548
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:00,570
stone I still have to change these
 

549
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,930
stone I still have to change these
torches I probably want to put either

550
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:02,940
torches I probably want to put either
 

551
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,290
torches I probably want to put either
glowing pumpkins or or glowstone or

552
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:06,300
glowing pumpkins or or glowstone or
 

553
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,270
glowing pumpkins or or glowstone or
lamps or something back there that's

554
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,280
lamps or something back there that's
 

555
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,370
lamps or something back there that's
what's giving it its brightness and then

556
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:12,380
what's giving it its brightness and then
 

557
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,770
what's giving it its brightness and then
I'll solid fill this with something to

558
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:15,780
I'll solid fill this with something to
 

559
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,160
I'll solid fill this with something to
this to block gap but yeah I think this

560
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,170
this to block gap but yeah I think this
 

561
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,870
this to block gap but yeah I think this
is going to work out pretty good so

562
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
is going to work out pretty good so
 

563
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,270
is going to work out pretty good so
moving on

564
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,280
moving on
 

565
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
moving on
while there's also the choice of what to

566
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:27,810
while there's also the choice of what to
 

567
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,640
while there's also the choice of what to
do at the end

568
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,650
do at the end
 

569
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,490
do at the end
should we just have two more of those or

570
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,500
should we just have two more of those or
 

571
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,990
should we just have two more of those or
what I don't know

572
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000

 

573
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,730

or we could maybe have that style but

574
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:42,740
or we could maybe have that style but
 

575
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,800
or we could maybe have that style but
maybe change the shape or I don't know

576
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:44,810
maybe change the shape or I don't know
 

577
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,269
maybe change the shape or I don't know
because it's somewhere we got to

578
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:46,279
because it's somewhere we got to
 

579
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,280
because it's somewhere we got to
incorporate bonemeal and dispensers and

580
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,290
incorporate bonemeal and dispensers and
 

581
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,030
incorporate bonemeal and dispensers and
or chess or something and maybe an axe

582
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
or chess or something and maybe an axe
 

583
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,790
or chess or something and maybe an axe
or something to cut down the the

584
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:57,800
or something to cut down the the
 

585
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,210
or something to cut down the the
mushrooms but anyway I have lost all my

586
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,220
mushrooms but anyway I have lost all my
 

587
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,860
mushrooms but anyway I have lost all my
markers because the mushrooms are

588
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:02,870
markers because the mushrooms are
 

589
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,500
markers because the mushrooms are
spreading for some reason and I think

590
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,510
spreading for some reason and I think
 

591
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,590
spreading for some reason and I think
they're up ruining each other so yeah

592
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:10,600
they're up ruining each other so yeah
 

593
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,919
they're up ruining each other so yeah
what I wanted to do with this I think

594
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:14,929
what I wanted to do with this I think
 

595
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,590
what I wanted to do with this I think
this is this is one advantage of only

596
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
this is this is one advantage of only
 

597
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,419
this is this is one advantage of only
making it five blocks I still might make

598
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:19,429
making it five blocks I still might make
 

599
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,429
making it five blocks I still might make
it six but one advantage of making it

600
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
it six but one advantage of making it
 

601
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,020
it six but one advantage of making it
five is I can easily tell where the

602
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,030
five is I can easily tell where the
 

603
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,960
five is I can easily tell where the
center is although I might mark that on

604
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:25,970
center is although I might mark that on
 

605
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,140
center is although I might mark that on
the ground somehow well yeah using a lot

606
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,150
the ground somehow well yeah using a lot
 

607
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,230
the ground somehow well yeah using a lot
the lights here I probably will so I

608
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
the lights here I probably will so I
 

609
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:41,700
the lights here I probably will so I
think what I want to do have lights in

610
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:41,710
think what I want to do have lights in
 

611
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:51,149
think what I want to do have lights in

corner corner highlighter thing around

614
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:55,549
corner corner highlighter thing around
 

615
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:01,510
corner corner highlighter thing around
the mushroom do that for each mushroom

616
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
the mushroom do that for each mushroom
 

617
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,899
the mushroom do that for each mushroom
and then below will light that up with

618
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:04,909
and then below will light that up with
 

619
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,820
and then below will light that up with
redstone torches we would need oh man

620
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:09,830
redstone torches we would need oh man
 

621
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,169

what I don't want to be able to see the
 

685
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:28,340
what I don't want to be able to see the
face of the pumpkin from the other side

686
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,350
face of the pumpkin from the other side
 

687
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,330
face of the pumpkin from the other side
so let's just check that out

688
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:31,340
so let's just check that out
 

689
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,529
so let's just check that out
voices coming together little pretty

690
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:33,539
voices coming together little pretty
 

691
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,350
voices coming together little pretty
quick

692
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,360

 

693
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,759

hopefully he doesn't steal these things

694
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:41,769
hopefully he doesn't steal these things
 

695
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:43,750
hopefully he doesn't steal these things
then why I get the pumpkins and I'm

696
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
then why I get the pumpkins and I'm
 

697
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,250
then why I get the pumpkins and I'm
gonna put the blocks between here could

698
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,260
gonna put the blocks between here could
 

699
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,740
gonna put the blocks between here could
be pretty much covered though I would

700
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:50,750
be pretty much covered though I would
 

701
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:58,200
be pretty much covered though I would
think now you can see them a little bit

702
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,210
think now you can see them a little bit
 

703
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,799
think now you can see them a little bit
it's not bad

704
00:20:59,799 --> 00:20:59,809
it's not bad
 

705
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:04,180
it's not bad
ooh yeah I can live with that I need to

706
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,190
ooh yeah I can live with that I need to
 

707
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,090
ooh yeah I can live with that I need to
do a big glowstone hunt again I'm really

708
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,100
do a big glowstone hunt again I'm really
 

709
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,629
do a big glowstone hunt again I'm really
running who really running low on

710
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:10,639
running who really running low on
 

711
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:16,299
running who really running low on
glowstone way I think I can live with

712
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:16,309
glowstone way I think I can live with
 

713
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:16,659
glowstone way I think I can live with
that

714
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:16,669
that
 

715
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:18,190
that
okay so I'm going to do that for all

716
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,200
okay so I'm going to do that for all
 

717
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,639
okay so I'm going to do that for all
them and I could go find some more lamps

718
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:21,649
them and I could go find some more lamps
 

719
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:25,919
them and I could go find some more lamps
because I just used all my glowstone up

720
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:25,929

 

721
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:29,230

okay I got all the lights and now it

722
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,240
okay I got all the lights and now it
 

723
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,100
okay I got all the lights and now it
might be too many lights I'm not sure

724
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,110
might be too many lights I'm not sure
 

725
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,570
might be too many lights I'm not sure
there's a lot of lamps so that's like

726
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:34,580
there's a lot of lamps so that's like
 

727
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,060
there's a lot of lamps so that's like
over a stack I think well one problem I

728
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,070
over a stack I think well one problem I
 

729
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,889
over a stack I think well one problem I
think we're having here is the grass

730
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:41,899
think we're having here is the grass
 

731
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,389
think we're having here is the grass
doesn't really go well with the lights

732
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:43,399
doesn't really go well with the lights
 

733
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,090
doesn't really go well with the lights
so we should maybe try some other things

734
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,100
so we should maybe try some other things
 

735
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,970
so we should maybe try some other things
I have a little setup here to show you I

736
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:48,980
I have a little setup here to show you I
 

737
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:55,090
I have a little setup here to show you I
have a tea bud switch up there just go

738
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:55,100
have a tea bud switch up there just go
 

739
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,539
have a tea bud switch up there just go
up real quick yeah this is our tea blood

740
00:21:58,539 --> 00:21:58,549
up real quick yeah this is our tea blood
 

741
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:03,549
up real quick yeah this is our tea blood
switch much it's the same same one I

742
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:03,559
switch much it's the same same one I
 

743
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:07,149
switch much it's the same same one I
used for my jukebox ah

744
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:07,159
used for my jukebox ah
 

745
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,980
used for my jukebox ah
and the idea is if a block goes next to

746
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:11,990
and the idea is if a block goes next to
 

747
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,430
and the idea is if a block goes next to
that piston it'll trigger a circuits and

748
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
that piston it'll trigger a circuits and
 

749
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,060
that piston it'll trigger a circuits and
then when it's removed it'll undo it or

750
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,070
then when it's removed it'll undo it or
 

751
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,029
then when it's removed it'll undo it or
whatever so when I grow this mushroom it

752
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:22,039
whatever so when I grow this mushroom it
 

753
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,289
whatever so when I grow this mushroom it
should grow exactly that height so that

754
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:26,299
should grow exactly that height so that
 

755
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,299
should grow exactly that height so that
it will trigger that that piston up

756
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:28,309
it will trigger that that piston up
 

757
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:38,300
it will trigger that that piston up
there Oh hmm

758
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,310

 

759
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,860

hmm might have figured it's still wrong

760
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:42,870
hmm might have figured it's still wrong
 

761
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:51,060
hmm might have figured it's still wrong
it's one short huh mmm what to do about

762
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,070
it's one short huh mmm what to do about
 

763
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,860
it's one short huh mmm what to do about
that I can force the mushroom to grow

764
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:52,870
that I can force the mushroom to grow
 

765
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,200
that I can force the mushroom to grow
taller if I have a block here I don't

766
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,210
taller if I have a block here I don't
 

767
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,820
taller if I have a block here I don't
know if I want it taller this was

768
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:02,830
know if I want it taller this was
 

769
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,730
know if I want it taller this was
unexpected okay my choices are either

770
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:08,740
unexpected okay my choices are either
 

771
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,050
unexpected okay my choices are either
have a block to force it to go taller or

772
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,060
have a block to force it to go taller or
 

773
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:17,580
have a block to force it to go taller or
lower the piston one block problem about

774
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:17,590
lower the piston one block problem about
 

775
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,530
lower the piston one block problem about
trying to lower it one block is well no

776
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:22,540
trying to lower it one block is well no
 

777
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,060
trying to lower it one block is well no
I could pull it off if I really want

778
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,070
I could pull it off if I really want
 

779
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,570
I could pull it off if I really want
it'll look weird though I think I'm not

780
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:30,580
it'll look weird though I think I'm not
 

781
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,590
it'll look weird though I think I'm not
really sure what I'm doing about that

782
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
really sure what I'm doing about that
 

783
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,570
really sure what I'm doing about that
yet but I also wanted to try a change of

784
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:33,580
yet but I also wanted to try a change of
 

785
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,580
yet but I also wanted to try a change of
floor something else I want to do let's

786
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:38,590
floor something else I want to do let's
 

787
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,820
floor something else I want to do let's
try the birch planks on the outside of

788
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:41,830
try the birch planks on the outside of
 

789
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,670
try the birch planks on the outside of
this and then the Spruce ones on the

790
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:44,680
this and then the Spruce ones on the
 

791
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,970
this and then the Spruce ones on the
inside you know what I mean so I have a

792
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:47,980
inside you know what I mean so I have a
 

793
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:55,530
inside you know what I mean so I have a
have a square this going around it look

794
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:55,540

better mixed so yeah I need a block to

832
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:26,660
better mixed so yeah I need a block to
 

833
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,180
better mixed so yeah I need a block to
force the group taller if I want to go

834
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,190
force the group taller if I want to go
 

835
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,340

that way I could I think I'd just use a

836
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,350
that way I could I think I'd just use a
 

837
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,770
that way I could I think I'd just use a
sign even have a sign up there somewhere

838
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:32,780
sign even have a sign up there somewhere
 

839
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,560
sign even have a sign up there somewhere
and that would do the trick

840
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:34,570
and that would do the trick
 

841
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:43,840
and that would do the trick
where else have a piston right here okay
