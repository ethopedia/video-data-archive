stuff to resize the window but if you're

26
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:47,730

not playing the game in full-screen it
 

29
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,069
not playing the game in full-screen it
actually doesn't run as fast because

actually doesn't run as fast because
 

31
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,970
actually doesn't run as fast because
it's not freeing up resources that like

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:24,680
I was going to I'm probably not going to
 

163
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,250
I was going to I'm probably not going to
actually because I don't know where I'm

164
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,260
actually because I don't know where I'm
 

165
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,770
actually because I don't know where I'm
gonna put it for one thing and I don't

166
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:32,780
gonna put it for one thing and I don't
 

167
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,790
gonna put it for one thing and I don't
feel like it really but I will show you

168
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:35,800
feel like it really but I will show you
 

169
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,810
feel like it really but I will show you
I will show you how to move the squids

170
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:42,820
I will show you how to move the squids
 

171
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,120
I will show you how to move the squids
up in case you want to build your own

172
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,130
up in case you want to build your own
 

173
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:55,990
up in case you want to build your own
split farms I was working on digging out

174
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
split farms I was working on digging out
 

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,390
split farms I was working on digging out
more of the collection points and I

176
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
more of the collection points and I
 

177
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,580
more of the collection points and I
found some squids so I did some tests to

178
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:00,590
found some squids so I did some tests to
 

179
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,190
found some squids so I did some tests to
them actually I got a look up to the

180
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,200
them actually I got a look up to the
 

181
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,760
them actually I got a look up to the
ones name one section yeah so like I

182
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:09,770
ones name one section yeah so like I
 

183
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,250
ones name one section yeah so like I
think when squids came out I did this

184
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,260
think when squids came out I did this
 

185
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,970
think when squids came out I did this
test to see if they could go up half

186
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:15,980
test to see if they could go up half
 

187
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,690
test to see if they could go up half
slabs and stairs and they weren't able

188
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:19,700
slabs and stairs and they weren't able
 

189
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,170
slabs and stairs and they weren't able
to they would get stuck like if water

190
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,180
to they would get stuck like if water
 

191
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,110
to they would get stuck like if water
was pushing them towards the half slab

192
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,120
was pushing them towards the half slab
 

193
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,150
was pushing them towards the half slab
or stair to see if they would go up it

194
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
or stair to see if they would go up it
 

195
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,540
or stair to see if they would go up it
they wouldn't then a guy - master one

196
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:34,550
they wouldn't then a guy - master one
 

197
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,410
they wouldn't then a guy - master one
thank you - master he sent me a video

198
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:38,420
thank you - master he sent me a video
 

199
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,290
thank you - master he sent me a video
response telling me to try fences and I

200
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,300
response telling me to try fences and I
 

201
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,140
response telling me to try fences and I
never did because I had no splits around

202
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,150
never did because I had no splits around
 

203
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,760
never did because I had no splits around
and I kind of didn't think it would be

204
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,770
and I kind of didn't think it would be
 

205
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,670
and I kind of didn't think it would be
any different than what I had tried with

206
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
any different than what I had tried with
 

207
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,110
any different than what I had tried with
half slabs and stairs but when I was

208
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,120
half slabs and stairs but when I was
 

209
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,490
half slabs and stairs but when I was
digging out the collection points other

210
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:57,500
digging out the collection points other
 

211
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,850
digging out the collection points other
day I found some squids and I still

212
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:00,860
day I found some squids and I still
 

213
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,900
day I found some squids and I still
remembered his response so I thought hey

214
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:03,910
remembered his response so I thought hey
 

215
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,690
remembered his response so I thought hey
might as well try it out now and to my

216
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:07,700
might as well try it out now and to my
 

217
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,950
might as well try it out now and to my
surprise it worked

218
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960

 

219
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,570

but here's the interesting thing I tried

220
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:16,580
but here's the interesting thing I tried
 

221
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,940
but here's the interesting thing I tried
it again with the half step I just

222
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:18,950
it again with the half step I just
 

223
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:29,170
it again with the half step I just
killed the squid was it my fault what

224
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,180
killed the squid was it my fault what
 

225
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,810
killed the squid was it my fault what
was I saying

226
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:30,820
was I saying
 

227
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,580
was I saying
yeah I tried half slabs and stairs again

228
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:33,590
yeah I tried half slabs and stairs again
 

229
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,040
yeah I tried half slabs and stairs again
and they also work now so something

230
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,050
and they also work now so something
 

231
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,430
and they also work now so something
changed with their I don't know what you

232
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:42,440
changed with their I don't know what you
 

233
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,640
changed with their I don't know what you
call it their behavior so they can go up

234
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:45,650
call it their behavior so they can go up
 

235
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,120
call it their behavior so they can go up
half slabs and stairs now and I will

236
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,130
half slabs and stairs now and I will
 

237
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:57,130
half slabs and stairs now and I will
prove that to you now with this fatty so

238
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:57,140
prove that to you now with this fatty so
 

239
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,140
prove that to you now with this fatty so
we have a water stream going towards a

240
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,150
we have a water stream going towards a
 

241
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,580
we have a water stream going towards a
half slab here and this sign keeps the

242
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:06,590
half slab here and this sign keeps the
 

243
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,350
half slab here and this sign keeps the
water from back flowing towards this

244
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,360
water from back flowing towards this
 

245
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,060
water from back flowing towards this
screen and over here is a fence which

246
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,070
screen and over here is a fence which
 

247
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,430
screen and over here is a fence which
they're going up as well to push this

248
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
they're going up as well to push this
 

249
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,940
they're going up as well to push this
guy in he should go up the half slab or

250
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:24,950
guy in he should go up the half slab or
 

251
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:34,170
guy in he should go up the half slab or
stair or fence whatever you use

252
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:34,180

 

253
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,930

so far this hasn't turned out too well I

254
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:36,940
so far this hasn't turned out too well I
 

255
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:46,630
so far this hasn't turned out too well I
almost think fences do work better hey

256
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
almost think fences do work better hey
 

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,680
almost think fences do work better hey
what are you doing dude

258
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:47,690
what are you doing dude
 

259
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,910
what are you doing dude
they're finally they do go up

260
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
they're finally they do go up
 

261
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,940
they're finally they do go up
I think fences do work better but they

262
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:54,950
I think fences do work better but they
 

263
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,210
I think fences do work better but they
have a problem I think if you log out

264
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,220
have a problem I think if you log out
 

265
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,850
have a problem I think if you log out
and they're over top of fence they'll

266
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:00,860
and they're over top of fence they'll
 

267
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,350
and they're over top of fence they'll
get stuck in the fence like they'll fall

268
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
get stuck in the fence like they'll fall
 

269
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,090
get stuck in the fence like they'll fall
down the block into the fence kind of

270
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,100
down the block into the fence kind of
 

271
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,579
down the block into the fence kind of
like how mobs go through class if you

272
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:09,589
like how mobs go through class if you
 

273
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,430
like how mobs go through class if you
log out and they're being pushed against

274
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,440
log out and they're being pushed against
 

275
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,430
log out and they're being pushed against
it so yeah

276
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
it so yeah
 

277
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,930
it so yeah
fences may work better I don't know for

278
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:19,940
fences may work better I don't know for
 

279
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:27,850
fences may work better I don't know for
sure but they have that problem too yes

280
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:27,860
sure but they have that problem too yes
 

281
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,370
sure but they have that problem too yes
those thing works a lot better at night

282
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,380

 

283
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:44,770

got way more bacon than I ever need it's

284
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:44,780
got way more bacon than I ever need it's
 

285
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
got way more bacon than I ever need it's
pretty cool and then below you can watch

286
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:46,790
pretty cool and then below you can watch
 

287
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,180
pretty cool and then below you can watch
and burn it's pretty much exactly what I

288
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,190
and burn it's pretty much exactly what I
 

289
00:09:49,190 --> 00:10:02,560
and burn it's pretty much exactly what I
wanted

290
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,570

 

291
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,150

if you did want the cooked bacon to fall

292
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
if you did want the cooked bacon to fall
 

293
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,710
if you did want the cooked bacon to fall
into a water stream I think the way I

294
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
into a water stream I think the way I
 

295
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,690
into a water stream I think the way I
would do that is drop them down one by

296
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:17,700
would do that is drop them down one by
 

297
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,390
would do that is drop them down one by
one tube like this through the lava like

298
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,400
one tube like this through the lava like
 

299
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,910
one tube like this through the lava like
I'm doing here

300
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
I'm doing here
 

301
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,430
I'm doing here
but drop them on top of a fence post

302
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
but drop them on top of a fence post
 

303
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:37,280
but drop them on top of a fence post
with water stream above and I think I

304
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,290
with water stream above and I think I
 

305
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,930
with water stream above and I think I
think that would work I haven't tested

306
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:38,940
think that would work I haven't tested
 

307
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,620
think that would work I haven't tested
it but I think they would still on be

308
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:42,630
it but I think they would still on be
 

309
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,690
it but I think they would still on be
fun they would still be on fire and the

310
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:44,700
fun they would still be on fire and the
 

311
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,430
fun they would still be on fire and the
gravity would kill them I'm falling and

312
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:46,440
gravity would kill them I'm falling and
 

313
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,460
gravity would kill them I'm falling and
they should drop cook pork chops even

314
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,470
they should drop cook pork chops even
 

315
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,830
they should drop cook pork chops even
though they're landing in water

316
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,840
though they're landing in water
 

317
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,290
though they're landing in water
I think they'll hit the fence post first

318
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:54,300
I think they'll hit the fence post first
 

319
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,570
I think they'll hit the fence post first
before they get sting

320
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:56,580
before they get sting
 

321
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:05,960
before they get sting
I think but I haven't tested it so I'm

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,540
okay so what I'm going to show you is
how you can move them up vertically as

348
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:25,550
how you can move them up vertically as
 

349
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,120
how you can move them up vertically as
quickly as I know how

350
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,130

 

351
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,580

actually I'll pause it and do it off

352
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:33,590
actually I'll pause it and do it off
 

353
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,380
actually I'll pause it and do it off
camera because there's other things I

354
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,390
camera because there's other things I
 

355
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,120
camera because there's other things I
want to do this episode and then this

356
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,130
want to do this episode and then this
 

357
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,110
want to do this episode and then this
will take a while okay nevermind I

361
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,690
changed my mind I'll do it on camera
because a lot of people have been asking

362
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:46,700
because a lot of people have been asking
 

363
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,930
because a lot of people have been asking
me how to make these spiral staircases

364
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:51,940

 

365
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,720

so may as well show it this here will be

366
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:58,730
so may as well show it this here will be
 

367
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:05,290
so may as well show it this here will be
the center and I'm using glass even

368
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,300
the center and I'm using glass even
 

369
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,000
the center and I'm using glass even
though I'm going to destroy this

370
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,010

 

371
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:19,720

and so you need to keep the water in

372
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:19,730
and so you need to keep the water in
 

373
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:26,500
and so you need to keep the water in
position and you do that using these

374
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:26,510
position and you do that using these
 

375
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:35,050
position and you do that using these
signs they're a little bit tedious to

376
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,060
signs they're a little bit tedious to
 

377
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,250
signs they're a little bit tedious to
build but I like them they're pretty

378
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,260
build but I like them they're pretty
 

379
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,600
build but I like them they're pretty
cool

380
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:42,610

 

381
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,880

I'm sure you could build them pretty

382
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:45,890
I'm sure you could build them pretty
 

383
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:58,560
I'm sure you could build them pretty
fast if you made a few of them okay so

384
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,570

 

385
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:10,570

nope I guess the sign is one two I place

386
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:10,580
nope I guess the sign is one two I place
 

387
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,030
nope I guess the sign is one two I place
it there and then we place our water

388
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
it there and then we place our water
 

389
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:27,010
it there and then we place our water
yeah so it pulls you in okay so I

390
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,020
yeah so it pulls you in okay so I
 

391
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,600
yeah so it pulls you in okay so I
usually just place the signs on the

392
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,610
usually just place the signs on the
 

393
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,720
usually just place the signs on the
inside column here and you keep going up

394
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:31,730
inside column here and you keep going up
 

395
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:39,280
inside column here and you keep going up
one level next one will go here and if

396
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,290
one level next one will go here and if
 

397
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,380
one level next one will go here and if
you keep going you just keep going

398
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,390
you keep going you just keep going
 

399
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,420
you keep going you just keep going
around I think that's as high as I'm

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,130
right well let's call this the top so
 

435
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,650
right well let's call this the top so
I'm gonna push a squid in and it should

436
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:44,660
I'm gonna push a squid in and it should
 

437
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,270
I'm gonna push a squid in and it should
somehow make his way to the top over

438
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,280
somehow make his way to the top over
 

439
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
somehow make his way to the top over
time

440
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,410
time
 

441
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,390
time
he'll probably fight climbing up though

442
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:52,400
he'll probably fight climbing up though
 

443
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,120
he'll probably fight climbing up though
but you will see they can swim against

444
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,130
but you will see they can swim against
 

445
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,820
but you will see they can swim against
the current so if you want to keep them

446
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:01,830
the current so if you want to keep them
 

447
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,130
the current so if you want to keep them
from going back you can have a drop like

448
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
from going back you can have a drop like
 

449
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,439
from going back you can have a drop like
I have here I got you can't even get up

450
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:09,449
I have here I got you can't even get up
 

451
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:17,710
I have here I got you can't even get up
here

452
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:17,720

 

453
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,930

usually they gets spazzing the walls

454
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:20,940
usually they gets spazzing the walls
 

455
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,370
usually they gets spazzing the walls
like that it might work better if you

456
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:22,380
like that it might work better if you
 

457
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,500
like that it might work better if you
make your canals too wide but I haven't

458
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:24,510
make your canals too wide but I haven't
 

459
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:34,370
make your canals too wide but I haven't
tried that yet you should give it enough

460
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,380
tried that yet you should give it enough
 

461
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,670
tried that yet you should give it enough
time make his way up so but he'll try to

462
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:40,680
time make his way up so but he'll try to
 

463
00:17:40,680 --> 00:18:05,990
time make his way up so but he'll try to
go down

464
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000

 

465
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,610

yeah it's not it's not gonna be fast

466
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:08,620
yeah it's not it's not gonna be fast
 

467
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:23,850
yeah it's not it's not gonna be fast
that's for sure you can make it buddy

468
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:23,860
that's for sure you can make it buddy
 

469
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,600
that's for sure you can make it buddy
no you don't want to go that way I

470
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:26,610
no you don't want to go that way I
 

471
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:41,790
no you don't want to go that way I
believe in you Oh big like 15 frames per

472
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:41,800
believe in you Oh big like 15 frames per
 

473
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:52,950
believe in you Oh big like 15 frames per
second but yeah anyway that's the idea

474
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
second but yeah anyway that's the idea
 

475
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,680
second but yeah anyway that's the idea
he's slowly making his way up and every

476
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:55,690
he's slowly making his way up and every
 

477
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,570
he's slowly making his way up and every
now and then he goes back down and then

478
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:57,580
now and then he goes back down and then
 

479
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,560
now and then he goes back down and then
comes back up it's like a tug-of-war

480
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:00,570
comes back up it's like a tug-of-war
 

481
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,340
comes back up it's like a tug-of-war
but since the screens are pulling him in

482
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,350
but since the screens are pulling him in
 

483
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,640
but since the screens are pulling him in
general he will make his way up

484
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:07,650
general he will make his way up
 

485
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:17,300
general he will make his way up
given enough time and he is stuck now

486
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,310
given enough time and he is stuck now
 

487
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,630
given enough time and he is stuck now
they can't swim once they're on dry land

488
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
they can't swim once they're on dry land
 

489
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:29,270
they can't swim once they're on dry land
so he made it congratulations

490
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280

 

491
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,340

ok so you guys can go ahead and make

492
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,350
ok so you guys can go ahead and make
 

493
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,710
ok so you guys can go ahead and make
your squid farms before me if you want I

494
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
your squid farms before me if you want I
 

495
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,200
your squid farms before me if you want I
don't really know exactly what I'm gonna

496
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,210
don't really know exactly what I'm gonna
 

497
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,710
don't really know exactly what I'm gonna
do with mine yet but if you're new to my

498
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
do with mine yet but if you're new to my
 

499
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,780
do with mine yet but if you're new to my
channel if you don't know how this works

500
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:42,790
channel if you don't know how this works
 

501
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,570
channel if you don't know how this works
I'll explain it to you again

502
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:45,580
I'll explain it to you again
 

503
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll explain it to you again
the idea is to set up these collection

504
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,010
the idea is to set up these collection
 

505
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:54,000
the idea is to set up these collection
points every so often in your world

506
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,010
points every so often in your world
 

507
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,430
points every so often in your world
because since there's thousands and

508
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:56,440
because since there's thousands and
 

509
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,260
because since there's thousands and
thousands of water source blocks all

510
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,270
thousands of water source blocks all
 

511
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,430
thousands of water source blocks all
around my base there's pretty much an

512
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:02,440
around my base there's pretty much an
 

513
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,110
around my base there's pretty much an
endless number of locations where the

514
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,120
endless number of locations where the
 

515
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,950
endless number of locations where the
squid can spawn so in order to control

516
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:07,960
squid can spawn so in order to control
 

517
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,649
squid can spawn so in order to control
them you need to

518
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:11,659
them you need to
 

519
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,149
them you need to
try to make it so that they all funnel

520
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
try to make it so that they all funnel
 

521
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,489
try to make it so that they all funnel
to a central point since they can't swim

522
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:19,499
to a central point since they can't swim
 

523
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,289
to a central point since they can't swim
they'll go to the lowest point in the

524
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:21,299
they'll go to the lowest point in the
 

525
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,379
they'll go to the lowest point in the
ocean and you find all these little

526
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:24,389
ocean and you find all these little
 

527
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,110
ocean and you find all these little
points you can terraform the bottom of

528
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
points you can terraform the bottom of
 

529
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,649
points you can terraform the bottom of
the ocean to to make them and then you

530
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:30,659
the ocean to to make them and then you
 

531
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:37,580
the ocean to to make them and then you
dig down place a sign try to do it

532
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:37,590
dig down place a sign try to do it
 

533
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,340
dig down place a sign try to do it
against the wall like I have here so the

534
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,350
against the wall like I have here so the
 

535
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,749
against the wall like I have here so the
squid will align with the wall and then

536
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:44,759
squid will align with the wall and then
 

537
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,600
squid will align with the wall and then
fall down they fall through these things

538
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,610
fall down they fall through these things
 

539
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:54,919
fall down they fall through these things
into water streams make sure they can't

540
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:54,929
into water streams make sure they can't
 

541
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,799
into water streams make sure they can't
get out of the water streams and it just

542
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:57,809
get out of the water streams and it just
 

543
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:00,980
get out of the water streams and it just
keeps pulling them and pulling them all

544
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:00,990
keeps pulling them and pulling them all
 

545
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:07,129
keeps pulling them and pulling them all
towards a central point where you want

546
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:07,139
towards a central point where you want
 

547
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:15,109
towards a central point where you want
them all to collect and you make him

548
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:15,119
them all to collect and you make him
 

549
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:22,210
them all to collect and you make him
wheel up or you can make a drop oh

550
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,220

 

551
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,639

that's bad that's bad now I need to fix

552
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:28,649
that's bad that's bad now I need to fix
 

553
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:43,620
that's bad that's bad now I need to fix
that

554
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:43,630

 

555
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,860

yeah

556
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:46,870

 

557
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:56,560

and so you need to yeah so with these

558
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:56,570
and so you need to yeah so with these
 

559
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,070
and so you need to yeah so with these
spiral staircase things you can bring

560
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
spiral staircase things you can bring
 

561
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,430
spiral staircase things you can bring
them up vertically quickly doing this or

562
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
them up vertically quickly doing this or
 

563
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,880
them up vertically quickly doing this or
you can just gradually bring them up

564
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:05,890
you can just gradually bring them up
 

565
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,860
you can just gradually bring them up
vertically if you want or you know

566
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:08,870
vertically if you want or you know
 

567
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,779
vertically if you want or you know
however you want to do it and it should

568
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:13,789
however you want to do it and it should
 

569
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:16,090
however you want to do it and it should
be possible to hook up an automatic

570
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,100
be possible to hook up an automatic
 

571
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,630
be possible to hook up an automatic
killing thing using lab and stuff which

572
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:19,640
killing thing using lab and stuff which
 

573
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,960
killing thing using lab and stuff which
I might get into I probably will make it

574
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:22,970
I might get into I probably will make it
 

575
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,570
I might get into I probably will make it
manual though because there won't be

576
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:25,580
manual though because there won't be
 

577
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,529
manual though because there won't be
tons of squid so I'll want them to all

578
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:29,539
tons of squid so I'll want them to all
 

579
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:31,330
tons of squid so I'll want them to all
collect and then I'll choose to kill

580
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:31,340
collect and then I'll choose to kill
 

581
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,389
collect and then I'll choose to kill
them and so I don't miss picking up

582
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:34,399
them and so I don't miss picking up
 

583
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:41,019
them and so I don't miss picking up
their ink sacs before they D spawn and

584
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:41,029
their ink sacs before they D spawn and
 

585
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,529
their ink sacs before they D spawn and
so yeah set up your collection points in

586
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:44,539
so yeah set up your collection points in
 

587
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:48,930
so yeah set up your collection points in
the ocean I have I think two that way

588
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:48,940
the ocean I have I think two that way
 

589
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,740
the ocean I have I think two that way
I've got one over there there's one in

590
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:53,750
I've got one over there there's one in
 

591
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,430
I've got one over there there's one in
that area there I think there's one over

592
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
that area there I think there's one over
 

593
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,560
that area there I think there's one over
here so I got them kind of spread around

594
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,570
here so I got them kind of spread around
 

595
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,220
here so I got them kind of spread around
all around my base I haven't started

596
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,230
all around my base I haven't started
 

597
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,200
all around my base I haven't started
doing this yet but if you have a bunch

598
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,210
doing this yet but if you have a bunch
 

599
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,769
doing this yet but if you have a bunch
of collection points you can share water

600
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:08,779
of collection points you can share water
 

601
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,659
of collection points you can share water
streams like I could if I had one over

602
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:10,669
streams like I could if I had one over
 

603
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,019
streams like I could if I had one over
here see over there I could make it go

604
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:14,029
here see over there I could make it go
 

605
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,490
here see over there I could make it go
to the right and connect with this

606
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:15,500
to the right and connect with this
 

607
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,919
to the right and connect with this
stream here and then branch them all

608
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:20,929
stream here and then branch them all
 

609
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:22,960
stream here and then branch them all
together if you want or you can make

610
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:22,970
together if you want or you can make
 

611
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,580
together if you want or you can make
separate streams or you know figure it

612
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:27,590
separate streams or you know figure it
 

613
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,950
separate streams or you know figure it
out on your own I guess I'm saying do

614
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:29,960
out on your own I guess I'm saying do
 

615
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,950
out on your own I guess I'm saying do
what you want to do yeah so I think

616
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:35,960
what you want to do yeah so I think
 

617
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,060
what you want to do yeah so I think
that's all we're going to do with the

618
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,070
that's all we're going to do with the
 

619
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,169
that's all we're going to do with the
squid farm today

620
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:39,179
squid farm today
 

621
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:42,680
squid farm today
I just wanted to show you what's off in

622
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:42,690
I just wanted to show you what's off in
 

623
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,089
I just wanted to show you what's off in
this direction and while we're traveling

624
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:47,099
this direction and while we're traveling
 

625
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:50,810
this direction and while we're traveling
there talk about a few things and I want

626
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:50,820
there talk about a few things and I want
 

627
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,869
there talk about a few things and I want
to give a shout out to in frizam and to

628
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:53,879
to give a shout out to in frizam and to
 

629
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,810
to give a shout out to in frizam and to
everybody on a server they're a bunch of

630
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:56,820
everybody on a server they're a bunch of
 

631
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,060
everybody on a server they're a bunch of
cool guys and they recently made a very

632
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,070
cool guys and they recently made a very
 

633
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,249
cool guys and they recently made a very
interesting video I'm gonna link it in

634
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:04,259
interesting video I'm gonna link it in
 

635
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,219
interesting video I'm gonna link it in
the description it's a I guess you could

636
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:07,229
the description it's a I guess you could
 

637
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,889
the description it's a I guess you could
say a musical but it's not corny it's

638
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:09,899
say a musical but it's not corny it's
 

639
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:12,879
say a musical but it's not corny it's
pretty funny

640
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:12,889

 

641
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,529

that is a lot of cool people on his

642
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:15,539
that is a lot of cool people on his
 

643

687
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,460
mob systems there's one right over there
and when I build these I did a lot of

688
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:49,470
and when I build these I did a lot of
 

689
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:56,450
and when I build these I did a lot of
resources and then I also hopefully I

690
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:56,460
resources and then I also hopefully I
 

691
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,860
resources and then I also hopefully I
can sleep here without dying

695
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,850

when I build these mob systems I have to

when I build these mob systems I have to
 

697
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,009
when I build these mob systems I have to
light up the tunnels around the area too

698

808
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,280
today just exploring and collecting
 

809
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,240
today just exploring and collecting
resources lighting up the tunnels and I

810
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,250
resources lighting up the tunnels and I
 

811
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:36,010
resources lighting up the tunnels and I
am probably only 1/3 done all right so

812
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,020
am probably only 1/3 done all right so
 

813
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:45,500
am probably only 1/3 done all right so
you got one two one two three four about

814
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,510
you got one two one two three four about
 

815
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,360
you got one two one two three four about
four and a half stacks of sand doing

816
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,370
four and a half stacks of sand doing
 

817
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,870
four and a half stacks of sand doing
that and about two stacks of sand stone

818
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
that and about two stacks of sand stone
 

819
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,010
that and about two stacks of sand stone
so works out pretty good I think

820
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,020
so works out pretty good I think
 

821
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,560
so works out pretty good I think
and that wasn't that many TNT and I have

822
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:00,570
and that wasn't that many TNT and I have
 

823
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,350
and that wasn't that many TNT and I have
pretty much infinite gunpowder I just

824
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
pretty much infinite gunpowder I just
 

825
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,690
pretty much infinite gunpowder I just
don't have infinite sand so it's nice to

826
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:05,700
don't have infinite sand so it's nice to
 

827
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:14,180
don't have infinite sand so it's nice to
have fast ways of getting sand ok these

828
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,190
have fast ways of getting sand ok these
 

829
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,240
have fast ways of getting sand ok these
ones are spaced 5 apart now let's see

830
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,250
ones are spaced 5 apart now let's see
 

831
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:25,230
ones are spaced 5 apart now let's see
let's see if they do is need of a job

as I talk so the month of May is here
 

845
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,350
as I talk so the month of May is here
and what that means is I start working

and what that means is I start working
 

847
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,030
and what that means is I start working
10 to 12 hour days so I'm not gonna have

848
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,040
10 to 12 hour days so I'm not gonna have
 

849
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,670
10 to 12 hour days so I'm not gonna have

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,480
and that means don't expect a whole lot
 

855
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,450
