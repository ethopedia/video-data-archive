00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,180

hello everyone how's it going we're just

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,190
hello everyone how's it going we're just
 

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,160
hello everyone how's it going we're just
hanging out up in the sky here on our

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,170
hanging out up in the sky here on our
 

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,950
hanging out up in the sky here on our
new spawning pads and some of your

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:09,960
new spawning pads and some of your
 

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,660
new spawning pads and some of your
relatives and the grass has finished

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:14,670
relatives and the grass has finished
 

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,359
relatives and the grass has finished
spreading and we're going to get to

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:22,369
spreading and we're going to get to
 

11
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,830
spreading and we're going to get to
going to work on them some more fish

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:24,840
going to work on them some more fish
 

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,259
going to work on them some more fish
finish things up up here um so we need

14
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:30,269
finish things up up here um so we need
 

15
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:45,560
finish things up up here um so we need
to set up our water canals and actually

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:45,570
to set up our water canals and actually
 

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,209
to set up our water canals and actually
you know what I'm gonna turn sound down

18
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:49,219

 

19
00:00:49,219 --> 00:01:09,740

and we're gonna need a lot of signs and

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:09,750
and we're gonna need a lot of signs and
 

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,510
and we're gonna need a lot of signs and
everything seems to be working pretty

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
everything seems to be working pretty
 

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,460
everything seems to be working pretty
good still the mobs don't to walk off

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:18,470
good still the mobs don't to walk off
 

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,520
good still the mobs don't to walk off
our spawning pads that only seems to

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,530
our spawning pads that only seems to
 

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,020
our spawning pads that only seems to
happen if someone pushes them and so in

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,030
happen if someone pushes them and so in
 

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,910
happen if someone pushes them and so in
order to get them go down we're going to

30
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:28,920
order to get them go down we're going to
 

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,990
order to get them go down we're going to
need to push in with water and so that's

32
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,000
need to push in with water and so that's
 

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,249
need to push in with water and so that's
the center I'm going to need to move

34
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:37,259
the center I'm going to need to move
 

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,410
the center I'm going to need to move
this passageway up

36
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,420

 

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,880

but I think ideally we want to place the

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:46,890
but I think ideally we want to place the
 

39
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,200
but I think ideally we want to place the
water eight blocks from the center so

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,210
water eight blocks from the center so
 

41
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:59,050
water eight blocks from the center so
one two three four five six seven eight

42
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,060

 

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,460

so it makes it right to the edge without

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:01,470
so it makes it right to the edge without
 

45
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,490
so it makes it right to the edge without
going over and we'll probably place

46
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:07,500
going over and we'll probably place
 

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:22,699
going over and we'll probably place
signs there other side and we should get

48
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:22,709
signs there other side and we should get
 

49
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:28,039
signs there other side and we should get
some stairs you know what we're going to

50
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,049
some stairs you know what we're going to
 

51
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:41,870
some stairs you know what we're going to
use wooden stairs this time and same

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:41,880
use wooden stairs this time and same
 

53
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,599
use wooden stairs this time and same
trick that I do with the hostile mobs

54
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:46,609

 

55
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,150

take the spaces under the signs just

56
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
take the spaces under the signs just
 

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,210
take the spaces under the signs just
like this and place the stairs in the

58
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,220
like this and place the stairs in the
 

59
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,470
like this and place the stairs in the
direction you want the water to flow

60
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480

 

61
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720

and they'll the mobs will be pushed up

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:00,730
and they'll the mobs will be pushed up
 

63
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:09,000
and they'll the mobs will be pushed up
the stairs by the water get out of my

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,010
the stairs by the water get out of my
 

65
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:19,800
the stairs by the water get out of my
way and I'm going to do that for all of

66
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:19,810
way and I'm going to do that for all of
 

67
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,089
way and I'm going to do that for all of
them and we'll see you in a second these

68
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:24,099
them and we'll see you in a second these
 

69
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,009
them and we'll see you in a second these
guys are annoying mainly crazy bye bye

70
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:29,019
guys are annoying mainly crazy bye bye
 

71
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:39,289
guys are annoying mainly crazy bye bye
I think hardly wait to kill them all

72
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:39,299

 

73
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:46,650

move it ah I really should have made a

74
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:46,660
move it ah I really should have made a
 

75
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,929
move it ah I really should have made a
sword

76
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:49,939

 

77
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:54,009

okay so we got water canals all set up

78
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:54,019
okay so we got water canals all set up
 

79
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,869
okay so we got water canals all set up
we made a bunch of fences we're going to

80
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
we made a bunch of fences we're going to
 

81
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,009
we made a bunch of fences we're going to
put all around and yeah so these fences

82
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:04,019
put all around and yeah so these fences
 

83
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,750
put all around and yeah so these fences
aren't going to be for the mobs because

84
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
aren't going to be for the mobs because
 

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,349
aren't going to be for the mobs because
the mobs won't walk off I think mobs

86
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:09,359
the mobs won't walk off I think mobs
 

87
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,869
the mobs won't walk off I think mobs
only walk off if something is I think

88
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
only walk off if something is I think
 

89
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,520
only walk off if something is I think
they'll only walk off if the drop is

90
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:16,530
they'll only walk off if the drop is
 

91
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,509
they'll only walk off if the drop is
only three or less blocks so this is two

92
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:20,519
only three or less blocks so this is two
 

93
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,070
only three or less blocks so this is two
over here underneath our signs is three

94
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,080
over here underneath our signs is three
 

95
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,379
over here underneath our signs is three
I think if you want one block deeper

96
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:27,389
I think if you want one block deeper
 

97
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,990
I think if you want one block deeper
they wouldn't walk off because they take

98
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
they wouldn't walk off because they take
 

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,629
they wouldn't walk off because they take
fall damage but these fences are because

100
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:35,639
fall damage but these fences are because
 

101
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:50,659
fall damage but these fences are because
well ah ah I had a leg spike okay some

102
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:50,669
well ah ah I had a leg spike okay some
 

103
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,730
well ah ah I had a leg spike okay some
people were wondering what this f3 graph

104
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:55,740
people were wondering what this f3 graph
 

105
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,920
people were wondering what this f3 graph
thing does I'm going to explain it to

106
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:57,930
thing does I'm going to explain it to
 

107
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:05,480
thing does I'm going to explain it to
you from what I understand um I don't

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,490
you from what I understand um I don't
 

109
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,070
you from what I understand um I don't
know exactly how it works but basically

110
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,080
know exactly how it works but basically
 

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,420
know exactly how it works but basically
the graph is keeping track of your frame

112
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:11,430
the graph is keeping track of your frame
 

113
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,680
the graph is keeping track of your frame
rate your frames per second you'll

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:15,690
rate your frames per second you'll
 

115
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,550
rate your frames per second you'll
notice some of the it like some places

116
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,560
notice some of the it like some places
 

117
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,520
notice some of the it like some places
are higher some places are lower the

118
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,530
are higher some places are lower the
 

119
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,050
are higher some places are lower the
higher places are that places are like

120
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,060
higher places are that places are like
 

121
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:37,029
higher places are that places are like
frames where you are legging more um

122
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039

 

123
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,520

yeah the higher the spike is the higher

124
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:39,530
yeah the higher the spike is the higher
 

125
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:54,970
yeah the higher the spike is the higher
the fewer your frames per second are

126
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:54,980

 

127
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,700

Maude yes and the lower the jumps are

128
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,710
Maude yes and the lower the jumps are
 

129
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,080
Maude yes and the lower the jumps are
I'm legging again you see that high

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,090
I'm legging again you see that high
 

131
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm legging again you see that high
spike that's a leg spike if they are red

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,210
spike that's a leg spike if they are red
 

133
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,110
spike that's a leg spike if they are red
that means you are getting less than 60

134
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
that means you are getting less than 60
 

135
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,070
that means you are getting less than 60
frames per second and if they are green

136
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,080
frames per second and if they are green
 

137
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,280
frames per second and if they are green
that means you're getting 60 frames per

138
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,290
that means you're getting 60 frames per
 

139
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,880
that means you're getting 60 frames per
second or more so red means you are

140
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:25,890
second or more so red means you are
 

141
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,490
second or more so red means you are
losing frames and your performance could

142
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,500
losing frames and your performance could
 

143
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,230
losing frames and your performance could
be better

144
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,240

 

145
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,970

so since I'm recording there's a lot of

146
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:37,980
so since I'm recording there's a lot of
 

147
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,510
so since I'm recording there's a lot of
there's another like spike there's a lot

148
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
there's another like spike there's a lot
 

149
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:52,880
there's another like spike there's a lot
of a red in the graph and that's

150
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:52,890
of a red in the graph and that's
 

151
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,950
of a red in the graph and that's
basically what that does then you got

152
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
basically what that does then you got
 

153
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,110
basically what that does then you got
your ex excuse me your x y&z coordinates

154
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,120

 

155
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:09,200

where is the Sun Sun is moving this

156
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,210
where is the Sun Sun is moving this
 

157
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,620
where is the Sun Sun is moving this
direction which is you see how the Z

158
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:12,630
direction which is you see how the Z
 

159
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,440
direction which is you see how the Z
coordinate is changing when I walk this

160
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,450
coordinate is changing when I walk this
 

161
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:15,860
coordinate is changing when I walk this
way

162
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:15,870
way
 

163
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,870
way
that's east and west and then x

164
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
that's east and west and then x
 

165
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,460
that's east and west and then x
coordinate is

166
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:23,470
coordinate is
 

167
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,910
coordinate is
north and south and why is up and down

168
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:28,920
north and south and why is up and down
 

169
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:37,470
north and south and why is up and down
another leg spike and some people have

170
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:37,480
another leg spike and some people have
 

171
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,940
another leg spike and some people have
said that another one that's some people

172
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:44,950
said that another one that's some people
 

173
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,800
said that another one that's some people
have said that the y-coordinate is at

174
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:46,810
have said that the y-coordinate is at
 

175
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,370
have said that the y-coordinate is at
your feet and other people have said

176
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,380
your feet and other people have said
 

177
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,440
your feet and other people have said
it's at the top of your head I don't

178
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,450
it's at the top of your head I don't
 

179
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,550
it's at the top of your head I don't
know which it is but regardless you can

180
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
know which it is but regardless you can
 

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,210
know which it is but regardless you can
use it to figure out roughly where you

182
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,220
use it to figure out roughly where you
 

183
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,550
use it to figure out roughly where you
are in the world like sea levels around

184
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
are in the world like sea levels around
 

185
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,840
are in the world like sea levels around
64 I don't know which level exactly it

186
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:06,850
64 I don't know which level exactly it
 

187
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,480
64 I don't know which level exactly it
is right now I'm at 95 if I go up one

188
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:12,490
is right now I'm at 95 if I go up one
 

189
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,570
is right now I'm at 95 if I go up one
block it'll be 96 so you can subtract

190
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:17,580
block it'll be 96 so you can subtract
 

191
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,100
block it'll be 96 so you can subtract
differences to figure out changes in

192
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,110
differences to figure out changes in
 

193
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,430
differences to figure out changes in
height that you've made another leg

194
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
height that you've made another leg
 

195
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,510
height that you've made another leg
spike yeah

196
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
spike yeah
 

197
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,000
spike yeah
so these fences like I was saying I'm

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,010
so these fences like I was saying I'm
 

199
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,880
so these fences like I was saying I'm
lagging so bad are for I plan on like

200
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:38,890
lagging so bad are for I plan on like
 

201
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,560
lagging so bad are for I plan on like
moving the tree farm up here probably

202
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:40,570
moving the tree farm up here probably
 

203
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,350
moving the tree farm up here probably
eventually the trees will probably be

204
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
eventually the trees will probably be
 

205
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,410
eventually the trees will probably be
all around this fenced area and they'll

206
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:46,420
all around this fenced area and they'll
 

207
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,040
all around this fenced area and they'll
probably be other things up here too a

208
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,050
probably be other things up here too a
 

209
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,200
probably be other things up here too a
lot of people have commented that my

210
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,210
lot of people have commented that my
 

211
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,570
lot of people have commented that my
world looks ugly now well

212
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:56,580

 

213
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:05,540

it's a work in progress let me down let

214
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:05,550
it's a work in progress let me down let
 

215
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:14,150
it's a work in progress let me down let
me down I actually really liked how the

216
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
me down I actually really liked how the
 

217
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,819
me down I actually really liked how the
soil looks although I do like the really

218
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:19,829
soil looks although I do like the really
 

219
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:27,259
soil looks although I do like the really
green grass - um yeah if you looked at

220
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:27,269
green grass - um yeah if you looked at
 

221
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:31,240
green grass - um yeah if you looked at
the like that doesn't look very good

222
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,250
the like that doesn't look very good
 

223
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,220
the like that doesn't look very good
eventually there's going to be a huge

224
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,230
eventually there's going to be a huge
 

225
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:41,769
eventually there's going to be a huge
building all around the sink hopefully

226
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:41,779

 

227
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,110

but function comes first and then looks

228
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
but function comes first and then looks
 

229
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,460
but function comes first and then looks
come second I'm going to stop my Dean

230
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:49,470
come second I'm going to stop my Dean
 

231
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,440
come second I'm going to stop my Dean
for a second I'm lagging too much all

232
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,450
for a second I'm lagging too much all
 

233
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,990
for a second I'm lagging too much all
right we're back so I don't know what

234
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,000
right we're back so I don't know what
 

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,730
right we're back so I don't know what
all the numbers at the top left of this

236
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:58,740
all the numbers at the top left of this
 

237
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,010
all the numbers at the top left of this
f3 thing oops

238
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,020
f3 thing oops
 

239
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,060
f3 thing oops
are for maybe someone else will comment

240
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,070
are for maybe someone else will comment
 

241
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,690
are for maybe someone else will comment
on it

242
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:05,700
on it
 

243
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,910
on it
top rights is memory usage and I think

244
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:10,920
top rights is memory usage and I think
 

245
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,530
top rights is memory usage and I think
it might be bugged because it says I

246
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:12,540
it might be bugged because it says I
 

247
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,960
it might be bugged because it says I
have 989 Meg's but I actually have 16

248
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:17,970
have 989 Meg's but I actually have 16
 

249
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,240
have 989 Meg's but I actually have 16
gigs in my computer so no idea what

250
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,250
gigs in my computer so no idea what
 

251
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,949
gigs in my computer so no idea what
that's about and another thing I wanted

252
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:27,959
that's about and another thing I wanted
 

253
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,050
that's about and another thing I wanted
to point out a lot of people have

254
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,060
to point out a lot of people have
 

255
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,970
to point out a lot of people have
commented that light doesn't pass

256
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:31,980
commented that light doesn't pass
 

257
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,880
commented that light doesn't pass
through stairs anymore that is

258
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:34,890
through stairs anymore that is
 

259
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:43,310
through stairs anymore that is
definitely not true um and I'm going to

260
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:43,320
definitely not true um and I'm going to
 

261
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,960
definitely not true um and I'm going to
show you this because behind this stair

262
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:47,970
show you this because behind this stair
 

263
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,880
show you this because behind this stair
here and this stair here is a block

264
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:49,890
here and this stair here is a block
 

265
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,210
here and this stair here is a block
instead of lava and you'll notice that

266
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:53,220
instead of lava and you'll notice that
 

267
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,480
instead of lava and you'll notice that
they are darker these two sides while

268
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,490
they are darker these two sides while
 

269
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,579
they are darker these two sides while
all the other ones are being lit up by

270
00:10:58,579 --> 00:10:58,589
all the other ones are being lit up by
 

271
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:02,569
all the other ones are being lit up by
the lava still so I'm not sure why that

272
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:02,579
the lava still so I'm not sure why that
 

273
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,720
the lava still so I'm not sure why that
rumor is spreading around but light

274
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:05,730
rumor is spreading around but light
 

275
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,639
rumor is spreading around but light
still passes through stairs and I plan

276
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:07,649
still passes through stairs and I plan
 

277
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,800
still passes through stairs and I plan
on abusing that glitch until it

278
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:09,810
on abusing that glitch until it
 

279
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,490
on abusing that glitch until it
fixed like I do with everything else all

280
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:16,500
fixed like I do with everything else all
 

281
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,760
fixed like I do with everything else all
right

282
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:16,770
right
 

283
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,260
right
another big change I've made is I've got

284
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,270
another big change I've made is I've got
 

285
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,730
another big change I've made is I've got
the new hostile mob system up and

286
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:25,740
the new hostile mob system up and
 

287
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,260
the new hostile mob system up and
running kind of and I've changed all

288
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,270
running kind of and I've changed all
 

289
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:36,290
running kind of and I've changed all
these tubes around before we have a tube

290
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:36,300
these tubes around before we have a tube
 

291
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,519
these tubes around before we have a tube
for spiders and one for the tall mobs

292
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:39,529
for spiders and one for the tall mobs
 

293
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,150
for spiders and one for the tall mobs
ounce this one two by two two that goes

294
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
ounce this one two by two two that goes
 

295
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:55,910
ounce this one two by two two that goes
all the way up and so we only have four

296
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
all the way up and so we only have four
 

297
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,930
all the way up and so we only have four
spawning pads set up and it's very

298
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:58,940
spawning pads set up and it's very
 

299
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,500
spawning pads set up and it's very
efficient pretty much equal with what I

300
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,510
efficient pretty much equal with what I
 

301
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:10,400
efficient pretty much equal with what I
had before because I spent another about

302
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,410
had before because I spent another about
 

303
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,690
had before because I spent another about
our lighting up tunnels but I still have

304
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:14,700
our lighting up tunnels but I still have
 

305
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,550
our lighting up tunnels but I still have
some more tunnels to light up as you saw

306
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
some more tunnels to light up as you saw
 

307
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,180
some more tunnels to light up as you saw
in last episode and I don't really have

308
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,190
in last episode and I don't really have
 

309
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,630
in last episode and I don't really have
this thing doing anything yet they're

310
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:23,640
this thing doing anything yet they're
 

311
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,530
this thing doing anything yet they're
just drowning over here so I got to hook

312
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:30,540
just drowning over here so I got to hook
 

313
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,630
just drowning over here so I got to hook
this up so that I can collect their loot

314
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:32,640
this up so that I can collect their loot
 

315
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,960
this up so that I can collect their loot
because I'm running low on TNT and I'm

316
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:35,970
because I'm running low on TNT and I'm
 

317
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,760
because I'm running low on TNT and I'm
getting close to 5,000 subscribers so

318
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:39,770
getting close to 5,000 subscribers so
 

319
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:49,860
getting close to 5,000 subscribers so
need to start saving up soon

320
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:49,870

 

321
00:12:49,870 --> 00:13:03,150

so well I got to sit down

322
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,160

 

323
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,590

so connects right over here I ripped

324
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:08,600
so connects right over here I ripped
 

325
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,090
so connects right over here I ripped
everything out that was over here

326
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,100
everything out that was over here
 

327
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:20,290
everything out that was over here
and this is all shut down still and by

328
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,300
and this is all shut down still and by
 

329
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,949
and this is all shut down still and by
comparison this one is probably six

330
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:23,959
comparison this one is probably six
 

331
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,079
comparison this one is probably six
times bigger than the one I'm using now

332
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,089
times bigger than the one I'm using now
 

333
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:35,280
times bigger than the one I'm using now
and then oops

334
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,290

 

335
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,620

I'm convinced that like the popular

336
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:41,630
I'm convinced that like the popular
 

337
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,069
I'm convinced that like the popular
opinion on the Minecraft forms and

338
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:45,079
opinion on the Minecraft forms and
 

339
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,940
opinion on the Minecraft forms and
everywhere else is that in order to make

340
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:48,950
everywhere else is that in order to make
 

341
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,040
everywhere else is that in order to make
a really good mob system you need to

342
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,050
a really good mob system you need to
 

343
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,949
a really good mob system you need to
make something huge I don't think that's

344
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:53,959
make something huge I don't think that's
 

345
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:54,490
make something huge I don't think that's
true

346
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:54,500
true
 

347
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,269
true
I think all that's important is that you

348
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:58,279
I think all that's important is that you
 

349
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,319
I think all that's important is that you
light up the tunnels around the area and

350
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:01,329
light up the tunnels around the area and
 

351
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:11,380
light up the tunnels around the area and
then it'll work pretty good so this is

352
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,390
then it'll work pretty good so this is
 

353
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,519
then it'll work pretty good so this is
for spawning pads that I've split in

354
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:14,529
for spawning pads that I've split in
 

355
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:22,449
for spawning pads that I've split in
half to four sections so there is four

356
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:22,459
half to four sections so there is four
 

357
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,030
half to four sections so there is four
times four twenty not sixteen of these

358
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
times four twenty not sixteen of these
 

359
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,250
times four twenty not sixteen of these
6x6 pads

360
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:31,260

 

361
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:39,350

I got the four-way knob evader working

362
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
I got the four-way knob evader working
 

363
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,080
I got the four-way knob evader working
pretty much perfectly - I'm going to

364
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,090
pretty much perfectly - I'm going to
 

365
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,080
pretty much perfectly - I'm going to
make a tutorial on that soon show you

366
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,090
make a tutorial on that soon show you
 

367
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:51,440
make a tutorial on that soon show you
how to build it from scratch yes that's

368
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,450
how to build it from scratch yes that's
 

369
00:14:51,450 --> 00:15:02,060
how to build it from scratch yes that's
all that's down here pretty cool so even

370
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,070
all that's down here pretty cool so even
 

371
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,190
all that's down here pretty cool so even
with the new mom system I still want to

372
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,200
with the new mom system I still want to
 

373
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,010
with the new mom system I still want to
use this timer thing because it's pretty

374
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,020
use this timer thing because it's pretty
 

375
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,600
use this timer thing because it's pretty
convenient just to walk over here and

376
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:08,610
convenient just to walk over here and
 

377
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,270
convenient just to walk over here and
pick up everything so I need to kill the

378
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:14,280
pick up everything so I need to kill the
 

379
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,970
pick up everything so I need to kill the
mobs up there and send their loot down

380
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:16,980
mobs up there and send their loot down
 

381
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,960
mobs up there and send their loot down
here for both the hostel and I want the

382
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:20,970
here for both the hostel and I want the
 

383
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,360
here for both the hostel and I want the
Friendly mob drops to be routed to your

384
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,370
Friendly mob drops to be routed to your
 

385
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,070
Friendly mob drops to be routed to your
- so we're going to try to hook up two

386
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,080
- so we're going to try to hook up two
 

387
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,650
- so we're going to try to hook up two
pipes I think and I forgot how I built

388
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:33,660
pipes I think and I forgot how I built
 

389
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:50,980
pipes I think and I forgot how I built
this thing so let me ripping it apart

390
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:50,990

 

391
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,380

this wire is from the loop levers that

392
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:54,390
this wire is from the loop levers that
 

393
00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:16,900
this wire is from the loop levers that
used to control the junctions um

394
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:16,910

 

395
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:25,280

okay that's a dispenser let's try to try

396
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,290
okay that's a dispenser let's try to try
 

397
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:38,560
okay that's a dispenser let's try to try
to find the best place to drop the loot

398
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:38,570

 

399
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:50,360

probably J this is the center he's right

400
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,370
probably J this is the center he's right
 

401
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,400
probably J this is the center he's right
on this line here the signs probably not

402
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,410
on this line here the signs probably not
 

403
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:55,760
on this line here the signs probably not
needed

404
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:55,770
needed
 

405
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:13,390
needed
oh never mind

406
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:13,400

 

407
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,120

so from the center one two three one two

408
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,130
so from the center one two three one two
 

409
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:35,020
so from the center one two three one two
three okay start it start to destroy

410
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,030

 

411
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:41,420

check it out

412
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,430

 

413
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,850

I really hate this glitch where you

414
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:46,860
I really hate this glitch where you
 

415
00:17:46,860 --> 00:18:12,560
I really hate this glitch where you
can't jump out of the water okay

416
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,570
can't jump out of the water okay
 

417
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,260
can't jump out of the water okay
I'm just wasting tons of time in this

418
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,270
I'm just wasting tons of time in this
 

419
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:21,650
I'm just wasting tons of time in this
episode hope you guys don't mind so I'm

420
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660
episode hope you guys don't mind so I'm
 

421
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,710
episode hope you guys don't mind so I'm
going to run a tube all the way up from

422
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
going to run a tube all the way up from
 

423
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,130
going to run a tube all the way up from
here I just this water isn't need it

424
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,140
here I just this water isn't need it
 

425
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:37,610
here I just this water isn't need it
anymore and I just that sign isn't

426
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:37,620
anymore and I just that sign isn't
 

427
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:52,810
anymore and I just that sign isn't
needed

428
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:52,820

 

429
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,789

so I'm going to have two pipes one for

430
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:55,799
so I'm going to have two pipes one for
 

431
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,399
so I'm going to have two pipes one for
the hostile drops and one for the

432
00:18:58,399 --> 00:18:58,409
the hostile drops and one for the
 

433
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:02,080
the hostile drops and one for the
friendly mob drops and I'm going to

434
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,090
friendly mob drops and I'm going to
 

435
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,940
friendly mob drops and I'm going to
still use these two levers to turn them

436
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:04,950
still use these two levers to turn them
 

437
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,919
still use these two levers to turn them
on or off there'll be a minecart teeth

438
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:08,929
on or off there'll be a minecart teeth
 

439
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:11,239
on or off there'll be a minecart teeth
that controls whether or not the loop

440
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:11,249
that controls whether or not the loop
 

441
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:22,599
that controls whether or not the loop
can fall so if I don't want to mix the

442
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:22,609
can fall so if I don't want to mix the
 

443
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:25,999
can fall so if I don't want to mix the
the hostile mob drops with the friendly

444
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:26,009
the hostile mob drops with the friendly
 

445
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:33,190
the hostile mob drops with the friendly
mob drops I can turn them on or off

446
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200

 

447
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,749

using these levers to light that's what

448
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:35,759
using these levers to light that's what
 

449
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:48,680
using these levers to light that's what
I want to hook up okay other pipe goes

450
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:48,690
I want to hook up okay other pipe goes
 

451
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:58,149
I want to hook up okay other pipe goes
here

452
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:58,159

 

453
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,959

double-check that it's centered oops I

454
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:01,969
double-check that it's centered oops I
 

455
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:12,739
double-check that it's centered oops I
kind of want it to look - even - yeah I

456
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:12,749
kind of want it to look - even - yeah I
 

457
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:23,570
kind of want it to look - even - yeah I
think that's right that's still from the

458
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:23,580
think that's right that's still from the
 

459
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:34,800
think that's right that's still from the
old piping

460
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:34,810

 

461
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,330

you guys say I never build anything on

462
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:37,340
you guys say I never build anything on
 

463
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,300
you guys say I never build anything on
camera so if you don't like this episode

464
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,310
camera so if you don't like this episode
 

465
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:48,400
camera so if you don't like this episode
that's that's why because I'm actually

466
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,410
that's that's why because I'm actually
 

467
00:20:48,410 --> 00:21:01,180
that's that's why because I'm actually
building stuff it's hard to talk and

468
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,190
building stuff it's hard to talk and
 

469
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:11,710
building stuff it's hard to talk and
build stuff at the same time okay looks

470
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:11,720
build stuff at the same time okay looks
 

471
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,680
build stuff at the same time okay looks
good yep

472
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:16,690

 

473
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,380

all right so they'll fall down the pipes

474
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:20,390
all right so they'll fall down the pipes
 

475
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:25,600
all right so they'll fall down the pipes
and get sent here still don't need to do

476
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:25,610
and get sent here still don't need to do
 

477
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,070
and get sent here still don't need to do
anything with the lights someone

478
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,080
anything with the lights someone
 

479
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,720
anything with the lights someone
suggested I should change all this

480
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:28,730
suggested I should change all this
 

481
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,670
suggested I should change all this
cobblestone with wood I might do that

482
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:30,680
cobblestone with wood I might do that
 

483
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,610
cobblestone with wood I might do that
too I'll probably do that off camera if

484
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:33,620
too I'll probably do that off camera if
 

485
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:39,430
too I'll probably do that off camera if
I do um need to figure out how to run

486
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
I do um need to figure out how to run
 

487
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,450
I do um need to figure out how to run
