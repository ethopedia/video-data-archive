and guess what my mob system spawns tons
 

207
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,150
and guess what my mob system spawns tons
of them that's why there's

the zombie pigmen despawn
this is supposed to work by killing them

214
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
this is supposed to work by killing them
 

215
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,749
this is supposed to work by killing them
from fall damage

216
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
from fall damage
 

217
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,909
from fall damage
but these guys they just float down

218
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
but these guys they just float down
 

219
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,790
but these guys they just float down
they land on the track and then they get

220
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
they land on the track and then they get
 

221
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,310
they land on the track and then they get
in the way of this minecart thing going

222
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
in the way of this minecart thing going
 

223
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,749
in the way of this minecart thing going
around and around

224
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
around and around
 

225
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,870
around and around
and clog up everything so they are

226
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
and clog up everything so they are
 

227
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,710
and clog up everything so they are
a problem um as cool as they are

228
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
a problem um as cool as they are
 

229
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,510
a problem um as cool as they are
they are a problem we have to redo some

230
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
they are a problem we have to redo some
 

231
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,070
they are a problem we have to redo some
of this stuff and i have an idea

232
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
of this stuff and i have an idea
 

233
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,629
of this stuff and i have an idea
um using portals like we just saw with

234
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
um using portals like we just saw with
 

235
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,309
um using portals like we just saw with
all the zombie pigmen coming out in the

236
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
all the zombie pigmen coming out in the
 

237
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,070
all the zombie pigmen coming out in the
overworld rather than

238
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
overworld rather than
 

239
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,909
overworld rather than
killing the mobs here in the nether and

240
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
killing the mobs here in the nether and
 

241
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,350
killing the mobs here in the nether and
and dropping them down this this thing

242
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
and dropping them down this this thing
 

243
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,790
and dropping them down this this thing
this didn't really work either by the

244
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
this didn't really work either by the
 

245
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,390
this didn't really work either by the
way because they

246
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
way because they
 

247
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,550
way because they
they would despawn as they were falling

248
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
they would despawn as they were falling
 

249
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,469
they would despawn as they were falling
and they would usually despawn before

250
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
and they would usually despawn before
 

251
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,110
and they would usually despawn before
they hit the ground so i kind of had to

252
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
they hit the ground so i kind of had to
 

253
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,270
they hit the ground so i kind of had to
redo this anyway

254
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
redo this anyway
 

255
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,670
redo this anyway
so my new plan with the gold farm

256
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
so my new plan with the gold farm
 

257
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,029
so my new plan with the gold farm
we're going to try to set up a bunch of

258
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
we're going to try to set up a bunch of
 

259
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,430
we're going to try to set up a bunch of
portals like big long

260
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
portals like big long
 

261
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,350
portals like big long
short portals and then have the zombie

262
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
short portals and then have the zombie
 

263
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,510
short portals and then have the zombie
pigmen just walk through

264
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
pigmen just walk through
 

265
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,589
pigmen just walk through
and on the other side in the overworld

266
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
and on the other side in the overworld
 

267
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,350
and on the other side in the overworld
that is where we will store them and

268
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
that is where we will store them and
 

269
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,350
that is where we will store them and
then kill them with a looting sword and

270
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
then kill them with a looting sword and
 

271
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,990
then kill them with a looting sword and
we'll get even more gold from them

272
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
we'll get even more gold from them
 

273
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,230
we'll get even more gold from them
so yeah that's what we're going to try

274
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
so yeah that's what we're going to try
 

275
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,029
so yeah that's what we're going to try
to do

276
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
to do
 

277
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,189
to do
how effective is it going to be we will

278
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
how effective is it going to be we will
 

279
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,710
how effective is it going to be we will
find out i guess

280
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
find out i guess
 

281
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,469
find out i guess
but i'm going to get a ton of obsidian

282
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
but i'm going to get a ton of obsidian
 

283
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,830
but i'm going to get a ton of obsidian
together here

284
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
together here
 

285
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,990
together here
and start setting this up

286
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000

 

287
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,469

because i'm having the time of my life

288
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
because i'm having the time of my life
 

289
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,189
because i'm having the time of my life
minding obsidian

290
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
minding obsidian
 

291
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,830
minding obsidian
this is way less fun than it looks

292
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840

 

293
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,510

and it doesn't look very fun

294
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520

 

295
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,350

this was full of lava up to that point i

296
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
this was full of lava up to that point i
 

297
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,469
this was full of lava up to that point i
got

298
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
got
 

299
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,230
got
just about four stacks we're gonna need

300
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
just about four stacks we're gonna need
 

301
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,749
just about four stacks we're gonna need
a lot for the portals

302
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759

 

303
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,230

having the time of my life mining

304
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
having the time of my life mining
 

305
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,629

310
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
and that's why you start from the top
 

311
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,230
and that's why you start from the top
and work your way down

312
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240

 

313

um i didn't do the whole thing yet but
 

335
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,150
um i didn't do the whole thing yet but
in particular this wall

336
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
in particular this wall
 

337
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,990
in particular this wall
always bugged me it looked really plain

338
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
always bugged me it looked really plain
 

339
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,510
always bugged me it looked really plain
so i

340
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
so i
 

341
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,350
so i
i put the cracked and the mossy stuff in

342
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
i put the cracked and the mossy stuff in
 

343
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,150
i put the cracked and the mossy stuff in
i tried not to overdo it

344
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
i tried not to overdo it
 

345
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,990
i tried not to overdo it
i might have put a little too much but i

346
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
i might have put a little too much but i
 

347
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,189

think it looks okay
 

349
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,230
think it looks okay
gives it more of a cave feel i find

350
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240

 

351
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,149

breaks up the wall because it was just

352
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
breaks up the wall because it was just
 

353
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,149
breaks up the wall because it was just
plain stone before

354
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
plain stone before
 

355
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,310
plain stone before
i haven't done up to here kind of wanted

356
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
i haven't done up to here kind of wanted
 

357
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,709
i haven't done up to here kind of wanted
to see what you guys thought of that

358
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
to see what you guys thought of that
 

359
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,190
to see what you guys thought of that
um but yeah we're gonna go back to the

360
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
um but yeah we're gonna go back to the
 

361
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,909
um but yeah we're gonna go back to the
gold farm

362
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
gold farm
 

363
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,030
gold farm
let's go back very quickly

364
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040

 

365
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,710

so gonna need some sort of pusher system

366
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
so gonna need some sort of pusher system
 

367
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,030
so gonna need some sort of pusher system
too

368
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
too
 

369
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,870
too
to get them into the portal i'm setting

370
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
to get them into the portal i'm setting
 

371
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,630
to get them into the portal i'm setting
up and if this all goes well again this

372
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
up and if this all goes well again this
 

373
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,710
up and if this all goes well again this
is experimental too

374
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
is experimental too
 

375
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,590
is experimental too
i haven't uh haven't really done a mob

376
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
i haven't uh haven't really done a mob
 

377
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,710
i haven't uh haven't really done a mob
farm like this before that used portals

378
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
farm like this before that used portals
 

379
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,110
farm like this before that used portals
um but if this goes well i'm going to

380
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
um but if this goes well i'm going to
 

381
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,030
um but if this goes well i'm going to
try set up a mob farm like just a

382
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
try set up a mob farm like just a
 

383
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,350
try set up a mob farm like just a
regular mob farm that does this

384
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
regular mob farm that does this
 

385
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,829
regular mob farm that does this
by the man cave as well um

386
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
by the man cave as well um
 

387
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,509
by the man cave as well um
and send like creepers and stuff into

388
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
and send like creepers and stuff into
 

389
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,949
and send like creepers and stuff into
the nether so

390
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
the nether so
 

391
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,070
the nether so
working the other way

392
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
working the other way
 

393
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,670
working the other way
um yes so i guess

394
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
um yes so i guess
 

395
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,509
um yes so i guess
let's maybe just do one or two of these

396
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
let's maybe just do one or two of these
 

397
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,829
let's maybe just do one or two of these
first to make sure it works

398
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
first to make sure it works
 

399
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,350
first to make sure it works
i'm gonna have to get rid of a lot of

400
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
i'm gonna have to get rid of a lot of
 

401
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,389
i'm gonna have to get rid of a lot of
this stuff

402
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399

 

403
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,630

so the lowest spawning pad is right

404
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
so the lowest spawning pad is right
 

405
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,550
so the lowest spawning pad is right
there

406
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
there
 

407
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,310
there
um so maybe

408
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
um so maybe
 

409
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,190
um so maybe
let's plan to put like a portal here and

410
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
let's plan to put like a portal here and
 

411
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,630
let's plan to put like a portal here and
move all the mobs

412
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
move all the mobs
 

413
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,710
move all the mobs
to the left um

414
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
to the left um
 

415
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,750
to the left um
all right so i brought stone brick so

416
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
all right so i brought stone brick so
 

417
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,190
all right so i brought stone brick so
they would fall

418
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200

 

419
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,790

let's see they need at least a two block

420
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
let's see they need at least a two block
 

421
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,829
let's see they need at least a two block
high clearance to get underneath

422
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
high clearance to get underneath
 

423
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,710
high clearance to get underneath
all right so i think i think that means

424
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
all right so i think i think that means
 

425
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:17,190
all right so i think i think that means
our ground is going to be here

426
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200

 

427
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,430

so half of them like the right side is

428
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
so half of them like the right side is
 

429
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,870
so half of them like the right side is
going to land there and then we're going

430
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
going to land there and then we're going
 

431
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,910
going to land there and then we're going
to go

432
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
to go
 

433
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,110
to go
down a little bit more have another

434
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
down a little bit more have another
 

435
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,870
down a little bit more have another
layer

436
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880

 

437
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,990

probably i think at that

438
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
probably i think at that
 

439
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,269
probably i think at that
level

440
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279

 

441
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,630

so they'll fall down and then they'll

442
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
so they'll fall down and then they'll
 

443
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,150
so they'll fall down and then they'll
get pushed one more time when they're

444
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
get pushed one more time when they're
 

445
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,590
get pushed one more time when they're
down here to the left and that should

446
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
down here to the left and that should
 

447
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,030
down here to the left and that should
put them into a portal right here um

448
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
put them into a portal right here um
 

449
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,069
put them into a portal right here um
so we need pistons lots and lots of

450
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
so we need pistons lots and lots of
 

451
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,230
so we need pistons lots and lots of
pistons what a surprise

452
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
pistons what a surprise
 

453
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,910
pistons what a surprise
i've gone through so many pistons making

454
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
i've gone through so many pistons making
 

455
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,829
i've gone through so many pistons making
this dumb thing

456
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

457
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,630

um

458
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
um
 

459
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,389
um
see i'm going to use sticky pistons i'm

460
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
see i'm going to use sticky pistons i'm
 

461
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,069
see i'm going to use sticky pistons i'm
not using string

462
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
not using string
 

463
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,670
not using string
like tripwire for this one i'm just

464
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
like tripwire for this one i'm just
 

465
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,670
like tripwire for this one i'm just
going to use pressure plates i think

466
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
going to use pressure plates i think
 

467
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,990
going to use pressure plates i think
so that they can individually fire

468
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000

 

469
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,829

uh instead of like the tripwire setup we

470
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
uh instead of like the tripwire setup we
 

471
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,190
uh instead of like the tripwire setup we
got there where the whole row fires

472
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
got there where the whole row fires
 

473
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,790
got there where the whole row fires
and i guess

474
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800

 

475
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,350

it's gonna be a very simple nope not

476
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
it's gonna be a very simple nope not
 

477
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,710
it's gonna be a very simple nope not
there

478
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
there
 

479
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,030
there
right there i think

480
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
right there i think
 

481
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,590
right there i think
yeah just trying to remember how to do

482
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
yeah just trying to remember how to do
 

483
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,030
yeah just trying to remember how to do
this

484
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
this
 

485
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,670
this
okay so pissed in there block in front

486
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
okay so pissed in there block in front
 

487
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,630
okay so pissed in there block in front
um here let's let's change this up for

488
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
um here let's let's change this up for
 

489
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,630
um here let's let's change this up for
right now so we can get up here easy

490
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
right now so we can get up here easy
 

491
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,550
right now so we can get up here easy
i'm gonna have a whole row of pressure

492
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
i'm gonna have a whole row of pressure
 

493
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,710
i'm gonna have a whole row of pressure
plates stone pressure plates here then

494
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
plates stone pressure plates here then
 

495
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,629
plates stone pressure plates here then
we're gonna activate the pistons

496
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639

 

497
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,910

and we just need to send power

498
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
and we just need to send power
 

499
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,829
and we just need to send power
into there so we can do

500
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
into there so we can do
 

501
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,269
into there so we can do
we can do like redstone oh careful

502
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
we can do like redstone oh careful
 

503
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,829
we can do like redstone oh careful
redstone and then repeater and alternate

504
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
redstone and then repeater and alternate
 

505
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,470
redstone and then repeater and alternate
them all the way down

506
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
them all the way down
 

507
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,060
them all the way down
so let me get to that

508
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,070
so let me get to that
 

509
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,990
so let me get to that
[Music]

510
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
[Music]
 

511
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,190
[Music]
it's literally at eight

512
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
it's literally at eight
 

513
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,829
it's literally at eight
and those gas i don't think have gotten

514
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
and those gas i don't think have gotten
 

515
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,030
and those gas i don't think have gotten
any quieter

516
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040

 

517
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,190

they're still so loud oh uh anyway

518
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
they're still so loud oh uh anyway
 

519
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,389
they're still so loud oh uh anyway
so there is eight of these these

520
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
so there is eight of these these
 

521
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,430
so there is eight of these these
sections

522
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
sections
 

523
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,150
sections
this took 32 pistons which is a it's a

524
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
this took 32 pistons which is a it's a
 

525
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,150
this took 32 pistons which is a it's a
little bit it's not terrible

526
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
little bit it's not terrible
 

527
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,310
little bit it's not terrible
um this isn't even totally necessary

528
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
um this isn't even totally necessary
 

529
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,590
um this isn't even totally necessary
what i'm doing here i'm

530
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
what i'm doing here i'm
 

531
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,590
what i'm doing here i'm
i'm forcing them to enter the portal

532
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
i'm forcing them to enter the portal
 

533
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,870
i'm forcing them to enter the portal
though instead of relying on their

534
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
though instead of relying on their
 

535
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,069
though instead of relying on their
pathfinding

536
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
pathfinding
 

537
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,870
pathfinding
by doing it this way and i just noticed

538
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
by doing it this way and i just noticed
 

539
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,069
by doing it this way and i just noticed
as well

540
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
as well
 

541
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,829
as well
if we put the redstone there it's going

542
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
if we put the redstone there it's going
 

543
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,350
if we put the redstone there it's going
to activate the piston below it

544
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
to activate the piston below it
 

545
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,030
to activate the piston below it
so we might not be able to cheap out

546
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040

 

547
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,910

yeah i don't think we can cheap out oh

548
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
yeah i don't think we can cheap out oh
 

549
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,990
yeah i don't think we can cheap out oh
so

550
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
so
 

551
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,069
so
see before we put the blocks on let's do

552
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
see before we put the blocks on let's do
 

553
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,030
see before we put the blocks on let's do
the repeaters

554
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040

 

555
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,069

so glad i have lots of redstone now

556
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
so glad i have lots of redstone now
 

557
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,670
so glad i have lots of redstone now
i would have just dreaded doing this

558
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
i would have just dreaded doing this
 

559
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,949
i would have just dreaded doing this
otherwise it's the iron though

560
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
otherwise it's the iron though
 

561
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,590
otherwise it's the iron though
um everybody tells me to make a witch

562
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
um everybody tells me to make a witch
 

563
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,509

farm in my world i haven't found a

564
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
farm in my world i haven't found a
 

565
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,829
farm in my world i haven't found a
like a witch hut yet to be honest

566
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
like a witch hut yet to be honest
 

567
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,670
like a witch hut yet to be honest
and with my amplified terrain it's going

568
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
and with my amplified terrain it's going
 

569
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,990
and with my amplified terrain it's going
to be even harder

570
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
to be even harder
 

571
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,829
to be even harder
unless i change it back specifically for

572
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
unless i change it back specifically for
 

573
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,110
unless i change it back specifically for
that which i don't think i'm gonna do

574
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
that which i don't think i'm gonna do
 

575
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,710
that which i don't think i'm gonna do
because i do enjoy taping

576
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
because i do enjoy taping
 

577
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,829
because i do enjoy taping
although i do the speed mining thing now

578
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
although i do the speed mining thing now
 

579
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,230
although i do the speed mining thing now
so

580
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
so
 

581
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,629
so
hmm i don't know

582
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
hmm i don't know
 

583
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,389
hmm i don't know
i haven't used as much iron lately

584
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
i haven't used as much iron lately
 

585
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,829
i haven't used as much iron lately
now the next thing this is the part i

586
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
now the next thing this is the part i
 

587
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,990
now the next thing this is the part i
really don't want to mess up because

588
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
really don't want to mess up because
 

589
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,910
really don't want to mess up because
this is

590
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
this is
 

591
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,030
this is
not going to be fun um but i think the

592
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
not going to be fun um but i think the
 

593
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,069
not going to be fun um but i think the
portal goes

594
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
portal goes
 

595
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,230
portal goes
right here this is the base of it

596
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
right here this is the base of it
 

597
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,670
right here this is the base of it
i'm going to have to try to set this up

598
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
i'm going to have to try to set this up
 

599
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,670
i'm going to have to try to set this up
as well where i can disable the portal

600
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
as well where i can disable the portal
 

601
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,189
as well where i can disable the portal
otherwise it's going to interfere with

602
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
otherwise it's going to interfere with
 

603
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,110
otherwise it's going to interfere with
my portal network

604
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
my portal network
 

605
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,189
my portal network
system

606
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199

 

607
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,030

so only when i'm at the gold farm i want

608
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
so only when i'm at the gold farm i want
 

609
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,829
so only when i'm at the gold farm i want
this working

610
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839

 

611
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,870

come up and then probably just do a too

612
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
come up and then probably just do a too
 

613
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,110
come up and then probably just do a too
high portal would be fine

614
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
high portal would be fine
 

615
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,269
high portal would be fine
i hope see

616
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
i hope see
 

617
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,829
i hope see
i think that's okay we can come back

618
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839

 

619
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,949

very good i've never made a portal

620
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
very good i've never made a portal
 

621
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,470
very good i've never made a portal
this big before

622
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480

 

623
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,269

all right i brought in flint and steel

624
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
all right i brought in flint and steel
 

625
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:52,230
all right i brought in flint and steel
let's make sure it works

626
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240

 

627
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,710

i thought that would have worked what

628
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
i thought that would have worked what
 

629
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,189
i thought that would have worked what
did i do wrong

630
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
did i do wrong
 

631
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,590
did i do wrong
ah darn it uh i might go check creative

632
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
ah darn it uh i might go check creative
 

633
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,550
ah darn it uh i might go check creative
really quick because uh maybe it needs

634
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
really quick because uh maybe it needs
 

635
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,350
really quick because uh maybe it needs
to be taller

636
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
to be taller
 

637
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,389
to be taller
i'm not sure

638
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399

 

639
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,509

okay i'm back let's give this a try

640
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519

 

641
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,350

need to be one block taller so three

642
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
need to be one block taller so three
 

643
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,030
need to be one block taller so three
tall

644
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
tall
 

645
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,509
tall
so yes the idea is they will fall down

646
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
so yes the idea is they will fall down
 

647
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,350
so yes the idea is they will fall down
and this forces them right into the

648
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
and this forces them right into the
 

649
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,829
and this forces them right into the
portal

650
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
portal
 

651
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,870
portal
so they should instantly pretty much

652
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
so they should instantly pretty much
 

653
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,550
so they should instantly pretty much
teleport into there took us to the

654
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
teleport into there took us to the
 

655
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,230
teleport into there took us to the
snowflake

656
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240

 

657
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,470

just gonna take me back oh it did

658
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
just gonna take me back oh it did
 

659
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,629
just gonna take me back oh it did
oh because it's up high that's why i'm

660
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
oh because it's up high that's why i'm
 

661
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,230
oh because it's up high that's why i'm
not gonna be able to leave here

662
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240

 

663
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,590

because they uh oh oh

664
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
because they uh oh oh
 

665
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,790
because they uh oh oh
i'm having some pretty bad leg spikes

666
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
i'm having some pretty bad leg spikes
 

667
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,870
i'm having some pretty bad leg spikes
i think because of 174 i'm not sure

668
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
i think because of 174 i'm not sure
 

669
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,829
i think because of 174 i'm not sure
what's causing it but yeah that looks

670
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
what's causing it but yeah that looks
 

671
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,670
what's causing it but yeah that looks
like that's gonna work so that

672
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
like that's gonna work so that
 

673
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,430
like that's gonna work so that
is fantastic uh i'm gonna set up a few

674
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
is fantastic uh i'm gonna set up a few
 

675
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,069
is fantastic uh i'm gonna set up a few
more of them

676
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
more of them
 

677
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,269
more of them
maybe and we will try it out

678
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
maybe and we will try it out
 

679
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,870
maybe and we will try it out
and then we gotta set up like a killing

680
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
and then we gotta set up like a killing
 

681
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,189
and then we gotta set up like a killing
system on the other side

682
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
system on the other side
 

683
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,870
system on the other side
or or at least some way of storing them

684
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
or or at least some way of storing them
 

685
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,310
or or at least some way of storing them
so we can see what happens

686
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
so we can see what happens
 

687
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,949
so we can see what happens
the the main issue with this setup

688
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
the the main issue with this setup
 

689
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,990
the the main issue with this setup
though is i have to be

690
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
though is i have to be
 

691
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,030

let too many zombie pigmen through the
 

695
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,150
let too many zombie pigmen through the
portal and not take care of them

696

it
 

709
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,030
it
we're gonna try out this half first it's

710
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
we're gonna try out this half first it's
 

711
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,670
we're gonna try out this half first it's
gonna not be running at full speed as if

712
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
gonna not be running at full speed as if
 

713
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,269
gonna not be running at full speed as if
we did the whole thing but i just want

717
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,430

let me change all these to two um

718
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
let me change all these to two um
 

719
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,790
let me change all these to two um
now that i see that i'm glad i saw that

720
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
the the pist the piston left a block
 

723
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,870
the the pist the piston left a block
behind it looks like it glitched out

724
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
behind it looks like it glitched out
 

725
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,230
behind it looks like it glitched out
but if these are two it shouldn't do

726
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
but if these are two it shouldn't do
 

727
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,309
but if these are two it shouldn't do
that

728

743
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,190
though i'm like within the area they're
still spawning somehow

744
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
still spawning somehow
 

745
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,350
still spawning somehow
um but yeah we're gonna light these

746
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
um but yeah we're gonna light these
 

747

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
portals up
 

749
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,430
portals up
we're going to go on the ceiling

750
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
we're going to go on the ceiling
 

751
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,190
we're going to go on the ceiling
bye-bye

752
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200

 

753
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,510

i've heard if you have too much portal

754
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
i've heard if you have too much portal
 

755
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,549
i've heard if you have too much portal
blocks you get

756
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
blocks you get
 

757
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,990
blocks you get
lag um

758
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000

 

759
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,110

yeah we'll have to just see what happens

760
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
yeah we'll have to just see what happens
 

761
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,470
yeah we'll have to just see what happens
here i only did half because

762
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
here i only did half because
 

763
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,669
here i only did half because
this is either going to be really

764
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
this is either going to be really
 

765
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,909
this is either going to be really
awesome or really a

766
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
awesome or really a
 

767
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,669
awesome or really a
big waste of time i think so i don't

768
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
big waste of time i think so i don't
 

769
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,270
big waste of time i think so i don't
want to waste the other half

770
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
want to waste the other half
 

771
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,230
want to waste the other half
of my time if it is a a failure

772
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240

 

773
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,150

we got it we got it we did it um

774
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
we got it we got it we did it um
 

775
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,830
we got it we got it we did it um
gonna go up on the ceiling and just sit

776
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
gonna go up on the ceiling and just sit
 

777
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,350
gonna go up on the ceiling and just sit
there for a little bit and then

778
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
there for a little bit and then
 

779
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,830
there for a little bit and then
i'm gonna come back down go through the

780
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
i'm gonna come back down go through the
 

781
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,270
i'm gonna come back down go through the
portal and we should

782
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
portal and we should
 

783
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,870
portal and we should
possibly see

784
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880

 

785
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,710

although this portal goes to a different

786
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
although this portal goes to a different
 

787
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,789
although this portal goes to a different
place

788
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
place
 

789
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,630
place
doesn't go to the snowflake that could

790
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
doesn't go to the snowflake that could
 

791
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,470
doesn't go to the snowflake that could
be a problem

792
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
be a problem
 

793
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,789
be a problem
huh

794
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799

 

795
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,549

all right second thought i gotta disable

796
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
all right second thought i gotta disable
 

797
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,990
all right second thought i gotta disable
that snowflake portal i think

798
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000

 

799
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,110

because this takes us to the library

800
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
because this takes us to the library
 

801
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,470
because this takes us to the library
hey

802
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480

 

803
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,310

all right everyone so here we are on top

all right everyone so here we are on top
 

805
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,070
all right everyone so here we are on top
of the nether ceiling up at the very

806
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
of the nether ceiling up at the very
 

807
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,230
of the nether ceiling up at the very
tippy tippy top of my world at y230

808
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
tippy tippy top of my world at y230
 

809
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,190
tippy tippy top of my world at y230
um some stuff is happening i can tell

810
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
um some stuff is happening i can tell
 

811
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,390

you that for sure
i am getting lag

814
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
i am getting lag
 

815
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,830
i am getting lag
uh which makes me want to get down here

816
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
uh which makes me want to get down here
 

817
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,590
uh which makes me want to get down here
from here very quickly

818
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
from here very quickly
 

819
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,669
from here very quickly
but uh like i'm having like blocks come

820
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
but uh like i'm having like blocks come
 

821
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,070
but uh like i'm having like blocks come
back

822
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
back
 

823
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,230
back
and stuff like it's almost like server

824
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
and stuff like it's almost like server
 

825
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,190
and stuff like it's almost like server
lag

826
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
lag
 

827
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,270
lag
so things are definitely going through

828
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
so things are definitely going through
 

829
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,230
so things are definitely going through
the portal and they

830
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
the portal and they
 

831
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,150
the portal and they
are causing a lot of lag

832
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
are causing a lot of lag
 

833
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,830
are causing a lot of lag
that's all i know so far i've been up

834
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
that's all i know so far i've been up
 

835
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,590
that's all i know so far i've been up
here maybe a minute or two it hasn't

836
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
here maybe a minute or two it hasn't
 

837
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,950
here maybe a minute or two it hasn't
been long at all

838
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
been long at all
 

839
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,710
been long at all
i feel we should go check it just in

840
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
i feel we should go check it just in
 

841
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,549
i feel we should go check it just in
case i'm doing something

842
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
case i'm doing something
 

843
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,830
case i'm doing something
very wrong to my world i took out the

844
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
very wrong to my world i took out the
 

845
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,669
very wrong to my world i took out the
library portal instead of the snowflake

846
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
library portal instead of the snowflake
 

847
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,710
library portal instead of the snowflake
one so we should

848
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
one so we should
 

849
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,909
one so we should
meet up with the pigmen here

850
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919

 

851
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,150

oh it created a new portal

852
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160

 

853
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,270

huh

854
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280

 

855
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,590

okay darn it test is invalid

856
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600

it changes and then it freezes i think

906
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
it changes and then it freezes i think
 

907
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,470
it changes and then it freezes i think
that's lag every time it freezes like

908
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
that's lag every time it freezes like
 

909

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
i finished setting up the gold farm and
 

1105
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,789
i finished setting up the gold farm and
i'm anxiously

1106
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
i'm anxiously
 

1107
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,630
i'm anxiously
awaiting testing it i think it's going

awaiting testing it i think it's going
 

1109
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,230
awaiting testing it i think it's going
to be awesome

to be awesome
 

1111
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,230
to be awesome
but when i went to test the portals like

1112
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
but when i went to test the portals like
 

1113
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,630
but when i went to test the portals like
when i went through

1114
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
when i went through
 

1115
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,470
when i went through
um some of them worked some of them

1116
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
um some of them worked some of them
 

1117
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,950
um some of them worked some of them
took me off way out like negative 400

1118
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
took me off way out like negative 400
 

1119
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,310
took me off way out like negative 400
x and and created a new portal out there

1120
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
x and and created a new portal out there
 

1121
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,110
x and and created a new portal out there
instead of

1122
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120
instead of
 

1123
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,110
instead of
connecting with one of my existing ones

1124
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
connecting with one of my existing ones
 

1125
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,470
connecting with one of my existing ones
here

1126
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
here
 

1127
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,590
here
so i've tried to center

1128
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
so i've tried to center
 

1129
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,149
so i've tried to center
a portal as best as i can on the whole

1130
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
a portal as best as i can on the whole
 

1131
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,029
a portal as best as i can on the whole
farm

1132
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
farm
 

1133
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,430
farm
this is where it should go

1134
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440

 

1135
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,789

um this is the same y-coordinate same

1136
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
um this is the same y-coordinate same
 

1137
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,070
um this is the same y-coordinate same
y-shape as this is y 105.

1138
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
y-shape as this is y 105.
 

1139
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,029
y-shape as this is y 105.
it's one block higher than it should be

1140
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
it's one block higher than it should be
 

1141
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,350
it's one block higher than it should be
um

1142
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
um
 

1143
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,070
um
i think most of these it's gonna work

1144
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
i think most of these it's gonna work
 

1145
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,789
i think most of these it's gonna work
here we can try this out

1146
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799

 

1147
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,390

1148
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
yeah okay it took us back here that's
 

1149
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,549
yeah okay it took us back here that's
what we want

1150
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
what we want
 

1151
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,990
what we want
um some of them were not connecting with

1152
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
um some of them were not connecting with
 

1153
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,230
um some of them were not connecting with
the snowflake which is why i decided

1154
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
the snowflake which is why i decided
 

1155
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,909
the snowflake which is why i decided
to move it but even with this

1156
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
to move it but even with this
 

1157
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,710
to move it but even with this
in the right place if i go to the

1158
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
in the right place if i go to the
 

1159
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,669
in the right place if i go to the
portals in the corners

1160
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
portals in the corners
 

1161
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,350
portals in the corners
like the corner of the portals as far

1162
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
like the corner of the portals as far
 

1163
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,269
like the corner of the portals as far
away as i can

1164
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
away as i can
 

1165
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,310
away as i can
like this this is the very corner

1166
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320

 

1167
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,510

and when we go through

1168
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
and when we go through
 

1169
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,430
and when we go through
x negative 32 zed 28

1170
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440

 

1171
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,669

it just it creates a new portal for some

1172
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
it just it creates a new portal for some
 

1173
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,669
it just it creates a new portal for some
reason

1174
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
reason
 

1175
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,590
reason
which is weird it's very weird because i

1176
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
which is weird it's very weird because i
 

1177
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,389
which is weird it's very weird because i
was under the impression

1178
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
was under the impression
 

1179
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,590
was under the impression
that as long as you've got a portal in

1180
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
that as long as you've got a portal in
 

1181
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,310
that as long as you've got a portal in
the overworld here within a thousand

1182
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
the overworld here within a thousand
 

1183
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,789
the overworld here within a thousand
24 blocks it should connect with it

1184
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
24 blocks it should connect with it
 

1185
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,590
24 blocks it should connect with it
which

1186
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:43,600
which
 

1187
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,310
which
that one definitely is

1188
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
that one definitely is
 

1189
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,029
that one definitely is
very strange very strange but i think

very strange very strange but i think
i'm going to try this out

1192
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
i'm going to try this out
 

1193
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,510
i'm going to try this out
even with this problem i'm not sure what

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,269
right there
for example imagine that 15 villagers is

1362
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
for example imagine that 15 villagers is
 

1363
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,110
for example imagine that 15 villagers is
supposed to be your max

1364
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
supposed to be your max
 

1365
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,870
supposed to be your max
if you have 10 villagers some of them

1366
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
if you have 10 villagers some of them
 

1367
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,710
if you have 10 villagers some of them
will start breeding so let's say every

1368
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
will start breeding so let's say every
 

1369
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,310
will start breeding so let's say every
set of two breeds

1370
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
set of two breeds
 

1371
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,470
set of two breeds
we now have five child villagers plus

1372
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,480
we now have five child villagers plus
 

1373
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,909
we now have five child villagers plus
the original ten however

1374
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
the original ten however
 

1375
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,590
the original ten however
the village will still only count ten

1376
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
the village will still only count ten
 

1377
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,990
the village will still only count ten
villagers therefore it is possible for

1378
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
villagers therefore it is possible for
 

1379
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,590
villagers therefore it is possible for
those villagers to breed yet again

1380
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
those villagers to breed yet again
 

1381
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,310
those villagers to breed yet again
before the children grow up

1382
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320

 

1383
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,470

also even if some of them grow up let's

1384
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
also even if some of them grow up let's
 

1385
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,590
also even if some of them grow up let's
say that all

1386
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
say that all
 

1387
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,149
say that all
have except for the 15th villager all of

1388
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
have except for the 15th villager all of
 

1389
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:36,950
have except for the 15th villager all of
those new

1390
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
those new
 

1391
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,029
those new
adult villagers will now be willing to

1392
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
adult villagers will now be willing to
 

1393
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,110
adult villagers will now be willing to
breed meaning if all of the villagers

1394
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
breed meaning if all of the villagers
 

1395
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,110
breed meaning if all of the villagers
were to breed again we would have yet

1396
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
were to breed again we would have yet
 

1397
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,909
were to breed again we would have yet
another seven child villagers meaning

1398
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
another seven child villagers meaning
 

1399
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,509
another seven child villagers meaning
you could very possibly get

1400
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
you could very possibly get
 

1401
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,310
you could very possibly get
around 22 villagers in a village that

1402
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
around 22 villagers in a village that
 

1403
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,070
around 22 villagers in a village that
was meant to have a max of 15.

1404
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080

 

1405
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,590

that i think that's exactly what

1406
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
that i think that's exactly what
 

1407
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,110
that i think that's exactly what
happened because i have about 22

1408
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,120
happened because i have about 22
 

1409
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,710
happened because i have about 22
villagers in the village

1410
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
villagers in the village
 

1411
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,950
villagers in the village
all grown up and they stopped breeding

1412
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:02,960
all grown up and they stopped breeding
 

1413
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,990
all grown up and they stopped breeding
so

1414
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
so
 

1415
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,630
so
that's why it went over the limit of 15

1416
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:06,640
that's why it went over the limit of 15
 

1417
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,190
that's why it went over the limit of 15
and there was no need to panic

1418
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
and there was no need to panic
 

1419
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,389
and there was no need to panic
