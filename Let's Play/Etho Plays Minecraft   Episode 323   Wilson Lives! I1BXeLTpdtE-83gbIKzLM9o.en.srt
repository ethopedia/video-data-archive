then i'll attach a wire and then we'll

244
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
then i'll attach a wire and then we'll
 

245
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,469
then i'll attach a wire and then we'll
boot him up so

246
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
boot him up so
 

247
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,230
boot him up so
i think it'll be okay he might be a

248
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
i think it'll be okay he might be a
 

249
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,990
i think it'll be okay he might be a
little too easy i'm guessing

250
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
little too easy i'm guessing
 

251
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,629
little too easy i'm guessing
like i think i can neglect him for quite

252
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
like i think i can neglect him for quite
 

253
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,150
like i think i can neglect him for quite
a bit and he won't

254
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
a bit and he won't
 

255
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,710
a bit and he won't
die on us which isn't a good thing i

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,749
die on us which isn't a good thing i
think

258
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
think
 

259
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,510
think
if i neglect him he should die pretty

260
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
if i neglect him he should die pretty
 

261

three hearts cool

298
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
three hearts cool
 

299
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,550
three hearts cool
all right so we got that let's make sure

300
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
all right so we got that let's make sure
 

301
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,790
all right so we got that let's make sure
this is blinking yep

302
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
this is blinking yep
 

303
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,150
this is blinking yep
so every now and then he'll step on the

304
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
so every now and then he'll step on the
 

305
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,670
so every now and then he'll step on the
pressure plate down there and that makes

306
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
pressure plate down there and that makes
 

307
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,550
pressure plate down there and that makes
this blink

308
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
this blink
 

309
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,270
this blink
if i'm over 32 blocks away from him the

310
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
if i'm over 32 blocks away from him the
 

311
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,189
if i'm over 32 blocks away from him the
mob becomes inactive the snow golem and

312
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
mob becomes inactive the snow golem and
 

313
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,749
mob becomes inactive the snow golem and
he won't walk

314
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
he won't walk
 

315
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,310
he won't walk
anymore so this stops blinking so i'm

316
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
anymore so this stops blinking so i'm
 

317
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,110
anymore so this stops blinking so i'm
going to run this to his happiness meter

318
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
going to run this to his happiness meter
 

319
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,189
going to run this to his happiness meter
to increase it so i got to run a wire

320
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
to increase it so i got to run a wire
 

321
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,990
to increase it so i got to run a wire
all the way to

322
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
all the way to
 

323
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,350
all the way to
to here no i it's got to go

324
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
to here no i it's got to go
 

325
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,110
to here no i it's got to go
to this wire it's going to connect to

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
this dropper power that dropper puts an
 

329
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,790
this dropper power that dropper puts an
ender pearl into there and then the

330
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
ender pearl into there and then the
 

331
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,710
ender pearl into there and then the
comparator reads it

332
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
comparator reads it
 

333
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,629
comparator reads it
um all my item frames have popped off

stuff it's all controlled here
in this hopper clock so that should be

432
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
in this hopper clock so that should be
 

433
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,830
in this hopper clock so that should be
pretty good

434
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
pretty good
 

435
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,710

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,750
kind of in the middle of nowhere but
we've been here many times before this

740
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
we've been here many times before this
 

741
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,949
we've been here many times before this
is about two

742
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
is about two
 

743
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,110
is about two
300 blocks away from the man cave uh

744
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
300 blocks away from the man cave uh
 

745
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,230
300 blocks away from the man cave uh
this is where we did

746
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
this is where we did
 

747
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,350
this is where we did
the realistic caving adventure that one

748
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
the realistic caving adventure that one
 

749
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,670
the realistic caving adventure that one
time

750
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
time
 

751
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,110
time
in this cave let's go check that out

752
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
in this cave let's go check that out
 

753
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,670
in this cave let's go check that out
actually just really quick here

754
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
actually just really quick here
 

755
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,550
actually just really quick here
it's been a while that came to an end by

756
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
it's been a while that came to an end by
 

757
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,910
it's been a while that came to an end by
the way if people were wondering what

758
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
the way if people were wondering what
 

759
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,509
the way if people were wondering what
happened the goal with that was to see

760
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
happened the goal with that was to see
 

761
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,350
happened the goal with that was to see
how far i could get without

762
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
how far i could get without
 

763
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,829
how far i could get without
bringing any iron with me and

764
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
bringing any iron with me and
 

765
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,750
bringing any iron with me and
yeah i ran out of iron i couldn't make

766
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
yeah i ran out of iron i couldn't make
 

767
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,189
yeah i ran out of iron i couldn't make
any more tracks

768
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
any more tracks
 

769
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,829
any more tracks
so it hit a dead end eventually but we

770
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
so it hit a dead end eventually but we
 

771
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,430
so it hit a dead end eventually but we
made it pretty far with that actually

772
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
made it pretty far with that actually
 

773
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,350
made it pretty far with that actually
this is also where i did the speed

774
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
this is also where i did the speed
 

775
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,189
this is also where i did the speed
mining things so i have a haste 2 beacon

776
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
mining things so i have a haste 2 beacon
 

777
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,150
mining things so i have a haste 2 beacon
out here

778
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
out here
 

779
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,269
out here
which is perfect for our obsidian farm

780
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
which is perfect for our obsidian farm
 

781
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,870
which is perfect for our obsidian farm
because we want to mine it as quick as

782
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
because we want to mine it as quick as
 

783
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,310
because we want to mine it as quick as
possible

784
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
possible
 

785
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,310
possible
and i got one of these special portals

786
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
and i got one of these special portals
 

787
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,310
and i got one of these special portals
that closes on itself once you go

788
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
that closes on itself once you go
 

789
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,030
that closes on itself once you go
through

790
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040

 

791
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,949

so the lower dispenser has a flint and

792
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
so the lower dispenser has a flint and
 

793
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,870
so the lower dispenser has a flint and
steel for lighting the portal

794
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
steel for lighting the portal
 

795
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,069
steel for lighting the portal
upper one has a water bucket this

796
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
upper one has a water bucket this
 

797
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,670
upper one has a water bucket this
dispenser

798
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
dispenser
 

799
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,069
dispenser
triggers twice so it it drops the budget

800
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
triggers twice so it it drops the budget
 

801
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,430
triggers twice so it it drops the budget
to break the portal and then it picks it

802
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
to break the portal and then it picks it
 

803
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,189
to break the portal and then it picks it
up right away before the water spills

804
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
up right away before the water spills
 

805
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,470
up right away before the water spills
everywhere

806
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
everywhere
 

807
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,069
everywhere
and the portal closes 41 ticks after

808
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
and the portal closes 41 ticks after
 

809
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,590
and the portal closes 41 ticks after
it opens so

810
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
it opens so
 

811
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,990
it opens so
if we go through

812
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000

 

813
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,829

here the piston it just closed right

814
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
here the piston it just closed right
 

815
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,509
here the piston it just closed right
when we went through

816
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
when we went through
 

817
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,269
when we went through
so now when we go back since there's no

818
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
so now when we go back since there's no
 

819
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,310
so now when we go back since there's no
overworld portal there anymore

820
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
overworld portal there anymore
 

821
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,350
overworld portal there anymore
it has to create a new one

822
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
it has to create a new one
 

823
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,550
it has to create a new one
and let's see i'm trying to

824
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
and let's see i'm trying to
 

825
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,389
and let's see i'm trying to
it's definitely an obsidian farm already

826
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
it's definitely an obsidian farm already
 

827
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,710
it's definitely an obsidian farm already
but i'm trying to learn how this works

828
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
but i'm trying to learn how this works
 

829
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,550
but i'm trying to learn how this works
to be honest i'm not just

830
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
to be honest i'm not just
 

831
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,150
to be honest i'm not just
trying to get obsidian here i'm trying

832
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
trying to get obsidian here i'm trying
 

833
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,949
trying to get obsidian here i'm trying
to figure out how it decides where to

834
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
to figure out how it decides where to
 

835
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,629
to figure out how it decides where to
spawn the portal if you see these

836
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
spawn the portal if you see these
 

837
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,509
spawn the portal if you see these
cuts in the ground like there was a

838
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
cuts in the ground like there was a
 

839
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,790
cuts in the ground like there was a
portal here once

840
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
portal here once
 

841
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,110
portal here once
there was a portal here once i think a

842
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
there was a portal here once i think a
 

843
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,030
there was a portal here once i think a
portal formed here once

844
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
portal formed here once
 

845
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,310
portal formed here once
uh here here and now here

846
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
uh here here and now here
 

847
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,150
uh here here and now here
i'm wondering if there's a way where we

848
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
i'm wondering if there's a way where we
 

849
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,069
i'm wondering if there's a way where we
can

850
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
can
 

851
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,790
can
force it to spawn in a specific spot and

852
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
force it to spawn in a specific spot and
 

853
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,069
force it to spawn in a specific spot and
if there is

854
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
if there is
 

855
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,390
if there is
we might be able to take this to another

856
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
we might be able to take this to another
 

857
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,350
we might be able to take this to another
level

858
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
level
 

859
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,949
level
of like an afk obsidian farm

860
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
of like an afk obsidian farm
 

861
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,110
of like an afk obsidian farm
if we can control it so

862
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
if we can control it so
 

863
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,630
if we can control it so
of course by the time i figure that out

864
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:16,640
of course by the time i figure that out
 

865
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,630
of course by the time i figure that out
i'm going to have so much obsidian

866
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
i'm going to have so much obsidian
 

867
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,630
i'm going to have so much obsidian
uh i won't need it because i have to

868
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
uh i won't need it because i have to
 

869
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,390
uh i won't need it because i have to
break the portal every time

870
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
break the portal every time
 

871
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,309
break the portal every time
and i'm already up to let's see

872
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
and i'm already up to let's see
 

873
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,510
and i'm already up to let's see
over two stacks already oh man

874
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
over two stacks already oh man
 

875
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,029
over two stacks already oh man
so here's a test i want to try no sun is

876
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
so here's a test i want to try no sun is
 

877
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,230
so here's a test i want to try no sun is
setting

878
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
setting
 

879
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,710
setting
i'm going to lower this all one

880
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720

 

881
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,190

right because every time it spawns in

882
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
right because every time it spawns in
 

883
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,230
right because every time it spawns in
the portal it

884
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
the portal it
 

885
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,390
the portal it
takes out four blocks below it so i'm

886
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
takes out four blocks below it so i'm
 

887
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,430
takes out four blocks below it so i'm
wondering if we

888
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
wondering if we
 

889
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,710
wondering if we
like gave it a thing to target

890
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
like gave it a thing to target
 

891
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,549
like gave it a thing to target
like that like if if it'll make the

892
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
like that like if if it'll make the
 

893
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,150
like that like if if it'll make the
portal right here because it's

894
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
portal right here because it's
 

895
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,669
portal right here because it's
it's higher higher ground which it seems

896
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
it's higher higher ground which it seems
 

897
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,669
it's higher higher ground which it seems
to

898
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
to
 

899
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,669
to
prefer maybe i don't know let's sleep

900
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
prefer maybe i don't know let's sleep
 

901
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,270
prefer maybe i don't know let's sleep
really quick here before we try this so

902
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
really quick here before we try this so
 

903
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,750
really quick here before we try this so
i don't want mobs around

904
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
i don't want mobs around
 

905
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,150
i don't want mobs around
there is a bed here

906
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160

 

907
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,590

um don't know

908
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
um don't know
 

909
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,710
um don't know
like the rules to how it decides

910
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
like the rules to how it decides
 

911
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,390
like the rules to how it decides
where to put the portal um

912
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
where to put the portal um
 

913
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,310
where to put the portal um
sometimes i wish i had like access to

914
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
sometimes i wish i had like access to
 

915
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,909
sometimes i wish i had like access to
the game code

916
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
the game code
 

917
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,230
the game code
because that would make a lot of things

918
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
because that would make a lot of things
 

919
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,669
because that would make a lot of things
very simple

920
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
very simple
 

921
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,470
very simple
all right and i'm trying to make sure i

922
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
all right and i'm trying to make sure i
 

923
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,430
all right and i'm trying to make sure i
go through at the

924
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
go through at the
 

925
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,190
go through at the
exact same spot every time so 88 12

926
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
exact same spot every time so 88 12
 

927
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,750
exact same spot every time so 88 12
this spot not here if i went in this

928
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
this spot not here if i went in this
 

929
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,190
this spot not here if i went in this
block it would take us to a different

930
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
block it would take us to a different
 

931
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,029
block it would take us to a different
spot

932
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039

 

933
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,310

alright

934
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320

 

935
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,190

oh formed right by it that's interesting

936
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200

 

937
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,350

okay let's break this

938
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
okay let's break this
 

939
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,390
okay let's break this
and also went lower too

940
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400

 

941
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,710

okay if this doesn't work i have another

942
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
okay if this doesn't work i have another
 

943
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,150
okay if this doesn't work i have another
idea maybe we can

944
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
idea maybe we can
 

945
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,750
idea maybe we can
put pressure plates on the ground and

946
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
put pressure plates on the ground and
 

947
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,710
put pressure plates on the ground and
see what it does

948
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720

 

949
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,549

if that doesn't work we can put

950
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
if that doesn't work we can put
 

951
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,390
if that doesn't work we can put
structures

952
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
structures
 

953
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,830
structures
and i don't know we gotta find some kind

954
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
and i don't know we gotta find some kind
 

955
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,870
and i don't know we gotta find some kind
of surface it won't

956
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
of surface it won't
 

957
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,630
of surface it won't
spawn on

958
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
spawn on
 

959
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,070
spawn on
let's see if it goes to the same spot

960
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
let's see if it goes to the same spot
 

961
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,830
let's see if it goes to the same spot
again i kind of doubt it will

962
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840

 

963
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,470

all right it might kind of i wonder if

964
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
all right it might kind of i wonder if
 

965
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,750
all right it might kind of i wonder if
it depends where i'm standing

966
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
it depends where i'm standing
 

967
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,990
it depends where i'm standing
i should try to force myself to line

968
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
i should try to force myself to line
 

969
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,590
i should try to force myself to line
perfectly when i go through too so i'm

970
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
perfectly when i go through too so i'm
 

971
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,909
perfectly when i go through too so i'm
going to go right into the corner

972
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919

 

973
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,710

like a fraction of my position might

974
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
like a fraction of my position might
 

975
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,870
like a fraction of my position might
affect it

976
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
affect it
 

977
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,510
affect it
all right so it went there let's break

978
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
all right so it went there let's break
 

979
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,750
all right so it went there let's break
it one more time

980
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
it one more time
 

981
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,909
it one more time
go through at the exact same spot and

982
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
go through at the exact same spot and
 

983
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,029
go through at the exact same spot and
see if that works

984
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039

 

985
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,430

um and if not i'll experiment with a few

986
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
um and if not i'll experiment with a few
 

987
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,710
um and if not i'll experiment with a few
other things

988
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720

 

989
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,789

i hate breaking it every time come on

990
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
i hate breaking it every time come on
 

991
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,029
i hate breaking it every time come on
this is efficiency five pick and haste

992
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
this is efficiency five pick and haste
 

993
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,830
this is efficiency five pick and haste
two so this is as quick as you can break

994
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
two so this is as quick as you can break
 

995
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,270
two so this is as quick as you can break
it

996
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
it
 

997
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,310
it
and it still seems so slow all right

998
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320

 

999
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,470

so we're gonna go through again exactly

1000
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
so we're gonna go through again exactly
 

1001
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,070
so we're gonna go through again exactly
the same position when we go

1002
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
the same position when we go
 

1003
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,350
the same position when we go
go through the portal and see if that's

1004
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
go through the portal and see if that's
 

1005
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,909
go through the portal and see if that's
what determines it

1006
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
what determines it
 

1007
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,590
what determines it
so i want to line right in the corner

1008
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
so i want to line right in the corner
 

1009
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,549
so i want to line right in the corner
again

1010
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559

 

1011
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,190

okay 88.3 12.3

1012
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200

 

1013
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,830

and you know what i can't remember where

1014
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
and you know what i can't remember where
 

1015
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,430
and you know what i can't remember where
it spawned last time

1016
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
it spawned last time
 

1017
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,149
it spawned last time
i'm gonna check the the recording i i

1018
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
i'm gonna check the the recording i i
 

1019
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,750
i'm gonna check the the recording i i
know it spawned there once i don't know

1020
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
know it spawned there once i don't know
 

1021
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,310
know it spawned there once i don't know
if it was

1022
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
if it was
 

1023
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,789
if it was
their last time i think it spawned here

1024
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
their last time i think it spawned here
 

1025
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,830
their last time i think it spawned here
actually now that i think of it last

1026
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
actually now that i think of it last
 

1027
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,070
actually now that i think of it last
time

1028
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080

 

1029
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,070

uh-huh chicken get out of here you're

1030
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
uh-huh chicken get out of here you're
 

1031
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,990
uh-huh chicken get out of here you're
gonna wreck science

1032
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
gonna wreck science
 

1033
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,990
gonna wreck science
the experiment we're doing here don't

1034
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
the experiment we're doing here don't
 

1035
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,390
the experiment we're doing here don't
contaminate our field

1036
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
contaminate our field
 

1037
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,390
contaminate our field
um so i checked the video and

1038
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
um so i checked the video and
 

1039
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,070
um so i checked the video and
even though i went through the exact

1040
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
even though i went through the exact
 

1041
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,070
even though i went through the exact
same spot in the nether every time it

1042
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
same spot in the nether every time it
 

1043
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,510
same spot in the nether every time it
shows a random spot

1044
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
shows a random spot
 

1045
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,789
shows a random spot
each time uh to put the

1046
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
each time uh to put the
 

1047
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,390
each time uh to put the
nether portal so we can't control it

1048
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
nether portal so we can't control it
 

1049
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,870
nether portal so we can't control it
that way we're gonna try control it by

1050
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
that way we're gonna try control it by
 

1051
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,909
that way we're gonna try control it by
obstructing where it can spawn hopefully

1052
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
obstructing where it can spawn hopefully
 

1053
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,270
obstructing where it can spawn hopefully
pressure plates will do that we'll see

1054
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
pressure plates will do that we'll see
 

1055
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,310
pressure plates will do that we'll see
if it breaks them

1056
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
if it breaks them
 

1057
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,110
if it breaks them
i'm trying to target this area here and

1058
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
i'm trying to target this area here and
 

1059
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,230
i'm trying to target this area here and
there might not be enough pressure

1060
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
there might not be enough pressure
 

1061
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,870
there might not be enough pressure
blades

1062
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
blades
 

1063
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,149
blades
we'll see

1064
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
we'll see
 

1065
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,990
we'll see
this is a learning experience hopefully

1066
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
this is a learning experience hopefully
 

1067
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,390
this is a learning experience hopefully
the chickens stay away

1068
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
the chickens stay away
 

1069
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,669
the chickens stay away
not that they would affect it but still

1070
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
not that they would affect it but still
 

1071
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,270
not that they would affect it but still
yeah we're gonna line into the corner

1072
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
yeah we're gonna line into the corner
 

1073
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,950
yeah we're gonna line into the corner
every time though

1074
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
every time though
 

1075
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,630
every time though
just for consistency

1076
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640

 

1077
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,669

oh all right we might need more pressure

1078
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
oh all right we might need more pressure
 

1079
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,350
oh all right we might need more pressure
plates

1080
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360

 

1081
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,510

okay i have another idea for a test

1082
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
okay i have another idea for a test
 

1083
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,990
okay i have another idea for a test
from what i've noticed the portal always

1084
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,000
from what i've noticed the portal always
 

1085
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,710
from what i've noticed the portal always
seems to

1086
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
seems to
 

1087
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,830
seems to
spawn at four blocks that are at the

1088
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
spawn at four blocks that are at the
 

1089
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,830
spawn at four blocks that are at the
same height level

1090
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
same height level
 

1091
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,190
same height level
like if they're all together

1092
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
like if they're all together
 

1093
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,870
like if they're all together
but it won't for example spawn like here

1094
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
but it won't for example spawn like here
 

1095
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,029
but it won't for example spawn like here
here here and here because two of these

1096
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
here here and here because two of these
 

1097
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,110
here here and here because two of these
are up two of them are down

1098
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
are up two of them are down
 

1099
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,750
are up two of them are down
um i'm guessing i'm guessing this is

1100
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760
um i'm guessing i'm guessing this is
 

1101
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,270
um i'm guessing i'm guessing this is
just what i've noticed

1102
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
just what i've noticed
 

1103
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,830
just what i've noticed
while doing this so i kind of broke this

1104
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
while doing this so i kind of broke this
 

1105
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,350
while doing this so i kind of broke this
up in such a way that i think

1106
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
up in such a way that i think
 

1107
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,630
up in such a way that i think
no four blocks are together

1108
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
no four blocks are together
 

1109
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,390
no four blocks are together
could be wrong i kind of did it randomly

1110
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
could be wrong i kind of did it randomly
 

1111
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,669
could be wrong i kind of did it randomly
so i might have missed a few

1112
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679

 

1113
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,350

but let's try this out these are the

1114
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
but let's try this out these are the
 

1115
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,470
but let's try this out these are the
only four together in the middle

1116
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
only four together in the middle
 

1117
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,350
only four together in the middle
pretty sure like it can't spawn here i

1118
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
pretty sure like it can't spawn here i
 

1119
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,029
pretty sure like it can't spawn here i
don't think because

1120
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
don't think because
 

1121
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,990
don't think because
that's down this is up these are down

1122
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
that's down this is up these are down
 

1123
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,750
that's down this is up these are down
these pressure plant

1124
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
these pressure plant
 

1125
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,549
these pressure plant
pressure plants pressure plates count

1126
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
pressure plants pressure plates count
 

1127
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,470
pressure plants pressure plates count
those full blocks too for example so

1128
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
those full blocks too for example so
 

1129
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,430
those full blocks too for example so
this one's down

1130
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
this one's down
 

1131
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,710
this one's down
this is up this is down this is up this

1132
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
this is up this is down this is up this
 

1133
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,630
this is up this is down this is up this
is up this is up this is down up

1134
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
is up this is up this is down up
 

1135
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,750
is up this is up this is down up
down up you know um

1136
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
down up you know um
 

1137
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,830
down up you know um
anyway let's just try it see what

1138
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
anyway let's just try it see what
 

1139
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,950
anyway let's just try it see what
happens i'm probably gonna have a hard

1140
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
happens i'm probably gonna have a hard
 

1141
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,470
happens i'm probably gonna have a hard
time to tell

1142
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
time to tell
 

1143
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,350
time to tell
for sure until i review the video though

1144
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360

 

1145
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,310

all right here we go

1146
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
all right here we go
 

1147
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,870
all right here we go
it spawned outside of my uh range here

1148
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
it spawned outside of my uh range here
 

1149
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,590
it spawned outside of my uh range here
darn it

1150
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600

 

1151
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,269

uh that's the other question is how far

1152
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:43,279
uh that's the other question is how far
 

1153
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,830
uh that's the other question is how far
can it spawn away from its target spot

1154
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840

 

1155
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,590

hmm

1156
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
hmm
 

1157
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,510
hmm
man this is gonna be tough

1158
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
man this is gonna be tough
 

1159
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,269
man this is gonna be tough
um

1160
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279

 

1161
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,070

all right i might try this one more time

1162
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
all right i might try this one more time
 

1163
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,950
all right i might try this one more time
uh-huh so i managed to replicate a

1164
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
uh-huh so i managed to replicate a
 

1165
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,230
uh-huh so i managed to replicate a
glitch i did once

1166
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
glitch i did once
 

1167
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,149
glitch i did once
a long time ago and i wasn't able to

1168
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
a long time ago and i wasn't able to
 

1169
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,830
a long time ago and i wasn't able to
reproduce it

1170
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
reproduce it
 

1171
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,190
reproduce it
but uh check this out

1172
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
but uh check this out
 

1173
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,110
but uh check this out
that portal's off that portal's off that

1174
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
that portal's off that portal's off that
 

1175
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,470
that portal's off that portal's off that
one's off we're going to go through this

1176
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
one's off we're going to go through this
 

1177
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,149
one's off we're going to go through this
one it's going to close behind itself

1178
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
one it's going to close behind itself
 

1179
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,950
one it's going to close behind itself
like it does every time

1180
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960
like it does every time
 

1181
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,549
like it does every time
where do you think the new portal is

1182
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
where do you think the new portal is
 

1183
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,950
where do you think the new portal is
going to be this is a trick question now

1184
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
going to be this is a trick question now
 

1185
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,549
going to be this is a trick question now
where do you think the new portal is

1186
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
where do you think the new portal is
 

1187
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,789
where do you think the new portal is
going to be

1188
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
going to be
 

1189
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,630
going to be
we'll check it out

1190
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640

 

1191
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,029

oh it didn't work darn it

1192
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039

 

1193
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,630

oh man

1194
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
oh man
 

1195
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,630
oh man
i'm gonna try it one more time that

1196
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
i'm gonna try it one more time that
 

1197
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,990
i'm gonna try it one more time that
might have been a fluke

1198
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
might have been a fluke
 

1199
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,070
might have been a fluke
i think what happens or the way it works

1200
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
i think what happens or the way it works
 

1201
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,830
i think what happens or the way it works
by the way i think it tries to place the

1202
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
by the way i think it tries to place the
 

1203
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,149
by the way i think it tries to place the
portal several hundred times

1204
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
portal several hundred times
 

1205
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,710
portal several hundred times
and it keeps trying until it finds a

1206
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
and it keeps trying until it finds a
 

1207
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,990
and it keeps trying until it finds a
spot that's acceptable

1208
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
spot that's acceptable
 

1209
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,789
spot that's acceptable
and clearly the heights has to be the

1210
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
and clearly the heights has to be the
 

1211
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,789
and clearly the heights has to be the
same for all four blocks that's why it's

1212
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
same for all four blocks that's why it's
 

1213
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,190
same for all four blocks that's why it's
not

1214
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
not
 

1215
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,830
not
going anywhere here anymore it seems to

1216
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
going anywhere here anymore it seems to
 

1217
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,549
going anywhere here anymore it seems to
prefer

1218
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
prefer
 

1219
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,950
prefer
the center of where it's supposed to go

1220
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960

 

1221
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,390

which seems to be about there and you'll

1222
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
which seems to be about there and you'll
 

1223
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,230
which seems to be about there and you'll
notice every time it's placing it just

1224
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
notice every time it's placing it just
 

1225
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,390
notice every time it's placing it just
outside of my perimeter here where i've

1226
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
outside of my perimeter here where i've
 

1227
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,430
outside of my perimeter here where i've
put torches in

1228
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
put torches in
 

1229
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,310
put torches in
and junk to block it it's not like

1230
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
and junk to block it it's not like
 

1231
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,190
and junk to block it it's not like
placing it way out here for example

1232
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
placing it way out here for example
 

1233
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,669
placing it way out here for example
so that's kind of interesting but let's

1234
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
so that's kind of interesting but let's
 

1235
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,430
so that's kind of interesting but let's
try to do this glitch

1236
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
try to do this glitch
 

1237
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,470
try to do this glitch
i wanted to show it

1238
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480

 

1239
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,830

i did it twice in a row and now it's not

1240
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,840
i did it twice in a row and now it's not
 

1241
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,070
i did it twice in a row and now it's not
working

1242
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
working
 

1243
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,470
working
all right come on

1244
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480

 

1245
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,590

and nope okay i'll tell you what the

1246
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
and nope okay i'll tell you what the
 

1247
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,950
and nope okay i'll tell you what the
glitch is i guess

1248
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:52,960
glitch is i guess
 

1249
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,149
glitch is i guess
basically i went through the portal and

1250
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
basically i went through the portal and
 

1251
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,909
basically i went through the portal and
it took me to

1252
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:57,919
it took me to
 

1253
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,950
it took me to
this one here except the portal was out

1254
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
this one here except the portal was out
 

1255
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,630
this one here except the portal was out
it teleported me here even though the

1256
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
it teleported me here even though the
 

1257
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,590
it teleported me here even though the
portal was broken

1258
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
portal was broken
 

1259
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,630
portal was broken
which is a very rare rare thing but it

1260
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
which is a very rare rare thing but it
 

1261
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,669
which is a very rare rare thing but it
can happen i'm not sure why

1262
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
can happen i'm not sure why
 

1263
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,630
can happen i'm not sure why
um i can't seem to do it again

1264
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640

 

1265
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,070

okay it just happened three times in a

1266
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
okay it just happened three times in a
 

1267
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,669
okay it just happened three times in a
row i'm gonna try to show it one more

1268
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
row i'm gonna try to show it one more
 

1269
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,149
row i'm gonna try to show it one more
time

1270
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
time
 

1271
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,070
time
so all these portals are out it's

1272
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
so all these portals are out it's
 

1273
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,029
so all these portals are out it's
teleporting me to that one

1274
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
teleporting me to that one
 

1275
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,310
teleporting me to that one
let's see if we can do it again

1276
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
let's see if we can do it again
 

1277
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,310
let's see if we can do it again
three in a row it's better than the last

1278
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,320
three in a row it's better than the last
 

1279
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,149
three in a row it's better than the last
time

1280
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
time
 

1281
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,990
time
okay let's go back through

1282
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
okay let's go back through
 

1283
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,630
okay let's go back through
there we go check it out teleport me

1284
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
there we go check it out teleport me
 

1285
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,149
there we go check it out teleport me
here even though there's no portal and

1286
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
here even though there's no portal and
 

1287
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,149
here even though there's no portal and
it's broken

1288
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
it's broken
 

1289
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,870
it's broken
it's pretty weird

1290
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:48,880

 

1291
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,190

so that glitch is happening just about

1292
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
so that glitch is happening just about
 

1293
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,990
so that glitch is happening just about
every

1294
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
every
 

1295
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,630
every
time now actually um

1296
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
time now actually um
 

1297
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,269
time now actually um
i'm appearing there right now i think

1298
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
i'm appearing there right now i think
 

1299
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,630
i'm appearing there right now i think
what happens

1300
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
what happens
 

1301
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,310
what happens
it tries a certain number of times to

1302
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
it tries a certain number of times to
 

1303
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,990
it tries a certain number of times to
place a portal

1304
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,000
place a portal
 

1305
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,190
place a portal
if it doesn't find a proper spot in all

1306
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
if it doesn't find a proper spot in all
 

1307
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,310
if it doesn't find a proper spot in all
those tests

1308
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,320
those tests
 

1309
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,789
those tests
for all those tries i think it just

1310
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
for all those tries i think it just
 

1311
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,310
for all those tries i think it just
takes you to the last one you went

1312
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
takes you to the last one you went
 

1313
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,029
takes you to the last one you went
through

1314
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
through
 

1315
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,149
through
if it's in memory

1316
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159

 

1317
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,110

oh it took us here

1318
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
oh it took us here
 

1319
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,710
oh it took us here
i can almost guarantee we will go

1320
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
i can almost guarantee we will go
 

1321
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,710
i can almost guarantee we will go
through or we'll end up here even though

1322
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
through or we'll end up here even though
 

1323
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,430
through or we'll end up here even though
i just broke it

1324
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440

 

1325
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,190

it's pretty interesting

1326
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200

 

1327
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,750

very oddly though it hasn't spawned once

1328
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,760
very oddly though it hasn't spawned once
 

1329
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,669
very oddly though it hasn't spawned once
in that target area

1330
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
in that target area
 

1331
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,110
in that target area
so i don't know why that is yeah there

1332
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120
so i don't know why that is yeah there
 

1333
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,190
so i don't know why that is yeah there
we are

1334
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200

 

1335
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,230

it hasn't spawned here once

1336
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
it hasn't spawned here once
 

1337
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,549
it hasn't spawned here once
so for some reason i don't think it's
