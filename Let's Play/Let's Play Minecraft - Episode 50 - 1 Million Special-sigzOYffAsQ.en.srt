00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,780
I think one of the most requested things
I've been getting is that I finish this

166
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:50,790
I've been getting is that I finish this
 

167
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,180
I've been getting is that I finish this
minecart system and I finally got around

168
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,190
minecart system and I finally got around
 

169
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,990
minecart system and I finally got around
to doing it today works pretty good so

170
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
to doing it today works pretty good so
 

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,880
to doing it today works pretty good so
I'm going to show you guys how it works

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:04,890
I'm going to show you guys how it works
 

173
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm going to show you guys how it works
basically we got bled is it bla bla yeah

174
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,370
basically we got bled is it bla bla yeah
 

175
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:20,700
basically we got bled is it bla bla yeah
booster the door booster and it sends

176
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:20,710
booster the door booster and it sends
 

177
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,420
booster the door booster and it sends
this card around cart stops and momentum

178
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,430
this card around cart stops and momentum
 

179
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,210
this card around cart stops and momentum
gets reset the other cart hits that so

180
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:30,220
gets reset the other cart hits that so
 

181
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,370
gets reset the other cart hits that so
it's momentum gets reset so they want to

182
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:32,380
it's momentum gets reset so they want to
 

183
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,230
it's momentum gets reset so they want to
overload and then this car goes around

184
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,240
overload and then this car goes around
 

185
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,990
overload and then this car goes around
and the stack of mine carts goes over

186
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
and the stack of mine carts goes over
 

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,530
and the stack of mine carts goes over
here

188
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:40,540
here
 

189
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,550
here
the PEZ dispenser and this cart sends

190
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
the PEZ dispenser and this cart sends
 

191
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,190
the PEZ dispenser and this cart sends
one out they get boosted along here they

192
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,200
one out they get boosted along here they
 

193
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,159
one out they get boosted along here they
get boost it again here

194
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,169
get boost it again here
 

195
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:55,239
get boost it again here
and then they go to the hot and cold a

196
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:55,249
and then they go to the hot and cold a
 

197
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:59,989
and then they go to the hot and cold a
minecart extension which makes gives the

198
00:07:59,989 --> 00:07:59,999
minecart extension which makes gives the
 

199
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,059
minecart extension which makes gives the
option of having flaming mine carts if

200
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:02,069
option of having flaming mine carts if
 

201
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,850
option of having flaming mine carts if
you want mmm so yeah let's get this

202
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:07,860
you want mmm so yeah let's get this
 

203
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:34,639
you want mmm so yeah let's get this
going that's probably enough so I was

204
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:34,649
going that's probably enough so I was
 

205
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,069
going that's probably enough so I was
kind of hesitant to actually make this

206
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:37,079
kind of hesitant to actually make this
 

207
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:40,880
kind of hesitant to actually make this
thing because apparently it has quite a

208
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:40,890
thing because apparently it has quite a
 

209
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,829
thing because apparently it has quite a
bit of flaws as you shall soon see I

210
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:44,839
bit of flaws as you shall soon see I
 

211
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:51,199
bit of flaws as you shall soon see I
think right now I'm just loading them up

212
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,209
think right now I'm just loading them up
 

213
00:08:51,209 --> 00:09:04,340
think right now I'm just loading them up
here and yeah I killed those dogs

214
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,350
here and yeah I killed those dogs
 

215
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,380
here and yeah I killed those dogs
because they were getting in the way of

216
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,390
because they were getting in the way of
 

217
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,370
because they were getting in the way of
the mine carts which is causing them to

218
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:10,380
the mine carts which is causing them to
 

219
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:20,329
the mine carts which is causing them to
stall oh yeah these guys make way too

220
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:20,339
stall oh yeah these guys make way too
 

221
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:35,660
stall oh yeah these guys make way too
much noise in there so it was a real

222
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:35,670
much noise in there so it was a real
 

223
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,220
much noise in there so it was a real
challenge get them to make it all the

224
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,230
challenge get them to make it all the
 

225
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,860
challenge get them to make it all the
way around not an easy thing to do they

226
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:42,870
way around not an easy thing to do they
 

227
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,850
way around not an easy thing to do they
work pretty good like it's easy to get

228
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:46,860
work pretty good like it's easy to get
 

229
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,579
work pretty good like it's easy to get
around these corners are really tricky

230
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:49,589
around these corners are really tricky
 

231
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,660
around these corners are really tricky
though I don't like that let's get off

232
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:53,670
though I don't like that let's get off
 

233
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,160
though I don't like that let's get off
it's easy they go back down

234
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,170

 

235
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:08,280

cool and mmm

236
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,290
cool and mmm
 

237
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:15,190
cool and mmm
where to begin so yeah you can stop it

238
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
where to begin so yeah you can stop it
 

239
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,220
where to begin so yeah you can stop it
at any time by closing this door or if

240
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,230
at any time by closing this door or if
 

241
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,550
at any time by closing this door or if
you wanted you could hook up some

242
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:21,560
you wanted you could hook up some
 

243
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,110
you wanted you could hook up some
redstone clocks to it to regulate the

244
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,120
redstone clocks to it to regulate the
 

245
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,140
redstone clocks to it to regulate the
speed to slow it down if you want and it

246
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,150
speed to slow it down if you want and it
 

247
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:37,230
speed to slow it down if you want and it
just keeps going around and around I

248
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,240

 

249
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,070

don't know what the deal is with this

250
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,080
don't know what the deal is with this
 

251
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,500
don't know what the deal is with this
lever there were just cobblestone below

252
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:41,510
lever there were just cobblestone below
 

253
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,180
lever there were just cobblestone below
and I removed the cobblestone and now

254
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,190
and I removed the cobblestone and now
 

255
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,820
and I removed the cobblestone and now
the lever is here must be a new glitch

256
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:48,830
the lever is here must be a new glitch
 

257
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,170
the lever is here must be a new glitch
in the game and you'll notice these

258
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:53,180
in the game and you'll notice these
 

259
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,510
in the game and you'll notice these
minecarts make it back just in time as

260
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:55,520
minecarts make it back just in time as
 

261
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,030
minecarts make it back just in time as
the next minecart approaches there's a

262
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
the next minecart approaches there's a
 

263
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:15,820
the next minecart approaches there's a
little bit of gap there goes around so

264
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:15,830

 

265
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:22,000

try switch a hot cold yep

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,010
try switch a hot cold yep
 

267
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:34,520
try switch a hot cold yep
seems to work but the problems what are

268
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,530
seems to work but the problems what are
 

269
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,320
seems to work but the problems what are
the problems well if you leave the world

270
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,330
the problems well if you leave the world
 

271
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:45,620
the problems well if you leave the world
actually I'm going to leave the world

272
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:45,630
actually I'm going to leave the world
 

273
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,030
actually I'm going to leave the world
and this is proof that I don't go off in

274
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,040
and this is proof that I don't go off in
 

275
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,210
and this is proof that I don't go off in
other worlds to test things out they all

276
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,220
other worlds to test things out they all
 

277
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,730
other worlds to test things out they all
need to be converted still just the LP

278
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:55,740
need to be converted still just the LP
 

279
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:06,199
need to be converted still just the LP
world when I play in

280
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:06,209

 

281
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,920

and that is the flaw this is why I

282
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:10,930
and that is the flaw this is why I
 

283
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,110
and that is the flaw this is why I
wasn't excited to finish building this

284
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
wasn't excited to finish building this
 

285
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,040
wasn't excited to finish building this
because one of the guys I built it told

286
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,050
because one of the guys I built it told
 

287
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,860
because one of the guys I built it told
me that they freeze if you walk far away

288
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:22,870
me that they freeze if you walk far away
 

289
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,040
me that they freeze if you walk far away
from the minecarts and apparently they

290
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,050
from the minecarts and apparently they
 

291
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,949
from the minecarts and apparently they
also freeze if you leave the game so

292
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
also freeze if you leave the game so
 

293
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,550
also freeze if you leave the game so
kind of a major issue because the whole

294
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:35,560
kind of a major issue because the whole
 

295
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,100
kind of a major issue because the whole
point of this is to speed things up it's

296
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,110
point of this is to speed things up it's
 

297
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,780
point of this is to speed things up it's
supposed to be a convenience thing so I

298
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,790
supposed to be a convenience thing so I
 

299
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,689
supposed to be a convenience thing so I
can get around faster it's kind of

300
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:42,699
can get around faster it's kind of
 

301
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:46,019
can get around faster it's kind of
pointless if I have to get them going

302
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:46,029
pointless if I have to get them going
 

303
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:49,740
pointless if I have to get them going
every single time and also worry about

304
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:49,750
every single time and also worry about
 

305
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,620
every single time and also worry about
getting in their way if anything lands

306
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:52,630
getting in their way if anything lands
 

307
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,129
getting in their way if anything lands
on the track the minecarts are going to

308
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:56,139
on the track the minecarts are going to
 

309
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:02,069
on the track the minecarts are going to
stop if I have to destroy the minecarts

310
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
stop if I have to destroy the minecarts
 

311
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,019
stop if I have to destroy the minecarts
if they land in this stair area I can't

312
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,029
if they land in this stair area I can't
 

313
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,050
if they land in this stair area I can't
pick them up which is [ __ ] so I

314
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,060
pick them up which is [ __ ] so I
 

315
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,420
pick them up which is [ __ ] so I
actually have to destroy a log to pick

316
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,430
actually have to destroy a log to pick
 

317
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,509
actually have to destroy a log to pick
up the minecarts if I have to destroy

318
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:18,519
up the minecarts if I have to destroy
 

319
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,079
up the minecarts if I have to destroy
them

320
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:21,089

 

321
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:30,990

so just full of problems although it is

322
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,000
so just full of problems although it is
 

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,569
so just full of problems although it is
very cool I think

324
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:32,579
very cool I think
 

325
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,350
very cool I think
but yeah the negative kind of defeats

326
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
but yeah the negative kind of defeats
 

327
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,269
but yeah the negative kind of defeats
the pros so that's why I like eats Road

328
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
the pros so that's why I like eats Road
 

329
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,990
the pros so that's why I like eats Road
by the way because the eats road is

330
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,000
by the way because the eats road is
 

331
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,030
by the way because the eats road is
constantly boosted so even if you leave

332
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
constantly boosted so even if you leave
 

333
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,240
constantly boosted so even if you leave
the world they'll keep the boats will

334
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,250
the world they'll keep the boats will
 

335
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,949
the world they'll keep the boats will
keep going because they're always in a

336
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:55,959
keep going because they're always in a
 

337
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,420
keep going because they're always in a
booster minecarts they stop because they

338
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,430
booster minecarts they stop because they
 

339
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,819
booster minecarts they stop because they
only have boosted in the one spot or

340
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:02,829
only have boosted in the one spot or
 

341
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:07,129
only have boosted in the one spot or
whatever and then

342
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:07,139

 

343
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,289

then their velocity gets set to zero if

344
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:10,299
then their velocity gets set to zero if
 

345
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:15,619
then their velocity gets set to zero if
you leave the world or go out a range so

346
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:15,629
you leave the world or go out a range so
 

347
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:20,429
you leave the world or go out a range so
yeah but I'm not going to do a eats fro

348
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:20,439
yeah but I'm not going to do a eats fro
 

349
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,869
yeah but I'm not going to do a eats fro
thing either because I don't have a

350
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:21,879
thing either because I don't have a
 

351
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,909
thing either because I don't have a
space and it's probably going to be

352
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:23,919
space and it's probably going to be
 

353
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,720
space and it's probably going to be
complicated

354
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:24,730
complicated
 

355
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,849
complicated
also these mine carts are making my Dane

356
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:26,859
also these mine carts are making my Dane
 

357
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:30,179
also these mine carts are making my Dane
leg more so and it's not just because of

358
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:30,189
leg more so and it's not just because of
 

359
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:35,039
leg more so and it's not just because of
the fire so I probably will get rid of

360
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,049
the fire so I probably will get rid of
 

361
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,449
the fire so I probably will get rid of
it but I'm going to leave this all set

362
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:36,459
it but I'm going to leave this all set
 

363
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,069
it but I'm going to leave this all set
up here in case you guys want to play

364
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
up here in case you guys want to play
 

365
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,759
up here in case you guys want to play
around with it and instead I'm just

366
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:41,769
around with it and instead I'm just
 

367
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,960
around with it and instead I'm just
going to set up simple water trenches I

368
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:45,970
going to set up simple water trenches I
 

369
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,559
going to set up simple water trenches I
think and take out the logs and put

370
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:49,569
think and take out the logs and put
 

371
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,389
think and take out the logs and put
water streams all going in the same

372
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:51,399
water streams all going in the same
 

373
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,960
water streams all going in the same
direction and will be slightly faster

374
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:54,970
direction and will be slightly faster
 

375
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,769
direction and will be slightly faster
than walking still and a lot simpler

376
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:57,779
than walking still and a lot simpler
 

377
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:06,509
than walking still and a lot simpler
then hooking up one of these things and

378
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:06,519
then hooking up one of these things and
 

379
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:17,689
then hooking up one of these things and
yeah there's a creeper

380
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:17,699

 

381
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,549

so I decided against doing the tree farm

382
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:20,559
so I decided against doing the tree farm
 

383
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,119
so I decided against doing the tree farm
like I would said I was going to do it

384
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:23,129
like I would said I was going to do it
 

385
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:32,729
like I would said I was going to do it
well last episode instead I'm going to

386
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:32,739
well last episode instead I'm going to
 

387
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,319
well last episode instead I'm going to
set up something out here to the right

388
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:34,329
set up something out here to the right
 

389
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,929
set up something out here to the right
there's going to be hello

390
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:36,939
there's going to be hello
 

391
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,729
there's going to be hello
it's going to be a tree farm to the

392
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:38,739
it's going to be a tree farm to the
 

393
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,799
it's going to be a tree farm to the
right and then to the left there's going

394
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:40,809
right and then to the left there's going
 

395
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:45,989
right and then to the left there's going
to be a taxes farm an automated cactus

396
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:45,999
to be a taxes farm an automated cactus
 

397
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:50,549
to be a taxes farm an automated cactus
farm and then up there I might set up

398
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:50,559
farm and then up there I might set up
 

399
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,829
farm and then up there I might set up
the wheat farm with the eats road going

400
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
the wheat farm with the eats road going
 

401
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,400
the wheat farm with the eats road going
around or something I don't know we'll

402
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,410
around or something I don't know we'll
 

403
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,040
around or something I don't know we'll
see

404
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,050

 

405
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,700

but um it's time to go to the cannons

406
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:04,710
but um it's time to go to the cannons
 

407
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,390
but um it's time to go to the cannons
because this is a special episode and so

408
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:08,400
because this is a special episode and so
 

409
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,000
because this is a special episode and so
we're going to have a firework display

410
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,010

 

411
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,360

and here we are I love the way these

412
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,370
and here we are I love the way these
 

413
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,210
and here we are I love the way these
things look all the different colors

414
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:20,220
things look all the different colors
 

415
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,030
things look all the different colors
together pretty cool so I went ahead and

416
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,040
together pretty cool so I went ahead and
 

417
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,010
together pretty cool so I went ahead and
set them all up I think so all we got to

418
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,020
set them all up I think so all we got to
 

419
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,930
set them all up I think so all we got to
do is load them and then we're ready to

420
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:32,940
do is load them and then we're ready to
 

421
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,520
do is load them and then we're ready to
fire and so we're going to go through

422
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:37,530
fire and so we're going to go through
 

423
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,750
fire and so we're going to go through
them all and load them quickly and then

424
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:41,760
them all and load them quickly and then
 

425
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,600
them all and load them quickly and then
we'll we'll probably be nighttime about

426
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,610
we'll we'll probably be nighttime about
 

427
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:57,590
we'll we'll probably be nighttime about
towards the end of this and yeah again

428
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
towards the end of this and yeah again
 

429
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,490
towards the end of this and yeah again
if I made any mistakes just let me know

430
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:01,500
if I made any mistakes just let me know
 

431
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:09,470
if I made any mistakes just let me know
and I'll fix up and some of them have

432
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:09,480
and I'll fix up and some of them have
 

433
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,329
and I'll fix up and some of them have
lava in now and some don'ts the ones

434
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:14,339
lava in now and some don'ts the ones
 

435
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,810
lava in now and some don'ts the ones
that don't can't handle the lava because

436
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:17,820
that don't can't handle the lava because
 

437
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,829
that don't can't handle the lava because
they're made out of cloth or whatever

438
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:20,839
they're made out of cloth or whatever
 

439
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,850
they're made out of cloth or whatever
but it's going to be good this way

440
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,860
but it's going to be good this way
 

441
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,530
but it's going to be good this way
because we'll have a nice mixture of the

442
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:24,540
because we'll have a nice mixture of the
 

443
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,010
because we'll have a nice mixture of the
flashing white ones and the flaming ones

444
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,020
flashing white ones and the flaming ones
 

445
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:37,130
flashing white ones and the flaming ones
oh yeah and also I forgot to give a

446
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,140
oh yeah and also I forgot to give a
 

447
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,300
oh yeah and also I forgot to give a
shout-out to brainy beast that guys

448
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,310
shout-out to brainy beast that guys
 

449
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,400
shout-out to brainy beast that guys
helped me out a bit

450
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,410

 

451
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,370

and I'm sure I forgot to give shoutouts

452
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:48,380
and I'm sure I forgot to give shoutouts
 

453
00:17:48,380 --> 00:18:10,320
and I'm sure I forgot to give shoutouts
to a few people so sorry about that and

454
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,330

 

455
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,660

what to talk about yeah I don't like the

456
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:16,670
what to talk about yeah I don't like the
 

457
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:23,220
what to talk about yeah I don't like the
new water the strong currents because I

458
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,230
new water the strong currents because I
 

459
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,120
new water the strong currents because I
don't know if they really make you go

460
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,130
don't know if they really make you go
 

461
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,590
don't know if they really make you go
any faster and they don't seem to

462
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:26,600
any faster and they don't seem to
 

463
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,020
any faster and they don't seem to
transport items any faster I don't think

464
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,030
transport items any faster I don't think
 

465
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,880
transport items any faster I don't think
it has any effect on the heats Road does

466
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:33,890
it has any effect on the heats Road does
 

467
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,550
it has any effect on the heats Road does
it make it any faster

468
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:35,560
it make it any faster
 

469
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,960
it make it any faster
so all it really is is a annoyance of no

470
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:39,970
so all it really is is a annoyance of no
 

471
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,970
so all it really is is a annoyance of no
no benefits that I can see so I hope

472
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:45,980
no benefits that I can see so I hope
 

473
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:55,800
no benefits that I can see so I hope
they change it back to the way it was

474
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:55,810

 

475
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,720

I'm not quite sure why they do some of

476
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:58,730
I'm not quite sure why they do some of
 

477
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,159
I'm not quite sure why they do some of
the things they do

478
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:02,169

 

479
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:18,119

I guess I know one other thing I could

480
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,129
I guess I know one other thing I could
 

481
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:23,759
I guess I know one other thing I could
talk about I guess many of you suggest

482
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:23,769
talk about I guess many of you suggest
 

483
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:28,289
talk about I guess many of you suggest
that I use mods and I don't really want

484
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:28,299
that I use mods and I don't really want
 

485
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,210
that I use mods and I don't really want
to use mods because I'm really happy

486
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,220
to use mods because I'm really happy
 

487
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,919

with the way the game is as is you know

488
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:34,929
with the way the game is as is you know
 

489
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,049
with the way the game is as is you know
I have a lot of fun playing the game the

490
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:37,059
I have a lot of fun playing the game the
 

491
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,749
I have a lot of fun playing the game the
way it is so I don't really want to

492
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:38,759
way it is so I don't really want to
 

493
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,539
way it is so I don't really want to
change that unless I get bored with the

494
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:42,549
change that unless I get bored with the
 

495
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,119
change that unless I get bored with the
game then I'll probably check out some

496
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:45,129
game then I'll probably check out some
 

497
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:50,970
game then I'll probably check out some
mods but on a totally unrelated note I

498
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:50,980
mods but on a totally unrelated note I
 

499
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:58,729
mods but on a totally unrelated note I
started programming my own mod this game

500
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:58,739

 

501
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,239

that I think might be pretty cool quite

502
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:03,249
that I think might be pretty cool quite
 

503
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:06,450
that I think might be pretty cool quite
get around to putting some time into it

504
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:06,460
get around to putting some time into it
 

505
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,690
get around to putting some time into it
it's actually not a mod it's going to be

506
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:09,700
it's actually not a mod it's going to be
 

507
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,190
it's actually not a mod it's going to be
a level generator minecraft has a really

508
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,200
a level generator minecraft has a really
 

509
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,820
a level generator minecraft has a really
cool level generation but at the same

510
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:17,830
cool level generation but at the same
 

511
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,499
cool level generation but at the same
time I find it if you know it's always

512
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:22,509
time I find it if you know it's always
 

513
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,299
time I find it if you know it's always
the same the levels are all generated

514
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:24,309
the same the levels are all generated
 

515
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:29,070
the same the levels are all generated
the same way and it gets a little bit

516
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,080
the same way and it gets a little bit
 

517
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,570
the same way and it gets a little bit
boring after a while because you know

518
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:30,580
boring after a while because you know
 

519
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,619
boring after a while because you know
all the rules so I think it might be fun

520
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:34,629
all the rules so I think it might be fun
 

521
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:39,200
all the rules so I think it might be fun
to make a level generator that's a

522
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,210
to make a level generator that's a
 

523
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,169
to make a level generator that's a
generates oddball level sets it still

524
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:43,179
generates oddball level sets it still
 

525
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,550
generates oddball level sets it still
