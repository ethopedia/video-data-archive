of getting in here and out of here I've
 

69
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,250
of getting in here and out of here I've
cut these things out over here there's

70
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,260
cut these things out over here there's
 

71
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,330
cut these things out over here there's
going to be a water source here and here

72
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:43,340
going to be a water source here and here
 

73
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,680
going to be a water source here and here
that the wool is going to fall in from

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:45,690
that the wool is going to fall in from
 

75
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,559
that the wool is going to fall in from
above and that's going to push it down

76
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:48,569
above and that's going to push it down
 

77
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,620
above and that's going to push it down
here we're going to put signs here and

78
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,630
here we're going to put signs here and
 

79
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,370
here we're going to put signs here and
here so the water doesn't flow down and

80
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:57,380
here so the water doesn't flow down and
 

81
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,530
here so the water doesn't flow down and
then right below in this tunnel I just

82
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:00,540
then right below in this tunnel I just
 

83
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,550
then right below in this tunnel I just
dug all along at this height there's

84
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
dug all along at this height there's
 

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,070
dug all along at this height there's
going to be ice with water streams in

86
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,080
going to be ice with water streams in
 

87
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,289
going to be ice with water streams in
that are going to push the ice or push

88
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:09,299
that are going to push the ice or push
 

89
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:14,750
that are going to push the ice or push
the wool this way and then join together

90
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:14,760
the wool this way and then join together
 

91
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,420
the wool this way and then join together
somehow from the other side so I got to

92
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,430
somehow from the other side so I got to
 

93
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,380
somehow from the other side so I got to
go all along here placing signs and then

94
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,390
go all along here placing signs and then
 

95
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,030
go all along here placing signs and then
placing the water and then placing the

96
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,040
placing the water and then placing the
 

97
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,460
placing the water and then placing the
ice and the water streams and all that

98
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,470
ice and the water streams and all that
 

99
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,960
ice and the water streams and all that
fun stuff all right very good we got

100
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:32,970
fun stuff all right very good we got
 

101
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,210
fun stuff all right very good we got
that all done now took a little while

102
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,220
that all done now took a little while
 

103
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,259
that all done now took a little while
but we got it done so we got water

104
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:39,269
but we got it done so we got water
 

105
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,530
but we got it done so we got water
streams below each of these drop zones

106
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:41,540
streams below each of these drop zones
 

107
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,270
streams below each of these drop zones
and they go this way and then there's

108
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,280
and they go this way and then there's
 

109
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,569
and they go this way and then there's
another stream with ice below it that

110
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:47,579
another stream with ice below it that
 

111
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:52,849
another stream with ice below it that
goes that way and we got these all the

112
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:52,859
goes that way and we got these all the
 

113
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:59,960
goes that way and we got these all the
way down and then these all end up right

114
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,970
way down and then these all end up right
 

115
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:06,559
way down and then these all end up right
over over here yeah they all come to

116
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:06,569
over over here yeah they all come to
 

117
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,030
over over here yeah they all come to
over here and same with other side they

118
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
over here and same with other side they
 

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,490
over here and same with other side they
all end up here now I got to figure out

120
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:13,500
all end up here now I got to figure out
 

121
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,949
all end up here now I got to figure out
how I'm going to join these two together

122
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:17,959

 

123
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,420

but first I want to make sure they work

124
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,430
but first I want to make sure they work
 

125
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,850
but first I want to make sure they work
I haven't tried them yet so let's just

126
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:22,860
I haven't tried them yet so let's just
 

127

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:32,580
we'll try out the automatic water system
 

133
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,070

that's what I'm also concerned about for
 

161
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,450
that's what I'm also concerned about for
right now I think it has to do like with

162
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:41,460
right now I think it has to do like with
 

163
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,520
right now I think it has to do like with
the randomness of where the wool jumps

164
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,530
the randomness of where the wool jumps
 

165
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,100
the randomness of where the wool jumps
when you share them I fit if it's too

166
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,110
when you share them I fit if it's too
 

167
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,650
when you share them I fit if it's too
far away or not too Brown oh yeah most

168
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:51,660
far away or not too Brown oh yeah most
 

169
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,510
far away or not too Brown oh yeah most
of my shirt on the side I was like

170
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
of my shirt on the side I was like
 

171
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,390
of my shirt on the side I was like
where's all the wool what's wrong there

172
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
where's all the wool what's wrong there
 

173
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,920
where's all the wool what's wrong there
we go

174
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:56,930
we go
 

175
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,990
we go
yeah so it looks like it's good so we'll

176
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
yeah so it looks like it's good so we'll
 

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,940
yeah so it looks like it's good so we'll
join these two together probably in this

178
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:01,950
join these two together probably in this
 

179
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,740
join these two together probably in this
corridor here I just mined out and then

180
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:05,750
corridor here I just mined out and then
 

181
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,940
corridor here I just mined out and then
the thing is in this game for the

182
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:07,950
the thing is in this game for the
 

183
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,800
the thing is in this game for the
longest time there was no good way of

184
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:09,810
longest time there was no good way of
 

185
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,810
longest time there was no good way of
making items go up like they can only go

186
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:14,820
making items go up like they can only go
 

187
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,870
making items go up like they can only go
down as far as I know there's still only

188
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:17,880
down as far as I know there's still only
 

189
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,210
down as far as I know there's still only
one way of making them go up and that's

190
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,220
one way of making them go up and that's
 

191
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,730
one way of making them go up and that's
with pistons I don't think there's any

192
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:22,740
with pistons I don't think there's any
 

193
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,340
with pistons I don't think there's any
other tricks to it and using pistons is

194
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,350
other tricks to it and using pistons is
 

195
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,850
other tricks to it and using pistons is
not very clean really so I may try to do

196
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:31,860
not very clean really so I may try to do
 

197
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,370
not very clean really so I may try to do
what what what height is is that what

198
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:36,380

 

199
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,950

accidents my height is assets we are at

200
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:39,960
accidents my height is assets we are at
 

201
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,690
accidents my height is assets we are at
our eyes or at 47 where the items are

202
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:47,700
our eyes or at 47 where the items are
 

203
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,420
our eyes or at 47 where the items are
and way up here 53 foot six blocks

204
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,430
and way up here 53 foot six blocks
 

205
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:00,530
and way up here 53 foot six blocks
higher we got this section here with

206
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:00,540
higher we got this section here with
 

207
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,130
higher we got this section here with
nothing in I'm thinking we should use

208
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,140
nothing in I'm thinking we should use
 

209
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,810
nothing in I'm thinking we should use
this as a collection area for the wool

210
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:07,820
this as a collection area for the wool
 

211
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,090
this as a collection area for the wool
but it would maybe be a bit weird if I

212
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,100
but it would maybe be a bit weird if I
 

213
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,920
but it would maybe be a bit weird if I
went down six blocks like if we had a

214
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:12,930
went down six blocks like if we had a
 

215
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,120
went down six blocks like if we had a
six block drop from here mmm

216
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,130
six block drop from here mmm
 

217
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,080
six block drop from here mmm
I'm going to mess around with it a

218
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,090
I'm going to mess around with it a
 

219
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,420
I'm going to mess around with it a
little bit yes I dug the hole and it

220
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:26,430
little bit yes I dug the hole and it
 

221
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,690
little bit yes I dug the hole and it
comes out to here this is level the ice

222
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:29,700
comes out to here this is level the ice
 

223
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,450
comes out to here this is level the ice
would be at so I could either make a

224
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:32,460
would be at so I could either make a
 

225
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,530
would be at so I could either make a
room down low or I could try make an

226
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:36,540
room down low or I could try make an
 

227
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,760
room down low or I could try make an
item elevator to take the items up and I

228
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:40,770
item elevator to take the items up and I
 

229
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,440
item elevator to take the items up and I
did a little bit of research and it

230
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,450
did a little bit of research and it
 

231
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,600
did a little bit of research and it
seems there are there is another method

232
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:44,610
seems there are there is another method
 

233
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,350
seems there are there is another method
people use for transporting items

234
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
people use for transporting items
 

235
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,159
people use for transporting items
basically well if you have an item in

236
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,169
basically well if you have an item in
 

237
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,080
basically well if you have an item in
the hole like that and a block gets put

238
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,090
the hole like that and a block gets put
 

239
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,500
the hole like that and a block gets put
into it it gets pushed up so if you have

240
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,510
into it it gets pushed up so if you have
 

241
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,120
into it it gets pushed up so if you have
an array of vertical Pistons firing one

242
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,130
an array of vertical Pistons firing one
 

243
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,940
an array of vertical Pistons firing one
after another all the way up the block

244
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:04,950
after another all the way up the block
 

245
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,260
after another all the way up the block
will keep getting pushed higher and

246
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,270
will keep getting pushed higher and
 

247
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,560
will keep getting pushed higher and
higher until it reaches the top so I may

248
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,570
higher until it reaches the top so I may
 

249
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,020
higher until it reaches the top so I may
do something like that it's only would

250
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,030
do something like that it's only would
 

251
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,060
do something like that it's only would
only be six blocks to get it level with

252
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,070
only be six blocks to get it level with
 

253
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,909
only be six blocks to get it level with
the ground here or no five blocks only

254
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:16,919
the ground here or no five blocks only
 

255
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,520
the ground here or no five blocks only
five blocks because there's ice block at

256
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,530
five blocks because there's ice block at
 

257
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,370
five blocks because there's ice block at
the bottom so I may do something like

258
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:22,380
the bottom so I may do something like
 

259
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,450
the bottom so I may do something like
that I'm not sure okay

260
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:26,460

 

261
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,280

let's let's take a little break from

262
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,290
let's let's take a little break from
 

263
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,670
let's let's take a little break from

I know you can I know neither work grows
 

275
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:57,079
I know you can I know neither work grows
in the overworld now that looks crazy

276
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:57,089

 

277
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,400

okay so what should we do here let's

278
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,410
okay so what should we do here let's
 

279
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,420
okay so what should we do here let's
grab some pre-made potions to speed this

280
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,430
grab some pre-made potions to speed this
 

281
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,430
grab some pre-made potions to speed this
up if we can okay these are extended

282
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:08,440
up if we can okay these are extended
 

283
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,009

to your - oh well that would have been
cool though if you could both extend it

320
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
cool though if you could both extend it
 

321
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,060
cool though if you could both extend it
and your to it you can you can get those

322
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,070
and your to it you can you can get those
 

323
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,870
and your to it you can you can get those
of you if you use editors external

324
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:21,880
of you if you use editors external
 

325
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,590
of you if you use editors external
editors but I guess it's not true

326
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600

 

327
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,090

alright so I'm thinking about building a

328
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,100
alright so I'm thinking about building a
 

329
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,180
alright so I'm thinking about building a
little room here for storing wool and

330
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,190
little room here for storing wool and
 

331
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,329
little room here for storing wool and
stuff and for collecting it but before

332
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:36,339
stuff and for collecting it but before
 

333
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,340
stuff and for collecting it but before
we do that I wanted to play around with

334
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,350
we do that I wanted to play around with
 

335
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,300
we do that I wanted to play around with
arches we might do some arches at the

336
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,310
arches we might do some arches at the
 

337
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,189
arches we might do some arches at the
top here similar to what we have down

338
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:44,199
top here similar to what we have down
 

339
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,819
top here similar to what we have down
here and just see how it looks and if it

340
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:47,829
here and just see how it looks and if it
 

341
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:53,250
here and just see how it looks and if it
looks good we will keep it so yeah let's

342
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,260
looks good we will keep it so yeah let's
 

343
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,140
looks good we will keep it so yeah let's
just do this

344
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,150
just do this
 

345
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,240
just do this
and maybe go to full blocks here well

346
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,250
and maybe go to full blocks here well
 

347
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,980
and maybe go to full blocks here well
you know that is that's where I drop the

348
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:01,990
you know that is that's where I drop the
 

349
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,920
you know that is that's where I drop the
sheep down I was wondering what the deal

350
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:04,930
sheep down I was wondering what the deal
 

351
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:12,240
sheep down I was wondering what the deal
was okay

352
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,250
was okay
 

353
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,680
was okay
how weird does that look a little weird

354
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:16,690
how weird does that look a little weird
 

355
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,890
how weird does that look a little weird
is okay just really weird is not good

356
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:21,900

 

357
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,590

and down below I did that so maybe we'll

358
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
and down below I did that so maybe we'll
 

359
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:36,170
and down below I did that so maybe we'll
keep this look looks off doesn't it

360
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,180
keep this look looks off doesn't it
 

361
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,990
keep this look looks off doesn't it
what's wrong oh no no that's centered

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
what's wrong oh no no that's centered
 

363
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,090

okay I'll do I'll do the rest here and
 

365
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,560
okay I'll do I'll do the rest here and
we'll see what it looks like so let me

366
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,570
we'll see what it looks like so let me
 

367
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,410
we'll see what it looks like so let me
know what you guys think of this I like

368
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:52,420
know what you guys think of this I like
 

369
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,370
know what you guys think of this I like
the width and the height of these arches

370
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:55,380
the width and the height of these arches
 

371
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,680
the width and the height of these arches
really makes the place feel open and it

372
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:58,690
really makes the place feel open and it
 

373
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,450
really makes the place feel open and it
looks like they're holding up the

374
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:00,460
looks like they're holding up the
 

375
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,620
looks like they're holding up the
ceiling or will if I feel on that

376
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:04,630
ceiling or will if I feel on that
 

377
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,070
ceiling or will if I feel on that
ceiling which is also cool for the the K

378
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:08,080
ceiling which is also cool for the the K
 

379
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,450
ceiling which is also cool for the the K
feel this side will be different though

380
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:12,460
feel this side will be different though
 

381
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,040
feel this side will be different though
because of the sheep farm entrance it's

382
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,050
because of the sheep farm entrance it's
 

383
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,730
because of the sheep farm entrance it's
not the same and I don't really want to

384
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:17,740
not the same and I don't really want to
 

385
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,010
not the same and I don't really want to
change it either we just might have one

386
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,020
change it either we just might have one
 

387
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,730
change it either we just might have one
side that's different if we keep this

388
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:22,740
side that's different if we keep this
 

389
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,560
side that's different if we keep this
I'm wondering if it's too bulky like

390
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:27,570

 

391
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,780

these out

392
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:32,790

 

393
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,300

fill that in it might look too flat then

394
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,310
fill that in it might look too flat then
 

395
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,990
fill that in it might look too flat then
too square

396
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
too square
 

397
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,750
too square
I want to try something else to let me

398
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:42,760
I want to try something else to let me
 

399
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,350
I want to try something else to let me
know what you think of this this is the

400
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,360
know what you think of this this is the
 

401
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
know what you think of this this is the
other look I had in mind I think it's

402
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:47,770
other look I had in mind I think it's
 

403
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,040
other look I had in mind I think it's
pretty good

404
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,050
pretty good
 

405
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,940
pretty good
and I did the the leaves in the ceiling

406
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:52,950
and I did the the leaves in the ceiling
 

407
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,930
and I did the the leaves in the ceiling
so we might keep this again I'm worried

408
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:57,940
so we might keep this again I'm worried
 

409
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,400
so we might keep this again I'm worried
it's too bulky like it doesn't make

410
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,410
it's too bulky like it doesn't make
 

411
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,860
it's too bulky like it doesn't make
sense to have it thin at the bottom and

412
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:01,870
sense to have it thin at the bottom and
 

413
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,830
sense to have it thin at the bottom and
then really fat at the top but oh well

414
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:06,840
then really fat at the top but oh well
 

415
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,510
then really fat at the top but oh well
this is minecraft it doesn't have to be

416
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:09,520
this is minecraft it doesn't have to be
 

417
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,340
this is minecraft it doesn't have to be
perfect so something I want to do here

perfect so something I want to do here
there's only one proper way of getting

420
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:18,300
there's only one proper way of getting
 

421
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,450
there's only one proper way of getting
out of the cave it's this elevator here

422
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,460
out of the cave it's this elevator here
 

423
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,980
out of the cave it's this elevator here
but I would also like to have some ender

424
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:25,990
but I would also like to have some ender
 

425
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,390
but I would also like to have some ender
pearl ways of getting out so I'm going

426
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:30,400
pearl ways of getting out so I'm going
 

427
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,580
pearl ways of getting out so I'm going
to do the water and lily pad thing like

428
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:32,590
to do the water and lily pad thing like
 

429
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,340
to do the water and lily pad thing like
I have at the at the mineshaft area so

430
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,350
I have at the at the mineshaft area so
 

431
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,690
I have at the at the mineshaft area so
maybe let's just go up and see where

432
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:39,700
maybe let's just go up and see where
 

433
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,710
maybe let's just go up and see where
this takes us outside and one one will

434
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:43,720
this takes us outside and one one will
 

435
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,630
this takes us outside and one one will
be for going up and one will be for

436
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:45,640
be for going up and one will be for
 

437
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,910
be for going up and one will be for
falling down type thing oh okay we're in

it's really surprising but the mobs can
 

463
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:53,030
it's really surprising but the mobs can
actually make their way down it like if

464
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
actually make their way down it like if
 

465
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,950
actually make their way down it like if
I'm by the slime area for example they

466
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:54,960
I'm by the slime area for example they
 

467
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,900
I'm by the slime area for example they
can see me all the way from the top and

468
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:56,910
can see me all the way from the top and
 

469
