how did a creeper get in here the point

910
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
how did a creeper get in here the point
 

911
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,789
how did a creeper get in here the point
of this

912
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
of this
 

913
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,630
of this
you go in it and you die

914
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:24,640
you go in it and you die
 

915
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:33,190
you go in it and you die
of course can't get

916
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200

 

917
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,070

why would you do that well this is what

918
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
why would you do that well this is what
 

919
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,389
why would you do that well this is what
i'm using to get from

920
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
i'm using to get from
 

921
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,789
i'm using to get from
my starter base to my new ice base

922
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:44,799

 

923
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,870

because this is where i slept so this is

924
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:46,880
because this is where i slept so this is
 

925
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,830
because this is where i slept so this is
where my spawn point is

926
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:54,840

 

927
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:30,230

enjoy

928
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240

 

929
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,430

epic you still remember who this is

930
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
epic you still remember who this is
 

931
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,789
epic you still remember who this is
right

932
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
right
 

933
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:42,389
right
eso efo etho

934
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:42,399

 

935
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,310

yeah uncle leo i mean etho this is etho

936
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
yeah uncle leo i mean etho this is etho
 

937
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,389
yeah uncle leo i mean etho this is etho
so this should work out pretty good and

938
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
so this should work out pretty good and
 

939
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,070
so this should work out pretty good and
this is the fifth

940
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
this is the fifth
 

941
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,990
this is the fifth
mob system i'm gonna be building it's

942
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,000
mob system i'm gonna be building it's
 

943
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,470
mob system i'm gonna be building it's
also a hostile mob one

944
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,480
also a hostile mob one
 

945
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,310
also a hostile mob one
uh the main difference though this is

946
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
uh the main difference though this is
 

947
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,990
uh the main difference though this is
aimed at high efficiency

948
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
aimed at high efficiency
 

949
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,230
aimed at high efficiency
and as you can see

950
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,240
and as you can see
 

951
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,109
and as you can see
moves the items all is good

952
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119

 

953
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,190

assuming of course my water streams down

954
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200
assuming of course my water streams down
 

955
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,669
assuming of course my water streams down
here

956
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
here
 

957
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,669
here
down here aren't frozen this should work

958
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:17,679
down here aren't frozen this should work
 

959
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,869
down here aren't frozen this should work
good

960
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
good
 

961
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,629
good
they won't freeze once the floor is on

962
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639

 

963
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,869

let's try this out

964
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879

 

965
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,990

that's pretty cool water

966
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
that's pretty cool water
 

967
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,030
that's pretty cool water
will probably be on all the time only

968
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
will probably be on all the time only
 

969
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,389
will probably be on all the time only
turn it off when you

970
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399
turn it off when you
 

971
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,790
turn it off when you
want to restock it and it's bright

972
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
want to restock it and it's bright
 

973
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,829
want to restock it and it's bright
enough that mobs won't spawn

974
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:43,839
enough that mobs won't spawn
 

975
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,349
enough that mobs won't spawn
so directly

976
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:47,359

 

977
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,629

what the heck how did i fall no

978
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639

 

979
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,149

no got these switches here that one's

980
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
no got these switches here that one's
 

981
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,270
no got these switches here that one's
for the lighting

982
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280

 

983
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,270

switch is pretty quick it's good

984
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
switch is pretty quick it's good
 

985
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,310
switch is pretty quick it's good
um this one's for spider options i think

986
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
um this one's for spider options i think
 

987
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,349
um this one's for spider options i think
i showed that already

988
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359

 

989
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,950

um you are now going to believe this

990
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:12,960
um you are now going to believe this
 

991
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,660
um you are now going to believe this
this is crazy

992
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:19,670

 

993
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,349

[Music]

994
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:21,359
[Music]
 

995
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:30,230
[Music]
oh such a crazy patch

996
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
oh such a crazy patch
 

997
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,829
oh such a crazy patch
look at them all it's crazy

998
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
look at them all it's crazy
 

999
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,069
look at them all it's crazy
switch it

1000
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079

 

1001
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:46,390

okay we're gonna go down below

1002
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400

 

1003
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,349

all right so the reason why i made the

1004
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:49,359
all right so the reason why i made the
 

1005
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,390
all right so the reason why i made the
spawning pads

1006
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400

 

1007
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,390

bigger is because of this experiment i

1008
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
bigger is because of this experiment i
 

1009
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,750
bigger is because of this experiment i
did here

1010
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:55,760
did here
 

1011
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,109
did here
but it looks like all the pigs got

1012
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
but it looks like all the pigs got
 

1013
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,750
but it looks like all the pigs got
separated amazingly

1014
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760
separated amazingly
 

1015
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,030
separated amazingly
all the chickens are getting separated

1016
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
all the chickens are getting separated
 

1017
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,550
all the chickens are getting separated
to our emp units with

1018
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,560
to our emp units with
 

1019
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,990
to our emp units with
i didn't do all the tubes because i

1020
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,000
i didn't do all the tubes because i
 

1021
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,870
i didn't do all the tubes because i
didn't have enough glass at the time

1022
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
didn't have enough glass at the time
 

1023
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,510
didn't have enough glass at the time
oh yeah they straight fell so they died

1024
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520

 

1025
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,910

all wool in there all pork in there

1026
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
all wool in there all pork in there
 

1027
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:32,470
all wool in there all pork in there
and bunch of chickens in here blast off

1028
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:32,480

 

1029
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,710

we got our sand cannon

1030
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:36,720

 

1031
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,829

and our water switch

1032
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:41,839
and our water switch
 

1033
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,670
and our water switch
there's the torch it's going to the

1034
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
there's the torch it's going to the
 

1035
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,710
there's the torch it's going to the
pressure plate

1036
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720

 

1037
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,589

it worked that time that's

1038
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:53,599

 

1039
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,710

it's cool of uh hard to deal with them

1040
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:56,720
it's cool of uh hard to deal with them
 

1041
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,710
it's cool of uh hard to deal with them
when they're all out

1042
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:58,720
when they're all out
 

1043
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,470
when they're all out
if you share them you get more wool it's

1044
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
if you share them you get more wool it's
 

1045
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,470
if you share them you get more wool it's
another nice thing

1046
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
another nice thing
 

1047
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,550
another nice thing
instead of only getting one you get

1048
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,560
instead of only getting one you get
 

1049
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,990
instead of only getting one you get
between two and four

1050
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
between two and four
 

1051
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,510
between two and four
but yeah that's the ideas

1052
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:11,520
but yeah that's the ideas
 

1053
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,430
but yeah that's the ideas
should be a fun build

1054
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,440

 

1055
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,750

i'm not worried about

1056
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:19,760
i'm not worried about
 

1057
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,390
i'm not worried about
it not working with my lp series the

1058
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
it not working with my lp series the
 

1059
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,589
it not working with my lp series the
patch

1060
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:23,599
patch
 

1061
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,710
patch
from what i understand things like

1062
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:26,720
from what i understand things like
