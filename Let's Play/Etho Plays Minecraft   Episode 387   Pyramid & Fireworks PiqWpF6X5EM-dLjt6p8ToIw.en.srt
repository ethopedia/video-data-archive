i've never built a
 

43
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,389
i've never built a
pyramid before i probably stink at it

44
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
pyramid before i probably stink at it
 

45
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,150
pyramid before i probably stink at it
but we will try we will

46
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
but we will try we will
 

47
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,830
but we will try we will
endeavor to endure and prevail and

00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
endeavor to endure and prevail and
 

49
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,190

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
i'm still thinking about the hair on my
 

53
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,190
i'm still thinking about the hair on my
tongue it's messing with my brain

54
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
tongue it's messing with my brain
 

55
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,230
tongue it's messing with my brain

okay so i'm gonna tear this
 

57
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,550
okay so i'm gonna tear this
this sucker down uh we'll probably have

58
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
this sucker down uh we'll probably have
 

59
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,070
this sucker down uh we'll probably have
to go

60
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
to go
 

61
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,910
to go
collect a whole bunch of sandstone today

62
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
collect a whole bunch of sandstone today
 

63
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,670
collect a whole bunch of sandstone today
too to build the pyramid

64
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
too to build the pyramid
 

65
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,070
too to build the pyramid
now let's talk about it for a second

66
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
now let's talk about it for a second
 

67
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,030
now let's talk about it for a second
okay

68
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
okay
 

69
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,710
okay
there's there's a couple ways we could

70
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
there's there's a couple ways we could
 

71
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,990
there's there's a couple ways we could
do it

72
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000

 

73
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,950

now the most common way is to do just a

74
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
now the most common way is to do just a
 

75
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,469
now the most common way is to do just a
straight up staircase

76
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
straight up staircase
 

77
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,830
straight up staircase
totally constant no change um

78
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
totally constant no change um
 

79
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,310
totally constant no change um
that's probably an easy way of doing it

80
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
that's probably an easy way of doing it
 

81
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,190
that's probably an easy way of doing it
i'm going to try to do

82
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
i'm going to try to do
 

83
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,670
i'm going to try to do
more of an aztec type of pyramid it's

84
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
more of an aztec type of pyramid it's
 

85
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,389
more of an aztec type of pyramid it's
going to be

86
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
going to be
 

87
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,789
going to be
aztec shape but i'm going to still build

88
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
aztec shape but i'm going to still build
 

89
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,270
aztec shape but i'm going to still build
it out of sandstone usually when people

90
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
it out of sandstone usually when people
 

91
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,749
it out of sandstone usually when people
do that they build it out of stone

92
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
do that they build it out of stone
 

93
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,830
do that they build it out of stone
so we might go like five blocks up and

94
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
so we might go like five blocks up and
 

95
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,950
so we might go like five blocks up and
then

96
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
then
 

97
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,709
then
go sideways three or four blocks

98
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
go sideways three or four blocks
 

99
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,630
go sideways three or four blocks
let's try for four and then go up again

100
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
let's try for four and then go up again
 

101
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,749
let's try for four and then go up again
for the next level so

102
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
for the next level so
 

103
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,030
for the next level so
we'll do it in levels all the way up and

104
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
we'll do it in levels all the way up and
 

105
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,990
we'll do it in levels all the way up and
i think that'll look

106
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
i think that'll look
 

107
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,630
i think that'll look
pretty cool maybe have a staircase

108
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
pretty cool maybe have a staircase
 

109
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,830
pretty cool maybe have a staircase
running up the middle

110
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
running up the middle
 

111
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,550
running up the middle
but we'll we'll see um let me tear this

112
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
but we'll we'll see um let me tear this
 

113
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,309
but we'll we'll see um let me tear this
thing down first and then we'll get to

114
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
thing down first and then we'll get to
 

115
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:35,430
thing down first and then we'll get to
it though

116
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440

 

117
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,550

before i regret what i've done

132
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
before i regret what i've done
 

133
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,990
before i regret what i've done
oh man i always have that fear when i

00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
oh man i always have that fear when i
 

135
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,990
oh man i always have that fear when i
tear something down

00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
tear something down
 

137
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
tear something down
and try to replace it i'm always worried

138
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
and try to replace it i'm always worried
 

139
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,270
and try to replace it i'm always worried
whatever i replace it with is going to

140
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
whatever i replace it with is going to
 

141
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,390
whatever i replace it with is going to
look worse

142
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
look worse
 

143
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,030

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
and then it's like oh i'm such an idiot
 

145
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,869
and then it's like oh i'm such an idiot

00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
why did i do that
 

147
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,190
why did i do that
so hopefully that's not the case today

148
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
so hopefully that's not the case today
 

149
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,990
so hopefully that's not the case today
um

um
the animals they got moved up by the ice

152
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
the animals they got moved up by the ice
 

153
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,750
the animals they got moved up by the ice
cube there so you can kind of see the

154
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
cube there so you can kind of see the
 

155
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,430
cube there so you can kind of see the
mammoth from here and the penguins up

156
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
mammoth from here and the penguins up
 

157
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,190
mammoth from here and the penguins up
over there too

158
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
over there too
 

159
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,990
over there too
everything else is gone though and i'm

160
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
everything else is gone though and i'm
 

161
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,589
everything else is gone though and i'm
starting to lay out the framework for

162
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
starting to lay out the framework for
 

163
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,390
starting to lay out the framework for
the building

164
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
the building
 

165
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,509
the building
it's not going to be very big is it

166
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
it's not going to be very big is it
 

167
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,030
it's not going to be very big is it
which is good we'll get it done today

168
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
which is good we'll get it done today
 

169
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,550
which is good we'll get it done today
most likely at least the exterior um

170
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
most likely at least the exterior um
 

171
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,430
most likely at least the exterior um
so i'm gonna go get some red sandstone i

172
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
so i'm gonna go get some red sandstone i
 

173
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,110
so i'm gonna go get some red sandstone i
want to try red sandstone just so it

174
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
want to try red sandstone just so it
 

175
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,869
want to try red sandstone just so it
stands out a little bit more in our

176
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
stands out a little bit more in our
 

177
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,990
stands out a little bit more in our
desert

178
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
desert
 

179
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,550
desert
so it's a different color and then we

180
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
so it's a different color and then we
 

181
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,390
so it's a different color and then we
will get to it here

182
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
will get to it here
 

183
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,550
will get to it here
so i've been all over the mesa biome

184
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
so i've been all over the mesa biome
 

185
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,550
so i've been all over the mesa biome
here looking for red sandstone i can't

186
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
here looking for red sandstone i can't
 

187
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,390
here looking for red sandstone i can't
find any

188
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
find any
 

189
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,550
find any
where does it spawn guys i don't know

190
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
where does it spawn guys i don't know
 

191
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,110
where does it spawn guys i don't know
i've never looked for it before

192
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
i've never looked for it before
 

193
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,149
i've never looked for it before
but no there is none there's barely any

194
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
but no there is none there's barely any
 

195
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,110
but no there is none there's barely any
sand either

196
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
sand either
 

197
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,710
sand either
because i think of the because the

198
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
because i think of the because the
 

199
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,190
because i think of the because the
amplified terrain makes it so

200
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
amplified terrain makes it so
 

201
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,509
amplified terrain makes it so
it's very little land that's actually at

202
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
it's very little land that's actually at
 

203
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,869
it's very little land that's actually at
this level here

204
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
this level here
 

205
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,910
this level here
most of it's raised and yeah it's just

206
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
most of it's raised and yeah it's just
 

207
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,350
most of it's raised and yeah it's just
very very little red sand even

208
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
very very little red sand even
 

209
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,870
very very little red sand even
but hopefully there's enough we got

210
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
but hopefully there's enough we got
 

211
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,030
but hopefully there's enough we got
quite a bit here i'm gonna head back

212
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
quite a bit here i'm gonna head back
 

213
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,949
quite a bit here i'm gonna head back
soon

214
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
soon
 

215
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,189
soon
all right so here we go we are doing the

216
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
all right so here we go we are doing the
 

217
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,230
all right so here we go we are doing the
building now

218
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
building now
 

219
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,070
building now
uh first step the first thing i'm gonna

220
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
uh first step the first thing i'm gonna
 

221
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,749
uh first step the first thing i'm gonna
do is just copy this

222
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
do is just copy this
 

223
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,950
do is just copy this
basic frame this shape here all the way

224
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
basic frame this shape here all the way
 

225
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,510
basic frame this shape here all the way
along the side and not going to do

226
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
along the side and not going to do
 

227
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,030
along the side and not going to do
anything fancy to it right away we'll

228
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
anything fancy to it right away we'll
 

229
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,790
anything fancy to it right away we'll
add details

230
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
add details
 

231
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,870
add details
step by step to it i think and then once

232
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
step by step to it i think and then once
 

233
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,310
step by step to it i think and then once
we get one side

234
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
we get one side
 

235
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,990
we get one side
totally figured out we'll copy it to the

236
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
totally figured out we'll copy it to the
 

237
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,510
totally figured out we'll copy it to the
other three

238
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
other three
 

239
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,350
other three
um that's probably the the easiest way

240
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
um that's probably the the easiest way
 

241
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,230
um that's probably the the easiest way
of figuring this all out

242
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
of figuring this all out
 

243
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,990
of figuring this all out
all right well major red sand shortage

244
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
all right well major red sand shortage
 

245
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,270
all right well major red sand shortage
unfortunately

246
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
unfortunately
 

247
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,070
unfortunately
so we're going with regular sandstone

248
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
so we're going with regular sandstone
 

249
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,430
so we're going with regular sandstone
and we got one side

250
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
and we got one side
 

251
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,430
and we got one side
kind of done here now it doesn't look

252
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
kind of done here now it doesn't look
 

253
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,510
kind of done here now it doesn't look
very good does it

254
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
very good does it
 

255
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,150
very good does it
no there's no detail to it so it just

256
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
no there's no detail to it so it just
 

257
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,110
no there's no detail to it so it just
looks like a giant

258
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
looks like a giant
 

259
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,629
looks like a giant
blah giant blob of nothing we need

260
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
blah giant blob of nothing we need
 

261
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,710
blah giant blob of nothing we need
stuff for the eye to focus on for it to

262
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
stuff for the eye to focus on for it to
 

263
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,990
stuff for the eye to focus on for it to
get better

264
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
get better
 

265
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,469
get better
so let's let's get to the detail adding

266
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
so let's let's get to the detail adding
 

267
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,990
so let's let's get to the detail adding
shall we

268
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
shall we
 

269
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,310
shall we
uh this is really the only good side for

270
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
uh this is really the only good side for
 

271
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,390
uh this is really the only good side for
for making a front i think because we

272
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
for making a front i think because we
 

273
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,070
for making a front i think because we
kind of got a hill here

274
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
kind of got a hill here
 

275
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,150
kind of got a hill here
got the reeds on that side this side

276
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
got the reeds on that side this side
 

277
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,070
got the reeds on that side this side
over here we have the trees

278
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
over here we have the trees
 

279
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,629
over here we have the trees
so we're going to make this side over

280
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
so we're going to make this side over
 

281
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,350
so we're going to make this side over
here the front

282
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
here the front
 

283
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,710
here the front
if i can figure out how to get there

284
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
if i can figure out how to get there
 

285
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,629
if i can figure out how to get there
again okay

286
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
again okay
 

287
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,830
again okay
so i want to try to put a staircase in

288
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
so i want to try to put a staircase in
 

289
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,430
so i want to try to put a staircase in
maybe starting at this height let's make

290
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
maybe starting at this height let's make
 

291
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,990
maybe starting at this height let's make
it

292
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
it
 

293
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,189
it
seven blocks wide

294
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
seven blocks wide
 

295
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,310
seven blocks wide
and try that out okay very good and now

296
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
and try that out okay very good and now
 

297
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,990
and try that out okay very good and now
we're going to put in a main entrance

298
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
we're going to put in a main entrance
 

299
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,189
we're going to put in a main entrance
to the pyramid probably the full width

300
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
to the pyramid probably the full width
 

301
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,830
to the pyramid probably the full width
of the staircase here

302
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
of the staircase here
 

303
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,870
of the staircase here
let's go like this and maybe

304
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
let's go like this and maybe
 

305
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,550
let's go like this and maybe
curve it a bit yeah let's do that and

306
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
curve it a bit yeah let's do that and
 

307
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,070
curve it a bit yeah let's do that and
then like do the staircase thing like

308
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
then like do the staircase thing like
 

309
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,909
then like do the staircase thing like
this

310
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
this
 

311
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,350
this
maybe some half slabs over here too

312
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
maybe some half slabs over here too
 

313
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,270
maybe some half slabs over here too
and if we want to make it more detailed

314
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
and if we want to make it more detailed
 

315
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,510
and if we want to make it more detailed
we can add like something that

316
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
we can add like something that
 

317
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,150
we can add like something that
sticks out a bit

318
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
sticks out a bit
 

319
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,309
sticks out a bit
yeah uh-huh okay we're having a bit of a

320
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
yeah uh-huh okay we're having a bit of a
 

321
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,110
yeah uh-huh okay we're having a bit of a
problem here

322
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
problem here
 

323
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,670
problem here
i can't find any blocks i really like

324
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
i can't find any blocks i really like
 

325
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,189
i can't find any blocks i really like
with sandstone

326
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
with sandstone
 

327
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,790
with sandstone
like this looks just kind of weird

328
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
like this looks just kind of weird
 

329
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,309
like this looks just kind of weird
doesn't it

330
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
doesn't it
 

331
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,230
doesn't it
we need more than just sandstone though

332
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
we need more than just sandstone though
 

333
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,670
we need more than just sandstone though
we need something with contrast

334
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
we need something with contrast
 

335
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,029
we need something with contrast
something to

336
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
something to
 

337
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,110
something to
to highlight stuff like for example we

338
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
to highlight stuff like for example we
 

339
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,590
to highlight stuff like for example we
have all these levels to the pyramid

340
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
have all these levels to the pyramid
 

341
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,110
have all these levels to the pyramid
we need some way of differentiating

342
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
we need some way of differentiating
 

343
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,469
we need some way of differentiating
between them because right now it just

344
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
between them because right now it just
 

345
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,710
between them because right now it just
looks like one giant flat wall

346
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
looks like one giant flat wall
 

347
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,830
looks like one giant flat wall
you can't see that it's 3d even so we

348
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
you can't see that it's 3d even so we
 

349
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,189
you can't see that it's 3d even so we
need like something

350
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
need like something
 

351
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,270
need like something
to highlight each of the levels like

352
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
to highlight each of the levels like
 

353
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,390
to highlight each of the levels like
maybe

354
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
maybe
 

355
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,230
maybe
slabs or something running across the

356
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
slabs or something running across the
 

357
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,710
slabs or something running across the
top

358
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720

 

359
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,629

but what block do we use to do that i

360
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
but what block do we use to do that i
 

361
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,189
but what block do we use to do that i
don't know

362
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199

 

363
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,390

spruce might be okay

364
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
spruce might be okay
 

365
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,390
spruce might be okay
okay well if we put spruce on every

366
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
okay well if we put spruce on every
 

367
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,270
okay well if we put spruce on every
level we get this kind of effect

368
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
level we get this kind of effect
 

369
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,270
level we get this kind of effect
which i kind of like but i'm not sure i

370
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
which i kind of like but i'm not sure i
 

371
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,150
which i kind of like but i'm not sure i
want to do it with spruce

372
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
want to do it with spruce
 

373
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,230
want to do it with spruce
struggling quite a bit with this this

i don't build a sandstone often and i'm

378
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
i don't build a sandstone often and i'm
 

379
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,110
i don't build a sandstone often and i'm
starting to know why

380
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
starting to know why
 

381
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,790
starting to know why
i used to use it a lot but i never like

382
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
i used to use it a lot but i never like
 

383
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,629
i used to use it a lot but i never like
mixed blocks with it it was this pure

384
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
mixed blocks with it it was this pure
 

385
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,469
mixed blocks with it it was this pure
sandstone always

386
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
sandstone always
 

387
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,749
sandstone always
because i don't think there's many

388
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
because i don't think there's many
 

389
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,589
because i don't think there's many
blocks that go with it too well to be

390
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
blocks that go with it too well to be
 

391
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,710
blocks that go with it too well to be
honest

392
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720

usually people use lapis in like a

394
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
usually people use lapis in like a
 

395
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,950
usually people use lapis in like a
yellow block like gold or something

396
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
yellow block like gold or something
 

397
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,110
yellow block like gold or something
so i might just might just try that

398
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
so i might just might just try that
 

399
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,469
so i might just might just try that
we'll see

400
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
we'll see
 

401
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,469
we'll see
but uh here let's let's try add some

402
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
but uh here let's let's try add some
 

403
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,070
but uh here let's let's try add some
detail

404
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
detail
 

405
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,589
detail
so i was thinking we should have some

406
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
so i was thinking we should have some
 

407
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,430
so i was thinking we should have some
arches

408
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
arches
 

409
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,790
arches
at the front here like some

410
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
at the front here like some
 

411
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,150
at the front here like some
some cool design nothing too fancy

412
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
some cool design nothing too fancy
 

413
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,430
some cool design nothing too fancy
we'll just do this see the thing is

414
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
we'll just do this see the thing is
 

415
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,430
we'll just do this see the thing is
i want to mix a block with the sandstone

416
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
i want to mix a block with the sandstone
 

417
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,589
i want to mix a block with the sandstone
but if i can't just use wood because

418
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
but if i can't just use wood because
 

419
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,990
but if i can't just use wood because
wood isn't used as a structural support

420
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
wood isn't used as a structural support
 

421
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,510
wood isn't used as a structural support
for something like a pyramid

422
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
for something like a pyramid
 

423
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,309
for something like a pyramid
so it doesn't make a lot of sense i need

424
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
so it doesn't make a lot of sense i need
 

425
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,990
so it doesn't make a lot of sense i need
another type of stone block

426
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
another type of stone block
 

427
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,230
another type of stone block
to use instead and all i can think of is

428
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
to use instead and all i can think of is
 

429
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,309
to use instead and all i can think of is
nether brick

430
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
nether brick
 

431
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,909
nether brick
and nether brick i don't know

432
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
and nether brick i don't know
 

433
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,110
and nether brick i don't know
it might stand out too much

434
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
it might stand out too much
 

435
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,309
it might stand out too much
all right let's do a little bit of this

436
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
all right let's do a little bit of this
 

437
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,909
all right let's do a little bit of this
does this meet up with the staircase

438
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
does this meet up with the staircase
 

439
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,790
does this meet up with the staircase
over here

440
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800

 

441
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,389

not quite let's just try some some wood

442
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
not quite let's just try some some wood
 

443
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,790
not quite let's just try some some wood
over here

444
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
over here
 

445
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,630
over here
all right uh maybe

446
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
all right uh maybe
 

447
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,590
all right uh maybe
maybe maybe let's put a block of lapis

448
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
maybe maybe let's put a block of lapis
 

449
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,030
maybe maybe let's put a block of lapis
here just to try this

450
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040

 

451
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,230

maybe maybe uh

452
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
maybe maybe uh
 

453
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,710
maybe maybe uh
there's other clays too which might work

454
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
there's other clays too which might work
 

455
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,150
there's other clays too which might work
i grabbed this stuff it looked

456
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
i grabbed this stuff it looked
 

457
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,550
i grabbed this stuff it looked
kind of decent let's see let's put some

458
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
kind of decent let's see let's put some
 

459
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,310
kind of decent let's see let's put some
yellow by this and just see what happens

460
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
yellow by this and just see what happens
 

461
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,670
yellow by this and just see what happens
yellows oranges browns

462
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
yellows oranges browns
 

463
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,949
yellows oranges browns
and blues i think is our limits

464
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
and blues i think is our limits
 

465
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,389
and blues i think is our limits
um still experimenting one two

466
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
um still experimenting one two
 

467
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,829
um still experimenting one two
three probably like one the most but

468
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
three probably like one the most but
 

469
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,470
three probably like one the most but
it's

470
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
it's
 

471
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,829
it's
yeah why is this so tough

472
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:28,839

 

473
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:35,269

no it's like a polkadot pyramid

474
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279

 

475
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,590

all right everybody so i think maybe we

476
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
all right everybody so i think maybe we
 

477
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,470
all right everybody so i think maybe we
will just leave this as it is for today

478
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
will just leave this as it is for today
 

479
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,590
will just leave this as it is for today
i have tried so many different things

i have tried so many different things
 

481
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,550
i have tried so many different things
and i am just struggling trying to find

482
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
and i am just struggling trying to find
 

483

sandstone oh i used to love you so much
 

487
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,150
sandstone oh i used to love you so much
but now i just

488

um i tried adding some palm trees up

492
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
um i tried adding some palm trees up
 

493
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,310
um i tried adding some palm trees up
here i thought it would be a good idea i

494
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
here i thought it would be a good idea i
 

495
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,870
here i thought it would be a good idea i
do kind of like the idea but

496
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
do kind of like the idea but
 

497
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,310
do kind of like the idea but
even that's not really working because

498
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
even that's not really working because
 

499
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,150
even that's not really working because
you can see the sky through it and that

500
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
you can see the sky through it and that
 

501
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,110
you can see the sky through it and that
that doesn't look so good so i don't

502
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
that doesn't look so good so i don't
 

503
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,790
that doesn't look so good so i don't

got onto the pathway and then bounced

550
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
got onto the pathway and then bounced
 

551
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,550
got onto the pathway and then bounced
around and

552
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
around and
 

553
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,670
around and
probably bounced down here or

554
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
probably bounced down here or
 

555
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,670
probably bounced down here or
or maybe down here somewhere and and

556
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
or maybe down here somewhere and and
 

557
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,310
or maybe down here somewhere and and
died most likely

558
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
died most likely
 

559
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,990

oh that was a pigment okay anyway
so i was thinking about what we should

566
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
so i was thinking about what we should
 

567
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,870
so i was thinking about what we should
do next uh

568
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
do next uh
 

569
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,150
do next uh
it might be a fun challenge to build

star on them
 

601
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,350
star on them
when they first came out they would

602
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
when they first came out they would

okay so let's plan this out let's start

606
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
okay so let's plan this out let's start
 

607
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,470
okay so let's plan this out let's start
designing our firework gizmo here

608
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
designing our firework gizmo here
 

609
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,670
designing our firework gizmo here
so with the stars you can have i think

610
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
so with the stars you can have i think
 

611
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,190
so with the stars you can have i think
up to eight colors per

612
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
up to eight colors per
 

613
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,310
up to eight colors per
star is what it looks like here

614
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
star is what it looks like here
 

615
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,230
star is what it looks like here
and then there's also a bunch of shape

616
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
and then there's also a bunch of shape
 

617
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,750
and then there's also a bunch of shape
modifiers you can put on it

618
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
modifiers you can put on it
 

619
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,470
modifiers you can put on it
and then there's glowstone and diamond

620
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
and then there's glowstone and diamond
 

621
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,829
and then there's glowstone and diamond
also

622
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
also
 

623
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,030
also
oops so feathers make it a burst

624
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040

oops so feathers make it a burst
firework gold

626
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
firework gold
 

627
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,790
firework gold
nuggets make it a what was it

628
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
nuggets make it a what was it
 

629
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,670
nuggets make it a what was it
trying to think i think they're the star

630
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
trying to think i think they're the star
 

631
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,030
trying to think i think they're the star
ones and then these are the big

632
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
ones and then these are the big
 

633
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,670
ones and then these are the big
fireworks

634
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
fireworks
 

635
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,710
fireworks
like the big explosion can we use

636
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
like the big explosion can we use
 

637
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,590
like the big explosion can we use
more than one of these i don't think you

638
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
more than one of these i don't think you
 

639
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,629
more than one of these i don't think you
can right

640
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
can right
 

641
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,629
can right
no the recipe goes away okay so

642
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
no the recipe goes away okay so
 

643
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,470
no the recipe goes away okay so
we can use either this one this one or

644
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
we can use either this one this one or
 

645
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,910
we can use either this one this one or
this one or none so that's four options

646
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
this one or none so that's four options
 

647
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,829
this one or none so that's four options
there's also the option of using

648
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
there's also the option of using
 

649
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,949
there's also the option of using
a head like a wither skull head

650
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
a head like a wither skull head
 

651
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,629
a head like a wither skull head
but that's going to be too expensive so

652
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
but that's going to be too expensive so
 

653
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,230
but that's going to be too expensive so
we'll never we'll never do that

654
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
we'll never we'll never do that
 

655
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,629
we'll never we'll never do that
i doubt so we're not going to even think

656
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
i doubt so we're not going to even think
 

657
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,069
i doubt so we're not going to even think
about it

658
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
about it
 

659
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,790
about it
um then there's also like the glowstone

660
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
um then there's also like the glowstone
 

661
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,870
um then there's also like the glowstone
and the diamond i think

662
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880

 

663
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,470

one of these makes a trail i think one

664
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
one of these makes a trail i think one
 

665
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,910
one of these makes a trail i think one
it's the diamond that makes the trail

666
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
it's the diamond that makes the trail
 

667
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,949
it's the diamond that makes the trail
and the glowstone makes it twinkle

668
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
and the glowstone makes it twinkle
 

669
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,190
and the glowstone makes it twinkle
and you can have i'm pretty sure you can

670
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
and you can have i'm pretty sure you can
 

671
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,069
and you can have i'm pretty sure you can
have both of those if you want right

672
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
have both of those if you want right
 

673
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,870
have both of those if you want right
can you do both yeah it lets you do both

674
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
can you do both yeah it lets you do both
 

675
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,590
can you do both yeah it lets you do both
okay

676
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
okay
 

677
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,269
okay
and then you can have the shape modifier

678
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
and then you can have the shape modifier
 

679
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,269
and then you can have the shape modifier
too

680
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
too
 

681
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,910
too
all right so the way i think we'll do it

682
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
all right so the way i think we'll do it
 

683
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,990
all right so the way i think we'll do it
we'll make a

684
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
we'll make a
 

685
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,470
we'll make a
stall for putting together the stars

686
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
stall for putting together the stars
 

687
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,430
stall for putting together the stars
first

688
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
first
 

689
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,790
first
and then we'll just drop a bunch of

690
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
and then we'll just drop a bunch of
 

691
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,550
and then we'll just drop a bunch of
stars in a chest

692
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
stars in a chest
 

693
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,470
stars in a chest
and then we'll have another area for

694
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
and then we'll have another area for
 

695
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,990
and then we'll have another area for
putting together the firework

696
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
putting together the firework
 

697
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,629
putting together the firework
itself and we'll get a random number of

698
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
itself and we'll get a random number of
 

699
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,710
itself and we'll get a random number of
stars given to us

700
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
stars given to us
 

701
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,870
stars given to us
and we will put together the fireworks

702
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
and we will put together the fireworks
 

703
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,389
and we will put together the fireworks
that way

704
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
that way
 

705
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,230
that way
all right so we're trying to make it

706
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
all right so we're trying to make it
 

707
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,150
all right so we're trying to make it
random like

708
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
random like
 

709
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,310
random like
make the system give us a random number

710
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
make the system give us a random number
 

711
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,829
make the system give us a random number
of items to create a random firework

712
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
of items to create a random firework
 

713
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,389
of items to create a random firework
basically so

714
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
basically so
 

715
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,350
basically so
we will be using droppers to do that

716
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
we will be using droppers to do that
 

717
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,509
we will be using droppers to do that
with randomizers

718
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
with randomizers
 

719
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,030
with randomizers
and let's go start setting this up

720
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
and let's go start setting this up
 

721
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,590
and let's go start setting this up
now we just need to find a spot for it

722
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
now we just need to find a spot for it
 

723
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,350
now we just need to find a spot for it
and i think over here is

724
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
and i think over here is
 

725
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,189
and i think over here is
pretty good it's sort of out of the way

726
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
pretty good it's sort of out of the way
 

727
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,870
pretty good it's sort of out of the way
it's not something we would use all the

728
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
it's not something we would use all the
 

729
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,470
it's not something we would use all the
time

730
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
time
 

731
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,990
time
and we'll just make like a door to enter

732
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
and we'll just make like a door to enter
 

733
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,430
and we'll just make like a door to enter
it over here and then i think there's a

734
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
it over here and then i think there's a
 

735
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,550
it over here and then i think there's a
bit of space for us to work

736
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
bit of space for us to work
 

737
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,670
bit of space for us to work
i'll just hollow this out and for the

738
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
i'll just hollow this out and for the
 

739
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,110
i'll just hollow this out and for the
most part

740
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
most part
 

741
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,470
most part
most the wiring is going to go in the

742
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
most the wiring is going to go in the
 

743
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,990
most the wiring is going to go in the
roof i think or in the ceiling here

744
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000

 

745
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,990

all right so let's get to the building

746
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
all right so let's get to the building
 

747
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,030
all right so let's get to the building
now

748
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
now
 

749
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,710
now
i don't know exactly what we should do

750
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
i don't know exactly what we should do
 

751
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,310
i don't know exactly what we should do
or how we should lay this out but we'll

752
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
or how we should lay this out but we'll
 

753
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,509
or how we should lay this out but we'll
just try

754
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
just try
 

755
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,710
just try
what i have in mind first so basically

756
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
what i have in mind first so basically
 

757
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,910
what i have in mind first so basically
i'm thinking we'll put

758
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
i'm thinking we'll put
 

759
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,790
i'm thinking we'll put
most ingredients in the roof here like

760
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
most ingredients in the roof here like
 

761
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,389
most ingredients in the roof here like
all the dyes all the fireworks

762
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
all the dyes all the fireworks
 

763
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,269
all the dyes all the fireworks
modifiers additions whatever they'll go

764
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
modifiers additions whatever they'll go
 

765
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,629
modifiers additions whatever they'll go
in the roof here we'll have a

766
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
in the roof here we'll have a
 

767
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,230
in the roof here we'll have a
water stream here let's get a bunch of

768
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
water stream here let's get a bunch of
 

769
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,910
water stream here let's get a bunch of
droppers going here

770
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
droppers going here
 

771
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,030
droppers going here
water stream will carry them all to a

772
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
water stream will carry them all to a
 

773
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,990
water stream will carry them all to a
one by one hole

774
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
one by one hole
 

775
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,509
one by one hole
and then they'll fall down on our head

776
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
and then they'll fall down on our head
 

777
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,069
and then they'll fall down on our head
so we're gonna use pack dice

778
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
so we're gonna use pack dice
 

779
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,749
so we're gonna use pack dice
i wonder is that enough head space

780
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
i wonder is that enough head space
 

781
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,870
i wonder is that enough head space
yeah it should be good that's four

782
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
yeah it should be good that's four
 

783
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,910
yeah it should be good that's four
blocks up all right

784
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
blocks up all right
 

785
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,629
blocks up all right
so let's get this laid out and each of

786
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
so let's get this laid out and each of
 

787
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,150
so let's get this laid out and each of
these droppers

788
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
these droppers
 

789
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,710
these droppers
we'll need 16 of them for the dies and

790
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
we'll need 16 of them for the dies and
 

791
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,189
we'll need 16 of them for the dies and
then

792
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
then
 

793
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,430
then
probably another do i don't know eight

794
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
probably another do i don't know eight
 

795
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,310
probably another do i don't know eight
or so

796
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
or so
 

797
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,509
or so
for the rest of stuff

798
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
for the rest of stuff
 

799
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,629
for the rest of stuff
so we got 22 in total here 16 for the

800
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
so we got 22 in total here 16 for the
 

801
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,710
so we got 22 in total here 16 for the
dies and then we need six more for these

802
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
dies and then we need six more for these
 

803
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,910
dies and then we need six more for these
other things

804
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
other things
 

805
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,069
other things
every fireworks there take takes a piece

806
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
every fireworks there take takes a piece
 

807
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,110
every fireworks there take takes a piece
of gunpowder

808
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
of gunpowder
 

809
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,910
of gunpowder
but then these other five are optional

810
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
but then these other five are optional
 

811
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,189
but then these other five are optional
all right

812
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
all right
 

813
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,829
all right
so the ingredients get delivered to us

814
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
so the ingredients get delivered to us
 

815
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,350
so the ingredients get delivered to us
in the middle here they'll fall on our

816
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
in the middle here they'll fall on our
 

817
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,590
in the middle here they'll fall on our
head and then they'll probably be like a

818
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
head and then they'll probably be like a
 

819
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,749
head and then they'll probably be like a
hopper or something we craft this star

820
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
hopper or something we craft this star
 

821
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,350
hopper or something we craft this star
then we throw it in this hopper and then

822
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
then we throw it in this hopper and then
 

823
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,749
then we throw it in this hopper and then
when we throw it in the hopper

824
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
when we throw it in the hopper
 

825
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,550
when we throw it in the hopper
it detects that and tells it to send us

826
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
it detects that and tells it to send us
 

827
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,230
it detects that and tells it to send us
more ingredients to make the next star

828
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
more ingredients to make the next star
 

829
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,870
more ingredients to make the next star
so

830
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
so
 

831
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,509
so
the cycle will continue as long as we

832
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
the cycle will continue as long as we
 

833
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,629
the cycle will continue as long as we
keep throwing the stars

834
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
keep throwing the stars
 

835
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,350
keep throwing the stars
in the hopper here is the plan all right

836
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
in the hopper here is the plan all right
 

837
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,110
in the hopper here is the plan all right
but now we got to randomize what we get

838
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
but now we got to randomize what we get
 

839
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,269
but now we got to randomize what we get
so what we'll do is set set up a whole

840
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
so what we'll do is set set up a whole
 

841
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,590
so what we'll do is set set up a whole
bunch of these randomizers much like how

842
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
bunch of these randomizers much like how
 

843
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,230
bunch of these randomizers much like how
we did the

844
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240

 

845
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,350

random random music in the end there all

846
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
random random music in the end there all
 

847
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,949
random random music in the end there all
right so we have a whole bunch of wire

848
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
right so we have a whole bunch of wire
 

849
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,870
right so we have a whole bunch of wire
it's got to go three spaces and then we

850
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
it's got to go three spaces and then we
 

851
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,629
it's got to go three spaces and then we
have comparators running along here

852
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
have comparators running along here
 

853
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,990
have comparators running along here
oh and these go to a dropper hopper

854
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
oh and these go to a dropper hopper
 

855
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,750
oh and these go to a dropper hopper
combo it's actually very close

856
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
combo it's actually very close
 

857
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,710
combo it's actually very close
to the outside i might need to move this

858
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
to the outside i might need to move this
 

859
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,789
to the outside i might need to move this
further

860
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
further
 

861
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,230
further
yeah i almost definitely need to

862
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
yeah i almost definitely need to
 

863
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,470
yeah i almost definitely need to
actually this is just a little

864
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
actually this is just a little
 

865
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,710
actually this is just a little
too close to the wall all right

866
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
too close to the wall all right
 

867
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,230
too close to the wall all right
um that's not in the right spot

868
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
um that's not in the right spot
 

869
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,189
um that's not in the right spot
has to go down here and then we'd need

870
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
has to go down here and then we'd need
 

871
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,190
has to go down here and then we'd need
to run another wire over here

872
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
to run another wire over here
 

873
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,510
to run another wire over here
to trigger the droppers

874
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
to trigger the droppers
 

875
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,430
to trigger the droppers
but basically with these we'll be able

876
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
but basically with these we'll be able
 

877
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,990
but basically with these we'll be able
to set whatever random probability we

878
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
to set whatever random probability we
 

879
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,350
to set whatever random probability we
want for each ingredient

880
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
want for each ingredient
 

881
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,830
want for each ingredient
so certain colors we might not want as

882
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
so certain colors we might not want as
 

883
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,870
so certain colors we might not want as
often as others

884
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
often as others
 

885
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,990
often as others
like black for example might not want

886
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
like black for example might not want
 

887
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,789
like black for example might not want
black too often make that a rare one but

888
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
black too often make that a rare one but
 

889
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,710
black too often make that a rare one but
the super colorful

890
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
the super colorful
 

891
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,110
the super colorful
or the bright colors like lime and that

892
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
or the bright colors like lime and that
 

893
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,070
or the bright colors like lime and that
we might

894
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
we might
 

895
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,070
we might
we might want more often um

896
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
we might want more often um
 

897
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,310
we might want more often um
and then again some of these ingredients

898
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
and then again some of these ingredients
 

899
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,310
and then again some of these ingredients
like the diamonds we might not want as

900
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
like the diamonds we might not want as
 

901
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,870
like the diamonds we might not want as
often as

902
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
often as
 

903
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,590
often as
as the glowstone for example so yeah we

904
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
as the glowstone for example so yeah we
 

905
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,029
as the glowstone for example so yeah we
can play around with the probability

906
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
can play around with the probability
 

907
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,230
can play around with the probability
that way

908
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
that way
 

909
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,549
that way
but i guess we gotta move all this a

910
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
but i guess we gotta move all this a
 

911
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,909
but i guess we gotta move all this a
little bit further

912
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
little bit further
 

913
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,669
little bit further
over here very good we

914
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
over here very good we
 

915
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,430
over here very good we
just about have this thing up and

916
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
just about have this thing up and
 

917
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,350
just about have this thing up and
running totally we're gonna try it out

918
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
running totally we're gonna try it out
 

919
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,870
running totally we're gonna try it out
now

920
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
now
 

921
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,110
now
oh and i'm trapped in here i thought i

922
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
oh and i'm trapped in here i thought i
 

923
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,630
oh and i'm trapped in here i thought i
could teleport through there but no

924
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
could teleport through there but no
 

925
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,630
could teleport through there but no
i put i put a thing glass over top

926
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
i put i put a thing glass over top
 

927
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,190
i put i put a thing glass over top
because some of the items are flying out

928
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
because some of the items are flying out
 

929
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,270
because some of the items are flying out
uh of these droppers like they would

930
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
uh of these droppers like they would
 

931
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,590
uh of these droppers like they would
shoot over top sometimes

932
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
shoot over top sometimes
 

933
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,270
shoot over top sometimes
but yeah this is what we got a whole

934
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
but yeah this is what we got a whole
 

935
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,310
but yeah this is what we got a whole
bunch of randomizers here

936
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
bunch of randomizers here
 

937
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,549
bunch of randomizers here
most of them i just left as a one out of

938
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
most of them i just left as a one out of
 

939
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,430
most of them i just left as a one out of
nine

940
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
nine
 

941
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,470
nine
chance and then we got all the items in

942
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
chance and then we got all the items in
 

943
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,630
chance and then we got all the items in
these

944
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
these
 

945
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,669
these
and i think the glowstone i i left as a

946
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
and i think the glowstone i i left as a
 

947
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,350
and i think the glowstone i i left as a
one and three chance or one and four i

948
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
one and three chance or one and four i
 

949
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,590
one and three chance or one and four i
can't remember

950
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
can't remember
 

951
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,870
can't remember
and then i'm gonna split this these last

952
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
and then i'm gonna split this these last
 

953
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,070
and then i'm gonna split this these last
six over here

954
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
six over here
 

955
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,510
six over here
i'm gonna make them have a lower

956
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
i'm gonna make them have a lower
 

957
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,070
i'm gonna make them have a lower
probability i haven't decided

958
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
probability i haven't decided
 

959
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,870
probability i haven't decided
how to do that exactly but these are the

960
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
how to do that exactly but these are the
 

961
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,990
how to do that exactly but these are the
colors we don't

962
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
colors we don't
 

963
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,110
colors we don't
want as often like green

964
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
want as often like green
 

965
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,710
want as often like green
white uh light gray gray

966
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
white uh light gray gray
 

967
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,190
white uh light gray gray
black and brown these don't look very

968
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
black and brown these don't look very
 

969
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,110
black and brown these don't look very
good in fireworks so i don't want them

970
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
good in fireworks so i don't want them
 

971
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,950
good in fireworks so i don't want them
happening as often

972
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
happening as often
 

973
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,310
happening as often
the rest of the colors though are just a

974
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
the rest of the colors though are just a
 

975
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,909
the rest of the colors though are just a
one to nine chance for right now we

976
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
one to nine chance for right now we
 

977
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,310
one to nine chance for right now we
might have to tweak it

978
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
might have to tweak it
 

979
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,310
might have to tweak it
but let's let's do a few test runs here

980
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
but let's let's do a few test runs here
 

981
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,430
but let's let's do a few test runs here
and just see what we get

982
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440

 

983
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,029

okay we lucked out

984
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
okay we lucked out
 

985
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,870
okay we lucked out
pretty poorly there we didn't get any

986
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
pretty poorly there we didn't get any
 

987
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,870
pretty poorly there we didn't get any
colors

988
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
colors
 

989
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,909
colors
which was something i was a little

990
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
which was something i was a little
 

991
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,950
which was something i was a little
worried about

992
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960

 

993
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,549

uh oh

994
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559

 

995
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,470

how often does that happen i did not

996
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
how often does that happen i did not
 

997
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,669
how often does that happen i did not
think that would happen very

998
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
think that would happen very
 

999
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,350
think that would happen very
often if it ever did all right

1000
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
often if it ever did all right
 

1001
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,190
often if it ever did all right
let's try it a couple more times i guess

1002
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200

 

1003
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,190

um there we go let's make one more just

1004
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
um there we go let's make one more just
 

1005
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,070
um there we go let's make one more just
to use up this

1006
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080

 

1007
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,789

all right yeah let's try it again

1008
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
all right yeah let's try it again
 

1009
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,630
all right yeah let's try it again
we got purple and red

1010
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640

 

1011
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,990

and one gunpowder okay that's not a bad

1012
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
and one gunpowder okay that's not a bad
 

1013
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,630
and one gunpowder okay that's not a bad
start that's pretty good let's try it

1014
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,640
start that's pretty good let's try it
 

1015
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,789
start that's pretty good let's try it
again

1016
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
again
 

1017
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,990
again
just one gun pounder all right so

1018
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
just one gun pounder all right so
 

1019
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,909
just one gun pounder all right so
there's some issues

1020
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
there's some issues
 

1021
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,990
there's some issues
that time we got a bunch we got a fire

1022
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
that time we got a bunch we got a fire
 

1023
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,590
that time we got a bunch we got a fire
charge

1024
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
charge
 

1025
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,190
charge
so it looks like we'll have to lower the

1026
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
so it looks like we'll have to lower the
 

1027
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,470
so it looks like we'll have to lower the
probability on a few things

1028
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
probability on a few things
 

1029
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,830
probability on a few things
lower or raise make it more likely we'll

1030
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
lower or raise make it more likely we'll
 

1031
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,710
lower or raise make it more likely we'll
get things

1032
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
get things
 

1033
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,270
get things
that's what i'm trying to say all rights

1034
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
that's what i'm trying to say all rights
 

1035
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,190
that's what i'm trying to say all rights
but yeah basically just get random

1036
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
but yeah basically just get random
 

1037
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,510
but yeah basically just get random
colors random effects

1038
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
colors random effects
 

1039
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,270
colors random effects
make your stars from that this time we

1040
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
make your stars from that this time we
 

1041
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,430
make your stars from that this time we
just got light blue

1042
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440

 

1043
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,830

and yeah that happens a lot actually i'm

1044
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
and yeah that happens a lot actually i'm
 

1045
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,070
and yeah that happens a lot actually i'm
surprised

1046
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
surprised
 

1047
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,070
surprised
where we don't get any colors again we

1048
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
where we don't get any colors again we
 

1049
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,669
where we don't get any colors again we
didn't get any colors

1050
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679

 

1051
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,390

all right anyway that's the basic idea

1052
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
all right anyway that's the basic idea
 

1053
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,230
all right anyway that's the basic idea
behind the firework thing we'll have to

1054
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
behind the firework thing we'll have to
 

1055
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,990
behind the firework thing we'll have to
set up a little bit more to it and make

1056
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
set up a little bit more to it and make
 

1057
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,470
set up a little bit more to it and make
something nice uh

1058
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
something nice uh
 

1059
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,470
something nice uh
over here as well like so it's not just

1060
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
over here as well like so it's not just
 

1061
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,750
over here as well like so it's not just
a rough thing

1062
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
a rough thing
 

1063
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,669
a rough thing
but i want to keep this so that we can

1064
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
but i want to keep this so that we can
 

1065
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,430
but i want to keep this so that we can
still access the droppers if we ever

1066
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
still access the droppers if we ever
 

1067
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,470
still access the droppers if we ever
have to refill it

1068
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
have to refill it
 

1069
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,270
have to refill it
i'm going to keep that open i think

1070
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280

 

1071
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,190

all right everybody it is that time

1072
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
all right everybody it is that time

usually it takes a long time for for any
number to accumulate here

1104
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
number to accumulate here
 

1105
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,430

who is it it's magikarp he has found his
 

1111
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,149
who is it it's magikarp he has found his
way over here apparently

1112
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
way over here apparently
 

1113
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,230
way over here apparently
um he should be perfectly safe in here i

1114
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
um he should be perfectly safe in here i
 

1115
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,990
um he should be perfectly safe in here i
don't think he can escape anywhere

1116
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
don't think he can escape anywhere
 

1117
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,390
don't think he can escape anywhere
he could possibly swim up one of these

1118
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
he could possibly swim up one of these
 

1119
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,909
he could possibly swim up one of these
i don't think he'll be able to get out
