so I think what we'll do here guys we'll
 

163
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,030
so I think what we'll do here guys we'll
try to build a little of this together

164
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,040
try to build a little of this together
 

165
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,409

172
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:07,750
it's going to be tough though
 

173
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,770

it's going to take me at least an hour
 

179
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,000
it's going to take me at least an hour
to build this whole thing it's pretty

180
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,010
to build this whole thing it's pretty
 

181
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,750

complicated

182

the thing is though the reason the

292
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:02,540
the thing is though the reason the
 

293
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,150
the thing is though the reason the
reason there's only one video per day

294
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
reason there's only one video per day
 

295
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,430
reason there's only one video per day
usually is kind of because of the upload

296
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,440
usually is kind of because of the upload
 

297
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,800
usually is kind of because of the upload
speed but also because I spend a lot of

298
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:08,810
speed but also because I spend a lot of
 

299
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,870
speed but also because I spend a lot of
time on each video and that hasn't

300
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:13,880
time on each video and that hasn't
 

301
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,330
time on each video and that hasn't
really changed so I don't know if you're

302
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:16,340
really changed so I don't know if you're
 

303
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,930
really changed so I don't know if you're
really going to get any more um now that

304
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:19,940
really going to get any more um now that
 

305
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,870
really going to get any more um now that
being said there are times when for

306
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
being said there are times when for
 

307
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,590
being said there are times when for
example the upload fails and then if

308
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:26,600
example the upload fails and then if
 

309
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,810
example the upload fails and then if
that happens I pretty much can't upload

310
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:28,820
that happens I pretty much can't upload
 

311
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,930
that happens I pretty much can't upload
it that day again I have to wait for the

312
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:31,940
it that day again I have to wait for the
 

313
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,490
it that day again I have to wait for the
next day so then you miss a video

314
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:33,500
next day so then you miss a video
 

315
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,550
next day so then you miss a video
for that day so if that happens there's

316
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
for that day so if that happens there's
 

317
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,500
for that day so if that happens there's
a good chance I'll be able to actually

318
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:38,510
a good chance I'll be able to actually
 

319
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,750
a good chance I'll be able to actually
get it up the day even though it failed

320
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:40,760
get it up the day even though it failed
 

321
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,880

take too much time like these let's play
series are are tough where I'm actually

328
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
series are are tough where I'm actually
 

329
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,010
series are are tough where I'm actually
trying to create things takes a long

330
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,020
trying to create things takes a long
 

331
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,460
trying to create things takes a long
long time right now probably the one

332
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,470
long time right now probably the one
 

333
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,440
long time right now probably the one
that takes the most time is mine crack

334
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,450
that takes the most time is mine crack
 

335
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,870
that takes the most time is mine crack
for whatever reason I don't know I just

336
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:07,880
for whatever reason I don't know I just
 

337
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,320
for whatever reason I don't know I just
find that one the most difficult then my

338
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,330
find that one the most difficult then my
 

339
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,500
find that one the most difficult then my
single-player um those two I obviously

340
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,510
single-player um those two I obviously
 

341
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,070
single-player um those two I obviously
spend the most time in though and they

342
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
spend the most time in though and they
 

343
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,159
spend the most time in though and they
get the most views so that's good then

344
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:21,169
get the most views so that's good then
 

345
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,110
get the most views so that's good then
probably Terra Firma craft that started

346
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
probably Terra Firma craft that started
 

347
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,300
probably Terra Firma craft that started
out as a really easy series three chord

but as I've developed or progressed in

350
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:27,740
but as I've developed or progressed in
 

351
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,300
but as I've developed or progressed in
it it's taking more and more time um I'm

352

wood together in builds so I decided to
 

407
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,829
wood together in builds so I decided to
try it again though and I think I got it

408

the general shape of it then I decide to
 

457
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,960
the general shape of it then I decide to
do these entrance things and then I

looks but it's going to have a function

510
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,220
looks but it's going to have a function
 

511
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,070

villager in here and then if you like

514
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:15,860
villager in here and then if you like
 

515
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,650
villager in here and then if you like
come out during the day and harvest the

516
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:17,660
come out during the day and harvest the
 

517
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,240
come out during the day and harvest the
wheat and replant it and that would be

518
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,250
wheat and replant it and that would be
 

519
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,760
wheat and replant it and that would be
pretty cool if we can keep them alive

520
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:21,770
pretty cool if we can keep them alive
 

521
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,250
pretty cool if we can keep them alive
anyway so if if we do that might try to

522
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,260
anyway so if if we do that might try to
 

523
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,720
anyway so if if we do that might try to
make away from him to get up to the

524
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:28,730
make away from him to get up to the
 

525
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,140
make away from him to get up to the
second floor I don't know it might be

526
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,150
second floor I don't know it might be
 

527
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,290
second floor I don't know it might be
tricky I think it would be really

528
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,300
tricky I think it would be really
 

529

little by little here it's gonna take a
 

565
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,120
little by little here it's gonna take a
long time to collect everything if I try

566
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,130
long time to collect everything if I try
 

567
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,980
long time to collect everything if I try
to do it all at once it's gonna kill me

568

to do it all at once it's gonna kill me
 

569
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,220
to do it all at once it's gonna kill me
so just little by little I'm I'm doing

don't think I'm going to do speed mining
 

589

on the lower level anymore I keep

590

hitting these lava pockets and they just
 

593
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,120
hitting these lava pockets and they just
slow the whole thing down a ton it's
