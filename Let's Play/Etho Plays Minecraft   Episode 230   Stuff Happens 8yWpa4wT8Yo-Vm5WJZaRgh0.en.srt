00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
um some drops will land on it but the
 

177
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,270
um some drops will land on it but the
majority will go

178
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
majority will go
 

179
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,430
majority will go
off and down into the water and

180
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
off and down into the water and
 

181
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,230
off and down into the water and
this should work like it did before

182
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240

 

183
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,110

let's see so i'm gonna get rid of

184
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
let's see so i'm gonna get rid of
 

185
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,430
let's see so i'm gonna get rid of
going to get rid of this fence below

186
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
going to get rid of this fence below
 

187
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,310
going to get rid of this fence below
and change that with ice

188
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320

 

189
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,430

gotta be quick here

190

191
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,430

that always scares me

192
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440

 

193
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,540

[Music]
 

197
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,590
[Music]
i guess that's sandstone too

198
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600

 

199
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,150

let's do that

200
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160

 

201
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,590

okay all right that should be good

202
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600

 

203
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,110

yeah so one thing i was thinking about

204
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
yeah so one thing i was thinking about
 

205
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,469
yeah so one thing i was thinking about
is the items uh

206
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
is the items uh
 

207
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,510
is the items uh
in the afk stream since every time

208
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
in the afk stream since every time
 

209
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,550
in the afk stream since every time
an item goes in to the end here the the

210
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
an item goes in to the end here the the
 

211
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,710
an item goes in to the end here the the
world loads the chunks load

212
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
world loads the chunks load
 

213
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,870
world loads the chunks load
eventually if i left it forever um

214
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
eventually if i left it forever um
 

215
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,629
eventually if i left it forever um
the items would start despawning just

216
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
the items would start despawning just
 

217
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,029
the items would start despawning just
from its being loaded for five minutes

218
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
from its being loaded for five minutes
 

219
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,390
from its being loaded for five minutes
but

220
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
but
 

221
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,150
but
from what i can tell so far that's not a

222
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
from what i can tell so far that's not a
 

223
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,230
from what i can tell so far that's not a
problem

224
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240

 

225
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,670

yeah so this place is starting to feel a

226
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
yeah so this place is starting to feel a
 

227
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,990
yeah so this place is starting to feel a
lot more complete to me now like it's

228
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
lot more complete to me now like it's
 

229
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,590
lot more complete to me now like it's
it's actually feeling like one of my

230
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
it's actually feeling like one of my
 

231
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,350
it's actually feeling like one of my
bases instead of a

232
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
bases instead of a
 

233
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,710
bases instead of a
incomplete project uh there's still

234
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
incomplete project uh there's still
 

235
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,950
incomplete project uh there's still
an unbelievable amount to do to it but

236
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
an unbelievable amount to do to it but
 

237
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,870
an unbelievable amount to do to it but
it actually feels

238
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
it actually feels
 

239
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,150
it actually feels
pretty good now um

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
pretty good now um
 

241
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,189
pretty good now um
let's see what did i want to do oh yeah

242
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
let's see what did i want to do oh yeah
 

243
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,790
let's see what did i want to do oh yeah
uh somebody left a good suggestion for

244
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
uh somebody left a good suggestion for

bit nervous
 

259
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,629
bit nervous
yeah leaves i don't think they're gonna

260
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
yeah leaves i don't think they're gonna
 

261
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,230
yeah leaves i don't think they're gonna
work out too well they're they're really

262
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
work out too well they're they're really
 

263
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,510
work out too well they're they're really
dark

264
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
dark
 

265
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,110
dark
i do i did want something green though

266
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
i do i did want something green though
 

267
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,029
i do i did want something green though
and a pretty good suggestion

268
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
and a pretty good suggestion
 

269
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,950
and a pretty good suggestion
was to use wheat for decoration

270
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960

 

271
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,270

so let's see what that looks like i got

272
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
so let's see what that looks like i got
 

273
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,990
so let's see what that looks like i got
everything we need here

274
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000

 

275
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,909

um that's probably gonna dry up before

276
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
um that's probably gonna dry up before
 

277
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,870
um that's probably gonna dry up before
i'm ready

278
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880

 

279
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,950

yep it's drying up

280
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960

 

281
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,469

growits it's a bit yellowish though

282
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
growits it's a bit yellowish though
 

283
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:08,950
growits it's a bit yellowish though
isn't it

284
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
isn't it
 

285
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,150
isn't it
that might not be bad

286
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160

 

287
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,430

let's just see what that would look like

288
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
let's just see what that would look like
 

289
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,710
let's just see what that would look like
another idea is to use sugarcane

290
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720

 

291
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,309

i do kind of like that that looks pretty

292
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
i do kind of like that that looks pretty
 

293
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,909
i do kind of like that that looks pretty
cool

294
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
cool
 

295
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,309
cool
pretty cool if we use sugar chain we can

296
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
pretty cool if we use sugar chain we can
 

297
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,670
pretty cool if we use sugar chain we can
have secret passages

298
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
have secret passages
 

299
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,830
have secret passages
too though behind it

300
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840

 

301
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,550

i did want to mess with water just to

302
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
i did want to mess with water just to
 

303
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,309
i did want to mess with water just to
see what it would look like

304
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
see what it would look like
 

305
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,830
see what it would look like
i love having water in my bases

306
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840

 

307
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,790

um

308
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800

 

309
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,150

it's probably gonna look really out of

310
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
it's probably gonna look really out of
 

311
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,550
it's probably gonna look really out of
place so

312
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
place so
 

313
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,670
place so
i just want to see what it would look

314
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
i just want to see what it would look
 

315
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,670
i just want to see what it would look
like if we had water flowing down there

316
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680

 

317
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:06,070

right there

318
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080

 

319
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,070

have to have it

320
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080

 

321
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,430

maybe here too

322
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440

 

323
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,270

just for a little bit of decoration it's

324
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
just for a little bit of decoration it's
 

325
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,350
just for a little bit of decoration it's
probably not going to work though

326
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360

 

327
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,749

don't have many blocks

328
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
don't have many blocks
 

329
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:37,350
don't have many blocks
okay that'll work

330
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360

 

331
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,709

i don't know

332
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
i don't know
 

333
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,070
i don't know
i don't know it's a thought

334
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
i don't know it's a thought
 

335
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,750
i don't know it's a thought
if i did that i would have like a secret

336
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
if i did that i would have like a secret
 

337
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,509
if i did that i would have like a secret
patch passage that would go down there

338
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
patch passage that would go down there
 

339
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,870
patch passage that would go down there
oh no i did it darn doc warned me about

340
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
oh no i did it darn doc warned me about

that today
if you go on a downward stream you can't

344
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
if you go on a downward stream you can't
 

345
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,310
if you go on a downward stream you can't
swim out of it

346
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320

 

347
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,990

350
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
swim up it actually pulls you down
 

351
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,949
swim up it actually pulls you down
man i wonder how you know what let's try

352
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
man i wonder how you know what let's try
 

353
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,949
man i wonder how you know what let's try
that with boats

354
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
that with boats
 

355
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,190
that with boats
i'm curious to see if that would push

356
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
i'm curious to see if that would push
 

357
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,550
i'm curious to see if that would push
boats down too or if they'll float still

358
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
boats down too or if they'll float still
 

359
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,829
boats down too or if they'll float still
let's see

360
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839

 

361
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,509

get a boat uh where should we try this

362
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519

 

363
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,630

he's still there he's not moving though

364
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
he's still there he's not moving though
 

365
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,870
he's still there he's not moving though
i think he's trapped

366
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
i think he's trapped
 

367
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,509
i think he's trapped
now maybe we'll just do it up here

368
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519

 

369
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:50,230

okay i will contain it

370
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
okay i will contain it
 

371
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:59,509
okay i will contain it
sure that works

372
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519

 

373
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:09,269

that's not gonna work

374
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279

 

375
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,350

okay so if we put a boat on there do you

376
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
okay so if we put a boat on there do you
 

377
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,269
okay so if we put a boat on there do you
think it'll float up still

378
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279

 

379
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,389

oh no it did not

380
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
oh no it did not
 

381
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,590
oh no it did not
you think it's still there what do you

382
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
you think it's still there what do you
 

383
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,470
you think it's still there what do you
think it actually went through

384
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
think it actually went through
 

385
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,030
think it actually went through
can't click on it down here

386
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040

 

387
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,590

man that's going to be tough for that

388
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
man that's going to be tough for that
 

389
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,949
man that's going to be tough for that
really sucks that means you can't do

390
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
really sucks that means you can't do
 

391
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,949
really sucks that means you can't do
boat elevators anymore

392
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
boat elevators anymore
 

393
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,790
boat elevators anymore
well you can with source blocks i guess

394
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
well you can with source blocks i guess
 

395
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,829
well you can with source blocks i guess
but it limits you a bit more

396
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839

 

397
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,389

huh all right anyway

398
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399

 

399
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,829

yeah i do really like that wheat i think

400
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
yeah i do really like that wheat i think
 

401
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,910
yeah i do really like that wheat i think
we're going to do wheat

402
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
we're going to do wheat
 

403
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,710
we're going to do wheat
in each of these areas the water doesn't

404
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
in each of these areas the water doesn't
 

405
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,069
in each of these areas the water doesn't
really work though i don't think so i'll

406
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
really work though i don't think so i'll
 

407
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,069
really work though i don't think so i'll
probably get rid of that

408
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
probably get rid of that
 

409
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,150
probably get rid of that
and with the wheat we should try to make

410
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
and with the wheat we should try to make
 

411
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,829
and with the wheat we should try to make
it into an actual

412
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
it into an actual
 

413
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,670
it into an actual
or make it actually farmable so i'll put

414
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
or make it actually farmable so i'll put
 

415
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,030
or make it actually farmable so i'll put
a piston

416
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
a piston
 

417
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,069
a piston
on this end and like a smart piston and

418
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
on this end and like a smart piston and
 

419
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,389
on this end and like a smart piston and
a

420
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
a
 

421
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,990
a
piston on this end and it'll just move

422
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
piston on this end and it'll just move
 

423
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,310
piston on this end and it'll just move
the soil back and forth and make them

424
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
the soil back and forth and make them
 

425
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,030
the soil back and forth and make them
pop off that way

426
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
pop off that way
 

427
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,949
pop off that way
uh but something i want to try now

428
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
uh but something i want to try now
 

429
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,630
uh but something i want to try now
is do that three-quarter circle thing i

430
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
is do that three-quarter circle thing i
 

431
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,949
is do that three-quarter circle thing i
talked about last episode so make a path

432
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
talked about last episode so make a path
 

433
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:27,990
talked about last episode so make a path
that goes

434
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
that goes
 

435
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,389
that goes
around this way and connect to the

436
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
around this way and connect to the
 

437
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,710
around this way and connect to the
stairs on that side

438
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
stairs on that side
 

439
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,030
stairs on that side
so see if we got to figure out

440
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
so see if we got to figure out
 

441
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,870
so see if we got to figure out
where the center of that would be then

442
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880

 

443
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,150

figure out how big this circle is

444
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
figure out how big this circle is
 

445
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,509
figure out how big this circle is
so the center is right

446
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
so the center is right
 

447
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,430
so the center is right
let's see two right there

448
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
let's see two right there
 

449
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,230
let's see two right there
yeah right there then it goes out one

450
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
yeah right there then it goes out one
 

451
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,030
yeah right there then it goes out one
two

452
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
two
 

453
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,350
two
well

454
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360

 

455
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,710

one two three four five

456
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
one two three four five
 

457
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,910
one two three four five
six seven eight

458
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
six seven eight
 

459
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,590
six seven eight
nine ten eleven

460
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
nine ten eleven
 

461
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,750
nine ten eleven
probably make come out one more 12. so

462
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
probably make come out one more 12. so
 

463
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,389
probably make come out one more 12. so
we need a circle

464
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
we need a circle
 

465
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,990
we need a circle
with a radius of 12 plus 11

466
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
with a radius of 12 plus 11
 

467
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,389
with a radius of 12 plus 11
23. that goes around so

468
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
23. that goes around so
 

469
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,949
23. that goes around so
i'm gonna go look up the shape of that

470
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
i'm gonna go look up the shape of that
 

471
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,310
i'm gonna go look up the shape of that
and i'll

472
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
and i'll
 

473
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,990
and i'll
i'll dig it out and just see what it's

474
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
i'll dig it out and just see what it's
 

475
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,550
i'll dig it out and just see what it's
like

476
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560

 

477
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,710

i'm in diameter by the way not radius

478
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
i'm in diameter by the way not radius
 

479
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,910
i'm in diameter by the way not radius
don't worry

480
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
don't worry
 

481
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,110
don't worry
i know the difference i did pass fourth

482
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
i know the difference i did pass fourth
 

483
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,509
i know the difference i did pass fourth
grade or whatever it was

484
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
grade or whatever it was
 

485
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,269
grade or whatever it was
where you learned that stuff but yeah

486
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
where you learned that stuff but yeah
 

487
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,629
where you learned that stuff but yeah
this is what it looks like with that

488
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
this is what it looks like with that
 

489
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,509
this is what it looks like with that
area

490
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
area
 

491
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,910
area
mined out so this is a 25 diameter

492
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
mined out so this is a 25 diameter
 

493
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,509
mined out so this is a 25 diameter
circle

494
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
circle
 

495
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,030
circle
um it's kind of cool

496
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
um it's kind of cool
 

497
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,110
um it's kind of cool
it might work trying to decide if i want

498
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
it might work trying to decide if i want
 

499
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,190
it might work trying to decide if i want
to keep it or do that

500
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200

 

501
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,430

the only thing that i might not like if

502
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
the only thing that i might not like if
 

503
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,470
the only thing that i might not like if
i do

504
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
i do
 

505
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,389
i do
is i don't want to see all that open

506
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
is i don't want to see all that open
 

507
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,310
is i don't want to see all that open
space from down here i don't think

508
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
space from down here i don't think
 

509
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,430
space from down here i don't think
so uh one thing i did want to have is

510
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
so uh one thing i did want to have is
 

511
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,910
so uh one thing i did want to have is
like

512
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
like
 

513
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,150
like
a column here at least the five by five

514
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
a column here at least the five by five
 

515
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,190
a column here at least the five by five
column that goes

516
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
column that goes
 

517
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,750
column that goes
goes up probably to the ceiling or

518
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
goes up probably to the ceiling or
 

519
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,030
goes up probably to the ceiling or
whatever

520
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
whatever
 

521
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,829
whatever
whenever we decide where the ceiling is

522
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
whenever we decide where the ceiling is
 

523
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,110
whenever we decide where the ceiling is
um but maybe i could have a

524
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
um but maybe i could have a
 

525
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,110
um but maybe i could have a
a second wall kind of come out

526
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
a second wall kind of come out
 

527
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,829
a second wall kind of come out
like this

528
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839

 

529
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:33,990

535
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,790

it's probably gonna look really bad

536
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800

 

537
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,949

yeah have like another another wall
 

539
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,829
yeah have like another another wall
there to

540
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
there to
 

541
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,230
there to
hide anything back here and then over

542
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
hide anything back here and then over
 

543
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,110
hide anything back here and then over
here we'll have

544
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
here we'll have
 

545
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,949
here we'll have
more rooms or something that we can go

546
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
more rooms or something that we can go
 

547
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,829
more rooms or something that we can go
to

548
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
to
 

549
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,750
to
um and

550
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
um and
 

551
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,350
um and

552
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
we'll probably bring the wall out on
 

553
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,590
we'll probably bring the wall out on
this side up to

554
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
this side up to
 

555
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,990
this side up to
you know just make it a little thicker

556
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000

 

557
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,550

i don't know it's hard to hard to

558
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
i don't know it's hard to hard to
 

559
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,310
i don't know it's hard to hard to
envision it until i actually do it

560
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
envision it until i actually do it
 

561
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,750
envision it until i actually do it
but that's what i'm thinking i tried put

647
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,670

um so it's been running a little while

648
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
um so it's been running a little while
 

649
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,110
um so it's been running a little while
here let's see how much

650
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
here let's see how much
 

651
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,189
here let's see how much
much we get for going through it's gonna

652
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
much we get for going through it's gonna
 

653
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,829
much we get for going through it's gonna
drop off some of the items first

654
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839

 

655
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,189

and that and

656
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
and that and
 

657
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,269
and that and
okay i think that's everything

658
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279

 

659
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,629

so with this i have a fence uh

660
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
so with this i have a fence uh
 

661
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,629
so with this i have a fence uh
connected like this so when items flow

662
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
connected like this so when items flow
 

663
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,990
connected like this so when items flow
through here they hit hit

664
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
through here they hit hit
 

665
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,430
through here they hit hit
that fence and fall straight down

666
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
that fence and fall straight down
 

667
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,710
that fence and fall straight down
because i was having trouble with them

668
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
because i was having trouble with them
 

669
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,189
because i was having trouble with them
landing

670
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
landing
 

671
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,150
landing
like over here and not going into the

672
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
like over here and not going into the
 

673
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,829
like over here and not going into the
portal

674
00:16:59,829 --> 00:16:59,839

 

675
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,230

so that works out much better yeah let's

676
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
so that works out much better yeah let's
 

677
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,150
so that works out much better yeah let's
see how many items we get now

678
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160

 

679
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,510

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
it just straight like that i would bring
 

695
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,829
it just straight like that i would bring
the wheat

696
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
the wheat
 

697
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,230
the wheat
and have it curve around like that so

698
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
and have it curve around like that so
 

699
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,070
and have it curve around like that so
that it uses up the rest of the land

700
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
that it uses up the rest of the land
 

701
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,350
that it uses up the rest of the land
here

702
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
here
 

703
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,110
here
i think that's better

704
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120

 

705
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,350

the whole piston earth mover method

706
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
the whole piston earth mover method
 

707
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,909
the whole piston earth mover method
probably won't work with this even even

708
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
probably won't work with this even even
 

709
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,150
probably won't work with this even even
with it straight like this

710
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
with it straight like this
 

711
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,230
with it straight like this
because when the tilled land goes under

712
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
because when the tilled land goes under
 

713
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,950
because when the tilled land goes under
a block it's going to get untilled

714
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
a block it's going to get untilled
 

715
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,710
a block it's going to get untilled
and since it's mostly for show

716
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
and since it's mostly for show
 

717
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,150
and since it's mostly for show
that's not going to work out too well if

718
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
that's not going to work out too well if
 

719
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,029
that's not going to work out too well if
if one one block on the end isn't isn't

720
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
if one one block on the end isn't isn't
 

721
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,270
if one one block on the end isn't isn't
grown it's going to look bad

722
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
grown it's going to look bad
 

723
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,230
grown it's going to look bad
so maybe instead

724
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
so maybe instead
 

725
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,110
so maybe instead
we'll just use a whole ton of pistons

726
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
we'll just use a whole ton of pistons
 

727
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,470
we'll just use a whole ton of pistons
and

728
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
and
 

729
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:21,029
and
put one under each each soil block

730
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039

 

731
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,830

man everything is such a mess around

732
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840

 

733
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,750

here

734
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760

 

735
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,710

all right yeah so we'll just do

736
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720

 

737
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,070

do this all the way along

738
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
do this all the way along
 

739
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,150
do this all the way along
and we got to get the water in we'll

740
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
and we got to get the water in we'll
 

741
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,350
and we got to get the water in we'll
probably just put the water under the

742
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
probably just put the water under the
 

743
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:54,630
probably just put the water under the
wall here you'll never see it

744
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640

 

745
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,029

yeah so a little a little off topic

746
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
yeah so a little a little off topic
 

747
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,789
yeah so a little a little off topic
um you know i keep hearing people talk

he's seeing how he'll react right
as he lunges at him and he kind of he's

792
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
as he lunges at him and he kind of he's
 

793
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,029
as he lunges at him and he kind of he's
circling around him and

794
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
circling around him and
 

795
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,470
circling around him and
the badgers is standing its ground

796
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
the badgers is standing its ground
 

797
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,150
the badgers is standing its ground
and at one point in the video he

798
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
and at one point in the video he
 

799
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,270
and at one point in the video he
actually runs at the badger

800
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
actually runs at the badger
 

801
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,110

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
like a badger is only maybe 20 pounds or
 

803
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,830
like a badger is only maybe 20 pounds or
so

804
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
so
 

805
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,750

a badger you would
think the animal would take off but nope

all the pistons and then those will

858
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
all the pistons and then those will
 

859
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,110
all the pistons and then those will
power them

power them
 

861
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,070
power them
when we send a minecart down so that

862
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
when we send a minecart down so that
 

863
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,630
when we send a minecart down so that
should be

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
should be
 

865
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,310
should be
pretty simple

866
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320

make
 

915
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,750
make
make it connect to the road up there

916
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760

 

917
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,149

right at the platform i want to i want

918
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
right at the platform i want to i want
 

919
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:24,950
right at the platform i want to i want
to be able to

920
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
to be able to
 

921
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,990
to be able to
have a boat go up to it

922
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
have a boat go up to it
 

923
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,710
have a boat go up to it
so see it's going that way

924
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720

 

925
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,470

nothing too fancy at least not to start

926
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
nothing too fancy at least not to start
 

927
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,070
nothing too fancy at least not to start
off with all i really need to do

928
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
off with all i really need to do
 

929
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,470
off with all i really need to do
see so we gotta link up with that path

930
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
see so we gotta link up with that path
 

931
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,190
see so we gotta link up with that path
there that's one that's going that way

932
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
there that's one that's going that way
 

933
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,789
there that's one that's going that way
so i guess we'll have to put it here

934
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:50,799

 

935
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,789

right here

936
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
right here
 

937
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:01,350
right here
yeah uh really all we need to do

938
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360

 

939
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,750

let's see how should we do this

940
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760

 

941
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,549

maybe fix it up a bit before

942
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559

 

943
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,590

put this here

944
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600

 

945
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,149

just want to try it out now we just need

946
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
just want to try it out now we just need
 

947
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,549
just want to try it out now we just need
to

948
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559

 

949
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,110

this we just put the water here even

950
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120

 

951
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,270

see start like that and

952
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
see start like that and
 

953
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,270
see start like that and
we just have to alternate all the way up

954
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,280
we just have to alternate all the way up
 

955
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,909
we just have to alternate all the way up
like this

956
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919

 

957
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,390

and then melt it all

958
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400

 

959
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,230

and we should be able to just plop a

960
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
and we should be able to just plop a
 

961
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,430
and we should be able to just plop a
boat down and

962
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
boat down and
 

963
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,870
boat down and
ride it up to underneath there

964
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:52,880

 

965
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,110

yeah so we need to open up a three by

966
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
yeah so we need to open up a three by
 

967
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,510
yeah so we need to open up a three by
three area for the boat to get up

968
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
three area for the boat to get up
 

969
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,269
three area for the boat to get up
oops and the waters come up here so

970
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279
oops and the waters come up here so
 

971
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,350
oops and the waters come up here so
we'll put

972
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
we'll put
 

973
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,230
we'll put
oh i yeah i put that in the right place

974
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
oh i yeah i put that in the right place
 

975
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,669
oh i yeah i put that in the right place
it's hard to see

976
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
it's hard to see
 

977
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,390
it's hard to see
so ice block there

978
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
so ice block there
 

979
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,870
so ice block there
then we'll put a sign here

980
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
then we'll put a sign here
 

981
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,909
then we'll put a sign here
and one over here

982
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
and one over here
 

983
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,110
and one over here
hold the water up and then break

984
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,120
hold the water up and then break
 

985
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,110
hold the water up and then break
those three

986
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120

 

987
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,590

and that should work

988
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
and that should work
 

989
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:47,510
and that should work
yeah just missing one ice block there

990
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
yeah just missing one ice block there
 

991
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,510
yeah just missing one ice block there
now i'm going to set up a whole bunch of

992
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
now i'm going to set up a whole bunch of
 

993
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,590
now i'm going to set up a whole bunch of
torches near this

994
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:51,600
torches near this
 

995
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,029
torches near this
and we'll we'll try melt this all

996
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
and we'll we'll try melt this all
 

997
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,830
and we'll we'll try melt this all
that one melted on its own good

998
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840

 

999
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,269

see

1000
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279

 

1001
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,390

oops so just give me a moment this will

1002
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
oops so just give me a moment this will
 

1003
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,510
oops so just give me a moment this will
take a while to

1004
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
take a while to
 

1005
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,190
take a while to
all melt

1006
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200

 

1007
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,590

alrighty it's all melted let's try this

1008
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
alrighty it's all melted let's try this
 

1009
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,269
alrighty it's all melted let's try this
out i'm a little worried some of the

1010
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
out i'm a little worried some of the
 

1011
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:17,990
out i'm a little worried some of the
water

1012
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
water
 

1013
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,590
water
like when you do this the water can get

1014
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:19,600
like when you do this the water can get
 

1015
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,269
like when you do this the water can get
this flowing thing and i think it does

1016
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
this flowing thing and i think it does
 

1017
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,870
this flowing thing and i think it does
actually flow

1018
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
actually flow
 

1019
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,149
actually flow
yeah it's pulling me to the center

1020
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
yeah it's pulling me to the center
 

1021
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,510
yeah it's pulling me to the center
as long as it doesn't pull me off the

1022
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
as long as it doesn't pull me off the
 

1023
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,190
as long as it doesn't pull me off the
edge we should be okay

1024
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
edge we should be okay
 

1025
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,950
edge we should be okay
because that is a fall down there

1026
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
because that is a fall down there
 

1027
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,549
because that is a fall down there
and if we start going that way i'm going

1028
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
and if we start going that way i'm going
 

1029
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,230
and if we start going that way i'm going
to bail

1030
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240

 

1031
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,110

yeah it's okay it's not crashing not

00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
yeah it's okay it's not crashing not
 

1033
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,950
yeah it's okay it's not crashing not
going crazy

1034
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
going crazy
 

1035
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,390
going crazy
