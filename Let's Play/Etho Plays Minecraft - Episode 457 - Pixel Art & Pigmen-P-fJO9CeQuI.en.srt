161
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,210
your inventory with this whole
middle-click thing I use it all the time

162
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,220
middle-click thing I use it all the time
 

163
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,520
middle-click thing I use it all the time
now and it's great if you want to select

164
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,530
now and it's great if you want to select
 

165
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,770
now and it's great if you want to select
the block if you have it middle-click

166
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:40,780
the block if you have it middle-click
 

167
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,830
the block if you have it middle-click
and you got it which is really really

168
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
and you got it which is really really
 

169
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,430
and you got it which is really really
useful once you get used to it my second

170
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
useful once you get used to it my second
 

171
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,550
useful once you get used to it my second
thing they need to deal with the whole

172
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
thing they need to deal with the whole
 

173
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,430
thing they need to deal with the whole
slab and stair issue because every time

174
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,440
slab and stair issue because every time
 

175
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,220
slab and stair issue because every time
they add a new block in the game people

176
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,230
they add a new block in the game people
 

177
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,159
they add a new block in the game people
want them to add a slab variant for it

178
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,169
want them to add a slab variant for it
 

179
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,199
want them to add a slab variant for it
and a stair variant they can't keep

180
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,209
and a stair variant they can't keep
 

181
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,220
and a stair variant they can't keep
doing that though I don't

182
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,230
doing that though I don't
 

183
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,380
doing that though I don't
thank because that also adds to the

184
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,390
thank because that also adds to the
 

185
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,270
thank because that also adds to the
inventory issue right they actually need

186
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,280
inventory issue right they actually need
 

187
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,930
inventory issue right they actually need
to create a block that is a slab that

188
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:09,940
to create a block that is a slab that
 

189
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,570
to create a block that is a slab that
you can like put other blocks in kind of

190
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:12,580
you can like put other blocks in kind of
 

191
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,390
you can like put other blocks in kind of
like the carpenter blocks but maybe

192
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
like the carpenter blocks but maybe
 

193
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,009
like the carpenter blocks but maybe
they'll deal with the problem in their

194
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:17,019
they'll deal with the problem in their
 

195
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,990
they'll deal with the problem in their
own way you know try to come up with

196
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,000
own way you know try to come up with
 

197
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,800
own way you know try to come up with
their own clever solution and ideally be

198
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:22,810
their own clever solution and ideally be
 

199
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,010
their own clever solution and ideally be
able to rotate the block every which way

200
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,020
able to rotate the block every which way
 

201
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,770
able to rotate the block every which way
but yeah that's that's a big thing

202
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:28,780
but yeah that's that's a big thing
 

203
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,350
but yeah that's that's a big thing
another big thing is entity leg they

204
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
another big thing is entity leg they
 

205
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,270
another big thing is entity leg they
need to optimize entities in the steam

206
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
need to optimize entities in the steam
 

207
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
need to optimize entities in the steam
like mobs and just like items on the

208
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,010
like mobs and just like items on the
 

209
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,129
like mobs and just like items on the
ground that kind of stuff they did take

210
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:38,139
ground that kind of stuff they did take
 

211
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,790
ground that kind of stuff they did take
the time to optimize like particles not

212
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:41,800
the time to optimize like particles not
 

213
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,070
the time to optimize like particles not
too long ago and that was a big big

214
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
too long ago and that was a big big
 

215
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
too long ago and that was a big big
improvement now if they could do

216
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:45,850
improvement now if they could do
 

217
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,480
improvement now if they could do
entities too that would be great

218
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,490

 

219
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,640

yes that's it right that's pretty good

220
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,650
yes that's it right that's pretty good
 

221
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,040
yes that's it right that's pretty good
I'm really happy with that actually that

222
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,050
I'm really happy with that actually that
 

223
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,020
I'm really happy with that actually that
looks like the the minecraft dragon

224
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,030
looks like the the minecraft dragon
 

225
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,540
looks like the the minecraft dragon
right and it's actually surprisingly

226
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:00,550
right and it's actually surprisingly
 

227
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,909
right and it's actually surprisingly
detailed for the size you got the wings

228
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:02,919
detailed for the size you got the wings
 

229
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,070
detailed for the size you got the wings
you got the spikes think I messed up the

230
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,080
you got the spikes think I messed up the
 

231
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,409
you got the spikes think I messed up the
tail it looks like we need more black

232
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:07,419
tail it looks like we need more black
 

233
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,110
tail it looks like we need more black
there I got to stop looking at these

234
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,120
there I got to stop looking at these
 

235
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,750
there I got to stop looking at these
guys too but yeah I think that's I think

236
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,760
guys too but yeah I think that's I think
 

237
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,430
guys too but yeah I think that's I think
that's what we want one thing I might

238
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,440
that's what we want one thing I might
 

239
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,279
that's what we want one thing I might
say though is it is pretty plain over

240
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,289
say though is it is pretty plain over
 

241
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,879
say though is it is pretty plain over
there still right I even though that's a

242
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:20,889
there still right I even though that's a
 

243
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:23,940
there still right I even though that's a
that's a big pixel art there's still a

244
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:23,950
that's a big pixel art there's still a
 

245
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,190
that's a big pixel art there's still a
lot of space left to fill here so I was

246
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,200
lot of space left to fill here so I was
 

247
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,350
lot of space left to fill here so I was
thinking we can survive here maybe we

248
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
thinking we can survive here maybe we
 

249
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,029
thinking we can survive here maybe we
try to make like an Enderman pixel art

250
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
try to make like an Enderman pixel art
 

251
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,129
try to make like an Enderman pixel art
to not just the dragon what do you guys

252

a bunch of them try to make it look like
 

263
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,700
a bunch of them try to make it look like
a pictograph maybe okay guys so I think

264
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:56,710
a pictograph maybe okay guys so I think
 

265
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,279
a pictograph maybe okay guys so I think
I got this all done I fixed the tail and

266
00:05:59,279 --> 00:05:59,289
I got this all done I fixed the tail and
 

267
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,320
I got this all done I fixed the tail and
everything got a couple more Enderman

268
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,330
everything got a couple more Enderman
 

269
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,640
everything got a couple more Enderman
down let's go check it out from a

270
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:02,650
down let's go check it out from a
 

271
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,680
down let's go check it out from a
distance here

272
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:06,690

 

273
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,000

but yes awesome I'm really happy with

but yes awesome I'm really happy with
that actually what is it about the

276
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,250
that actually what is it about the
 

277
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,830
that actually what is it about the
Enderman why do they look so derpy I

278
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
Enderman why do they look so derpy I
 

279
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,690
Enderman why do they look so derpy I
guess it's the eyes cuz I got the white

280
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:17,700
guess it's the eyes cuz I got the white
 

281
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,270
guess it's the eyes cuz I got the white
in there maybe I didn't liked how I

282
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,280
in there maybe I didn't liked how I
 

283
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,100
in there maybe I didn't liked how I
looked when I changed the white to black

284
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,110
looked when I changed the white to black
 

285
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:29,780
looked when I changed the white to black
I don't know I think it's good that guy

286
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:29,790
I don't know I think it's good that guy
 

287
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,960
I don't know I think it's good that guy
on the end there's my favorite with the

288
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:31,970
on the end there's my favorite with the
 

289
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,610
on the end there's my favorite with the
Egyptian arms you know because that's

290
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:34,620
Egyptian arms you know because that's
 

291
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,750
Egyptian arms you know because that's
that's what I'm trying to make it look

292
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:35,760
that's what I'm trying to make it look
 

293
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,590
that's what I'm trying to make it look
like just a pictograph cool alright well

294
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
like just a pictograph cool alright well
 

295
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
like just a pictograph cool alright well
we'll call that good for the pixel art

296
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:40,890
we'll call that good for the pixel art
 

297
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,640
we'll call that good for the pixel art
maybe I could fit some more decorative

298
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:43,650
maybe I could fit some more decorative
 

299
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,530
maybe I could fit some more decorative
stuff up there but I think I'm fine with

300
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:45,540
stuff up there but I think I'm fine with
 

301
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,320
stuff up there but I think I'm fine with
that alright guys so I'm just getting

302
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,330
that alright guys so I'm just getting
 

303
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,880
that alright guys so I'm just getting
some blocks here together for our next

304
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:52,890
some blocks here together for our next
 

305
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,010
some blocks here together for our next
project I'll be honest with you that

306
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,020
project I'll be honest with you that
 

307
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,170
project I'll be honest with you that
little bits in the end there took up all

308
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,180
little bits in the end there took up all
 

309
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,530
little bits in the end there took up all
my recording time so I couldn't just

310
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:00,540
my recording time so I couldn't just
 

311
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,510
my recording time so I couldn't just
release a five-minute video I decided to

312
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
release a five-minute video I decided to
 

313
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,670
release a five-minute video I decided to
delay the episode and now this is a

314
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:04,680
delay the episode and now this is a
 

315
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,370
delay the episode and now this is a
couple days later I am still extremely

316
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,380
couple days later I am still extremely
 

317
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,980
couple days later I am still extremely
busy but I have found probably two or

318
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:09,990
busy but I have found probably two or
 

319
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,590
busy but I have found probably two or
three more hours I can record today so

320
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:12,600
three more hours I can record today so
 

321
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,870
three more hours I can record today so
let's try to get another project done

322
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
let's try to get another project done
 

323
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,150
let's try to get another project done
quickly here so last time we built that

324
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,160
quickly here so last time we built that
 

325
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,909
quickly here so last time we built that
the Enderman farm I was debating between

326
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:22,919
the Enderman farm I was debating between
 

327
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,190
the Enderman farm I was debating between
that and a gold farm or this general

328
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,200
that and a gold farm or this general
 

329
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,750
that and a gold farm or this general
building general building takes a little

330
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:26,760
building general building takes a little
 

331
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,240
building general building takes a little
bit of prep work though usually a little

332
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,250
bit of prep work though usually a little
 

333
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,120
bit of prep work though usually a little
bit of thinking but a gold farm gold

334
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,130
bit of thinking but a gold farm gold
 

335
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,340
bit of thinking but a gold farm gold
farms are easy so that's what we're

336
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,350
farms are easy so that's what we're
 

337
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,130
farms are easy so that's what we're
gonna do today I think we'll get started

338
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,140
gonna do today I think we'll get started
 

339
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,050
gonna do today I think we'll get started
on it anyway and it should be fun

340
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,060
on it anyway and it should be fun
 

341
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,070
on it anyway and it should be fun
because we can test it as we go here

342
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
because we can test it as we go here
 

343
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,930
because we can test it as we go here
okay but before we start building it I

344
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
okay but before we start building it I
 

345
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,460
okay but before we start building it I
do want to try to figure out what's

346
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,470
do want to try to figure out what's
 

347
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,690
do want to try to figure out what's
wrong with the old gold farm here so the

348
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:50,700
wrong with the old gold farm here so the
 

349
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,420
wrong with the old gold farm here so the
bunch of zombie pigmen stuck in the

350
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,430
bunch of zombie pigmen stuck in the
 

351
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,510
bunch of zombie pigmen stuck in the
portals right now I'm gonna turn them on

352
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
portals right now I'm gonna turn them on
 

353
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,950
portals right now I'm gonna turn them on
my problem is I have no idea where

354
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:57,960
my problem is I have no idea where
 

355
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,540
my problem is I have no idea where
they're going

356
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:00,550
they're going
 

357
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,580
they're going
I did this one nope this one that's why

358
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:05,590
I did this one nope this one that's why
 

359
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,170
I did this one nope this one that's why
you should label things to guys by the

360
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:07,180
you should label things to guys by the
 

361
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,910
you should label things to guys by the
way so yeah you see when I turn the

362
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:08,920
way so yeah you see when I turn the
 

363
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,450
way so yeah you see when I turn the
portals on that giant leg that's our

364
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:12,460
portals on that giant leg that's our
 

365
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,970
portals on that giant leg that's our
first big problem with this farm but

366
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:14,980
first big problem with this farm but
 

367
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,940
first big problem with this farm but
even after even after they go in it if

368
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:20,950
even after even after they go in it if
 

369
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,980
even after even after they go in it if
we go in these portals is it gonna take

370
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:22,990
we go in these portals is it gonna take
 

371
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,430
we go in these portals is it gonna take
me to the same place as them I wonder

372
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
me to the same place as them I wonder
 

373
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,200
me to the same place as them I wonder
did I can't seem to find them well still

374
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,210
did I can't seem to find them well still
 

375
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,830
did I can't seem to find them well still
lagging still lagging yeah this old

376
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:34,840
lagging still lagging yeah this old
 

377
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,120
lagging still lagging yeah this old
firms not working the best anymore

378
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,130
firms not working the best anymore
 

379
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,200
firms not working the best anymore
that's the part that's really confusing

380
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,210
that's the part that's really confusing
 

381
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,870
that's the part that's really confusing
me though cuz they're not going to the

382
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
me though cuz they're not going to the
 

383
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,310
me though cuz they're not going to the
same place as me when I go through the

384
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
same place as me when I go through the
 

385
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,370
same place as me when I go through the
portal so what where are they going I

386
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:47,380
portal so what where are they going I
 

387
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,700
portal so what where are they going I
think I have to look in like an MC edit

388
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:50,710
think I have to look in like an MC edit
 

389
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,030
think I have to look in like an MC edit
or something to actually figure it out

390
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
or something to actually figure it out
 

391
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,380
or something to actually figure it out
because whenever I try to find them

392
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,390
because whenever I try to find them
 

393
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:00,210
because whenever I try to find them
they're just gone uh-huh so that's a

394
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,220
they're just gone uh-huh so that's a
 

395
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,730
they're just gone uh-huh so that's a
little bit of a mystery to me guys I get

396
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:02,740
little bit of a mystery to me guys I get
 

397
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,680
little bit of a mystery to me guys I get
the impression portals might be broken

398
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:04,690
the impression portals might be broken
 

399
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,050
the impression portals might be broken
in the game currently like the zombie

400
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,060
in the game currently like the zombie
 

401
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,700
in the game currently like the zombie
pigmen are going to the wrong spot or

402
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:08,710
pigmen are going to the wrong spot or
 

403
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,820
pigmen are going to the wrong spot or
something because when we both go

404
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:11,830
something because when we both go
 

405
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,290
something because when we both go
through the same portal at the exact

406
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:13,300
through the same portal at the exact
 

407
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,880
through the same portal at the exact
same spot I've done this test a couple

408
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:14,890
same spot I've done this test a couple
 

409
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,670
same spot I've done this test a couple
more times we should end up at the same

410
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
more times we should end up at the same
 

411
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,230
more times we should end up at the same
place right but it's like they just

412
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,240
place right but it's like they just
 

413
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,880
place right but it's like they just
vanish like they went somewhere they

414
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:20,890
vanish like they went somewhere they
 

415
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,810
vanish like they went somewhere they
shouldn't have I don't know and we also

416
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:24,820
shouldn't have I don't know and we also
 

417
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,580
shouldn't have I don't know and we also
have that leg problem so here's the plan

418
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:26,590
have that leg problem so here's the plan
 

419
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,050
have that leg problem so here's the plan
we're going to build a new zombie Pigman

420
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,060
we're going to build a new zombie Pigman
 

421
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,300
we're going to build a new zombie Pigman
farm and we're going to try to build it

422
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,310
farm and we're going to try to build it
 

423
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,070
farm and we're going to try to build it
right above the nether hub if we tend so

424
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
right above the nether hub if we tend so
 

425
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,980
right above the nether hub if we tend so
I don't have to travel too far to use it

426
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:33,990
I don't have to travel too far to use it
 

427
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,860
I don't have to travel too far to use it
this platform is that why 232 I think

428
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:37,870
this platform is that why 232 I think
 

429
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,320
this platform is that why 232 I think
ideally we want to go as high up here as

430
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,330
ideally we want to go as high up here as
 

431
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,480
ideally we want to go as high up here as
possible

432
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:41,490
possible
 

433
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,940
possible
so mobs despawn when you 120 eight

434
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:44,950
so mobs despawn when you 120 eight
 

435
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,650
so mobs despawn when you 120 eight
blocks away from them they instantly do

436
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:46,660
blocks away from them they instantly do
 

437
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,850
blocks away from them they instantly do
spawn pretty much and the bedrock

438
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:50,860
spawn pretty much and the bedrock
 

439
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,990
spawn pretty much and the bedrock
barrier is that like 128 right so if we

440
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,000
barrier is that like 128 right so if we
 

441
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,690
barrier is that like 128 right so if we
go up to the very top here nothing

442
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:57,700
go up to the very top here nothing
 

443
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,280
go up to the very top here nothing
should be spawning below that bedrock

444
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,290
should be spawning below that bedrock
 

445
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,110
should be spawning below that bedrock
barrier as long as we stand above this

446
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
barrier as long as we stand above this
 

447
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,370
barrier as long as we stand above this
points or at this point here so we're

448
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:05,380
points or at this point here so we're
 

449
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,770
points or at this point here so we're
going to do this much like we did the

450
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:07,780
going to do this much like we did the
 

451
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,140
going to do this much like we did the
Enderman farm build pretty low tech

452
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,150
Enderman farm build pretty low tech
 

453
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,500
Enderman farm build pretty low tech
let's mark this as our

454
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:12,510
let's mark this as our
 

455
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,000
let's mark this as our
Center ich area I'm just going to start

456
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,010
Center ich area I'm just going to start
 

457
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,860
Center ich area I'm just going to start
putting down some spawning platform and

458
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:18,870
putting down some spawning platform and
 

459
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,290
putting down some spawning platform and
see what happens here I guess we do have

460
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,300
see what happens here I guess we do have
 

461
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,210
see what happens here I guess we do have
to like if we plan on standing here no

462
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,220
to like if we plan on standing here no
 

463
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,250
to like if we plan on standing here no
mobs will spawn within 24 blocks of you

464
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,260
mobs will spawn within 24 blocks of you
 

465
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,870
mobs will spawn within 24 blocks of you
so I am going to go out a little bit

466
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:29,880
so I am going to go out a little bit
 

467
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,310
so I am going to go out a little bit
here before I start building in the

468
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,320
here before I start building in the
 

469
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,940
here before I start building in the
platform okay so I'm just going to do

470
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:34,950
platform okay so I'm just going to do
 

471
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,130
platform okay so I'm just going to do
like a seven by seven platform here to

472
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,140
like a seven by seven platform here to
 

473
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,610
like a seven by seven platform here to
begin with this will be our first test

474
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:39,620
begin with this will be our first test
 

475
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,770
begin with this will be our first test
in the game previously mobs would not

476
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:42,780
in the game previously mobs would not
 

477
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,510
in the game previously mobs would not
spawn above 240 I think that changed in

478
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:46,520
spawn above 240 I think that changed in
 

479
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,070
spawn above 240 I think that changed in
1.9 though so let's take a couple steps

480
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,080
1.9 though so let's take a couple steps
 

481
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,920
1.9 though so let's take a couple steps
back and now I think they spawn at the

482
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:51,930
back and now I think they spawn at the
 

483
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,000
back and now I think they spawn at the
very top of the world alright this is

484
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,010
very top of the world alright this is
 

485
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,650
very top of the world alright this is
the moment where we want Sambi Pigman to

486
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:57,660
the moment where we want Sambi Pigman to
 

487
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:05,300
the moment where we want Sambi Pigman to
appear on that unless I'm wrong ok we

488
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,310
appear on that unless I'm wrong ok we
 

489
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,530
appear on that unless I'm wrong ok we
got yes not exactly what I wanted so

490
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:09,540
got yes not exactly what I wanted so
 

491
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,790
got yes not exactly what I wanted so
that is one problem

492
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
that is one problem
 

493
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,250
that is one problem
oh he's vanishing oh and I'm dead oh no

494
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,260
oh he's vanishing oh and I'm dead oh no
 

495
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,820
oh he's vanishing oh and I'm dead oh no
no no don't blow bolts hold things here

496
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:19,830
no no don't blow bolts hold things here
 

497
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:26,030
no no don't blow bolts hold things here
oh snap okay maybe we don't want to

498
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,040
oh snap okay maybe we don't want to
 

499
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,100
oh snap okay maybe we don't want to
build at the very top we might need to

500
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,110
build at the very top we might need to
 

501
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:35,690
build at the very top we might need to
add a gas proof barrier somehow but yeah

502
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:35,700
add a gas proof barrier somehow but yeah
 

503
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,280
add a gas proof barrier somehow but yeah
this is good we're getting zombie Pigman

504
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,290
this is good we're getting zombie Pigman
 

505
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,100
this is good we're getting zombie Pigman
spawning at the top chunk so we can we

506
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,110
spawning at the top chunk so we can we
 

507
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,330
spawning at the top chunk so we can we
can build this at the very top of the

508
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:41,340
can build this at the very top of the
 

509
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,180
can build this at the very top of the
world here and we're going to call this

510
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,190
world here and we're going to call this
 

511
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,770
world here and we're going to call this
hardened clay block here our center

512
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:45,780
hardened clay block here our center
 

513
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,470
hardened clay block here our center
point it's right above the the elevator

514
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
point it's right above the the elevator
 

515
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,420
point it's right above the the elevator
we got going up here so this is the very

516
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:50,430
we got going up here so this is the very
 

517
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,940
we got going up here so this is the very
center of the nether hub if I'm not

518
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:52,950
center of the nether hub if I'm not
 

519
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,940
center of the nether hub if I'm not
mistaken and then we're going to leave

520
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:55,950
mistaken and then we're going to leave
 

521
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,980
mistaken and then we're going to leave
at least a 3x3 platform for us to stand

522
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:57,990
at least a 3x3 platform for us to stand
 

523
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,080
at least a 3x3 platform for us to stand
on here as well so I counted 24 blocks

524
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,090
on here as well so I counted 24 blocks
 

525
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,110
on here as well so I counted 24 blocks
out here and our spawning area is going

526
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
out here and our spawning area is going
 

527
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,280
out here and our spawning area is going
to start here and we're going a couple

528
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,290
to start here and we're going a couple
 

529
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,170
to start here and we're going a couple
blocks lower than we were before so that

530
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,180
blocks lower than we were before so that
 

531
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,420
blocks lower than we were before so that
we can we have the option of putting a

532
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,430
we can we have the option of putting a
 

533
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,820
we can we have the option of putting a
roof over top here that will stop gas

534
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:13,830
roof over top here that will stop gas
 

535
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,730
roof over top here that will stop gas
from spawning and also the the big magma

536
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:16,740
from spawning and also the the big magma
 

537
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,530
from spawning and also the the big magma
cubes and all that kind of stuff that we

538
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:18,540
cubes and all that kind of stuff that we
 

539
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,890
cubes and all that kind of stuff that we
don't want alright so I'm going to do

540
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:21,900
don't want alright so I'm going to do
 

541
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,170
don't want alright so I'm going to do
pretty much the donut firm design I'm

542
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:24,180
pretty much the donut firm design I'm
 

543
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,199
pretty much the donut firm design I'm
sure most of you guys have seen that

544
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:26,209
sure most of you guys have seen that
 

545
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,540
sure most of you guys have seen that
we will try to optimize it a little bit

546
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,550
we will try to optimize it a little bit
 

547
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,430
we will try to optimize it a little bit
from what I've seen a lot of those donut

548
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,440
from what I've seen a lot of those donut
 

549
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,670
from what I've seen a lot of those donut
firms have very long travel time so

550
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
firms have very long travel time so
 

551
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,560
firms have very long travel time so
they'll have like one killing area for

552
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:35,570
they'll have like one killing area for
 

553
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,900
they'll have like one killing area for
the zombie pigmen that they try to

554
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:37,910
the zombie pigmen that they try to
 

555
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,699
the zombie pigmen that they try to
funnel them all to we're going to set up

556
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:39,709
funnel them all to we're going to set up
 

557
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,980
funnel them all to we're going to set up
several killing areas so that it's

558
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:41,990
several killing areas so that it's
 

559
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,259
several killing areas so that it's
hopefully a little bit more efficient

560
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:44,269
hopefully a little bit more efficient
 

561
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,139
hopefully a little bit more efficient
that way but the general idea is just to

562
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:47,149
that way but the general idea is just to
 

563
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,720
that way but the general idea is just to
get a whole bunch of spawning area down

564
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:49,730
get a whole bunch of spawning area down
 

565
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,430
get a whole bunch of spawning area down
so I'm going to build a big platform

566
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
so I'm going to build a big platform
 

567
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,150
so I'm going to build a big platform
here and then we will start having some

568
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,160
here and then we will start having some
 

569
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,970
here and then we will start having some
fun awesome

570
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:57,980
fun awesome
 

571
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,889
fun awesome
so I've been building our spotting

572
00:12:59,889 --> 00:12:59,899
so I've been building our spotting
 

573
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,900
so I've been building our spotting
platform here guys a big giant donut

574
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:01,910
platform here guys a big giant donut
 

575
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,290
platform here guys a big giant donut
it's got a 53 diameter circle for the

576
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,300
it's got a 53 diameter circle for the
 

577
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,480
it's got a 53 diameter circle for the
interior here and I'm probably gonna

578
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:07,490
interior here and I'm probably gonna
 

579
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,400
interior here and I'm probably gonna
make it at least five blocks wide and

580
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,410
make it at least five blocks wide and
 

581
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,889
make it at least five blocks wide and
we'll just see how that works but while

582
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:11,899
we'll just see how that works but while
 

583
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,480
we'll just see how that works but while
I was building we actually got some

584
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,490
I was building we actually got some
 

585
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,540
I was building we actually got some
internment spawned so they added this in

586
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,550
internment spawned so they added this in
 

587
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,759
internment spawned so they added this in
1.10 where Enderman didn't spawn very

588
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:18,769
1.10 where Enderman didn't spawn very
 

589
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,949
1.10 where Enderman didn't spawn very
rarely in the nether and apparently they

590
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
rarely in the nether and apparently they
 

591
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,069
rarely in the nether and apparently they
can also pick up netherrack now I want

592
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
can also pick up netherrack now I want
 

593
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,819
can also pick up netherrack now I want
to see if we force force-feed this guy

594
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:26,829
to see if we force force-feed this guy
 

595
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:31,540
to see if we force force-feed this guy
or look how delicious I know you want it

596
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:31,550
or look how delicious I know you want it
 

597
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,650
or look how delicious I know you want it
did I push him up a block well that was

598
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:35,660
did I push him up a block well that was
 

599
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,980
did I push him up a block well that was
weird somehow I made him go up a block

600
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:38,990
weird somehow I made him go up a block
 

601
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,129
weird somehow I made him go up a block
it's like he has auto jump can I do that

602
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:42,139
it's like he has auto jump can I do that
 

603
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,579
it's like he has auto jump can I do that
again

604
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:44,589

 

605
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:48,280

what okay that's very very weird

606
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,290
what okay that's very very weird
 

607
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,199
what okay that's very very weird
actually normally you can't do that with

608
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:50,209
actually normally you can't do that with
 

609
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,230
actually normally you can't do that with
mobs right is it just Enderman that do

610
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,240
mobs right is it just Enderman that do
 

611
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,160
mobs right is it just Enderman that do
that if I try to push his zombie pigman

612
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,170
that if I try to push his zombie pigman
 

613
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,300
that if I try to push his zombie pigman
he's not going up there

614
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,310

 

615
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,460

okay guys very cool so we got a basic

616
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:03,470
okay guys very cool so we got a basic
 

617
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,189
okay guys very cool so we got a basic
donut built snouts like five blocks wide

618
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:06,199
donut built snouts like five blocks wide
 

619
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,410
donut built snouts like five blocks wide
probably a few hundred spawning spaces

620
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:08,420
probably a few hundred spawning spaces
 

621
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,699
probably a few hundred spawning spaces
though this will be a good first test

622
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:09,709
though this will be a good first test
 

623
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,480
though this will be a good first test
for it we want to see how quickly they

624
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:12,490
for it we want to see how quickly they
 

625
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,970
for it we want to see how quickly they
spawn and respawn on it hopefully we can

626
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:15,980
spawn and respawn on it hopefully we can
 

627
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,800
spawn and respawn on it hopefully we can
get a never ending cycle of death going

628
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:17,810
get a never ending cycle of death going
 

629
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,350
get a never ending cycle of death going
on here so I'm setting up some trapdoors

630
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:20,360
on here so I'm setting up some trapdoors
 

631
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,449
on here so I'm setting up some trapdoors
here for this test they see these as

632
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:22,459
here for this test they see these as
 

633
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,670
here for this test they see these as
regular blocks in their pathfinding so

634
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:24,680
regular blocks in their pathfinding so
 

635
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,519
regular blocks in their pathfinding so
they actually run off one of them as

636
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:27,529
they actually run off one of them as
 

637
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,050
they actually run off one of them as
they try to walk to the next one and

638
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,060
they try to walk to the next one and
 

639
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,900
they try to walk to the next one and
walk walk overtop the air and and just

640
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:31,910
walk walk overtop the air and and just
 

641
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,740
walk walk overtop the air and and just
die so there's really not much to these

642
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:35,750
die so there's really not much to these
 

643
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,139
die so there's really not much to these
farms you just got to build a spawning

644
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:38,149
farms you just got to build a spawning
 

645
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,079
farms you just got to build a spawning
area shoot

646
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:39,089
area shoot
 

647
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:41,660
area shoot
of them and then they should all start

648
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:41,670
of them and then they should all start
 

649
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:47,629
of them and then they should all start
rushing me right okay looking good

650
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:47,639
rushing me right okay looking good
 

651
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,210
rushing me right okay looking good
looking very good so now how quickly are

652
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,220
looking very good so now how quickly are
 

653
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,610
looking very good so now how quickly are
they going to come back I don't see any

654
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:52,620
they going to come back I don't see any
 

655
00:14:52,620 --> 00:15:00,819
they going to come back I don't see any
yet oh there's three but they're not mad

656
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:00,829

 

657
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,769

yeah so we need a lot more spawning area

658
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:03,779
yeah so we need a lot more spawning area
 

659
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,249
yeah so we need a lot more spawning area
this is not nearly enough let's try it

660
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:07,259
this is not nearly enough let's try it
 

661
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,619
this is not nearly enough let's try it
again

662
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:08,629
again
 

663
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,939
again
but you see what happens if like the

664
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:10,949
but you see what happens if like the
 

665
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,340
but you see what happens if like the
guys over there for example why can't I

666
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,350
guys over there for example why can't I
 

667
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,059
guys over there for example why can't I
shoot them what's going on you see they

668
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:17,069
shoot them what's going on you see they
 

669
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:19,129
shoot them what's going on you see they
got to walk all the way over there and

670
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:19,139
got to walk all the way over there and
 

671
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,809
got to walk all the way over there and
then all the way over here we need to

672
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:20,819
then all the way over here we need to
 

673
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,420
then all the way over here we need to
reduce travel time as much as possible

674
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:23,430
reduce travel time as much as possible
 

675
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,499
reduce travel time as much as possible
because that takes them several seconds

676
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:26,509
because that takes them several seconds
 

677
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,850
because that takes them several seconds
so we want lots of areas where they can

678
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:28,860
so we want lots of areas where they can
 

679
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:41,540
so we want lots of areas where they can
fall down potentially okay guys so I

680
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,550
fall down potentially okay guys so I
 

681
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,249
fall down potentially okay guys so I
just used up all my clay blocks I

682
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:43,259
just used up all my clay blocks I
 

683
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,169
just used up all my clay blocks I
doubled the width of this ring the

684
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:45,179
doubled the width of this ring the
 

685
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,759
doubled the width of this ring the
spawning ring so we should get double

686
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:46,769
spawning ring so we should get double
 

687
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,309
spawning ring so we should get double
the spawns let's try it again now and

688
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:49,319
the spawns let's try it again now and
 

689
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,419
the spawns let's try it again now and
just see how big of a difference that

690
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:50,429
just see how big of a difference that
 

691
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:55,389
just see how big of a difference that
makes on on how this works we have to

692
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:55,399
makes on on how this works we have to
 

693
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:03,470
makes on on how this works we have to
get rid of you guys quickly oh oh oh is

694
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:03,480
get rid of you guys quickly oh oh oh is
 

695
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,400
get rid of you guys quickly oh oh oh is

it is it lagging wait a second they had
 

697
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,960
it is it lagging wait a second they had
very stuttered movement now it's going

698
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:08,970
very stuttered movement now it's going
 

699
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,249
very stuttered movement now it's going
quick again though cool cool they're all

quick again though cool cool they're all
 

701
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:14,989
quick again though cool cool they're all
dying very nice so we got a guy there

702
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:14,999
dying very nice so we got a guy there
 

703
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:21,799
dying very nice so we got a guy there
already still very bad spawn rates so we

704
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:21,809
already still very bad spawn rates so we
 

705
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,139
already still very bad spawn rates so we
need a lot more spotting area by the

706
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:24,149
need a lot more spotting area by the
 

707
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,360
