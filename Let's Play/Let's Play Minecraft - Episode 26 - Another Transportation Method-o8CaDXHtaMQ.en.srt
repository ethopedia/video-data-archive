00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,380
hey everyone how's it going what's going

hey everyone how's it going what's going
on what's new how's the family

4
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:08,389
on what's new how's the family

00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:15,700
on what's new how's the family
we're up here at our record studio area

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:15,710
we're up here at our record studio area
 

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,200
we're up here at our record studio area
and I just wanted to show you this thing

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,210
and I just wanted to show you this thing
 

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,439
and I just wanted to show you this thing
here before it's destroyed this is where

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:24,449
here before it's destroyed this is where
 

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:33,650
here before it's destroyed this is where
the records get made and a little

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:33,660
the records get made and a little
 

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,330
the records get made and a little
refresher this is how it works

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:37,340

 

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,889

the mobs get sent to this room here

16
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:39,899
the mobs get sent to this room here
 

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,880
the mobs get sent to this room here
we'll there everybody but the creepers

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:42,890
we'll there everybody but the creepers
 

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,450
we'll there everybody but the creepers
die and then they click creepers go

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:47,460
die and then they click creepers go
 

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,389
die and then they click creepers go
through this door up in this path and

22
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:53,399
through this door up in this path and
 

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:07,490
through this door up in this path and
into this water here and then this where

24
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,500
into this water here and then this where
 

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,590
into this water here and then this where
we can set skeletons they go in this

26
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:12,600
we can set skeletons they go in this
 

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,730
we can set skeletons they go in this
path and they get sent here so there's

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:16,740
path and they get sent here so there's
 

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,109
path and they get sent here so there's
two layers of water

30
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:20,119
two layers of water
 

31
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:28,359
two layers of water
skeletons go here creepers go above and

32
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:28,369

 

33
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:34,100

the idea behind this was I wanted notice

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,110
the idea behind this was I wanted notice
 

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,030
the idea behind this was I wanted notice
there's a hole in the roof here idea was

36
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,040
there's a hole in the roof here idea was
 

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,109
there's a hole in the roof here idea was
I would go to the top there for the hole

38
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:42,119
I would go to the top there for the hole
 

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,840
I would go to the top there for the hole
in the roof is

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:43,850
in the roof is
 

41
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,940
in the roof is
and the skeletons would shoot up at me

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:45,950
and the skeletons would shoot up at me
 

43
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,250
and the skeletons would shoot up at me
did the creepers and the reason why I

44
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,260
did the creepers and the reason why I
 

45
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:57,330
did the creepers and the reason why I
made it like that so that because a

46
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:57,340
made it like that so that because a
 

47
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,500
made it like that so that because a
skeleton seems to shoot arrows out of

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,510
skeleton seems to shoot arrows out of
 

49
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,380
skeleton seems to shoot arrows out of
the top of their head so it was

50
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:02,390
the top of their head so it was
 

51
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,850
the top of their head so it was
hopefully to make it so they wouldn't

52
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:03,860
hopefully to make it so they wouldn't
 

53
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:19,060
hopefully to make it so they wouldn't
shoot each other and this is the job man

54
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,070
shoot each other and this is the job man
 

55
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,699
shoot each other and this is the job man
Tito calls it the quick and dirty f mobs

56
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:21,709
Tito calls it the quick and dirty f mobs
 

57
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,770
Tito calls it the quick and dirty f mobs
order this is a fitting term for it

58
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:26,780
order this is a fitting term for it
 

59
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,810
order this is a fitting term for it
it works good for this case because I

60
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:28,820
it works good for this case because I
 

61
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,990
it works good for this case because I
want to need few skeletons in that room

62
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
want to need few skeletons in that room
 

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,180
want to need few skeletons in that room
I don't need to sort a whole bunch of

64
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,190
I don't need to sort a whole bunch of
 

65
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:49,780
I don't need to sort a whole bunch of
mobs and then you let this fill up a bit

66
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:49,790
mobs and then you let this fill up a bit
 

67
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,729
mobs and then you let this fill up a bit
and I'll show you how it works

68
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:53,739

 

69
00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:03,370

finally our skeleton

70
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,380

 

71
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,440

[Music]

72
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,450
[Music]
 

73
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:37,400
[Music]
they don't always come on and I don't

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,410
they don't always come on and I don't
 

75
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,330
they don't always come on and I don't
see any more coming so some of you have

76
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,340
see any more coming so some of you have
 

77
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,770
see any more coming so some of you have
pointed out that I should just make a

78
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:42,780
pointed out that I should just make a
 

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,900
pointed out that I should just make a
creeper her out of the scalp and sugar

80
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:44,910
creeper her out of the scalp and sugar
 

81
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,240
creeper her out of the scalp and sugar
the papers when they're in that room and

82
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,250
the papers when they're in that room and
 

83
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,260
the papers when they're in that room and
that's what I'm going to do now and it

84
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,270
that's what I'm going to do now and it
 

85
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,660
that's what I'm going to do now and it
makes sense because the scalp is pretty

86
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:56,670
makes sense because the scalp is pretty
 

87
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,320
makes sense because the scalp is pretty
much go right here which is very tensed

88
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,330
much go right here which is very tensed
 

89
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,030
much go right here which is very tensed
that room there but what I'm trying to

90
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
that room there but what I'm trying to
 

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,120
that room there but what I'm trying to
do with this thing is I wanted to have

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,130
do with this thing is I wanted to have
 

93
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,290
do with this thing is I wanted to have
multiple skeletons eaters

94
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:11,300
multiple skeletons eaters
 

95
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:31,660
multiple skeletons eaters
instead of just one and doesn't quite

96
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,670
instead of just one and doesn't quite
 

97
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:56,920
instead of just one and doesn't quite
work so I'll show you what it does the

98
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:56,930
work so I'll show you what it does the
 

99
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,720
work so I'll show you what it does the
issue is a skeleton still shoot each

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:58,730
issue is a skeleton still shoot each
 

101
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,420
issue is a skeleton still shoot each
other even though they're shooting

102
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:01,430
other even though they're shooting
 

103
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:10,210
other even though they're shooting
straight up and I'm probably going to

104
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,220
straight up and I'm probably going to
 

105
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,750
straight up and I'm probably going to
adjust this so that the mobs fall and

106
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:13,760
adjust this so that the mobs fall and
 

107
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,720
adjust this so that the mobs fall and
take damage so that they only need one

108
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:16,730
take damage so that they only need one
 

109
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:25,090
take damage so that they only need one
or two hits to die but so you can see in

110
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,100
or two hits to die but so you can see in
 

111
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,980
or two hits to die but so you can see in
here we got about four or five skeletons

112
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:28,990
here we got about four or five skeletons
 

113
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:36,880
here we got about four or five skeletons
at the bottom layer and then in there

114
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:36,890
at the bottom layer and then in there
 

115
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,830
at the bottom layer and then in there
we've got quite a few creepers so once I

116
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
we've got quite a few creepers so once I
 

117
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,140
we've got quite a few creepers so once I
walk over this hole I can put a boat

118
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,150
walk over this hole I can put a boat
 

119
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,090
walk over this hole I can put a boat
over this hole and stand on top of the

120
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,100
over this hole and stand on top of the
 

121
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,810
over this hole and stand on top of the
boat and they'll still shoot at me once

122
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:49,820
boat and they'll still shoot at me once
 

123
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,970
boat and they'll still shoot at me once
I walk over this will start shooting

124
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:53,980

 

125
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,640

and they still blow up the reason is

126
00:05:59,640 --> 00:05:59,650
and they still blow up the reason is
 

127
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,870
and they still blow up the reason is
since the skeleton still shoot each

128
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:01,880
since the skeleton still shoot each
 

129
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,670
since the skeleton still shoot each
other da time

130
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:08,680

 

131
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,140

the odd time the skeletons will shoot

132
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,150
the odd time the skeletons will shoot
 

133
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,560
the odd time the skeletons will shoot
each other

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:11,570
each other
 

135
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,070
each other
and the skeletons will shoot up a block

136
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,080
and the skeletons will shoot up a block
 

137
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,770
and the skeletons will shoot up a block
or two so that they're within range of

138
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:17,780
or two so that they're within range of
 

139
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,930
or two so that they're within range of
the creepers and then the creepers blow

140
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:19,940
the creepers and then the creepers blow
 

141
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,640
the creepers and then the creepers blow
up the skeletons so it's probably a huge

142
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:24,650
up the skeletons so it's probably a huge
 

143
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,910
up the skeletons so it's probably a huge
hole you know looks like so yeah I'm

144
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:30,920
hole you know looks like so yeah I'm
 

145
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,470
hole you know looks like so yeah I'm
going to adjust this so that they could

146
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:32,480
going to adjust this so that they could
 

147
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:45,970
going to adjust this so that they could
shoot at each other here so what do we

148
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:45,980
shoot at each other here so what do we
 

149
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,230
shoot at each other here so what do we
have here this is for free entertainer

150
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
have here this is for free entertainer
 

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,180
have here this is for free entertainer
in particular and I'm sure za Bandidos

152
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,190
in particular and I'm sure za Bandidos
 

153
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,610
in particular and I'm sure za Bandidos
is going to find this interesting - um

154
00:06:59,610 --> 00:06:59,620
is going to find this interesting - um
 

155
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,340
is going to find this interesting - um
so freak entertainer made a mob and

156
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,350
so freak entertainer made a mob and
 

157
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,860
so freak entertainer made a mob and
loader but it wasn't it's very similar

158
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:08,870
loader but it wasn't it's very similar
 

159
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,470
loader but it wasn't it's very similar
to this but it wasn't automated he had

160
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:14,480
to this but it wasn't automated he had
 

161
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,590
to this but it wasn't automated he had
to destroy the carts manually to free

162
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:17,600
to destroy the carts manually to free
 

163
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,440
to destroy the carts manually to free

have any torches darn that'll have to do
 

327
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,840
have any torches darn that'll have to do
so this is a possible new mode of

328
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:15,850
so this is a possible new mode of
 

329
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,120
so this is a possible new mode of
transportation using mine carts you'll

330
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,130
transportation using mine carts you'll
 

331
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,380
transportation using mine carts you'll
notice there's only tracks in the at the

332
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,390
notice there's only tracks in the at the
 

333
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:32,460
notice there's only tracks in the at the
turns here I want to see what you guys

334
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:32,470
turns here I want to see what you guys
 

335
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,540
turns here I want to see what you guys
think of this so I enter the my carts

336
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:38,550
think of this so I enter the my carts
 

337
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:44,820
think of this so I enter the my carts
nothing happens if I press down we take

338
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:44,830
nothing happens if I press down we take
 

339
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,140
nothing happens if I press down we take
off and we can travel on land that has

340
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,150
off and we can travel on land that has
 

341
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:57,900
off and we can travel on land that has
no tracks on but it is not very fast

342
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:57,910
no tracks on but it is not very fast
 

343
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,750
no tracks on but it is not very fast
it's about walking speed and the tracks

344
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
it's about walking speed and the tracks
 

345
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,970
it's about walking speed and the tracks
and the corners allow us to take turns

346
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:05,980
and the corners allow us to take turns
 

347
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,540
and the corners allow us to take turns
we can also make the my carts go up

348
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:09,550
we can also make the my carts go up
 

349
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,830
we can also make the my carts go up
slopes using the tracks

350
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:14,840

 

351
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,730

and what I would like to make this

352
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:18,740
and what I would like to make this
 

353
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,080
and what I would like to make this
actually I'm going to make you guys a

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,090
actually I'm going to make you guys a
 

355
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:26,530
actually I'm going to make you guys a

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,400
challenge can you create a reliable
method of transportation doing this I'm

358
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,410
method of transportation doing this I'm
 

359
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:41,530
method of transportation doing this I'm
going to show you how this works so I

360
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:41,540
going to show you how this works so I
 

361
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:49,800
going to show you how this works so I
had five mine carts there I noticed this

362
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:49,810

 

363
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,750

the mine carts are basically an infinite

364
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:52,760
the mine carts are basically an infinite
 

365
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,810
the mine carts are basically an infinite
booster they'll keep going forever

366
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:54,820
booster they'll keep going forever
 

367
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,250
booster they'll keep going forever
because they're constantly boosting each

368
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,260
because they're constantly boosting each
 

369
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,370
because they're constantly boosting each
other but they're also receiving

370
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:03,380
other but they're also receiving
 

371
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,810
other but they're also receiving
friction from touching the ground which

372
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:07,820
friction from touching the ground which
 

373
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,130
friction from touching the ground which
slows them down and also prevents them

374
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,140
slows them down and also prevents them
 

375
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:23,500
slows them down and also prevents them
from overloading so listening is

376
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:23,510
from overloading so listening is
 

377
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,710
from overloading so listening is
dropping five mine carts so that they're

378
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
dropping five mine carts so that they're
 

379
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,390
dropping five mine carts so that they're
in the exact same position and they

380
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,400
in the exact same position and they
 

381
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,710
in the exact same position and they
won't move as long as they're in the

382
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
won't move as long as they're in the
 

383
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,250
won't move as long as they're in the
exact same position but if one one card

384
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,260
exact same position but if one one card
 

385
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,680
exact same position but if one one card
or more carts is is moved slightly away

386
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:41,690
or more carts is is moved slightly away
 

387
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,290
or more carts is is moved slightly away
from the other ones then it'll start the

388
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:44,300
from the other ones then it'll start the
 

389
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,460
from the other ones then it'll start the
boosting and apparently my carts can be

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,470
boosting and apparently my carts can be
 

391
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,920
boosting and apparently my carts can be
controlled like boats you know how you

392
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:50,930
controlled like boats you know how you
 

393
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,020
controlled like boats you know how you
can steer boats you can steer mine carts

394
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,030
can steer boats you can steer mine carts
 

395

I'm inside one of the mine carts right
 

409
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm inside one of the mine carts right
now but there's five of them

one I'm in slightly back which starts
the boosting but you'll notice they're

the boosting but you'll notice they're
 

417
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:50,360
the boosting but you'll notice they're
only about walking speed which is a huge

only about walking speed which is a huge

flaw I think they'd be faster if they

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,490
flaw I think they'd be faster if they

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,520
flaw I think they'd be faster if they
were traveling on ice because there's

422
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,530
were traveling on ice because there's
 

423
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:02,180
were traveling on ice because there's
less friction but you can do some weird

424
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,190
less friction but you can do some weird
 

425
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:09,920
less friction but you can do some weird
things with them too for example you can

426

things with them too for example you can
 

427
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:16,690
things with them too for example you can
go into the ocean

they're kind of glitchy the goal is to

they're kind of glitchy the goal is to
make them reliable so as soon as uh so I

434

make them reliable so as soon as uh so I
 

435
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,520
make them reliable so as soon as uh so I
had them in a trench stereo there as
