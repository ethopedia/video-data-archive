like he's he just kind of stays put

70
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860
like he's he just kind of stays put

away and then and then he loses it it

78
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:02,700
away and then and then he loses it it
 

79
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,490

guy down here okay and can you see me
from up from up here still let's see if

164
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:21,780
from up from up here still let's see if
 

165
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,120
from up from up here still let's see if
you'll track us

166
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,130

 

167
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,720

I think you should mr. pig yeah he can

168
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:31,730

I think you should mr. pig yeah he can
see us okay let's go up a little bit

170
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:33,830
see us okay let's go up a little bit
 

171
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,620
see us okay let's go up a little bit
let's see how far until he loses focus

172
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:35,630
let's see how far until he loses focus
 

173
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,380
let's see how far until he loses focus
oh but I unselected it darn it okay

174
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,390
oh but I unselected it darn it okay
 

175
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,370
oh but I unselected it darn it okay
let's build like a staircase go up step

176
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:42,380
let's build like a staircase go up step
 

177
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,050
let's build like a staircase go up step
by step so we don't have to keep getting

178
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,060
by step so we don't have to keep getting
 

179
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,500
by step so we don't have to keep getting
his attention all right mr. pig there we

180
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:50,510
his attention all right mr. pig there we
 

181
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,500
his attention all right mr. pig there we
go okay so I'm going to go up one step

182
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,510
go okay so I'm going to go up one step
 

183
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,250
go okay so I'm going to go up one step
still sees us good go up another one

184
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,260
still sees us good go up another one
 

185
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,730
still sees us good go up another one
still sees us now now we lost them okay

186
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:00,740
still sees us now now we lost them okay
 

187
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,910
still sees us now now we lost them okay
so this is the absolute limit over here

188
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:02,920
so this is the absolute limit over here
 

189
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,590
so this is the absolute limit over here
which is one two three I'm guessing it's

190
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:08,600
which is one two three I'm guessing it's
 

191
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:16,330
which is one two three I'm guessing it's
eight four five six seven eight ish I'll

192
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:16,340
eight four five six seven eight ish I'll
 

193
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,120
eight four five six seven eight ish I'll
call it eight so up to eight blocks away

194
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,130
call it eight so up to eight blocks away
 

195
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,780
call it eight so up to eight blocks away
ninth nine if you count the pig itself

196
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:21,790
ninth nine if you count the pig itself
 

197
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,280
ninth nine if you count the pig itself
we can get his attention and that works

198
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,290
we can get his attention and that works
 

199
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,730
we can get his attention and that works
through walls and stuff like ant path

200
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:27,740
through walls and stuff like ant path
 

201
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,800
through walls and stuff like ant path
find towards us it still works is what

202
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:29,810
find towards us it still works is what
 

203
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,090
find towards us it still works is what
I'm trying to say all right double check

204
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,100
I'm trying to say all right double check
 

205
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm trying to say all right double check
that yeah so he'll follow us no matter

206
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:37,970
that yeah so he'll follow us no matter
 

207
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,190
that yeah so he'll follow us no matter
where we put them as long as we're

208
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,200
where we put them as long as we're
 

209
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,650
where we put them as long as we're
within eight blocks of us he can do

210
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:41,660
within eight blocks of us he can do
 

211
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,940
within eight blocks of us he can do
stuff okay so if we were to do this

212
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:45,950
stuff okay so if we were to do this
 

213
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,980
stuff okay so if we were to do this
let's let's set up an example here let's

214
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:47,990
let's let's set up an example here let's
 

215
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,530
let's let's set up an example here let's
pretend there's a wall here the pig is

216
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:50,540
pretend there's a wall here the pig is
 

217
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,880
pretend there's a wall here the pig is
hidden inside the wall

218
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:51,890
hidden inside the wall
 

219
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,970
hidden inside the wall
and when we come up this hallway we want

220
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:54,980
and when we come up this hallway we want
 

221
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,610
and when we come up this hallway we want
a door to open or something so little

222
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:57,620
a door to open or something so little
 

223
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,410
a door to open or something so little
we'll just use a light to represent the

224
00:05:59,410 --> 00:05:59,420
we'll just use a light to represent the
 

225
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,570
we'll just use a light to represent the
door all right

226
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:01,580
door all right
 

227
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,880
door all right
how reliably do you think we could get

228
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:03,890
how reliably do you think we could get
 

229
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,450
how reliably do you think we could get
this to work I have no idea because we

230
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:07,460
this to work I have no idea because we
 

231
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,100
this to work I have no idea because we
don't want the pig opening the door just

232
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,110
don't want the pig opening the door just
 

233
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,080
don't want the pig opening the door just
randomly on its own for one thing we

234
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,090
randomly on its own for one thing we
 

235
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,000
randomly on its own for one thing we
only want it to happen when we have the

236
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,010
only want it to happen when we have the
 

237
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,820
only want it to happen when we have the
carrot selected and ideally as quickly

238
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:15,830
carrot selected and ideally as quickly
 

239
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,520
carrot selected and ideally as quickly
as possible too so we would probably

240
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:18,530
as possible too so we would probably
 

241
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,930
as possible too so we would probably
want the pig just like resting in a 1x1

242
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:22,940
want the pig just like resting in a 1x1
 

243
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,520
want the pig just like resting in a 1x1
block area or something I was to guess

244
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:26,530
block area or something I was to guess
 

245
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,070
block area or something I was to guess
build this up so you can't jump over all

246
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
build this up so you can't jump over all
 

247
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,450
build this up so you can't jump over all
right so you're very cooperative I like

248
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:31,460
right so you're very cooperative I like
 

249
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,719
right so you're very cooperative I like
you getting shoved around you're not

250
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:34,729
you getting shoved around you're not
 

251
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,010
you getting shoved around you're not
biting me or anything that's great okay

252
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,020
biting me or anything that's great okay
 

253
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,930
biting me or anything that's great okay
and then maybe water let's let's see if

254
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:43,940
and then maybe water let's let's see if
 

255
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,190
and then maybe water let's let's see if
he can fight the currents first off ok

256
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,200
he can fight the currents first off ok
 

257
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,110
he can fight the currents first off ok
and he's only one tall so maybe we can

258
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,120
and he's only one tall so maybe we can
 

259
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,130
and he's only one tall so maybe we can
do this even we'll see if I have the

260
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,140
do this even we'll see if I have the
 

261
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,790
do this even we'll see if I have the
carrot no he cannot escape that oh ok

262
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:57,800
carrot no he cannot escape that oh ok
 

263
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,350
carrot no he cannot escape that oh ok
what if we get rid of the blocks above

264
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
what if we get rid of the blocks above
 

265
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,260
what if we get rid of the blocks above
how about now no really

266
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,270
how about now no really
 

267
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:13,750
how about now no really
okay oh I was hoping that would work ok

268
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:13,760
okay oh I was hoping that would work ok
 

269
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,430
okay oh I was hoping that would work ok
so if I select the carrot will you go

270
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
so if I select the carrot will you go
 

271
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,150
so if I select the carrot will you go
through the water oh it does okay good

272
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,160
through the water oh it does okay good
 

273
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,830
through the water oh it does okay good
the other thing I want to see though is

274
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:20,840
the other thing I want to see though is
 

275
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,440
the other thing I want to see though is
if actually this is dangerous right

276
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,450
if actually this is dangerous right
 

277
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,670
if actually this is dangerous right
because if I unselect it he's gonna die

278
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
because if I unselect it he's gonna die
 

279
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,040
because if I unselect it he's gonna die
umm big you better get out of there

aha I think I have a good idea now I
this might actually work what we're

302
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,210
this might actually work what we're
 

303
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,600
this might actually work what we're
gonna do is get the pig into position

304
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:16,610
gonna do is get the pig into position
 

305
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:22,170
gonna do is get the pig into position
into the water there we go very good and

306
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,180

 

307
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,880

yeah I think I think we can do this he's

308

yeah I think I think we can do this he's
 

309
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,040
yeah I think I think we can do this he's
jumping though what we want to do is

310
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,050
jumping though what we want to do is
 

311
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,570

here let's do that so he stops jumping
 

317
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,540
here let's do that so he stops jumping
alright this is a bit tricky but it

318
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:40,550
alright this is a bit tricky but it
 

319
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,570
alright this is a bit tricky but it
should work and then if we activate this

320
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:43,580
should work and then if we activate this
 

321
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,940
should work and then if we activate this
this piston it'll push the fence down

322
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:45,950
this piston it'll push the fence down
 

323
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,210
this piston it'll push the fence down
into the pig then we can put a pressure

324
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:49,220
into the pig then we can put a pressure
 

325
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,240
into the pig then we can put a pressure
plate on top and as long

326
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,250
plate on top and as long
 

327
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,079
plate on top and as long
as we seal this off the pig should never

328
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:56,089
as we seal this off the pig should never
 

329
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,220
as we seal this off the pig should never
path find out of here right no reason to

330
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,230
path find out of here right no reason to
 

331
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,590
path find out of here right no reason to
go anywhere get rid of our piston up

332
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:02,600
go anywhere get rid of our piston up
 

333
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,319
go anywhere get rid of our piston up
here all right I think that's good so

334
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:08,329
here all right I think that's good so
 

335
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,269
here all right I think that's good so
the pig is this going to stay there I'm

336
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:10,279
the pig is this going to stay there I'm
 

337
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,220
the pig is this going to stay there I'm
pretty sure I don't think he'll go to

338
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:12,230
pretty sure I don't think he'll go to
 

339
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,780
pretty sure I don't think he'll go to
the water but we'll watch it for a

340
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:13,790
the water but we'll watch it for a
 

341
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,420
the water but we'll watch it for a
second just to be sure but if I have the

342
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,430
second just to be sure but if I have the
 

343
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,730
second just to be sure but if I have the
carrot then he's gonna activate the

344
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:18,740
carrot then he's gonna activate the
 

345
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,920
carrot then he's gonna activate the
pressure plates AHA and that's kind of

346
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:23,930
pressure plates AHA and that's kind of
 

347
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,309
pressure plates AHA and that's kind of
the key as soon as we unselect it he

348
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:27,319
the key as soon as we unselect it he
 

349
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:33,009
the key as soon as we unselect it he
should stop activating it right hasn't

350
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:33,019
should stop activating it right hasn't
 

351
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:38,530
should stop activating it right hasn't
seen us yet it's thinking about us it's

352
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:38,540
seen us yet it's thinking about us it's
 

353
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,990
seen us yet it's thinking about us it's
taken him a long time this time oh there

354
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,000
taken him a long time this time oh there
 

355
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,100
taken him a long time this time oh there
we go okay so soon to be let go

356
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,110
we go okay so soon to be let go
 

357
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,400
we go okay so soon to be let go
he stops okay so what we would have to

358
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,410
he stops okay so what we would have to
 

359
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,699
he stops okay so what we would have to
do then is get the signal out of here I

360
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:50,709
do then is get the signal out of here I
 

361
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,160
do then is get the signal out of here I
wonder if we use the repeater he might

362
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,170
wonder if we use the repeater he might
 

363
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,960
wonder if we use the repeater he might
be able to escape then that wouldn't be

364
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:55,970
be able to escape then that wouldn't be
 

365
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,790
be able to escape then that wouldn't be
good let's try it though don't don't get

366
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
good let's try it though don't don't get
 

367
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,299
good let's try it though don't don't get
out nope nope you can't come here the

368
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:04,309
out nope nope you can't come here the
 

369
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,490
out nope nope you can't come here the
repeater has a little bit of a hitbox so

370
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:06,500
repeater has a little bit of a hitbox so
 

371
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,809
repeater has a little bit of a hitbox so
I don't know if you'll try to get out of

372
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:07,819
I don't know if you'll try to get out of
 

373
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:13,360
I don't know if you'll try to get out of
that on his own there's lots of nice

374
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,370
that on his own there's lots of nice
 

375
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,009
that on his own there's lots of nice
grass out here do you want to come see

376
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:15,019
grass out here do you want to come see
 

377
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:21,569
grass out here do you want to come see
it how he is trying to get out okay um

378
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:21,579
it how he is trying to get out okay um
 

379
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,720
it how he is trying to get out okay um
we can't do it this way then they won't

380
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:25,730
we can't do it this way then they won't
 

381
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,340
we can't do it this way then they won't
believe me if you don't do it Pig come

382
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,350
believe me if you don't do it Pig come
 

383
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,980
believe me if you don't do it Pig come
on just go in the water let's pretend

384
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:29,990
on just go in the water let's pretend
 

385
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,329
on just go in the water let's pretend
I'm not recording you did it before

386
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:33,339
I'm not recording you did it before
 

387
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,369
I'm not recording you did it before
there there he just did it he did it

388
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:36,379
there there he just did it he did it
 

389
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:40,319
there there he just did it he did it
proof I got proof on camera aha I

390
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:40,329
proof I got proof on camera aha I
 

391
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,910
proof I got proof on camera aha I
tricked you he thought I wasn't

392
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:42,920
tricked you he thought I wasn't
 

393
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,980
tricked you he thought I wasn't
recording but I really was so that took

394
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:44,990
recording but I really was so that took
 

395
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,369
recording but I really was so that took
a long time but you can see even though

396
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:48,379
a long time but you can see even though
 

397
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:51,850
a long time but you can see even though
I put a stair in there and these two

398
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:51,860
I put a stair in there and these two
 

399
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,999
I put a stair in there and these two
blocks are water he still tries to path

400
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:55,009
blocks are water he still tries to path
 

401
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,519
blocks are water he still tries to path
find into these two water blocks which

402
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:57,529
find into these two water blocks which
 

403
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,860
find into these two water blocks which
is a problem because in order to make a

404
00:10:59,860 --> 00:10:59,870
is a problem because in order to make a
 

405
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,389
is a problem because in order to make a
reliable switch we don't want it

406
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:01,399
reliable switch we don't want it
 

407
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,569
reliable switch we don't want it
activating randomly on its own we only

408
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:04,579
activating randomly on its own we only
 

409
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:05,710
activating randomly on its own we only
want it to happen when we

410
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:05,720
want it to happen when we
 

411
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,699
want it to happen when we
a carrot selected right so we have a

412
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:09,709
a carrot selected right so we have a
 

413
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:13,090
a carrot selected right so we have a
slight problem with this design I did

414
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,100
slight problem with this design I did
 

415
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,410
slight problem with this design I did
figure out a way we could get the

416
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:14,420
figure out a way we could get the
 

417
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,210
figure out a way we could get the
redstone signal out of here though if we

418
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:16,220
redstone signal out of here though if we
 

419
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,720
redstone signal out of here though if we
wanted to use this this method basically

420
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:19,730
wanted to use this this method basically
 

421
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,090
wanted to use this this method basically
we can't get it out of the sides without

422
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,100
we can't get it out of the sides without
 

423
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,670
we can't get it out of the sides without
opening up the walls so we would have to

424
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:24,680
opening up the walls so we would have to
 

425
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,100
opening up the walls so we would have to
like dropper into a hopper it's not a

426
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,110
like dropper into a hopper it's not a
 

427
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,530
like dropper into a hopper it's not a
pretty method but it would work and then

428
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:32,540
pretty method but it would work and then
 

429
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,650
pretty method but it would work and then
like have a comparator detect when

430
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:35,660
like have a comparator detect when
 

431
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,980
like have a comparator detect when
something goes in there alright so we

432
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:38,990
something goes in there alright so we
 

433
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,449
something goes in there alright so we
have an item in here and then when the

434
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:43,459
have an item in here and then when the
 

435
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:45,759
have an item in here and then when the
pig activates its air let's put a light

436
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:45,769
pig activates its air let's put a light
 

437
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:51,670
pig activates its air let's put a light
down to there this is how we could

438
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
down to there this is how we could
 

439
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,769
down to there this is how we could
detect it but yeah that is an issue I

440
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:56,779
detect it but yeah that is an issue I
 

441
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,509
detect it but yeah that is an issue I
really don't know what to do about that

442
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:58,519
really don't know what to do about that
 

443
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,579
really don't know what to do about that
because the beautiful thing about this

444
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:00,589
because the beautiful thing about this
 

445
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,980
because the beautiful thing about this
is it was self resetting as soon as the

446
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:02,990
is it was self resetting as soon as the
 

447
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,420
is it was self resetting as soon as the
pig would go into the water he would get

448
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,430
pig would go into the water he would get
 

449
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,319
pig would go into the water he would get
pushed back if we get rid of it he's not

450
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,329
pushed back if we get rid of it he's not
 

451
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:11,499
pushed back if we get rid of it he's not
gonna move at all okay I got a new idea

452
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:11,509
gonna move at all okay I got a new idea
 

453
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,660
gonna move at all okay I got a new idea
guys let's try something here we might

454
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:13,670
guys let's try something here we might
 

455
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,110
guys let's try something here we might
be able to do it with minecarts I

456
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,120
be able to do it with minecarts I
 

457
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,340
be able to do it with minecarts I
remember something odd about mobs in

458
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,350
remember something odd about mobs in
 

459
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,480
remember something odd about mobs in
mine carts now okay one of you I don't

460
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,490
mine carts now okay one of you I don't
 

461
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:31,049
mine carts now okay one of you I don't
care who age before beauty

462
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:31,059

 

463
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:35,559

haha no oh wait no that means I'm old oh

464
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:35,569
haha no oh wait no that means I'm old oh
 

465
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:40,379
haha no oh wait no that means I'm old oh
darn it I got them I got them mixed up

466
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:40,389
darn it I got them I got them mixed up
 

467
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:42,900
darn it I got them I got them mixed up
somebody go in the stupid minecart

468
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:42,910
somebody go in the stupid minecart
 

469
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:49,869
somebody go in the stupid minecart
come on it's not supposed to be this

470
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:49,879
come on it's not supposed to be this
 

471
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,240
come on it's not supposed to be this

him trapped oh that doesn't look good he
 

479
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,879
him trapped oh that doesn't look good he
already moved um this might not work

480
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:06,889
already moved um this might not work
 

481
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,309
already moved um this might not work
actually I think it has the same problem

482
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:09,319
actually I think it has the same problem
 

483
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,259
actually I think it has the same problem
where even though he's in a minecart

484
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:11,269
where even though he's in a minecart
 

485
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,900
where even though he's in a minecart
he's randomly seeing these two blocks

486
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:15,910
he's randomly seeing these two blocks
 

487
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,210
he's randomly seeing these two blocks
but we'll try it let's make sure

488
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:19,220
but we'll try it let's make sure
 

489
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,949
but we'll try it let's make sure
I'm going to totally seal it up all

490
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
I'm going to totally seal it up all
 

491
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,679
I'm going to totally seal it up all
corners and everything alright so if we

492
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:26,689
corners and everything alright so if we
 

493
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,879
corners and everything alright so if we
select a carrot you can move right

494
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:29,889
select a carrot you can move right
 

495
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,480
select a carrot you can move right
that's good

496
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,490
that's good
 

497
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,429
that's good
they path fine towards you or track you

498
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:35,439
they path fine towards you or track you
 

499
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,480
they path fine towards you or track you
which is what I was hoping for I'm gonna

500
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,490
which is what I was hoping for I'm gonna
 

501
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,660
which is what I was hoping for I'm gonna
watch it for a second

502
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:39,670
watch it for a second
 

503
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,449
watch it for a second
why are you doing that stop moving mm

504
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:45,459
why are you doing that stop moving mm
 

505
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,860
why are you doing that stop moving mm
let me just watch him for a second I

506
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:47,870
let me just watch him for a second I
 

507
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,179
let me just watch him for a second I
think he's gonna move on his own though

508
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:51,189
think he's gonna move on his own though
 

509
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:52,900
think he's gonna move on his own though
yeah there we go

510
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:52,910
yeah there we go
 

511
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,040
yeah there we go
darn it's um okay I'll have to think of

512
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,050
darn it's um okay I'll have to think of
 

513
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,769
darn it's um okay I'll have to think of
another idea then okay there we go you

514
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:02,779
another idea then okay there we go you
 

515
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:10,240
another idea then okay there we go you
see that ah really I tell you what guys

516
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,250
see that ah really I tell you what guys
 

517
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,040
see that ah really I tell you what guys
I'm a little sad now I thought I had a

518
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,050
I'm a little sad now I thought I had a
 

519
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,929
I'm a little sad now I thought I had a
perfect method figured out here I

520
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:13,939
perfect method figured out here I
 

521
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:16,030
perfect method figured out here I
thought it was perfect

522
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,040
thought it was perfect
 

523
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
thought it was perfect
IAF Kate here for ten minutes without

524
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,050
IAF Kate here for ten minutes without
 

525
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,400
IAF Kate here for ten minutes without
any problems yeah because you see what

526
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,410
any problems yeah because you see what
 

527
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,559
any problems yeah because you see what
he does he usually only gets the second

528
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:23,569
he does he usually only gets the second
 

529
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:26,049
he does he usually only gets the second
one and then it fails it's only I think

530
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:26,059
one and then it fails it's only I think
 

531
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,480
one and then it fails it's only I think
if it fails and then he tries again it

532
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:28,490
if it fails and then he tries again it
 

533
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,579
if it fails and then he tries again it
like right after before the minecart

534
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:30,589
like right after before the minecart
 

535
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,829
like right after before the minecart
rolls down can he get higher than that

536
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:32,839
rolls down can he get higher than that
 

537
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,740
rolls down can he get higher than that
so it's extremely rare I have F cave

538
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:35,750
so it's extremely rare I have F cave
 

539
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,929
so it's extremely rare I have F cave
here ten minutes left 60 for dirt in

540
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:37,939
here ten minutes left 60 for dirt in
 

541
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:40,269
here ten minutes left 60 for dirt in
here and when I came back it was all

542
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:40,279
here and when I came back it was all
 

543
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,309
here and when I came back it was all
there then I started recording and it

544
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:42,319
there then I started recording and it
 

545
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:47,049
there then I started recording and it
failed the first time uh-huh but this is

546
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:47,059
failed the first time uh-huh but this is
 

547
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:49,329
failed the first time uh-huh but this is
good enough I think I'll use it so I

548
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:49,339
good enough I think I'll use it so I
 

549
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:50,980
good enough I think I'll use it so I
figured something out with the carrots

550
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:50,990
figured something out with the carrots
 

551
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,379
figured something out with the carrots
too it seems when you select them they

552
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:53,389
too it seems when you select them they
 

553
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,420
too it seems when you select them they
the pig instantly follows you so check

554
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,430
the pig instantly follows you so check
 

555
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,769
the pig instantly follows you so check
this out always it always works but

556
00:14:59,769 --> 00:14:59,779
this out always it always works but
 

557
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,660
this out always it always works but
after you deselect it there's a cool

558
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:01,670
after you deselect it there's a cool
 

559
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,819
after you deselect it there's a cool
down timer so the pig is going to ignore

560
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:03,829
down timer so the pig is going to ignore
 

561
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:06,759
down timer so the pig is going to ignore
me for you know I never did time it but

562
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:06,769
me for you know I never did time it but
 

563
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:08,590
me for you know I never did time it but
I'm guessing it's about 15 seconds or so

564
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:08,600
I'm guessing it's about 15 seconds or so
 

565
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,650
I'm guessing it's about 15 seconds or so
um but this is good enough that I think

566
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:11,660
um but this is good enough that I think
 

567
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,319
um but this is good enough that I think
we can use it and I don't know if it's

568
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:14,329
we can use it and I don't know if it's
 

569
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,730
we can use it and I don't know if it's
close enough I kind of built it a little

570
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:15,740
close enough I kind of built it a little
 

571
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,689
close enough I kind of built it a little
far away here but we'll try yeah you

572
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:19,699
far away here but we'll try yeah you
 

573
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,600
far away here but we'll try yeah you
hear that you rolled up the hill so I

574
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:22,610
hear that you rolled up the hill so I
 

575
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,179
hear that you rolled up the hill so I
think I think it's pretty pretty much

576
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:25,189
think I think it's pretty pretty much
 

577
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,619
think I think it's pretty pretty much
good unless you guys can think of a way

578
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:26,629
good unless you guys can think of a way
 

579
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:29,259
good unless you guys can think of a way
of making it even better I'm going to

580
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:29,269
of making it even better I'm going to
 

581
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,910
of making it even better I'm going to
say this is the best you can do

582
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
say this is the best you can do
 

583
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,949
say this is the best you can do
and actually now that I think of it

584
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:33,959
and actually now that I think of it
 

585
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,139
and actually now that I think of it
after saying that you know if we just go

586
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:36,149
after saying that you know if we just go
 

587
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,480
after saying that you know if we just go
up one more to a fourth one I want this

588
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,490
up one more to a fourth one I want this
 

589
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,790
up one more to a fourth one I want this
as compact as possible to of course but

590
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
as compact as possible to of course but
 

591
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,680
as compact as possible to of course but
if we go one more block make it a little

592
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:42,690
if we go one more block make it a little
 

593
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,079
if we go one more block make it a little
bit bigger I don't think the big will

594
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:45,089
bit bigger I don't think the big will
 

595
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,300
bit bigger I don't think the big will
reach this or extremely extremely rarely

596
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,310
reach this or extremely extremely rarely
 

597
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,449
reach this or extremely extremely rarely
yeah this is how I'm gonna build it

598
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:52,459
yeah this is how I'm gonna build it
 

599
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,769
yeah this is how I'm gonna build it
awesome so now we know how to make a big

600
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:54,779
awesome so now we know how to make a big
 

601
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,170
awesome so now we know how to make a big
switch that seems fairly reliable I'm

602
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,180
switch that seems fairly reliable I'm
 

603
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,300
switch that seems fairly reliable I'm
gonna set some up in the man cave or at

604
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,310
gonna set some up in the man cave or at
 

605
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,600
gonna set some up in the man cave or at
least one so we can try it on something

606
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,610
least one so we can try it on something
 

607
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,939
least one so we can try it on something
like a door or something just to try it

608
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:04,949
like a door or something just to try it
 

609
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:07,970
like a door or something just to try it
out before we do that though just to get

610
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:07,980
out before we do that though just to get
 

611
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,699
out before we do that though just to get
some variety in this episode as much as

612
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:10,709
some variety in this episode as much as
 

613
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,280
some variety in this episode as much as
I love pig power

614
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,290
I love pig power
 

615
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,750
I love pig power
maybe I'll just show you this so I went

616
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:14,760
maybe I'll just show you this so I went
 

617
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,480
maybe I'll just show you this so I went
through this path finally and mixed in

618
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:17,490
through this path finally and mixed in
 

619
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,360
through this path finally and mixed in
some cobblestone because it was all

620
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,370
some cobblestone because it was all
 

621
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,069
some cobblestone because it was all
gravel before and I didn't like to have

622
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
gravel before and I didn't like to have
 

623
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,720
gravel before and I didn't like to have
that look so I mixed in some cobblestone

624
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:23,730
that look so I mixed in some cobblestone
 

625
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,210
that look so I mixed in some cobblestone
and man I tell you that makes a big

626
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,220
and man I tell you that makes a big
 

627
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,150
and man I tell you that makes a big
difference I like it a lot more all

big power to this door over here in the
 

693
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,320
big power to this door over here in the
lab it's a perfect candidate for it

694
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,330
lab it's a perfect candidate for it
 

695
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,030
lab it's a perfect candidate for it
because there's no button or pressure

696
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,040
because there's no button or pressure

699
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,289
plate on this side of the door I can't
close it once I'm on this side I have to

700
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:01,299
close it once I'm on this side I have to
 

701
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,659
close it once I'm on this side I have to
go back and then close it with this

702
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:03,669
go back and then close it with this
 

703
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,240
go back and then close it with this
button so it's not a very good door as

704

button so it's not a very good door as
 

705
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,270
button so it's not a very good door as
it is to get a button on this side or

706
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
it is to get a button on this side or
 

707
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,880
it is to get a button on this side or
pressure plates I would have to like put

708
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:11,890
pressure plates I would have to like put
 

709
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,890
pressure plates I would have to like put
redstone somewhere where we can see it

710
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:13,900
redstone somewhere where we can see it
 

711
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,500
redstone somewhere where we can see it
like the buttons here I need redstone

712
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,510
like the buttons here I need redstone
 

713
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,310
like the buttons here I need redstone
here but if we do Pig power since it's

714
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
here but if we do Pig power since it's
 

715
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,150
here but if we do Pig power since it's
hidden in the wall we won't see it and

716
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
hidden in the wall we won't see it and
 

717
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,520
hidden in the wall we won't see it and
it should work I hope if there's enough

718
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:26,530
it should work I hope if there's enough
 

719
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,780
it should work I hope if there's enough
space back here okay so here we go

720
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:30,790
space back here okay so here we go
 

721
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,360
space back here okay so here we go
everyone we have pig power installed on

722
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,370
everyone we have pig power installed on
 

723
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,600

nothing happens
alright that's what you would expect if

730
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
alright that's what you would expect if
 

731
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,900
alright that's what you would expect if
we do it with a keratin in hand our key

732
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:45,910
we do it with a keratin in hand our key
 

733
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:53,190
we do it with a keratin in hand our key
card then big power activates pretty

734
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
card then big power activates pretty
 

735
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,260
card then big power activates pretty
cool you've got to hang around it'll

736
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,270
cool you've got to hang around it'll
 

737
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,980
cool you've got to hang around it'll
close and then we can go on with our day

738
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:58,990
close and then we can go on with our day
 

739
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,919
close and then we can go on with our day
and the doors closed rights there's a 15

740
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:01,929
and the doors closed rights there's a 15
 

741
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:04,409
and the doors closed rights there's a 15
second or 20 second whatever it is time

742
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:04,419
second or 20 second whatever it is time
 

743
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,299
second or 20 second whatever it is time
before we can activate it again though

744
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:06,309
before we can activate it again though
 

745
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,909
before we can activate it again though
but by now enough time is probably

746
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:08,919
but by now enough time is probably
 

747
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,580
but by now enough time is probably
passed so if we walk up with the carrots

748
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:13,590

 

749
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:20,130

big power uh-huh that's that's the kind

750
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,140
big power uh-huh that's that's the kind
 

751
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,960
big power uh-huh that's that's the kind
of idea - it's I think it's cool

752
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:21,970
of idea - it's I think it's cool
 

753
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,169
of idea - it's I think it's cool
it isn't perfect though I have to say

sometimes he activates it when I don't
 

757
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,549
sometimes he activates it when I don't
have a carrot in hand just on his own

and I don't know why or if there's any
 

761

and I don't know why or if there's any
way to make it better

762
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:33,640
way to make it better
 

763
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,090

what what the deal is why does he want

766
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
what what the deal is why does he want
 

767
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,480
what what the deal is why does he want
to go there I have no idea

768
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,490

 

769
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,180

most of the time like in that other area

770
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,190
most of the time like in that other area
 

771
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,789
most of the time like in that other area
he didn't seem to do it as much so

772
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
he didn't seem to do it as much so
 

773
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,620
he didn't seem to do it as much so
something with this path finding in this

774
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:52,630
something with this path finding in this
 

775
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,220
something with this path finding in this
area makes them more likely to go to the

776
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,230
area makes them more likely to go to the
 

777
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,149
area makes them more likely to go to the
top there I guess there's more

778
00:19:59,149 --> 00:19:59,159
top there I guess there's more
 

779
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,070
top there I guess there's more
more places he can go I don't know I'm

780
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,080
more places he can go I don't know I'm
 

781

more places he can go I don't know I'm
watching you Pig I know you're gonna do

it again okay he's not doing it again
 

785
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,960
it again okay he's not doing it again
it's pretty rare but I would like it to
