317
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,240
if I can do it - if I can be cool like
everybody else I don't know it's you

318
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,250
everybody else I don't know it's you
 

319
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,320
everybody else I don't know it's you
know that's probably not a good way to

320
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,330
know that's probably not a good way to
 

321
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,010
know that's probably not a good way to
start it I don't know exactly how to do

322
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,020
start it I don't know exactly how to do
 

323
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,260
start it I don't know exactly how to do
it though but yeah people just like

324
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,270
it though but yeah people just like
 

325
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,930
it though but yeah people just like
mixing slabs and cobblestone stairs and

326
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:52,940
mixing slabs and cobblestone stairs and
 

327
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,790
mixing slabs and cobblestone stairs and
cobblestone and somehow it looks really

328
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
cobblestone and somehow it looks really
 

329
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,790
cobblestone and somehow it looks really
good afterwards so that's what I'm gonna

330
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:57,800
good afterwards so that's what I'm gonna
 

331
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,710
good afterwards so that's what I'm gonna
try we'll see what happens when I work

332
00:07:59,710 --> 00:07:59,720
try we'll see what happens when I work
 

333
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,130
try we'll see what happens when I work
on it here for a little bit I guess

334
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,140
on it here for a little bit I guess
 

335
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,170
on it here for a little bit I guess
aha so check it out everybody I spent

336
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,180
aha so check it out everybody I spent
 

337
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,270
aha so check it out everybody I spent
maybe 10 minutes on this section here I

338
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
maybe 10 minutes on this section here I
 

339
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,860
maybe 10 minutes on this section here I
think it looks okay right yes you love

340
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:11,870
think it looks okay right yes you love
 

341
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,800
think it looks okay right yes you love
it you absolutely love it

342
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,810
it you absolutely love it
 

343
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,240
it you absolutely love it
hopefully I don't know I'm trying to

344
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,250
hopefully I don't know I'm trying to
 

345
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,800
hopefully I don't know I'm trying to
like I'm whenever I build something I

346
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:17,810
like I'm whenever I build something I
 

347
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,810
like I'm whenever I build something I
look at it afterwards and I'm like how

348
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:19,820
look at it afterwards and I'm like how
 

349
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,140
look at it afterwards and I'm like how
can I make this better and nothing's

350
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,150
can I make this better and nothing's
 

351
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,130
can I make this better and nothing's
really coming to my mind unfortunately

352
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,140
really coming to my mind unfortunately
 

353
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,530
really coming to my mind unfortunately
but just doing this I didn't find it too

354
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:29,540
but just doing this I didn't find it too
 

355
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,880
but just doing this I didn't find it too
difficult actually like you can see

356
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:30,890
difficult actually like you can see
 

357
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,630
difficult actually like you can see
throughout we got andesite makes kind of

358
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,640
throughout we got andesite makes kind of
 

359
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,089
throughout we got andesite makes kind of
maybe one quarter of the blocks or

360
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:37,099
maybe one quarter of the blocks or
 

361
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,190
maybe one quarter of the blocks or
andesite and that really does most the

362
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
andesite and that really does most the
 

363
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
andesite and that really does most the
work I find and then

364
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:40,610
work I find and then
 

365
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,240
work I find and then
just stagger the stairs and slaps route

366
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,250
just stagger the stairs and slaps route
 

367
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,940
just stagger the stairs and slaps route
look for any square-ish areas and try to

368
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:45,950
look for any square-ish areas and try to
 

369
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,850
look for any square-ish areas and try to
stagger them like like over there for

370
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:48,860
stagger them like like over there for
 

371
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,380
stagger them like like over there for
example you see oh we got like a square

372
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:50,390
example you see oh we got like a square
 

373
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,920
example you see oh we got like a square
there it would look better definitely

374
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:53,930
there it would look better definitely
 

375
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,540
there it would look better definitely
look better if you just put a slap here

376
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:55,550
look better if you just put a slap here
 

377
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,860
look better if you just put a slap here
because then it staggers it more right

378
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:58,870
because then it staggers it more right
 

379
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,440
because then it staggers it more right
yes and that's kind of what I did

380
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,450
yes and that's kind of what I did
 

381
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,970
yes and that's kind of what I did
throughout here again over there would

382
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:06,980
throughout here again over there would
 

383
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,290
throughout here again over there would
probably look better with a little bit

384
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:08,300
probably look better with a little bit
 

385
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,449
probably look better with a little bit
of a slab there uh-huh but I didn't like

386
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:13,459
of a slab there uh-huh but I didn't like
 

387
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,829
of a slab there uh-huh but I didn't like
go back and forth every time I just kind

388
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:14,839
go back and forth every time I just kind
 

389
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,139
go back and forth every time I just kind
of did it now that I got a I got the

390
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:17,149
of did it now that I got a I got the
 

391
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,310
of did it now that I got a I got the
pattern kind of figured out maybe we'll

392
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
pattern kind of figured out maybe we'll
 

393
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,960
pattern kind of figured out maybe we'll
do a little bit over here together just

394
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:19,970
do a little bit over here together just
 

395
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,810
do a little bit over here together just
to show you what I did so first thing

396
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:21,820
to show you what I did so first thing
 

397
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,220
to show you what I did so first thing
replace all the grass or dirt with the

398
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,230
replace all the grass or dirt with the
 

399
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,940
replace all the grass or dirt with the
stone we'll try to do this quickly so

400
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:27,950
stone we'll try to do this quickly so
 

401
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,680
stone we'll try to do this quickly so
I'm not gonna spend forever on it you

402
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:29,690
I'm not gonna spend forever on it you
 

403
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,199
I'm not gonna spend forever on it you
guys are like etho everybody knows how

404
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:32,209
guys are like etho everybody knows how
 

405
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,670
guys are like etho everybody knows how
to do this these are basic building

406
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
to do this these are basic building
 

407
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,199
to do this these are basic building
skills you should have known this 20

408
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:35,209
skills you should have known this 20
 

409
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,410
skills you should have known this 20
years ago but for my first time doing it

410
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:38,420
years ago but for my first time doing it
 

411
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,800
years ago but for my first time doing it
I'm so excited

412
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:40,810
I'm so excited
 

413
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,860
I'm so excited
uh-huh I will become a good builder one

414
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,870
uh-huh I will become a good builder one
 

415
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,449
uh-huh I will become a good builder one
day guys you will see I just have to

416
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:46,459
day guys you will see I just have to
 

417
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,100
day guys you will see I just have to
keep practicing things like this okay so

418
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,110
keep practicing things like this okay so
 

419
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,720
keep practicing things like this okay so
get the basic thing and then every so

420
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:52,730
get the basic thing and then every so
 

421
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,199
get the basic thing and then every so
often does make sense an andesite you

422
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:56,209
often does make sense an andesite you
 

423
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,449
often does make sense an andesite you
know try to stagger it don't put like

424
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:58,459
know try to stagger it don't put like
 

425
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,560
know try to stagger it don't put like
big lines of it or anything like that

426
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:01,570
big lines of it or anything like that
 

427
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,750
big lines of it or anything like that
every so often you want some mossy

428
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:04,760
every so often you want some mossy
 

429
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,340
every so often you want some mossy
cobble I tried to keep it close to the

430
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,350
cobble I tried to keep it close to the
 

431
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,780
cobble I tried to keep it close to the
water because that makes more sense and

432
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:09,790
water because that makes more sense and
 

433
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,240
water because that makes more sense and
also put in some cobblestone blocks in

434
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,250
also put in some cobblestone blocks in
 

435
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,210
also put in some cobblestone blocks in
places I tried I tried to polish

436
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:16,220
places I tried I tried to polish
 

437
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,060
places I tried I tried to polish
andesite and it really stood out like

438
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,070
andesite and it really stood out like
 

439
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,740
andesite and it really stood out like
maybe I'll put a block down just so we

440
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:20,750
maybe I'll put a block down just so we
 

441
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,259
maybe I'll put a block down just so we
can see it like it really stands out

442
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:23,269
can see it like it really stands out
 

443
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,230
can see it like it really stands out
wherever you put it so I got rid of it

444
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240

 

445
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,759

like when you look at this automatically

446
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:30,769
like when you look at this automatically
 

447
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,370
like when you look at this automatically
your eyes go whoop right over there

448
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:33,380
your eyes go whoop right over there
 

449
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,990
your eyes go whoop right over there
it just stands out too much for some

450
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,000
it just stands out too much for some
 

451
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,069
it just stands out too much for some
reason the borders on it I guess right

452
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
reason the borders on it I guess right
 

453
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,620
reason the borders on it I guess right
all right and then mix in some stairs

454
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,630
all right and then mix in some stairs
 

455
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,889
all right and then mix in some stairs
and stuff in places try to stagger that

456
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:43,899
and stuff in places try to stagger that
 

457
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:50,040
and stuff in places try to stagger that
and yeah not really much to it honestly

458
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,050
and yeah not really much to it honestly
 

459
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,059
and yeah not really much to it honestly
so just a little section like that

460
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:52,069
so just a little section like that
 

461
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,010
so just a little section like that
spinning a couple seconds on that let's

462
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,020
spinning a couple seconds on that let's
 

463
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,280
spinning a couple seconds on that let's
see what

464
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,290
see what
 

465
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,389
see what
looks like right now needs more up over

466
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
looks like right now needs more up over
 

467
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,639
looks like right now needs more up over
there but yeah you get the idea so I'm

468
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:00,649
there but yeah you get the idea so I'm
 

469
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:01,569
there but yeah you get the idea so I'm
going to do a little bit more with that

470
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:01,579
going to do a little bit more with that
 

471
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,829
going to do a little bit more with that
and then we'll probably go do something

472
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:02,839
and then we'll probably go do something
 

473
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,759
and then we'll probably go do something
else and there we go guys so check it

474
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:06,769
else and there we go guys so check it
 

475

think makes it look better it breaks up
 

487
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,680
think makes it look better it breaks up
the solid stone look but I know leaves

the solid stone look but I know leaves
 

489
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,120
the solid stone look but I know leaves

494
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,170
over using them and that kind of stuff I
 

495
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,689
over using them and that kind of stuff I
might have overused them a little bit

496
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:31,699
might have overused them a little bit
 

497
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,860
might have overused them a little bit
here there's quite a few actually but

less than two stacks of redstone left in
 

531
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,689
less than two stacks of redstone left in
the whole world so I'm a little bit

532
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:28,699
the whole world so I'm a little bit
 

533
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,550
the whole world so I'm a little bit

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,120
the which firm today and see if we can
 

537
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,370
the which firm today and see if we can
get that working a little bit

538
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,380
get that working a little bit
 

539
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,460
get that working a little bit
differently right now the way it works

540
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,470
differently right now the way it works
 

541
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,759
differently right now the way it works
is well originally I wanted to use snow

542
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:39,769
is well originally I wanted to use snow
 

543
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,410
is well originally I wanted to use snow
balls to knock the witches off the

544
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:41,420
balls to knock the witches off the
 

545
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,889
balls to knock the witches off the
platform one snowball per witch and I

546
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:44,899
platform one snowball per witch and I
 

547
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,250
platform one snowball per witch and I
found out you can't knock mobs shooting

548
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,260
found out you can't knock mobs shooting
 

549
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,990
found out you can't knock mobs shooting
snow balls out of dispensers so I

550
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
snow balls out of dispensers so I
 

551
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,139
snow balls out of dispensers so I
switched it to arrows and then I found

552
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:53,149
switched it to arrows and then I found
 

553
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,480
switched it to arrows and then I found
out I couldn't get it one one per would

554
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,490
out I couldn't get it one one per would
 

555
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,040
out I couldn't get it one one per would
so it ended up being I think like 27

556
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,050
so it ended up being I think like 27
 

557
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,420
so it ended up being I think like 27
whoa like 27 arrows to knock one witch

558
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,430

off the platform or something crazy like

560
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:06,139
off the platform or something crazy like
 

561
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,569
off the platform or something crazy like
that so that's why it's not a very

562
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:07,579
that so that's why it's not a very
 

563
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,079
that so that's why it's not a very
effective

564
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,089
effective
 

565
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,679
effective
farm and why I don't really use it in

566
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:10,689
farm and why I don't really use it in
 

567
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,689
farm and why I don't really use it in
currently so we got to change it try to

currently so we got to change it try to
 

569
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,040
currently so we got to change it try to
make it a bit more practical and I

570
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,050
make it a bit more practical and I
 

571
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,059
make it a bit more practical and I
thought I'd show you where it is because

572
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:16,069
thought I'd show you where it is because
 

573
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,799
thought I'd show you where it is because
we never go out here case you're curious

the witch farm let's go check it out

592
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,100
the witch farm let's go check it out
 

593
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,259
the witch farm let's go check it out
okay so we can see there's a few witches

in there right now I did end up lighting

596
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:16,579
in there right now I did end up lighting
 

597
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,369
in there right now I did end up lighting
up most of the caves in the area so the

598
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:18,379
up most of the caves in the area so the
 

599
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,530
up most of the caves in the area so the
spawn rate should be pretty decent with

600
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:20,540
spawn rate should be pretty decent with
 

601
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,639
spawn rate should be pretty decent with
this thing and we got most area flooded

602
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:23,649
this thing and we got most area flooded
 

603
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,989
this thing and we got most area flooded
or all area I can't remember if it

604
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:25,999
or all area I can't remember if it
 

605
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,689
or all area I can't remember if it
finished no I think I still gotta cut

606
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:28,699
finished no I think I still gotta cut
 

607
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,879
finished no I think I still gotta cut
off some over there to some of that land

608
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:30,889
off some over there to some of that land
 

609
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,999
off some over there to some of that land
needs to either get lit up or or blown

610
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:34,009
needs to either get lit up or or blown
 

611
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:38,319
needs to either get lit up or or blown
up but yeah you can see we got seven

612
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:38,329
up but yeah you can see we got seven
 

613
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,819
up but yeah you can see we got seven
dispensers in the back there those are

614
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:39,829
dispensers in the back there those are
 

615
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,639
dispensers in the back there those are
what we're shooting the arrows and

616
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:41,649
what we're shooting the arrows and
 

617
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,929
what we're shooting the arrows and
that's flashing right now because the

618
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:43,939
that's flashing right now because the
 

619
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,780
that's flashing right now because the
tripwires are activated so when there's

620
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:46,790
tripwires are activated so when there's
 

621
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,299
tripwires are activated so when there's
a witch in that area that shoots arrows

622
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:49,309
a witch in that area that shoots arrows
 

623
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,379
a witch in that area that shoots arrows
until the witch falls down here alright

624
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:53,389
until the witch falls down here alright
 

625
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,840
until the witch falls down here alright
so I'm thinking oh there's a chest down

626
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:55,850
so I'm thinking oh there's a chest down
 

627
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,530
so I'm thinking oh there's a chest down
here with goodies inside

628
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:58,540
here with goodies inside
 

629
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,030
here with goodies inside
yeah rigidly I wanted to use spectral

630
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
yeah rigidly I wanted to use spectral
 

631
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,389
yeah rigidly I wanted to use spectral
arrows as well but can't keep up with

632
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
arrows as well but can't keep up with
 

633
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,460
arrows as well but can't keep up with
the glowstone demand cuz I looked really

634
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,470
the glowstone demand cuz I looked really
 

635
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,470
the glowstone demand cuz I looked really
cool when the witches got highlighted as

636
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
cool when the witches got highlighted as
 

637
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,610
cool when the witches got highlighted as
they fell to their death I think what

638
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:12,620
they fell to their death I think what
 

639
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,739
they fell to their death I think what
we're gonna have to do is replace it

640
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:14,749
we're gonna have to do is replace it
 

641
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:17,949
we're gonna have to do is replace it
with a water flushing system so let's

642
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:17,959
with a water flushing system so let's
 

643
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,660
with a water flushing system so let's
count how long this is

644
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:19,670
count how long this is
 

645
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,730
count how long this is
and see if we can use water so up to

646
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:23,740
and see if we can use water so up to
 

647
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,710
and see if we can use water so up to
let's see here so this this is the end

648
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
let's see here so this this is the end
 

649
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,110
let's see here so this this is the end
of the platform three five seven and I'm

650
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,120
of the platform three five seven and I'm
 

651
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,220
of the platform three five seven and I'm
gonna add tribe yeah that pure so water

652
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,230
gonna add tribe yeah that pure so water
 

653
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,960
gonna add tribe yeah that pure so water
travels eight blocks right so this is

654
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:37,970
travels eight blocks right so this is
 

655
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,230
travels eight blocks right so this is
the furthest distance oh I broke a thing

656
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,240
the furthest distance oh I broke a thing
 

657
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,490
the furthest distance oh I broke a thing
here looks like it's nine blocks long

658
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:44,500
here looks like it's nine blocks long
 

659
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,850
here looks like it's nine blocks long
just one too far I think I got a plan

660
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:48,860
just one too far I think I got a plan
 

661
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,700
just one too far I think I got a plan
here let's go inside I'll just show you

662
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:51,710
here let's go inside I'll just show you
 

663
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:59,050
here let's go inside I'll just show you
what we're gonna do hello okay so my

664
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,060
what we're gonna do hello okay so my
 

665
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,550
what we're gonna do hello okay so my
plan is we're gonna rip out all the

666
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
plan is we're gonna rip out all the
 

667
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,310
plan is we're gonna rip out all the
wires all the all the string here all

668
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:03,320
wires all the all the string here all
 

669
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,500
wires all the all the string here all
the trip wires are gonna go we're not

670
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:08,510
the trip wires are gonna go we're not
 

671
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,180
the trip wires are gonna go we're not
gonna tech detect one of which spawns

672
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,190
gonna tech detect one of which spawns
 

673
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,620
gonna tech detect one of which spawns
here instead we're gonna keep it running

674
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:11,630
here instead we're gonna keep it running
 

675
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,920
here instead we're gonna keep it running
on a clock constantly so it's just it's

676
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:14,930
on a clock constantly so it's just it's
 

677
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,830
on a clock constantly so it's just it's
gonna always run whether there's a witch

678
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:17,840
gonna always run whether there's a witch
 

679
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,290
gonna always run whether there's a witch
here or not and my plan is since we need

680
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,300
here or not and my plan is since we need
 

681
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,490
here or not and my plan is since we need
the water to travel nine blocks which it

682
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:24,500
the water to travel nine blocks which it
 

683
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,760
the water to travel nine blocks which it
can't right that's one short of the edge

684
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:27,770
can't right that's one short of the edge
 

685
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,550
can't right that's one short of the edge
there if we just raise it up the

686
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
there if we just raise it up the
 

687
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,890
there if we just raise it up the
dispensers one block higher I'll spread

688
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:32,900
dispensers one block higher I'll spread
 

689
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,650
dispensers one block higher I'll spread
an extra block so all these dispensers

690
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:35,660
an extra block so all these dispensers
 

691
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,460
an extra block so all these dispensers
we're gonna raise up by one and instead

692
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:39,470
we're gonna raise up by one and instead
 

693
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,260
we're gonna raise up by one and instead
of dispensing arrows are gonna dispense

694
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,270
of dispensing arrows are gonna dispense
 

695
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,040
of dispensing arrows are gonna dispense
water buckets pretty simple really

696
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,050
water buckets pretty simple really
 

697
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,920
water buckets pretty simple really
yeah so they're gonna go up here with

698
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:47,930
yeah so they're gonna go up here with
 

699
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,520
yeah so they're gonna go up here with
water but it's inside we're gonna rip

700
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:51,530
water but it's inside we're gonna rip
 

701
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,300
water but it's inside we're gonna rip
out all those hoppers and it worked

702
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,310
out all those hoppers and it worked
 

703
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:16,910
out all those hoppers and it worked
pretty good

704
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:16,920

 

705
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,060

wait a second here one second one second

706
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,070
wait a second here one second one second
 

707
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,970
wait a second here one second one second
did I just do something cool so I had a

708
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:23,980
did I just do something cool so I had a
 

709
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,300
did I just do something cool so I had a
ladder here and I removed it and you can

710
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,310
ladder here and I removed it and you can
 

711
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,610
ladder here and I removed it and you can
see there's still a floating ladder bit

712
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:29,620
see there's still a floating ladder bit
 

713
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,560
see there's still a floating ladder bit
here in vanilla minecraft I had no idea

714
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,570
here in vanilla minecraft I had no idea
 

715
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,450
here in vanilla minecraft I had no idea
you could do this or wait oh why is it

716
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:39,460
you could do this or wait oh why is it
 

717
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,650
you could do this or wait oh why is it
doing that okay is there actually a

718
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:40,660
doing that okay is there actually a
 

719
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,080
doing that okay is there actually a
block there I don't remember putting one

720
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,090
block there I don't remember putting one
 

721
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,320
block there I don't remember putting one
there okay it's not that impressive now

722
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,330
there okay it's not that impressive now
 

723
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,690
there okay it's not that impressive now
I think this is about ready to go guys

724
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:51,700
I think this is about ready to go guys
 

725
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,450
I think this is about ready to go guys
so it's really really simple compared to

726
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:54,460
so it's really really simple compared to
 

727
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,780
so it's really really simple compared to
what we had so that's the bottom of the

728
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:57,790
what we had so that's the bottom of the
 

729
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,010
what we had so that's the bottom of the
staircase there you can see the wire

730
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,020
staircase there you can see the wire
 

731
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,860
staircase there you can see the wire
comes up oh actually one second you see

732
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:04,870
comes up oh actually one second you see
 

733
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,380
comes up oh actually one second you see
the wire comes up one two three four

734
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,390
the wire comes up one two three four
 

735
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,760
the wire comes up one two three four
five six seven and then runs up to eight

736
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:11,770
five six seven and then runs up to eight
 

737
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,710
five six seven and then runs up to eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen

738
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:13,720
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
 

739
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,010
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
so we don't need any more repeaters from

740
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,020
so we don't need any more repeaters from
 

741
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,600
so we don't need any more repeaters from
that bottom there runs to all three

742
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:18,610
that bottom there runs to all three
 

743
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,170
that bottom there runs to all three
layers here and behind each of these ice

744
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,180
layers here and behind each of these ice
 

745
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,090
layers here and behind each of these ice
things here is the dispensers with the

746
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,100
things here is the dispensers with the
 

747
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,400
things here is the dispensers with the
water buckets in so pretty simple and

748
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,410
water buckets in so pretty simple and
 

749
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,900
water buckets in so pretty simple and
then all that we're gonna do is set up a

750
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:27,910
then all that we're gonna do is set up a
 

751
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,220
then all that we're gonna do is set up a
hopper clock to eject the water and then

752
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,230
hopper clock to eject the water and then
 

753
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,640
hopper clock to eject the water and then
retract it over and over again so it's

754
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:35,650
retract it over and over again so it's
 

755
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,340
retract it over and over again so it's
gonna be laggy because water updates are

756
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,350
gonna be laggy because water updates are
 

757
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,970
gonna be laggy because water updates are
pretty laggy but this is the only thing

758
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:41,980
pretty laggy but this is the only thing
 

759
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,620
pretty laggy but this is the only thing
in this area so I don't care how late it

760
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:43,630
in this area so I don't care how late it
 

761
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,130
in this area so I don't care how late it
gets really as long as it works

762
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,140
gets really as long as it works
 

763
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,040
gets really as long as it works
so just a standard hopper clock nothing

764
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,050
so just a standard hopper clock nothing
 

765
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,850
so just a standard hopper clock nothing
fancy comparator comparator get our

766
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:53,860
fancy comparator comparator get our
 

767
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,800
fancy comparator comparator get our
hoppers and I don't know what kind of

768
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:55,810
hoppers and I don't know what kind of
 

769
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,150
hoppers and I don't know what kind of
timing we're gonna want on this we'll

770
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,160
timing we're gonna want on this we'll
 

771
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,510
timing we're gonna want on this we'll
have to experiment a bit with it okay

772
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:00,520
have to experiment a bit with it okay
 

773
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,900
have to experiment a bit with it okay
get our redstone and then this will

774
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:03,910
get our redstone and then this will
 

775
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,270
get our redstone and then this will
connect to over here so you hear that

776
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
connect to over here so you hear that
 

777
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
connect to over here so you hear that
the ejected the water so as it goes back

778
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,530
the ejected the water so as it goes back
 

779
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,950
the ejected the water so as it goes back
and forth it'll eject and retract

780
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:13,960
and forth it'll eject and retract
 

781
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,080
and forth it'll eject and retract
constantly let's just try it with maybe

782
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,090
constantly let's just try it with maybe
 

783
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,119
constantly let's just try it with maybe
ten blocks

784
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:21,129

 

785
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:25,149

okay cuz we got to give it time for the

786
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:25,159
okay cuz we got to give it time for the
 

787
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,940
okay cuz we got to give it time for the
the witches to flow off the end - we

788
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:27,950
the witches to flow off the end - we
 

789
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,789
the witches to flow off the end - we
don't want it to be instant all right so

790

00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:57,710
okay is this all working are they all
 

809
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,539
okay is this all working are they all
objecting yeah all at the same time and

810
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:01,549
objecting yeah all at the same time and
 

811
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,940
objecting yeah all at the same time and
retracting all at the same time it kind

812
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:03,950
retracting all at the same time it kind
 

813
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,499
retracting all at the same time it kind
of looked like they weren't you see that

814
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:08,509
of looked like they weren't you see that
 

815
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,180
of looked like they weren't you see that
like it kind of lopsided to that side

816
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,190
like it kind of lopsided to that side
 

817
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,659
like it kind of lopsided to that side
I'll play that's not an issue

818
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:15,669
I'll play that's not an issue
 

819
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:18,359
I'll play that's not an issue
everything's good on the other layers

820
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:18,369
everything's good on the other layers
 

821
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:22,919
everything's good on the other layers
looks okay so watch him retract once

822
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:22,929
looks okay so watch him retract once
 

823
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,269
looks okay so watch him retract once
yeah they're lopsided - why are they

824
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:25,279
yeah they're lopsided - why are they
 

825
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,039
yeah they're lopsided - why are they
lopsided because they're all activated

826
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,049
lopsided because they're all activated
 

827
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:32,519
lopsided because they're all activated
at the same time as far as I can tell I

828
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:32,529

 

829
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:36,209

guess oh that wasn't there before

830
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:36,219
guess oh that wasn't there before
 

831
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:43,269
guess oh that wasn't there before
okay so maybe we can get rid of one or

832
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:43,279
okay so maybe we can get rid of one or
 

833
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,440
okay so maybe we can get rid of one or
two items like it feels like it's a

834
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,450
two items like it feels like it's a
 

835
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,389
two items like it feels like it's a
little bit long well know better once we

836
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:46,399
little bit long well know better once we
 

837
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,579
little bit long well know better once we
get some witches in there but I'm just

838
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:48,589
get some witches in there but I'm just
 

839
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:49,930
get some witches in there but I'm just
gonna cover over this so we don't get

840
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:49,940
gonna cover over this so we don't get
 

841
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,209
gonna cover over this so we don't get
mob spawning and I think it's it's good

842
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:52,219
mob spawning and I think it's it's good
 

843
00:20:52,219 --> 00:21:00,219
mob spawning and I think it's it's good
to go um okay so we have a little bit of

844
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:00,229
to go um okay so we have a little bit of
 

845
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:02,589
to go um okay so we have a little bit of
a problem here we're not getting any mob

846
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:02,599
a problem here we're not getting any mob
 

847
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,940
a problem here we're not getting any mob
spotting or nuts

848
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:05,950
spotting or nuts
 

849
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,829
spotting or nuts
not very many anyways I saw one pack

850
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:08,839
not very many anyways I saw one pack
 

851
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,229
not very many anyways I saw one pack
spawn of four which is in like two

852
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:14,239
spawn of four which is in like two
 

853
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,509
spawn of four which is in like two
minutes here so I guess there's probably

854
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:16,519
minutes here so I guess there's probably
 

855
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,519
minutes here so I guess there's probably
still a lot of caves I gotta be lit up I

856
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:18,529
still a lot of caves I gotta be lit up I
 

857
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:24,190
still a lot of caves I gotta be lit up I
thought I got most of them but

858
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,200

 

859
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,880

no-nothing spawning its darked in there

860
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:27,890
no-nothing spawning its darked in there
 

861
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,640
no-nothing spawning its darked in there
it's definitely a which area and when we

862
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:31,650
it's definitely a which area and when we
 

863
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,080
it's definitely a which area and when we
arrived here there was a bunch of

864
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,090
arrived here there was a bunch of
 

865
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,550
arrived here there was a bunch of
witches in so I don't know why it's

866
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:34,560
witches in so I don't know why it's
 

867
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,100
witches in so I don't know why it's
having trouble now although they were

868
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,110
having trouble now although they were
 

869
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,840
having trouble now although they were
probably there when we left originally

870
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,850
probably there when we left originally
 

871
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,340
probably there when we left originally
yeah so our rates are garbage right now

872
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,350
yeah so our rates are garbage right now
 

873
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,960
yeah so our rates are garbage right now
that's gonna be the next mission is just

874
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:44,970
that's gonna be the next mission is just
 

875
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,440
that's gonna be the next mission is just
lighting up caves and stuff but I think

876
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,450
lighting up caves and stuff but I think
 

877
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,680
lighting up caves and stuff but I think
this is good the way it is all right it

878
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,690
this is good the way it is all right it
 

879
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,270
this is good the way it is all right it
looks like we actually worked on

880
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
looks like we actually worked on
 

881
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,970
looks like we actually worked on
blasting this mountain previously it's

882
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:55,980
blasting this mountain previously it's
 

883
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,250
blasting this mountain previously it's
not done though obviously so that's one

884
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,260
not done though obviously so that's one
 

885
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,050
not done though obviously so that's one
of the markers that red posts there and

886
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,060
of the markers that red posts there and
 

887
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,480
of the markers that red posts there and
there's like another one off that way we

888
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,490
there's like another one off that way we
 

889
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,300
there's like another one off that way we
got to get rid of all this land here

890
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,310
got to get rid of all this land here
 

891
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,830
got to get rid of all this land here
when I got up here you see all the dark

892
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:06,840
when I got up here you see all the dark
 

893
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:21,910
when I got up here you see all the dark
spots there was no mobs which okay I

894
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:21,920
spots there was no mobs which okay I
 

895
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,170
spots there was no mobs which okay I
really find that too - well yeah so if

896
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,180
really find that too - well yeah so if
 

897
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,220
really find that too - well yeah so if
there's no mobs up there it means

898
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,230
there's no mobs up there it means
 

899
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,320
there's no mobs up there it means
there's a lot of dark spots for them to

900
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,330
there's a lot of dark spots for them to
 

901
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,780
there's a lot of dark spots for them to
be hiding cuz this should be full of

902
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:32,790
be hiding cuz this should be full of
 

903
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,270
be hiding cuz this should be full of
them if it's the last dark spots near

it's not too bad
 

911
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,650
it's not too bad
I'm sure there's a few caves we've

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm sure there's a few caves we've
 

913
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm sure there's a few caves we've
missed though gonna need a lot more TNT

914
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,510
missed though gonna need a lot more TNT
 

915
