00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
series so guys last episode we started
 

13
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,070
series so guys last episode we started
building this super small tree this is a

14
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
building this super small tree this is a
 

15
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,830
building this super small tree this is a
colossal

16
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
colossal
 

17
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,509
colossal
64 furnace array and our goal

18
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
64 furnace array and our goal
 

19
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,830
64 furnace array and our goal
is to make it as quick as possible or or

20
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
is to make it as quick as possible or or
 

21
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,109
is to make it as quick as possible or or
at least within

22
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
at least within
 

23
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,069
at least within
practicality right and so far i think

24
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
practicality right and so far i think
 

25
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,270
practicality right and so far i think
it's off to a good start we're going to

26
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
it's off to a good start we're going to
 

27
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,590
it's off to a good start we're going to
try to get this up and running today

28
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
try to get this up and running today
 

29
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,430
try to get this up and running today
the key to the whole system to make it

30
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
the key to the whole system to make it
 

31
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,030
the key to the whole system to make it
quick though is we have a splitter

32
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
quick though is we have a splitter
 

33
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,950
quick though is we have a splitter
system in the middle here so let's check

34
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
system in the middle here so let's check
 

35
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,910
system in the middle here so let's check
this out

36
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
this out
 

37
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,029
this out
again uh basically we throw our our

38
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
again uh basically we throw our our
 

39
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,750
again uh basically we throw our our
items in here to be smelted

40
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
items in here to be smelted
 

41
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,270
items in here to be smelted
you see how quick they empty out and

42
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
you see how quick they empty out and
 

43
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,630
you see how quick they empty out and
then they go into eight different

44
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
then they go into eight different
 

45
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,229
then they go into eight different
hoppers here

46
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
hoppers here
 

47
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,069
hoppers here
uh like a stack will go eight items into

48
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
uh like a stack will go eight items into
 

49
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,830
uh like a stack will go eight items into
each of these hoppers so eight hoppers

50
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
each of these hoppers so eight hoppers
 

51
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,110
each of these hoppers so eight hoppers
total

52
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
total
 

53
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,270
total
and then there's gonna be eight hopper

54
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
and then there's gonna be eight hopper
 

55
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,950
and then there's gonna be eight hopper
mine carts that pick up the items out of

56
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
mine carts that pick up the items out of
 

57
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,789
mine carts that pick up the items out of
these hoppers

58
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
these hoppers
 

59
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,230
these hoppers
and then they're gonna run across the

60
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
and then they're gonna run across the
 

61
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,149
and then they're gonna run across the
top of these furnaces here and drop off

62
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
top of these furnaces here and drop off
 

63
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,390
top of these furnaces here and drop off
one item to each of these as it goes by

64
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
one item to each of these as it goes by
 

65
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,109
one item to each of these as it goes by
that's kind of the plan to this thing so

66
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
that's kind of the plan to this thing so
 

67
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,030
that's kind of the plan to this thing so
i've made a couple design changes since

68
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
i've made a couple design changes since
 

69
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,270
i've made a couple design changes since
last episode for one thing i've raised

70
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
last episode for one thing i've raised
 

71
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,510
last episode for one thing i've raised
up the splitter system by a block

72
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
up the splitter system by a block
 

73
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,270
up the splitter system by a block
and that allows us to sneak in some

74
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
and that allows us to sneak in some
 

75
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,030
and that allows us to sneak in some
redstone here

76
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
redstone here
 

77
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,950
redstone here
right underneath these hoppers so we can

78
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
right underneath these hoppers so we can
 

79
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,390
right underneath these hoppers so we can
easily control these

80
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
easily control these
 

81
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,350
easily control these
these power rails now on on both sides

82
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
these power rails now on on both sides
 

83
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,830
these power rails now on on both sides
uh

84
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
uh
 

85
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,710
uh
just by sending a pulse to this thing

86
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
just by sending a pulse to this thing
 

87
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,350
just by sending a pulse to this thing
it'll make the

88
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
it'll make the
 

89
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,350
it'll make the
hopper mine carts move we got to power

90
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
hopper mine carts move we got to power
 

91
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,390
hopper mine carts move we got to power
all this stuff here

92
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
all this stuff here
 

93
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,350
all this stuff here
though which it's not doing right now

94
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
though which it's not doing right now
 

95
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,469
though which it's not doing right now
and

96
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
and
 

97
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,469
and
i also made one other big change down

98
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
i also made one other big change down
 

99
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,630
i also made one other big change down
here we had a hopper minecart running

100
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
here we had a hopper minecart running
 

101
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,710
here we had a hopper minecart running
underneath the furnaces before and now

102
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
underneath the furnaces before and now
 

103
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,710
underneath the furnaces before and now
i've decided to change that out to a

104
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
i've decided to change that out to a
 

105
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,510
i've decided to change that out to a
hopper chain

106
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
hopper chain
 

107
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,990
hopper chain
instead so that'll pull the items out of

108
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
instead so that'll pull the items out of
 

109
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,670
instead so that'll pull the items out of
the furnace and

110
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
the furnace and
 

111
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,510
the furnace and
send them over to our dropper elevator

112
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
send them over to our dropper elevator
 

113
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,350
send them over to our dropper elevator
in the middle here

114
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
in the middle here
 

115
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,789
in the middle here
i think it's going to be about the same

116
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
i think it's going to be about the same
 

117
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,950
i think it's going to be about the same
speed using a hopper chain but the nice

118
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
speed using a hopper chain but the nice
 

119
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,749
speed using a hopper chain but the nice
thing is

120
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
thing is
 

121
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,990
thing is
we don't have to control the minecarts

122
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
we don't have to control the minecarts
 

123
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,749
we don't have to control the minecarts
this way it's going to be all automatic

124
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
this way it's going to be all automatic
 

125
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,029
this way it's going to be all automatic
so one less thing for us to worry about

126
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
so one less thing for us to worry about
 

127
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,830
so one less thing for us to worry about
i did realize though there's a problem

128
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
i did realize though there's a problem
 

129
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,510
i did realize though there's a problem
with this whole thing let's say for

130
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
with this whole thing let's say for
 

131
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,270
with this whole thing let's say for
example

132
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
example
 

133
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,910
example
some fool let's say i'm i'm being an

134
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
some fool let's say i'm i'm being an
 

135
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,710
some fool let's say i'm i'm being an
idiot

136
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
idiot
 

137
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,550
idiot
and i drop off a bunch of dirt

138
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
and i drop off a bunch of dirt
 

139
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,229
and i drop off a bunch of dirt
uh should that not go in wait a second

140
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
uh should that not go in wait a second
 

141
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,949
uh should that not go in wait a second
where where does the dirt go oh maybe

142
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
where where does the dirt go oh maybe
 

143
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,030
where where does the dirt go oh maybe
that furnace was full already

144
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
that furnace was full already
 

145
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,949
that furnace was full already
aha so i already got some garbage in my

146
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
aha so i already got some garbage in my
 

147
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,110
aha so i already got some garbage in my
furnaces here if you get garbage items

148
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
furnaces here if you get garbage items
 

149
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,350
furnaces here if you get garbage items
in your furnace array i've i've realized

150
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
in your furnace array i've i've realized
 

151
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,470
in your furnace array i've i've realized
there's no way to get it out like it'll

152
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
there's no way to get it out like it'll
 

153
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,990
there's no way to get it out like it'll
go into the top here you can't pull that

154
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
go into the top here you can't pull that
 

155
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,190
go into the top here you can't pull that
out with a hopper

156
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
out with a hopper
 

157
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,790
out with a hopper
or a hopper mine cart right

158
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
or a hopper mine cart right
 

159
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,949
or a hopper mine cart right
so you have to like come underneath here

160
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
so you have to like come underneath here
 

161
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,990
so you have to like come underneath here
break all these hoppers

162
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
break all these hoppers
 

163
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,229
break all these hoppers
because all the sides are blocked now

164
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
because all the sides are blocked now
 

165
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,229
because all the sides are blocked now
and take it out manually which kind of

166
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
and take it out manually which kind of
 

167
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,229
and take it out manually which kind of
sucks but

168
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
sucks but
 

169
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,990
sucks but
yeah it's that's kind of the issue with

170
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
yeah it's that's kind of the issue with
 

171
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,509
yeah it's that's kind of the issue with
the furnace arrays i guess

172
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
the furnace arrays i guess
 

173
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,949
the furnace arrays i guess
like any array you do that's going to

174
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
like any array you do that's going to
 

175
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,630
like any array you do that's going to
have that problem

176
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
have that problem
 

177
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,309
have that problem
so make sure if you're playing on a

178
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
so make sure if you're playing on a
 

179
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,750
so make sure if you're playing on a
server you're not playing with stupid

180
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
server you're not playing with stupid
 

181
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,390
server you're not playing with stupid
people

182
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
people
 

183
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,390
people
or don't let them use your smeltery

184
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
or don't let them use your smeltery
 

185
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,229
or don't let them use your smeltery
because they'll jam it all up

186
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
because they'll jam it all up
 

187
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,630
because they'll jam it all up
but anyways let's get to this here we

188
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
but anyways let's get to this here we
 

189
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,790
but anyways let's get to this here we
got a couple problems to solve with our

190
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
got a couple problems to solve with our
 

191
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,990
got a couple problems to solve with our
smeltery thing here

192
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
smeltery thing here
 

193
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,030
smeltery thing here
first off how and when

194
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
first off how and when
 

195
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,350
first off how and when
do we tell this minecart to start moving

196
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
do we tell this minecart to start moving
 

197
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,030
do we tell this minecart to start moving
like under what conditions do we want it

198
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
like under what conditions do we want it
 

199
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,789
like under what conditions do we want it
to leave like that

200
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
to leave like that
 

201
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,070
to leave like that
i think once it gets eight items that's

202
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
i think once it gets eight items that's
 

203
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,070
i think once it gets eight items that's
the perfect time for it to start moving

204
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
the perfect time for it to start moving
 

205
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,070
the perfect time for it to start moving
because it'll drop off one item to each

206
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
because it'll drop off one item to each
 

207
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,350
because it'll drop off one item to each
of the furnaces

208
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
of the furnaces
 

209
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,910
of the furnaces
if it only picked up seven the last

210
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
if it only picked up seven the last
 

211
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,350
if it only picked up seven the last
furnace wouldn't get one right

212
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
furnace wouldn't get one right
 

213
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,509
furnace wouldn't get one right
and then they would have to go back pick

214
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
and then they would have to go back pick
 

215
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,190
and then they would have to go back pick
up one more item and then drop it off to

216
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
up one more item and then drop it off to
 

217
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,270
up one more item and then drop it off to
get this thing

218
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
get this thing
 

219
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,350
get this thing
running at maximum efficiency we want to

220
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
running at maximum efficiency we want to
 

221
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,190
running at maximum efficiency we want to
make use of all the furnaces right

222
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
make use of all the furnaces right
 

223
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,190
make use of all the furnaces right
if it picks up nine items it's going to

224
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
if it picks up nine items it's going to
 

225
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,589
if it picks up nine items it's going to
drop off two

226
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
drop off two
 

227
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,350
drop off two
and another one which isn't a problem

228
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
and another one which isn't a problem
 

229
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,630
and another one which isn't a problem
but it's going to take longer for the

230
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
but it's going to take longer for the
 

231
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,149
but it's going to take longer for the
minecart to fill up here

232
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
minecart to fill up here
 

233
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,309
minecart to fill up here
and then we're wasting time as well so

234
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
and then we're wasting time as well so
 

235
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,789
and then we're wasting time as well so
eight items is the perfect amount

236
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
eight items is the perfect amount
 

237
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,910
eight items is the perfect amount
the problem is we can't detect when this

238
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
the problem is we can't detect when this
 

239
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,949
the problem is we can't detect when this
thing has eight

240
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
thing has eight
 

241
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,550
thing has eight
eight items in it and also when we

242
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
eight items in it and also when we
 

243
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,309
eight items in it and also when we
drop off our items to be smelted it

244
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
drop off our items to be smelted it
 

245
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,470
drop off our items to be smelted it
might not even get eight items

246
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
might not even get eight items
 

247
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,390
might not even get eight items
is the other issue so for example let's

248
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
is the other issue so for example let's
 

249
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,629
is the other issue so for example let's
say i want to smelt something i only

250
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
say i want to smelt something i only
 

251
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,550
say i want to smelt something i only
dropped 34

252
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
dropped 34
 

253
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,710
dropped 34
off into here it's not going to get

254
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
off into here it's not going to get
 

255
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,990
off into here it's not going to get
eight it only got five

256
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
eight it only got five
 

257
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,469
eight it only got five
right so if we're detecting eight this

258
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
right so if we're detecting eight this
 

259
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,749
right so if we're detecting eight this
thing is never going to

260
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
thing is never going to
 

261
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,070
thing is never going to
leave and i'm never gonna get my items

262
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
leave and i'm never gonna get my items
 

263
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,790
leave and i'm never gonna get my items
so i think what we want to do

264
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
so i think what we want to do
 

265
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,670
so i think what we want to do
is detect when it starts receiving items

266
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
is detect when it starts receiving items
 

267
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,590
is detect when it starts receiving items
so we'll probably put a comparator here

268
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
so we'll probably put a comparator here
 

269
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,909
so we'll probably put a comparator here
and hopefully that turns on

270
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
and hopefully that turns on
 

271
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,230
and hopefully that turns on
if we put something in this chest yeah

272
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
if we put something in this chest yeah
 

273
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,749
if we put something in this chest yeah
it does okay good

274
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
it does okay good
 

275
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,070
it does okay good
so i think all we gotta do is set up a

276
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
so i think all we gotta do is set up a
 

277
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,670
so i think all we gotta do is set up a
bunch of repeaters here i'm gonna try

278
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
bunch of repeaters here i'm gonna try
 

279
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,390
bunch of repeaters here i'm gonna try
eight

280
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
eight
 

281
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,189
eight
eight repeaters set at four and it's

282
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
eight repeaters set at four and it's
 

283
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,510
eight repeaters set at four and it's
gonna wait enough time for the hopper to

284
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
gonna wait enough time for the hopper to
 

285
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,430
gonna wait enough time for the hopper to
get eight items in it hopefully that's

286
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
get eight items in it hopefully that's
 

287
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,030
get eight items in it hopefully that's
our goal with this

288
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
our goal with this
 

289
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,670
our goal with this
so let's throw in a bunch of stuff here

290
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
so let's throw in a bunch of stuff here
 

291
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,310
so let's throw in a bunch of stuff here
and we'll

292
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
and we'll
 

293
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,029
and we'll
check out the mine cart real quick here

294
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
check out the mine cart real quick here
 

295
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:01,430
check out the mine cart real quick here
okay

296
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
okay
 

297
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,590
okay
look at the mine cart real quick four

298
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
look at the mine cart real quick four
 

299
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,270
look at the mine cart real quick four
five six seven

300
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
five six seven
 

301
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,029
five six seven
yeah i think it started moving on eight

302
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
yeah i think it started moving on eight
 

303
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,749
yeah i think it started moving on eight
right that's good

304
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
right that's good
 

305
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,990
right that's good
yeah so i really like this it's uh very

306
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
yeah so i really like this it's uh very
 

307
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,830
yeah so i really like this it's uh very
simple to do right but also

308
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
simple to do right but also
 

309
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,670
simple to do right but also
it it deals with the problem of not

310
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
it it deals with the problem of not
 

311
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,430
it it deals with the problem of not
waiting for eight items like if there is

312
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
waiting for eight items like if there is
 

313
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,310
waiting for eight items like if there is
an eight

314
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
an eight
 

315
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,830
an eight
so if we only put 32 in it'll wait for

316
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
so if we only put 32 in it'll wait for
 

317
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,350
so if we only put 32 in it'll wait for
the eight items but if it doesn't get

318
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
the eight items but if it doesn't get
 

319
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,110
the eight items but if it doesn't get
them it still goes anyway

320
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
them it still goes anyway
 

321
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,950
them it still goes anyway
right because it's based on timing not

322
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
right because it's based on timing not
 

323
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,029
right because it's based on timing not
on actual numbers

324
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
on actual numbers
 

325
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,830
on actual numbers
so that's cool the only problem with

326
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
so that's cool the only problem with
 

327
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,230
so that's cool the only problem with
this

328
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
this
 

329
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,749
this
maybe is i can't jump

330
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
maybe is i can't jump
 

331
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,950
maybe is i can't jump
i can't parkour what happens if we put

332
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
i can't parkour what happens if we put
 

333
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,950
i can't parkour what happens if we put
in a whole bunch of items let's test

334
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
in a whole bunch of items let's test
 

335
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,550
in a whole bunch of items let's test
that as well

336
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
that as well
 

337
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,830
that as well
i'm worried it's not gonna

338
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
i'm worried it's not gonna
 

339
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,629
i'm worried it's not gonna
deal with this too well so if it has a

340
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
deal with this too well so if it has a
 

341
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,350
deal with this too well so if it has a
lot of items it'll wait for eight

342
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
lot of items it'll wait for eight
 

343
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,029
lot of items it'll wait for eight
and now it keeps bouncing is the other

344
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
and now it keeps bouncing is the other
 

345
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,749
and now it keeps bouncing is the other
problem so it's only picking up

346
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
problem so it's only picking up
 

347
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,629
problem so it's only picking up
i picked up five i think six

348
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639

 

349
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,629

five or six right so only the first five

350
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
five or six right so only the first five
 

351
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,230
five or six right so only the first five
furnaces are getting items

352
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
furnaces are getting items
 

353
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,469
furnaces are getting items
because of that these ones have none

354
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
because of that these ones have none
 

355
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,029
because of that these ones have none
that's not good we want them all to get

356
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
that's not good we want them all to get
 

357
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,189
that's not good we want them all to get
items

358
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
items
 

359
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,790
items
okay all right guys so

360
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
okay all right guys so
 

361
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,309
okay all right guys so
this is actually a pretty challenging

362
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
this is actually a pretty challenging
 

363
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,150
this is actually a pretty challenging
build once you get down to the details i

364
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
build once you get down to the details i
 

365
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,909
build once you get down to the details i
thought this was going to be easy

366
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
thought this was going to be easy
 

367
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,430
thought this was going to be easy
so i started making a list of what we

368
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
so i started making a list of what we
 

369
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,550
so i started making a list of what we
want to do and uh number one on startup

370
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
want to do and uh number one on startup
 

371
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,390
want to do and uh number one on startup
leave at exactly eight items or

372
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
leave at exactly eight items or
 

373
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,990
leave at exactly eight items or
out of items to smelt so that's what we

374
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
out of items to smelt so that's what we
 

375
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,710
out of items to smelt so that's what we
did here already right

376
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
did here already right
 

377
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,629
did here already right
uh we don't want it to leave at seven

378
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
uh we don't want it to leave at seven
 

379
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,629
uh we don't want it to leave at seven
items we don't want it to leave it nine

380
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
items we don't want it to leave it nine
 

381
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,950
items we don't want it to leave it nine
it would be fine if it left at 16 items

382
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
it would be fine if it left at 16 items
 

383
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,830
it would be fine if it left at 16 items
though

384
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
though
 

385
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,590
though
because it would drop off one on the way

386
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
because it would drop off one on the way
 

387
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,430
because it would drop off one on the way
and one on the way back the key is that

388
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
and one on the way back the key is that
 

389
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,189
and one on the way back the key is that
we evenly distribute

390
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
we evenly distribute
 

391
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,510
we evenly distribute
items to the furnaces and at 16 or more

392
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
items to the furnaces and at 16 or more
 

393
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,510
items to the furnaces and at 16 or more
it'll drop off two items

394
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
it'll drop off two items
 

395
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,270
it'll drop off two items
in each of the furnaces at eight items

396
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
in each of the furnaces at eight items
 

397
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,230
in each of the furnaces at eight items
it'll drop off one item to each furnace

398
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
it'll drop off one item to each furnace
 

399
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,150
it'll drop off one item to each furnace
on startup though we don't want it to

400
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
on startup though we don't want it to
 

401
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,990
on startup though we don't want it to
wait till it gets 16 items because

402
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
wait till it gets 16 items because
 

403
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,909
wait till it gets 16 items because
that'll take longer for this to fill up

404
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
that'll take longer for this to fill up
 

405
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,230
that'll take longer for this to fill up
right it'll waste another two seconds

406
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
right it'll waste another two seconds
 

407
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,629
right it'll waste another two seconds
so we have a special startup sequence

408
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
so we have a special startup sequence
 

409
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,749
so we have a special startup sequence
here

410
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
here
 

411
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,029
here
that only activates once as soon as we

412
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
that only activates once as soon as we
 

413
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,270
that only activates once as soon as we
put the items into the smell tree

414
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
put the items into the smell tree
 

415
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,189
put the items into the smell tree
and we make it activate only once with

416
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
and we make it activate only once with
 

417
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,189
and we make it activate only once with
the sticky piston here the spinal stable

418
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
the sticky piston here the spinal stable
 

419
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,150
the sticky piston here the spinal stable
circuits

420
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
circuits
 

421
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,710
circuits
i've added a little bit of delay because

422
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
i've added a little bit of delay because
 

423
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,469
i've added a little bit of delay because
it was only actually dropping off seven

424
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
it was only actually dropping off seven
 

425
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,110
it was only actually dropping off seven
items to the furnaces so hopefully that

426
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
items to the furnaces so hopefully that
 

427
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,790
items to the furnaces so hopefully that
fixes it

428
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
fixes it
 

429
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,309
fixes it
the other thing though is that to make

430
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
the other thing though is that to make
 

431
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,110
the other thing though is that to make
it stop and pick up 16 items here

432
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
it stop and pick up 16 items here
 

433
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,950
it stop and pick up 16 items here
before it does the next cycle i've added

434
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
before it does the next cycle i've added
 

435
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,189
before it does the next cycle i've added
in a clock sequence down here

436
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
in a clock sequence down here
 

437
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,909
in a clock sequence down here
so as items smelt in the furnace they'll

438
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
so as items smelt in the furnace they'll
 

439
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,270
so as items smelt in the furnace they'll
pass by this hopper

440
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
pass by this hopper
 

441
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,550
pass by this hopper
here will detect that then we make it

442
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
here will detect that then we make it
 

443
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,390
here will detect that then we make it
run to a clock

444
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
run to a clock
 

445
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,510
run to a clock
uh this is like a a delay timer and then

446
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
uh this is like a a delay timer and then
 

447
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,270
uh this is like a a delay timer and then
this is our comparator clock that

448
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
this is our comparator clock that
 

449
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,390
this is our comparator clock that
activates the dropper elevator still

450
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
activates the dropper elevator still
 

451
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,589
activates the dropper elevator still
following me

452
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
following me
 

453
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,430
following me
because i've lost myself already long

454
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
because i've lost myself already long
 

455
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,790
because i've lost myself already long
ago uh

456
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
ago uh
 

457
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,990
ago uh
and then every time we finish

458
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
and then every time we finish
 

459
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,629
and then every time we finish
a smelting cycle once the items smelt we

460
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
a smelting cycle once the items smelt we
 

461
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,909
a smelting cycle once the items smelt we
tell this uh

462
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
tell this uh
 

463
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,070
tell this uh
hopper minecart up here you see how the

464
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
hopper minecart up here you see how the
 

465
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,670
hopper minecart up here you see how the
the line goes up here

466
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
the line goes up here
 

467
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,510
the line goes up here
we tell all the hopper minecarts to

468
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
we tell all the hopper minecarts to
 

469
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,350
we tell all the hopper minecarts to
deliver some more items to the furnaces

470
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
deliver some more items to the furnaces
 

471
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,950
deliver some more items to the furnaces
so it'll start another cycle

472
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
so it'll start another cycle
 

473
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,950
so it'll start another cycle
so it'll keep running until it runs out

474
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
so it'll keep running until it runs out
 

475
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,150
so it'll keep running until it runs out
of items to smelt

476
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
of items to smelt
 

477
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,950
of items to smelt
is what this does uh is the hope anyways

478
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
is what this does uh is the hope anyways
 

479
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,790
is what this does uh is the hope anyways
we gotta test it out so let's start it

480
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
we gotta test it out so let's start it
 

481
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,550
we gotta test it out so let's start it
up

482
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
up
 

483
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,189
up
and hopefully everything is set up

484
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
and hopefully everything is set up
 

485
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,189
and hopefully everything is set up
pretty good now how many should we do

486
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
pretty good now how many should we do
 

487
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,550
pretty good now how many should we do
let's just do four stacks of items

488
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
let's just do four stacks of items
 

489
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,909
let's just do four stacks of items
and we want this to leave okay let's

490
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
and we want this to leave okay let's
 

491
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,430
and we want this to leave okay let's
double check it delivered eight because

492
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
double check it delivered eight because
 

493
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,269
double check it delivered eight because
it wasn't no it only delivered seven

494
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
it wasn't no it only delivered seven
 

495
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:39,990
it wasn't no it only delivered seven
still

496
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
still
 

497
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,110
still
so this last furnace isn't on

498
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
so this last furnace isn't on
 

499
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,990
so this last furnace isn't on
okay but now i think it's waiting to

500
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
okay but now i think it's waiting to
 

501
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,470
okay but now i think it's waiting to
pick up 16 items or more

502
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
pick up 16 items or more
 

503
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,230
pick up 16 items or more
so it should deliver two items to each

504
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
so it should deliver two items to each
 

505
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,949
so it should deliver two items to each
furnace now

506
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
furnace now
 

507
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,350
furnace now
why is this oh maybe i gotta make this

508
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
why is this oh maybe i gotta make this
 

509
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,870
why is this oh maybe i gotta make this
minecart rail go

510
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
minecart rail go
 

511
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,630
minecart rail go
one block further because it's still not

512
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
one block further because it's still not
 

513
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,670
one block further because it's still not
giving items to the end one

514
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
giving items to the end one
 

515
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,870
giving items to the end one
i think that's what it is

516
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880

 

517
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,070

okay okay

518
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
okay okay
 

519
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,389
okay okay
but you can see as as items smelt here

520
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
but you can see as as items smelt here
 

521
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,150
but you can see as as items smelt here
they activate this comparator once the

522
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
they activate this comparator once the
 

523
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,630
they activate this comparator once the
cycle is done

524
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
cycle is done
 

525
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,110
cycle is done
see that turned on activates the dropper

526
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
see that turned on activates the dropper
 

527
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,590
see that turned on activates the dropper
elevator here

528
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
elevator here
 

529
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,509
elevator here
i think that was lag i don't know why it

530
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
i think that was lag i don't know why it
 

531
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,150
i think that was lag i don't know why it
stayed on for a while

532
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
stayed on for a while
 

533
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,470
stayed on for a while
and this first furnace seems to have got

534
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
and this first furnace seems to have got
 

535
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,070
and this first furnace seems to have got
more items because they weren't going to

536
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
more items because they weren't going to
 

537
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,030
more items because they weren't going to
the back there

538
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
the back there
 

539
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,110
the back there
like they were supposed to okay

540
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
like they were supposed to okay
 

541
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,190
like they were supposed to okay
we're getting close it still needs more

542
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
we're getting close it still needs more
 

543
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,150
we're getting close it still needs more
tweaking

544
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160

 

545
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,389

i just realized there was a lever here

546
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
i just realized there was a lever here
 

547
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,030
i just realized there was a lever here
watching this last hopper

548
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
watching this last hopper
 

549
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,070
watching this last hopper
okay so i've unlocked this hopper here

550
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
okay so i've unlocked this hopper here
 

551
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,829
okay so i've unlocked this hopper here
i noticed this furnace was only getting

552
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
i noticed this furnace was only getting
 

553
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,829
i noticed this furnace was only getting
one item instead of two like when there

554
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:49,839
one item instead of two like when there
 

555
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,230
one item instead of two like when there
was 16 in the mine cart so i've extended

556
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
was 16 in the mine cart so i've extended
 

557
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,590
was 16 in the mine cart so i've extended
it by a block here

558
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
it by a block here
 

559
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,070
it by a block here
and i've also extended this front part

560
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
and i've also extended this front part
 

561
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,750
and i've also extended this front part
by a block there used to be a furnace

562
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
by a block there used to be a furnace
 

563
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,949
by a block there used to be a furnace
down here

564
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
down here
 

565
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,870
down here
problem was the front the very first

566
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
problem was the front the very first
 

567
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,550
problem was the front the very first
furnace was getting two items when the

568
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
furnace was getting two items when the
 

569
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,550
furnace was getting two items when the
other ones are only getting one

570
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
other ones are only getting one
 

571
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,710
other ones are only getting one
so let's let's try it out now let's try

572
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
so let's let's try it out now let's try
 

573
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,150
so let's let's try it out now let's try
out these changes we're gonna put in

574
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
out these changes we're gonna put in
 

575
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,150
out these changes we're gonna put in
three stacks of items

576
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
three stacks of items
 

577
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,509
three stacks of items
so this should go at eight items

578
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
so this should go at eight items
 

579
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,110
so this should go at eight items
and i also shorten the timing by two

580
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
and i also shorten the timing by two
 

581
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,949
and i also shorten the timing by two
ticks up there

582
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
ticks up there
 

583
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,069
ticks up there
and then it should go again pretty soon

584
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
and then it should go again pretty soon
 

585
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,150
and then it should go again pretty soon
here so it's got enough for another

586
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
here so it's got enough for another
 

587
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,069
here so it's got enough for another
cycle okay as soon as that first cycle

588
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
cycle okay as soon as that first cycle
 

589
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,550
cycle okay as soon as that first cycle
finished smelting it sent this one

590
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
finished smelting it sent this one
 

591
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,230
finished smelting it sent this one
now each of these should have two

592
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
now each of these should have two
 

593
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,949
now each of these should have two
good looking good guys this will keep

594
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
good looking good guys this will keep
 

595
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,550
good looking good guys this will keep
running even when there's

596
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
running even when there's
 

597
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,110
running even when there's
there's no items left that's fine but

598
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
there's no items left that's fine but
 

599
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,990
there's no items left that's fine but
it'll stop once

600
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
it'll stop once
 

601
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,910
it'll stop once
all the smelting is done

602
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920

 

603
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,829

okay so i'm going to move it forward by

946
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
okay so i'm going to move it forward by
 

947
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,670
okay so i'm going to move it forward by
one block and then it'll start going up

948
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
one block and then it'll start going up
 

949
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,150
one block and then it'll start going up
here

950
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160

 

951
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,590

all right and we're going to do the quad

952
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
all right and we're going to do the quad
 

953

elevator i'm going to try to get it to

954
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
elevator i'm going to try to get it to
 

955
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,069
elevator i'm going to try to get it to
work here

956
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
work here
 

957
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,990
work here
i think the pattern we want to do

958
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
i think the pattern we want to do
 

959
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,949
i think the pattern we want to do
is let's see i got to move this forward

960
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
is let's see i got to move this forward
 

961
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,590
is let's see i got to move this forward
so we're going to

962
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
so we're going to
 

963
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,590
so we're going to
grab the signal from here

964
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600

 

965
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,510

and then i think we want to stagger our

966
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
and then i think we want to stagger our
 

967
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,429
and then i think we want to stagger our
wiring all the way up like staircase it

968
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
wiring all the way up like staircase it
 

969
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,710
wiring all the way up like staircase it
so it goes from here

970
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
so it goes from here
 

971
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,590
so it goes from here
to here to here to here all the way up

972
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
to here to here to here all the way up
 

973
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,270
to here to here to here all the way up
following that pattern

974
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
following that pattern
 

975
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,390
following that pattern
uh so this wire here will power this

976
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
uh so this wire here will power this
 

977
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,150
uh so this wire here will power this
dropper this one will power this one

978
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
dropper this one will power this one
 

979
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,230
dropper this one will power this one
this one will power this one one tick of

980
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
this one will power this one one tick of
 

981
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,829
this one will power this one one tick of
delay between them

982
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
delay between them
 

983
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,029
delay between them
and see how that works out let's let's

984
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
and see how that works out let's let's
 

985
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,390
and see how that works out let's let's
flip it on

986
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
flip it on
 

987
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,069
flip it on

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
make sure it works
 

995
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,789
make sure it works
uh-huh that's with the sound

996
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
uh-huh that's with the sound
 

997
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,830
uh-huh that's with the sound
all the way down to four percent guys

998
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
all the way down to four percent guys
 

999
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,630
all the way down to four percent guys
i had it louder before and this has been

1000
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
i had it louder before and this has been
 

1001
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,350
i had it louder before and this has been
running for a few minutes now

1002
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
running for a few minutes now
 

1003
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,390
running for a few minutes now
starting to lose my mind here oh it's so

1004
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
starting to lose my mind here oh it's so
 

1005
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,190
starting to lose my mind here oh it's so
bad

1006
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
bad
 

1007
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,270
bad
okay let's test it out though let's make

1008
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
okay let's test it out though let's make
 

1009
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,230
okay let's test it out though let's make
sure this works

1010
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
sure this works
 

1011
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,789
sure this works
so we're gonna throw um

1012
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
so we're gonna throw um
 

1013
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,430
so we're gonna throw um
29 stone bricks into the left there

1014
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
29 stone bricks into the left there
 

1015
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,310
29 stone bricks into the left there
let's throw in 29 grass

1016
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
let's throw in 29 grass
 

1017
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,950
let's throw in 29 grass
into there and then let's also test out

1018
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
into there and then let's also test out
 

1019
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,430
into there and then let's also test out
these front droppers

1020
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
these front droppers
 

1021
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,870
these front droppers
so eight eight sources are convoluting

1022
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
so eight eight sources are convoluting
 

1023
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,669
so eight eight sources are convoluting
down to

1024
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
down to
 

1025
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,150
down to
one basically that's what we're trying

1026
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
one basically that's what we're trying
 

1027
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,669
one basically that's what we're trying
to do here

1028
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
to do here
 

1029
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,110
to do here
let's put in rails into there

1030
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
let's put in rails into there
 

1031
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,470
let's put in rails into there
and then power rails into there so all

1032
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
and then power rails into there so all
 

1033
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,310
and then power rails into there so all
those items should make it to the top

1034
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
those items should make it to the top
 

1035
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,470
those items should make it to the top
eventually

1036
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
eventually
 

1037
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,190
eventually
hopefully fairly quickly let's get out

1038
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
hopefully fairly quickly let's get out
 

1039
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,470
hopefully fairly quickly let's get out
of here

1040
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
of here
 

1041
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,750
of here
oh my goodness the sound oh i went way

1042
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
oh my goodness the sound oh i went way
 

1043
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,470
oh my goodness the sound oh i went way
too far

1044
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
too far
 

1045
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,029
too far
where am i i'm lost i think i went over

1046
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
where am i i'm lost i think i went over
 

1047
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,870
where am i i'm lost i think i went over
the hill here

1048
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
the hill here
 

1049
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,470
the hill here
okay so those should end up in this

1050
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
okay so those should end up in this
 

1051
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,470
okay so those should end up in this
double chest at the very top

1052
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
double chest at the very top
 

1053
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,909
double chest at the very top
hopefully they didn't get stuck this

1054
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
hopefully they didn't get stuck this
 

1055
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,590
hopefully they didn't get stuck this
time

1056
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
time
 

1057
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,470
time
yeah so everything is there right i

1058
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
yeah so everything is there right i
 

1059
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,990
yeah so everything is there right i
think so i think it's all good so the

1060
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
think so i think it's all good so the
 

1061
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,390
think so i think it's all good so the
dropper elevator works

1062
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
dropper elevator works
 

1063
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,150
dropper elevator works
it's just really loud and annoying and

1064
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
it's just really loud and annoying and
 

1065
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,909
it's just really loud and annoying and
laggy

1066
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
laggy
 

1067
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,669
laggy
but you guys wanted the quad dropper

1068
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
but you guys wanted the quad dropper
 

1069
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,669
but you guys wanted the quad dropper
elevator so i delivered

1070
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
elevator so i delivered
 

1071
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,909
elevator so i delivered
right yeah

1072
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919

 

1073
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,470

all right guys very cool so this is it i

1074
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
all right guys very cool so this is it i
 

1075
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,630
all right guys very cool so this is it i
think we have the basics of our system

1076
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
think we have the basics of our system
 

1077
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,230
think we have the basics of our system
working here we're gonna do the first

1078
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
working here we're gonna do the first
 

1079
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,549
working here we're gonna do the first
official test let's get down our hoppers

1080
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
official test let's get down our hoppers
 

1081
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,750
official test let's get down our hoppers
i was worried they're gonna push each

1082
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
i was worried they're gonna push each
 

1083
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,470
i was worried they're gonna push each
other for a moment there it's like no

1084
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
other for a moment there it's like no
 

1085
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,350
other for a moment there it's like no
it's all for nothing it doesn't work no

1086
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
it's all for nothing it doesn't work no
 

1087
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,630
it's all for nothing it doesn't work no
they seem fine though

1088
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
they seem fine though
 

1089
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,549
they seem fine though
i put some redstone blocks down here

1090
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
i put some redstone blocks down here
 

1091
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,070
i put some redstone blocks down here
these are just the power of the power

1092
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
these are just the power of the power
 

1093
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,710
these are just the power of the power
rails

1094
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
rails
 

1095
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,470
rails
so four blocks will power all eight of

1096
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
so four blocks will power all eight of
 

1097
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,710
so four blocks will power all eight of
them and i don't think it'll lock the

1098
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
them and i don't think it'll lock the
 

1099
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,029
them and i don't think it'll lock the
hoppers so that's all good

1100
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
hoppers so that's all good
 

1101
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,190
hoppers so that's all good
uh let's get down our other ones yeah

1102
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
uh let's get down our other ones yeah
 

1103
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,710
uh let's get down our other ones yeah
these are all empty here

1104
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
these are all empty here
 

1105
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,230
these are all empty here
so we're going to do a speed test as

1106
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
so we're going to do a speed test as
 

1107
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,830
so we're going to do a speed test as
well we want to see how quick it'll

1108
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
well we want to see how quick it'll
 

1109
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,110
well we want to see how quick it'll
actually smelt things now too uh it's

1110
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,120
actually smelt things now too uh it's
 

1111
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,630
actually smelt things now too uh it's
not pretty the system's not

1112
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
not pretty the system's not
 

1113
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,789
not pretty the system's not
polished up or finished in that regard

1114
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
polished up or finished in that regard
 

1115
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,950
polished up or finished in that regard
but it's this basic

1116
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
but it's this basic
 

1117
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,950
but it's this basic
functionality right now is what we're

1118
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
functionality right now is what we're
 

1119
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,390
functionality right now is what we're
testing out

1120
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
testing out
 

1121
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,270
testing out
uh this i put down two hopper mine carts

1122
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
uh this i put down two hopper mine carts
 

1123
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,669
uh this i put down two hopper mine carts
here

1124
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
here
 

1125
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,909
here
sort of as a temporary thing this is an

1126
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
sort of as a temporary thing this is an
 

1127
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,430
sort of as a temporary thing this is an
easy way to give it fuel

1128
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
easy way to give it fuel
 

1129
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,870
easy way to give it fuel
until i figure out exactly what we're

1130
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
until i figure out exactly what we're
 

1131
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,470
until i figure out exactly what we're
doing with that

1132
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
doing with that
 

1133
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,789
doing with that
um so we got another one running on this

1134
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
um so we got another one running on this
 

1135
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,029
um so we got another one running on this
side whoa

1136
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
side whoa
 

1137
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,830
side whoa
and that works pretty good all right

1138
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:13,840
and that works pretty good all right
 

1139
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,230
and that works pretty good all right
let's

1140
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
let's
 

1141
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,830
let's
hop up here though and we'll try it out

1142
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
hop up here though and we'll try it out
 

1143
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,510
hop up here though and we'll try it out
now i think we're all good to go for our

1144
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
now i think we're all good to go for our
 

1145
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,830
now i think we're all good to go for our
first

1146
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
first
 

1147
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,070
first
tests oh i'm lost

right i clean clean out all the garbage
 

1157
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,430
right i clean clean out all the garbage
out of the the furnaces so they should

1158
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
out of the the furnaces so they should
 

1159
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,230
out of the the furnaces so they should
be

1160
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
be
 

1161
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,669
be
hopefully okay okay this is empty yeah

1162
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
hopefully okay okay this is empty yeah
 

1163
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,430
hopefully okay okay this is empty yeah
so here we go guys our first speed test

1164
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
so here we go guys our first speed test
 

1165
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,950
so here we go guys our first speed test
we're gonna make some cracked

1166
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
we're gonna make some cracked
 

1167
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,950
we're gonna make some cracked
stone bricks by smelting stone bricks

1168
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
stone bricks by smelting stone bricks
 

1169
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,070
stone bricks by smelting stone bricks
and at the very minimum it's gonna take

1170
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
and at the very minimum it's gonna take
 

1171
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,029
and at the very minimum it's gonna take
oh i felt the leg already

1172
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
oh i felt the leg already
 

1173
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,549
oh i felt the leg already
why is it lagging it should be lagging

1174
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
why is it lagging it should be lagging
 

1175
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,789
why is it lagging it should be lagging
already it's the dropper elevator that

1176
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
already it's the dropper elevator that
 

1177
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,950
already it's the dropper elevator that
lags

1178
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
lags
 

1179
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,549
lags
uh it's fine now yeah now i can feel it

1180
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
uh it's fine now yeah now i can feel it
 

1181
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,350
uh it's fine now yeah now i can feel it
i can really feel it now yeah so we had

1182
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
i can really feel it now yeah so we had
 

1183
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,789
i can really feel it now yeah so we had
some garbage items left

1184
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
some garbage items left
 

1185
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,630
some garbage items left
in the in the elevator it looks like

1186
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
in the in the elevator it looks like
 

1187
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,149
in the in the elevator it looks like
that's where that furnace and stuff came

1188
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
that's where that furnace and stuff came
 

1189
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,630
that's where that furnace and stuff came
from

1190
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640

 

1191
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,750

okay seems like uh maybe the elevator

1192
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
okay seems like uh maybe the elevator
 

1193
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,190
okay seems like uh maybe the elevator
needs to run a bit longer it's not

1194
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
needs to run a bit longer it's not
 

1195
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,350
needs to run a bit longer it's not
delivering a full stack

1196
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
delivering a full stack
 

1197
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,549
delivering a full stack
every time is it or maybe it is 43

1198
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
every time is it or maybe it is 43
 

1199
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,909
every time is it or maybe it is 43
to 35 yeah it's not quite

1200
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
to 35 yeah it's not quite
 

1201
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,070
to 35 yeah it's not quite
running long enough so that's an issue

1202
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
running long enough so that's an issue
 

1203
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,669
running long enough so that's an issue
there's more items in the elevator just

1204
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
there's more items in the elevator just
 

1205
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,110
there's more items in the elevator just
didn't deliver them

1206
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120

 

1207
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,270

but yeah that's the rough smelting time

1208
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
but yeah that's the rough smelting time
 

1209
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,789
but yeah that's the rough smelting time
of this thing

1210
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
of this thing
 

1211
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,190
of this thing
plus like 10 more items or so

1212
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200

 

1213
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,950

so that is pretty cool i'm i'm really

1214
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
so that is pretty cool i'm i'm really
 

1215
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,590
so that is pretty cool i'm i'm really
happy with that

1216
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
happy with that
 

1217
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,029
happy with that
i think that is uh that's a winner

1218
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
i think that is uh that's a winner
 

1219
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,510
i think that is uh that's a winner
yes everything seems to be running good

1220
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
yes everything seems to be running good
 

1221
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,350
yes everything seems to be running good
yeah no problems

1222
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360

 

1223
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,990

those ones are moving right yeah those

1224
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
those ones are moving right yeah those
 

1225
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,070
those ones are moving right yeah those
are going to

1226
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
are going to
 

1227
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,669
are going to
cool uh we can't check the furnaces but

1228
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
cool uh we can't check the furnaces but
 

1229
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,350
cool uh we can't check the furnaces but
it looks like they're all on here that's

1230
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
it looks like they're all on here that's
 

1231
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,190
it looks like they're all on here that's
a good sign

1232
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
a good sign
 

1233
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,310
a good sign
okay so in total we got six

1234
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
okay so in total we got six
 

1235
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,070
okay so in total we got six
just about seven stacks of items we put

1236
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
just about seven stacks of items we put
 

1237
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,830
just about seven stacks of items we put
eight stacks in though so that means

1238
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
eight stacks in though so that means
 

1239
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,750
eight stacks in though so that means
there's about a stack of items stuck

1240
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
there's about a stack of items stuck
 

1241
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,149
there's about a stack of items stuck
in the dropper elevator so we need to

1242
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
in the dropper elevator so we need to
 

1243
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,430
in the dropper elevator so we need to
make this clock run a bit longer

1244
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
make this clock run a bit longer
 

1245
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,669
make this clock run a bit longer
that's why that happened you can see

1246
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
that's why that happened you can see
 

1247
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,390
that's why that happened you can see
when we unpower this

1248
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
when we unpower this
 

1249
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,310
when we unpower this
this slowly bleeds away that's what

1250
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
this slowly bleeds away that's what
 

1251
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,750
this slowly bleeds away that's what
controls how long the

1252
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
controls how long the
 

1253
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,789
controls how long the
elevator stays powered for

1254
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
elevator stays powered for
 

1255
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,630
elevator stays powered for
so we need to make this longer somehow

1256
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640

 

1257
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,110

and then all should be good with that so

1258
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
and then all should be good with that so
 

1259
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,630
and then all should be good with that so
that is pretty cool let's double check

1260
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
that is pretty cool let's double check
 

1261
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,669
that is pretty cool let's double check
we got our

1262
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
we got our
 

1263
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,430
we got our
eight stacks up here

1264
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440

 

1265
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,510

plus one there must have been one

1266
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
plus one there must have been one
 

1267
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,350
plus one there must have been one
garbage item left in the elevator too

1268
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
garbage item left in the elevator too
 

1269
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,230
garbage item left in the elevator too
before we started aha but yeah it's a

1270
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
before we started aha but yeah it's a
 

1271
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,710
before we started aha but yeah it's a
very

1272
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
very
 

1273
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,350
very
very quick uh thing i'm happy with that

1274
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
very quick uh thing i'm happy with that
 

1275
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,310
very quick uh thing i'm happy with that
seems cool

1276
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
seems cool
 

1277
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,310
seems cool
about 10 seconds every stack of items

1278
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
about 10 seconds every stack of items
 

1279
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,190
about 10 seconds every stack of items
and very short startup and ending times

1280
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
and very short startup and ending times
 

1281
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,190
and very short startup and ending times
too so that's cool

1282
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
too so that's cool
 

1283
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,630
too so that's cool
anyways let's get to the comment of the

1284
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
anyways let's get to the comment of the
 

1285
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,230
anyways let's get to the comment of the
day it says one thing that would be

1286
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
day it says one thing that would be
 

1287
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,390
day it says one thing that would be
extremely cool with the auto smelter

1288
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
extremely cool with the auto smelter
 

1289
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:10,870
extremely cool with the auto smelter
would be

1290
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
would be
 

1291
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,789
would be
to make it so that you can just place

1292
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
to make it so that you can just place
 

1293
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,190
to make it so that you can just place
down a shulker box in a certain spot

1294
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
down a shulker box in a certain spot
 

1295
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,830
down a shulker box in a certain spot
just add a hopper to the input chest so

1296
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
just add a hopper to the input chest so
 

1297
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,390
just add a hopper to the input chest so
that way

1298
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
that way
 

1299
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,549
that way
you can take a shulker box from let's

1300
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
you can take a shulker box from let's
 

1301
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,470
you can take a shulker box from let's
say the gold farm

1302
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
say the gold farm
 

1303
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,830
say the gold farm
and smelt down the armor into nuggets

1304
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
and smelt down the armor into nuggets
 

1305
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,190
and smelt down the armor into nuggets
yeah so i would like to do something

1306
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
yeah so i would like to do something
 

1307
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,270
yeah so i would like to do something
like that have uh

1308
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
like that have uh
 

1309
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,789
like that have uh
let's see i want to make a building for

1310
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
let's see i want to make a building for
 

1311
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,950
let's see i want to make a building for
this i want to maybe have a shulker

1312
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
this i want to maybe have a shulker
 

1313
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,310
this i want to maybe have a shulker
input and output

1314
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
input and output
 

1315
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,669
input and output
system to it and also if we can i would

1316
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
system to it and also if we can i would
 

1317
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,430
system to it and also if we can i would
like to control whether we're using

1318
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
like to control whether we're using
 

1319
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,710
like to control whether we're using
