probably close to 20 stacks now and

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
probably close to 20 stacks now and
 

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,229
probably close to 20 stacks now and
we're going to enchant a diamond pickaxe

18
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
we're going to enchant a diamond pickaxe

to start out with I'm gonna do 47

20
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:39,420
to start out with I'm gonna do 47
 

21
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,780
to start out with I'm gonna do 47
because it's really hard to find a level

22
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:41,790
because it's really hard to find a level
 

23
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,260
because it's really hard to find a level
50 in this thing takes lots and lots of

24
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,270
50 in this thing takes lots and lots of
 

25
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,740
50 in this thing takes lots and lots of
time to find one so 47 is good for me

26
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:47,750
time to find one so 47 is good for me
 

27
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,450
time to find one so 47 is good for me
here we go I'm hoping for silk touch

28
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,460
here we go I'm hoping for silk touch
 

29
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,860
here we go I'm hoping for silk touch
will we get it will we get it I'm scared

30
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:54,870
will we get it will we get it I'm scared
 

31
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,410
will we get it will we get it I'm scared
to look efficiency for

32
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,420

 

33
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,820

that is a really good skill but I was

34
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:02,830
that is a really good skill but I was
 

35
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,030
that is a really good skill but I was
hoping for at least more than one skill

36
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,040
hoping for at least more than one skill
 

37
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,020
hoping for at least more than one skill
oh well I think when I do these

38
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,030
oh well I think when I do these
 

39
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,610
oh well I think when I do these
enchantments I'll probably only go to

40
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:11,620
enchantments I'll probably only go to
 

41
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,100
enchantments I'll probably only go to
about level 35 or so probably I don't

42
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,110
about level 35 or so probably I don't
 

43
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,830
about level 35 or so probably I don't
know it's tucked in to level 50 slows

44
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
know it's tucked in to level 50 slows
 

45
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,710
know it's tucked in to level 50 slows
down a lot as you get to as you at the

46
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
down a lot as you get to as you at the
 

47
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,890
down a lot as you get to as you at the
higher levels

48
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:24,900
higher levels
 

49
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,230
higher levels
all right well efficiency for that's not

50
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
all right well efficiency for that's not
 

51
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,390
all right well efficiency for that's not
terrible let's actually want to try it

can't find my words and I was hoping by
 

405
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,840
can't find my words and I was hoping by
doing an LP that I would get better that

406
00:10:59,840 --> 00:10:59,850
doing an LP that I would get better that
 

407
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,930
doing an LP that I would get better that
in real life and in minecraft of course

408
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:02,940
in real life and in minecraft of course
 

409
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,840
in real life and in minecraft of course
and it's helped me a little bit I feel

410
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:05,850
and it's helped me a little bit I feel
 

411
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:13,730
and it's helped me a little bit I feel
but I still struggle um see I got to

412
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:13,740
but I still struggle um see I got to
 

413
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,810
but I still struggle um see I got to
take a break again because I gotta think

414
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:14,820
take a break again because I gotta think
 

415
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,740
take a break again because I gotta think
about what I want to say if you've ever

416
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:18,750
about what I want to say if you've ever
 

417
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,600
about what I want to say if you've ever
done commentary before it's very

418
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:20,610
done commentary before it's very
 

419
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,870
done commentary before it's very
difficult to do something in the game

420
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:23,880
difficult to do something in the game
 

421
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,300
difficult to do something in the game
and talk about something at the same

422
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,310
and talk about something at the same
 

423
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,800
and talk about something at the same
time that's why I'm doing like very

424
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:30,810
time that's why I'm doing like very
 

425
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,900
time that's why I'm doing like very
simple stuff today in Minecraft because

426
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:32,910
simple stuff today in Minecraft because
 

427
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,540
simple stuff today in Minecraft because
I can't build something complicated and

428
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:35,550
I can't build something complicated and
 

429
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,900
I can't build something complicated and
talked at the same time so that's this

430
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:38,910
talked at the same time so that's this
 

431
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,020
talked at the same time so that's this
is a perfect project for today

432
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,030

 

433
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,280

yeah actually it just occurred to me I

434
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,290
yeah actually it just occurred to me I
 

435
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,440
yeah actually it just occurred to me I
should probably just do voiceover

436
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,450
should probably just do voiceover
 

437
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,470
should probably just do voiceover
commentary for this episode because I'll

438
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
commentary for this episode because I'll
 

439
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
commentary for this episode because I'll
be able to think about what I'm saying a

440
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,010
be able to think about what I'm saying a
 

441
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,880
be able to think about what I'm saying a
little bit more clear and the video will

442
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:54,890
little bit more clear and the video will
 

443
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,290
little bit more clear and the video will
be more interesting because I'll be able

444
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:56,300
be more interesting because I'll be able
 

445
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,630
be more interesting because I'll be able
to speed it up and yeah it'll just be

446
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:58,640
to speed it up and yeah it'll just be
 

447
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,320
to speed it up and yeah it'll just be
better but it's funny how the brain

448
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,330
better but it's funny how the brain
 

449
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,620
better but it's funny how the brain
works like if I was to compare talking

450
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:05,630
works like if I was to compare talking
 

451
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,020
works like if I was to compare talking
about something else

452
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,030
about something else
 

453
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,950
about something else
and building in Minecraft it's like have

454
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:11,960
and building in Minecraft it's like have
 

455
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,360
and building in Minecraft it's like have
you ever tried having a conversation

456
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,370
you ever tried having a conversation
 

457
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,190
you ever tried having a conversation
with someone like talking to someone on

458
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
with someone like talking to someone on
 

459
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,710
with someone like talking to someone on
the phone and then reading something at

460
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:17,720
the phone and then reading something at
 

461
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,420
the phone and then reading something at
the same time have you ever tried to do

462
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,430
the same time have you ever tried to do
 

463
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,300
the same time have you ever tried to do
both well it's like the brain just can't

464
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,310
both well it's like the brain just can't
 

465
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,130
both well it's like the brain just can't
do it it conflicts those two activities

466
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,140
do it it conflicts those two activities
 

467
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,430
do it it conflicts those two activities
conflict with each other and that's how

468
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
conflict with each other and that's how
 

469
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,310
conflict with each other and that's how
I compare building and talking at the

470
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
I compare building and talking at the
 

471
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,680
I compare building and talking at the
same time in Minecraft it's like that

472
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:32,690
same time in Minecraft it's like that
 

473
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,790
same time in Minecraft it's like that
even though the brain is able to

474
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:33,800
even though the brain is able to
 

475
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,970
even though the brain is able to
multitask pretty well there's certain

476
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:36,980
multitask pretty well there's certain
 

477
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,020
multitask pretty well there's certain
tasks it just can't do together it's

478
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,030
tasks it just can't do together it's

target a different audience as well and
 

683
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,390
target a different audience as well and
it just so happens
