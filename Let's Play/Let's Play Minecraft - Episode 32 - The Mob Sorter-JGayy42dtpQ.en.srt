00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:49,100
takes you to a junction here I've
changed the junctions with my one to one

168
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,110
changed the junctions with my one to one
 

169
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,470
changed the junctions with my one to one
block space junctions with the door here

170
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:51,480
block space junctions with the door here
 

171
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,320
block space junctions with the door here
and a door here I found mobs that

172
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,330
and a door here I found mobs that
 

173
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,560
and a door here I found mobs that
sometimes get clumped together and then

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:57,570
sometimes get clumped together and then
 

175
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,760
sometimes get clumped together and then
get stuck in at the doors so I've made

176
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:01,770
get stuck in at the doors so I've made
 

177
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,540
get stuck in at the doors so I've made
this junction at two by two and it seems

178
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,550
this junction at two by two and it seems
 

179
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,230
this junction at two by two and it seems
to not clog up like my other design and

180
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,240
to not clog up like my other design and
 

181
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,870
to not clog up like my other design and
they go directly into water here so they

182
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:14,880
they go directly into water here so they
 

183
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,490
they go directly into water here so they
don't get stuck in the door place over

184
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:19,500
don't get stuck in the door place over
 

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:33,410
don't get stuck in the door place over
here and this one goes to nothing and so

186
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:33,420
here and this one goes to nothing and so
 

187
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:41,690
here and this one goes to nothing and so
I leave her down here oops controls the

188
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:41,700
I leave her down here oops controls the
 

189
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,250
I leave her down here oops controls the
door junction over there there's wire

190
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,260
door junction over there there's wire
 

191
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:59,020
door junction over there there's wire
all along the top and it goes down to

192
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,030

 

193
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,250

goes all along the top

194
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,260
goes all along the top
 

195
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,580
goes all along the top
we're here on to the nether rack comes

196
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:07,590
we're here on to the nether rack comes
 

197
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,190
we're here on to the nether rack comes
down here to this block to this torch

198
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,200
down here to this block to this torch
 

199
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:17,930
down here to this block to this torch
and to the two doors

200
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:17,940

 

201
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,439

and your positioning is very important

202
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:22,449
and your positioning is very important
 

203
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:24,900
and your positioning is very important
with this you'll notice I have ladders

204
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:24,910
with this you'll notice I have ladders
 

205
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,860
with this you'll notice I have ladders
on the side and the side that is to

206
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,870
on the side and the side that is to
 

207
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,680
on the side and the side that is to
create a very small gap from this wall

208
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:31,690
create a very small gap from this wall
 

209
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:38,269
create a very small gap from this wall
and this wall it's very important

210
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:38,279

 

211
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,590

because if you're against right against

212
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
because if you're against right against
 

213
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,480
because if you're against right against
this wall there's a good chance the

214
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,490
this wall there's a good chance the
 

215
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,939
this wall there's a good chance the
creepers are not going to start circling

216
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:47,949
creepers are not going to start circling
 

217
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:50,280
creepers are not going to start circling
around you in time and they'll just fall

218
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,290
around you in time and they'll just fall
 

219
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,639
around you in time and they'll just fall
straight down here and if you're not

220
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:53,649
straight down here and if you're not
 

221
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,150
straight down here and if you're not
against this wall there's a good chance

222
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,160
against this wall there's a good chance
 

223
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,180
against this wall there's a good chance
that every so often mobs

224
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,190
that every so often mobs
 

225
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,069
that every so often mobs
will get stuck in the skeleton place

226
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
will get stuck in the skeleton place
 

227
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,300
will get stuck in the skeleton place
because they'll be if there are brush

228
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,310
because they'll be if there are brush
 

229
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,610
because they'll be if there are brush
trade against as well sometimes they'll

230
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:08,620
trade against as well sometimes they'll
 

231
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:23,910
trade against as well sometimes they'll
get sent in the water stream yeah so the

232
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
get sent in the water stream yeah so the
 

233
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,980
get sent in the water stream yeah so the
door Junction takes you the water block

234
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:25,990
door Junction takes you the water block
 

235
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:34,110
door Junction takes you the water block
here comes up it's too high here so they

236
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,120
here comes up it's too high here so they
 

237
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,920
here comes up it's too high here so they
can't jump skeleton will see you and

238
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:37,930
can't jump skeleton will see you and
 

239
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,079
can't jump skeleton will see you and
then they'll start circling around they

240
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,089
then they'll start circling around they
 

241
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,759
then they'll start circling around they
get into the water and they fall down

242
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:43,769
get into the water and they fall down
 

243
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,350
get into the water and they fall down
the other mobs keep going they'll jump

244
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:46,360
the other mobs keep going they'll jump
 

245
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,790
the other mobs keep going they'll jump
around here and there's a diagonal

246
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
around here and there's a diagonal
 

247
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,059
around here and there's a diagonal
stream of water going going this

248
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:54,069
stream of water going going this
 

249
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,050
stream of water going going this
direction

250
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,060
direction
 

251
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,760
direction
and which drops them off around here and

252
00:10:59,760 --> 00:10:59,770
and which drops them off around here and
 

253
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,080
and which drops them off around here and
that's a does two things it pushes them

254
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,090
that's a does two things it pushes them
 

255
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:10,780
that's a does two things it pushes them
against this wall again and like in case

256
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:10,790
against this wall again and like in case
 

257
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,630
against this wall again and like in case
that cases skeleton is is stuck here and

258
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:13,640
that cases skeleton is is stuck here and
 

259
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,270
that cases skeleton is is stuck here and
a creeper bumps against them the creeper

260
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,280
a creeper bumps against them the creeper
 

261
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,260
a creeper bumps against them the creeper
gets bumped to this this wall here a by

262
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,270
gets bumped to this this wall here a by
 

263
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,390
gets bumped to this this wall here a by
the time he gets here we won't be able

264
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,400
the time he gets here we won't be able
 

265
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,390
the time he gets here we won't be able
to make it to this water screen in time

266
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:25,400
to make it to this water screen in time
 

267
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,490
to make it to this water screen in time
they'll start circling but you'll fall

268
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:27,500
they'll start circling but you'll fall
 

269
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:38,580
they'll start circling but you'll fall
down the hole and yeah so pretty cool

270
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:38,590
down the hole and yeah so pretty cool
 

271
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:46,780
down the hole and yeah so pretty cool
try building yourself if you're too

272
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:46,790
try building yourself if you're too
 

273
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,820
try building yourself if you're too
close to this glass block the zombies

274
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:48,830
close to this glass block the zombies
 

275
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,790
close to this glass block the zombies
will be able to to hit you unfortunately

276
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
will be able to to hit you unfortunately
 

277
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,350
will be able to to hit you unfortunately
because it seems to work better if

278
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,360
because it seems to work better if
 

279
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,030
because it seems to work better if
you're closer but it works well with the

280
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
you're closer but it works well with the
 

281
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,880
you're closer but it works well with the
spacing with the ladders do and yeah so

282
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:06,890
spacing with the ladders do and yeah so
 

283
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,690
spacing with the ladders do and yeah so
that's the mostly automatic mobs order

284
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:10,700
that's the mostly automatic mobs order
 

285
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,390
that's the mostly automatic mobs order
it's not fully automatic because you

286
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:13,400
it's not fully automatic because you
 

287
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,270
it's not fully automatic because you
need to be there to make it work and

288
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,280
need to be there to make it work and
 

289
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,780
need to be there to make it work and
it's not perfect one other thing I

290
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:22,790
it's not perfect one other thing I
 

291
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,030
it's not perfect one other thing I
noticed I at first I tried building it

292
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
noticed I at first I tried building it
 

293
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,370
noticed I at first I tried building it
onto this door so that it would spread

294
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:30,380
onto this door so that it would spread
 

295
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,810
onto this door so that it would spread
out this way and the mobs behave

296
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:34,820
out this way and the mobs behave
 

297
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:41,350
out this way and the mobs behave
differently so the Sun is setting over

298
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
differently so the Sun is setting over
 

299
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,980
differently so the Sun is setting over
here that's West that's East

300
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:47,990
here that's West that's East
 

301
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:54,470
here that's West that's East
so you want the thing to run

302
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480

 

303
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,329

I can't do the directions right now you

304
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:57,339
I can't do the directions right now you
 

305
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:59,850
I can't do the directions right now you
don't want it running west west to east

306
00:12:59,850 --> 00:12:59,860
don't want it running west west to east
 

307
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,900
don't want it running west west to east
that's for sure

308
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:00,910
that's for sure
 

309
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:08,939
that's for sure
because when the mobs get to let's go

310
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:08,949
because when the mobs get to let's go
 

311
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:18,030
because when the mobs get to let's go
back in here if you run out west the

312
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,040
back in here if you run out west the
 

313
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,179
back in here if you run out west the
East when the mobs get here instead of

314
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:21,189
East when the mobs get here instead of
 

315
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:24,780
East when the mobs get here instead of
charging at you they're gonna freeze for

316
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:24,790
charging at you they're gonna freeze for
 

317
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,389
charging at you they're gonna freeze for
some reason they freeze when they see

318
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:27,399
some reason they freeze when they see
 

319
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,889
some reason they freeze when they see
you and they don't move

320
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:30,899

 

321
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,850

for some reason they behave differently

322
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:32,860
for some reason they behave differently
 

323
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,519
for some reason they behave differently
I don't know why so this is running and

324
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:38,529
I don't know why so this is running and
 

325
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,189
I don't know why so this is running and
I think either north to south or south

326
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
I think either north to south or south
 

327
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:50,309
I think either north to south or south
