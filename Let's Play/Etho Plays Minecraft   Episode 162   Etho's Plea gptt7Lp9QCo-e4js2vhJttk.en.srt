doesn't seem
 

171
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,869
doesn't seem
overly practical with this because it's

172
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
overly practical with this because it's
 

173
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,869
overly practical with this because it's
an expanding mine

174
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
an expanding mine
 

175
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,390
an expanding mine
and could cause problems so i need all

176
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
and could cause problems so i need all
 

177
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,190
and could cause problems so i need all
the carts

178
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
the carts
 

179
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,789
the carts
to be able to make it back to this main

180
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
to be able to make it back to this main
 

181
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,830
to be able to make it back to this main
hub on their own so

182
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
hub on their own so
 

183
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,030
hub on their own so
if we do a cross thing like this

184
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
if we do a cross thing like this
 

185
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,550
if we do a cross thing like this
it goes that way unfortunately so we

186
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
it goes that way unfortunately so we
 

187
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,630
it goes that way unfortunately so we
can't use that trick

188
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
can't use that trick
 

189
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,990
can't use that trick
um so what i would like to do or i think

190
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
um so what i would like to do or i think
 

191
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,190
um so what i would like to do or i think
what will work

192
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
what will work
 

193
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,869
what will work
is if we get rid of that

194
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
is if we get rid of that
 

195
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,789
is if we get rid of that
and do

196
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799

 

197
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,830

no got to do it like

198
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
no got to do it like
 

199
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,589
no got to do it like
this we'll make a cross

200
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
this we'll make a cross
 

201
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,869
this we'll make a cross
type thing and

202
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
type thing and
 

203
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,509
type thing and
get rid of that that and that

204
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
get rid of that that and that
 

205
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,189
get rid of that that and that
so that we can form

206
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199

 

207
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,430

like a little loop here

208
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440

 

209
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,270

but we don't want it to connect back

210
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
but we don't want it to connect back
 

211
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,469
but we don't want it to connect back
together we want it to go

212
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
together we want it to go
 

213
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:38,230
together we want it to go
this way

214
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240

 

215
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,550

how do we do that keep doing the same

216
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
how do we do that keep doing the same
 

217
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,749
how do we do that keep doing the same
thing over and over

218
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
thing over and over
 

219
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,469
thing over and over
um yeah i don't mess around with

220
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
um yeah i don't mess around with
 

221
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,670
um yeah i don't mess around with
minecraft stuff

222
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
minecraft stuff
 

223
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,270
minecraft stuff
all that much

224
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280

 

225
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,550

there we go i think that's what i want

226
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
there we go i think that's what i want
 

227
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,469
there we go i think that's what i want
so then these will just go like this

228
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479

 

229
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,469

and the card is going this way it will

230
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
and the card is going this way it will
 

231
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,510
and the card is going this way it will
do

232
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
do
 

233
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,870
do
that if it's going from this way

234
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
that if it's going from this way
 

235
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,150
that if it's going from this way
back it will do that and

236
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160

 

237
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,110

if it's going from this way

238
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120

 

239
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,029

it will darn it oh we were so close

240
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:27,039

 

241
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,629

hmm does it work if i

242
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
hmm does it work if i
 

243
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,590
hmm does it work if i
switch it it probably probably would my

244
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
switch it it probably probably would my
 

245
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,390
switch it it probably probably would my
mouse is acting up again i am so sad

246
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
mouse is acting up again i am so sad
 

247
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,189
mouse is acting up again i am so sad
i might need to get a new one again soon

248
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
i might need to get a new one again soon
 

249
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,870
i might need to get a new one again soon
oh that totally

250
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
oh that totally
 

251
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,710
oh that totally
was bad oops

252
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
was bad oops
 

253
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,870
was bad oops
um okay i'll redo this one sec

254
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
um okay i'll redo this one sec
 

255
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,629
um okay i'll redo this one sec
i guess having it switch doesn't work

256
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
i guess having it switch doesn't work
 

257
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,310
i guess having it switch doesn't work
either it was like this before

258
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
either it was like this before
 

259
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,990
either it was like this before
now we have it like this

260
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000

 

261
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,110

just keeps going around and around on

262
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
just keeps going around and around on
 

263
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,830
just keeps going around and around on
that one

264
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840

 

265
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,430

same with that one but i believe this

266
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
same with that one but i believe this
 

267
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,710
same with that one but i believe this
one goes

268
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
one goes
 

269
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,110
one goes
yeah so i have to do something else

270
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120

 

271
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,909

so i've been uh i've been messing with

272
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
so i've been uh i've been messing with
 

273
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,309
so i've been uh i've been messing with
this

274
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
this
 

275
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,430
this
and it's turns out to be very difficult

276
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
and it's turns out to be very difficult
 

277
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,110
and it's turns out to be very difficult
very challenging

278
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
very challenging
 

279
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,189
very challenging
i am not having much success here i

280
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
i am not having much success here i
 

281
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,350
i am not having much success here i
thought this idea might work

282
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
thought this idea might work
 

283
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,950
thought this idea might work
just do a standard cross like this

284
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
just do a standard cross like this
 

285
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,990
just do a standard cross like this
obviously if it goes this way it goes to

286
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
obviously if it goes this way it goes to
 

287
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,309
obviously if it goes this way it goes to
the main hub like we want

288
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
the main hub like we want
 

289
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,990
the main hub like we want
then this detector rail would cause it

290
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
then this detector rail would cause it
 

291
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,909
then this detector rail would cause it
to switch so

292
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
to switch so
 

293
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,790
to switch so
instead of going straight that way this

294
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
instead of going straight that way this
 

295
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,590
instead of going straight that way this
will switch

296
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
will switch
 

297
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,590
will switch
pointing it to the main hub like we want

298
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
pointing it to the main hub like we want
 

299
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,469
pointing it to the main hub like we want
and you would think it coming from this

300
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
and you would think it coming from this
 

301
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,270
and you would think it coming from this
direction would go straight as well

302
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
direction would go straight as well
 

303
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,029
direction would go straight as well
should right it does

304
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
should right it does
 

305
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,790
should right it does
the problem is now we have a four right

306
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
the problem is now we have a four right
 

307
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,309
the problem is now we have a four right
cross here

308
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
cross here
 

309
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,790
cross here
and this detector rail does absolutely

310
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
and this detector rail does absolutely
 

311
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,710
and this detector rail does absolutely
nothing

312
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
nothing
 

313
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,110
nothing
it doesn't matter if you power this uh

314
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
it doesn't matter if you power this uh
 

315
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,469
it doesn't matter if you power this uh
it won't switch

316
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
it won't switch
 

317
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,589
it won't switch
once you add that this piece here

318
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
once you add that this piece here
 

319
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,629
once you add that this piece here
so this idea is not working either

320
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
so this idea is not working either
 

321
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,629
so this idea is not working either
and i tried it with a detector rail or

322
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
and i tried it with a detector rail or
 

323
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,670
and i tried it with a detector rail or
something besides

324
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
something besides
 

325
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,830
something besides
your standard rail hoping it might be

326
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
your standard rail hoping it might be
 

327
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,909
your standard rail hoping it might be
different but no

328
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919

 

329
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,230

so yeah i'm trying to do this without

330
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
so yeah i'm trying to do this without
 

331
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,150
so yeah i'm trying to do this without
making a big mess of the track

332
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
making a big mess of the track
 

333
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,430
making a big mess of the track
and without having any raises or drops

334
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
and without having any raises or drops
 

335
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,270
and without having any raises or drops
in it

336
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
in it
 

337
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,510
in it
i wanted to keep it pretty clean if

338
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
i wanted to keep it pretty clean if
 

339
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,510
i wanted to keep it pretty clean if
possible but i'm not

340
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
possible but i'm not
 

341
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,749
possible but i'm not
doing too well here

342
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759

 

343
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,350

all right i finally found a method that

344
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
all right i finally found a method that
 

345
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,430
all right i finally found a method that
works here i went back to using that old

346
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
works here i went back to using that old
 

347
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,629
works here i went back to using that old
ring style

348
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
ring style
 

349
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,510
ring style
but i also stuck in a detector rail and

350
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
but i also stuck in a detector rail and
 

351
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,189
but i also stuck in a detector rail and
just the power rail here to keep it

352
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
just the power rail here to keep it
 

353
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,550
just the power rail here to keep it
going in case it gets

354
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
going in case it gets
 

355
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,670
going in case it gets
stuck going around and around

356
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
stuck going around and around
 

357
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,909
stuck going around and around
and it works so this way

358
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919

 

359
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,909

it's all good um this way

360
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919

 

361
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,950

good now come back

362
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
good now come back
 

363
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,469
good now come back
and this way

364
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479

 

365
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,990

is also good so that does what we wanted

366
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
is also good so that does what we wanted
 

367
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,629
is also good so that does what we wanted
to do

368
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
to do
 

369
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,150
to do
i had to do a little bit of wiring

370
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
i had to do a little bit of wiring
 

371
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,390
i had to do a little bit of wiring
underground here though

372
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
underground here though
 

373
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,950
underground here though
right below the detector rail is over

374
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
right below the detector rail is over
 

375
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,909
right below the detector rail is over
here

376
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
here
 

377
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:38,149
here
goes to the torch and then powers

378
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159

 

379
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,350

oh right

380
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
oh right
 

381
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,829
oh right
oops it's like that didn't make any

382
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
oops it's like that didn't make any
 

383
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,870
oops it's like that didn't make any
sense

384
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
sense
 

385
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,230
sense
there's a torch hidden behind there

386
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
there's a torch hidden behind there
 

387
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,070
there's a torch hidden behind there
which goes to

388
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
which goes to
 

389
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,110
which goes to
the junction

390
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120

 

391
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,310

all right and this uh this torch here is

392
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
all right and this uh this torch here is
 

393
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,790
all right and this uh this torch here is
just

394
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
just
 

395
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,710
just
to power this so i had to be careful not

396
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
to power this so i had to be careful not
 

397
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,630
to power this so i had to be careful not
to send any power below or have any

398
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
to send any power below or have any
 

399
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,470
to send any power below or have any
torches below this

400
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
torches below this
 

401
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,949
torches below this
this one here because that would cause

402
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
this one here because that would cause
 

403
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,430
this one here because that would cause
it to join with this track here

404
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
it to join with this track here
 

405
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,949
it to join with this track here
which we don't want um and i also tried

406
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
which we don't want um and i also tried
 

407
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,790
which we don't want um and i also tried
with the power rail to see it going max

408
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
with the power rail to see it going max
 

409
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,310
with the power rail to see it going max
speed when it enters this

410
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
speed when it enters this
 

411
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,389
speed when it enters this
intersection see if it goes the right

412
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
intersection see if it goes the right
 

413
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,389
intersection see if it goes the right
way or if it gets stuck going

414
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
way or if it gets stuck going
 

415
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,550
way or if it gets stuck going
in an infinite loop or something and it

416
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
in an infinite loop or something and it
 

417
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,630
in an infinite loop or something and it
seems to be fine

418
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640

 

419
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,670

it'll go around a few times sometimes

420
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
it'll go around a few times sometimes
 

421
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,070
it'll go around a few times sometimes
that's the most i've ever seen it do it

422
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
that's the most i've ever seen it do it
 

423
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,710
that's the most i've ever seen it do it
usually it's one or two times

424
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
usually it's one or two times
 

425
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,550
usually it's one or two times
from that way other ways don't seem to

426
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
from that way other ways don't seem to
 

427
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,790
from that way other ways don't seem to
have as much trouble

428
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
have as much trouble
 

429
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,430
have as much trouble
so good got it figured out

430
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440

 

431
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,110

and i forgot to mention but this does

432
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
and i forgot to mention but this does
 

433
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,949
and i forgot to mention but this does
work if i'm riding the carts

434
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
work if i'm riding the carts
 

435
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,829
work if i'm riding the carts
not just with empty carts which is

436
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
not just with empty carts which is
 

437
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,310
not just with empty carts which is
important

438
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320

 

439
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,949

because this will be for me getting back

440
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
because this will be for me getting back
 

441
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,230
because this will be for me getting back
to

442
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
to
 

443
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,389
to
the main hub here

444
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399

 

445
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,550

that way works this way has the most

446
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
that way works this way has the most
 

447
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,590
that way works this way has the most
trouble

448
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
trouble
 

449
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,790
trouble
but usually it's not bad sometimes you

450
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
but usually it's not bad sometimes you
 

451
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,389
but usually it's not bad sometimes you
get stuck going around

452
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
get stuck going around
 

453
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,310
get stuck going around
the ring one or two or three times

454
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
the ring one or two or three times
 

455
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,870
the ring one or two or three times
before it lets you through

456
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
before it lets you through
 

457
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,150
before it lets you through
all right

458
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160

 

459
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,069

okay so i got a bunch of track laid down

460
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
okay so i got a bunch of track laid down
 

461
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,430
okay so i got a bunch of track laid down
here we're gonna go for ride

462
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
here we're gonna go for ride
 

463
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,590
here we're gonna go for ride
um and i wasn't really planning to spend

464
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
um and i wasn't really planning to spend
 

465
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,110
um and i wasn't really planning to spend
a lot of time at the branch mine today

466
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
a lot of time at the branch mine today
 

467
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,870
a lot of time at the branch mine today
it just kind of happened so sorry about

468
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
it just kind of happened so sorry about
 

469
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,509
it just kind of happened so sorry about
that

470
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
that
 

471
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,069
that
hopefully you still found it

472
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
hopefully you still found it
 

473
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,269
hopefully you still found it
entertaining

474
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
entertaining
 

475
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,150
entertaining
um i really enjoy this project i don't

476
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
um i really enjoy this project i don't
 

477
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,870
um i really enjoy this project i don't
know why

478
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
know why
 

479
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,949
know why
it's i guess it's because i don't really

480
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
it's i guess it's because i don't really
 

481
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,949
it's i guess it's because i don't really
ever do anything

482
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
ever do anything
 

483
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,150
ever do anything
really repetitive in this game usually

484
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
really repetitive in this game usually
 

485
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,670
really repetitive in this game usually
and this is a really relaxing

486
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
and this is a really relaxing
 

487
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,509
and this is a really relaxing
thing to work on i guess

488
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519

 

489
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,870

and i really like the way it looks i

490
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
and i really like the way it looks i
 

491
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,750
and i really like the way it looks i
don't know

492
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760

 

493
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,190

so i got these at the intersection

494
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
so i got these at the intersection
 

495
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,190
so i got these at the intersection
it's there's a power rail right there

496
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
it's there's a power rail right there
 

497
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,310
it's there's a power rail right there
then it skips

498
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
then it skips
 

499
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,389
then it skips
every odd one and that there's six of

500
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
every odd one and that there's six of
 

501
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,269
every odd one and that there's six of
these and

502
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
these and
 

503
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,030
these and
then i have them

504
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
then i have them
 

505
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,350
then i have them
uh over here so normally they're eight

506
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
uh over here so normally they're eight
 

507
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,710
uh over here so normally they're eight
blocks apart

508
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
blocks apart
 

509
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,069
blocks apart
here they're six blocks just the way

510
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
here they're six blocks just the way
 

511
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,470
here they're six blocks just the way
this works out and then it goes back to

512
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
this works out and then it goes back to
 

513
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,829
this works out and then it goes back to
eight

514
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
eight
 

515
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,910
eight
up until the next intersection
