so so interesting so weird that happens
quite often actually

474
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
quite often actually
 

475
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,420
quite often actually
I think it's a random thing that it

476
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,430
I think it's a random thing that it
 

477
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:45,550
I think it's a random thing that it
happens I thought it might be like after

478
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560
happens I thought it might be like after
 

479
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,259
happens I thought it might be like after
last time when I bought that I have the

480
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:47,269
last time when I bought that I have the
 

481
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,759
last time when I bought that I have the
ender with him I

482
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:48,769
ender with him I
 

483
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,490
ender with him I
I got like good credit in his store cuz

484
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:51,500
I got like good credit in his store cuz
 

485
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,030
I got like good credit in his store cuz
this kept happening and that that's not

486
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
this kept happening and that that's not
 

487
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,170
this kept happening and that that's not
what it is though because I bought

488
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,180
what it is though because I bought
 

489
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,389
what it is though because I bought
another one and I I lost this trade

490
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
another one and I I lost this trade
 

491
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,689
another one and I I lost this trade
really quickly so I'm not sure you see I

492
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:04,699
really quickly so I'm not sure you see I
 

493
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,670
really quickly so I'm not sure you see I
wasn't able to trade too much there so

494
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:06,680
wasn't able to trade too much there so
 

495
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,199
wasn't able to trade too much there so
it seems like there's a lot of random

496
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:08,209
it seems like there's a lot of random
 

497
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:13,810
it seems like there's a lot of random
randomness to it let's see it refreshes

498
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:13,820
randomness to it let's see it refreshes
 

499
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,189
randomness to it let's see it refreshes
again this time it seems like I'm able

500
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:18,199
again this time it seems like I'm able
 

501
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,990
again this time it seems like I'm able
to get lots of emeralds off of them for

502
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
to get lots of emeralds off of them for
 

503
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,629
to get lots of emeralds off of them for
it again and it refreshed so I think has

504
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:25,639
it again and it refreshed so I think has
 

505
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,960
it again and it refreshed so I think has
a certain percent chance of it

506
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:27,970
a certain percent chance of it
 

507
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,400
a certain percent chance of it
refreshing afterwards and also there's a

508
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,410
refreshing afterwards and also there's a
 

509
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,530
refreshing afterwards and also there's a
certain chance to it that or how many

510
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:35,540
certain chance to it that or how many
 

511
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,970
certain chance to it that or how many
times you can do the trade before it

512
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:36,980
times you can do the trade before it
 

513
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,310
times you can do the trade before it
cancels out still I think it was that

514
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:39,320
cancels out still I think it was that
 

515
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:54,130
cancels out still I think it was that
way before oh man so while I was

516
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,140
way before oh man so while I was

zombie flesh we had up here plus like
 

603
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,940
zombie flesh we had up here plus like
another double chest and then another

604
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:06,950
another double chest and then another

addition to what we had here went from

608
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:14,340
addition to what we had here went from
 

609
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,500
addition to what we had here went from
levels 31 to 51 or something like that

610
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,510
levels 31 to 51 or something like that
 

611
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,899
levels 31 to 51 or something like that
I believe so got quite a bit of

612
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:20,909
I believe so got quite a bit of
 

613
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:25,490
I believe so got quite a bit of
experience points and trading itself the

614
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:25,500
experience points and trading itself the
 

615
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,220
experience points and trading itself the
way it seems to work now

616
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,230

 

617
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,950

oh my goodness so every time you trade

618
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
oh my goodness so every time you trade
 

619
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,690
oh my goodness so every time you trade
there's a chance to trade with it

620
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:38,700
there's a chance to trade with it
 

621
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,379
there's a chance to trade with it
cancelled right every time you do a

622
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:42,389
cancelled right every time you do a
 

623
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,419
cancelled right every time you do a
trade there's a chance it will renew the

624
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:44,429
trade there's a chance it will renew the
 

625
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,389
trade there's a chance it will renew the
trades like all the trades so that's why

626
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:47,399
trades like all the trades so that's why
 

627
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:50,769
trades like all the trades so that's why
sometimes when I trade zombie flesh and

628
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:50,779
sometimes when I trade zombie flesh and
 

629
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,720
sometimes when I trade zombie flesh and
it gets cancelled and I leave the menu

630
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:53,730
it gets cancelled and I leave the menu
 

631
00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:03,019
it gets cancelled and I leave the menu
it will renew itself no no I don't want

632
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:03,029
it will renew itself no no I don't want
 

633
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,769
it will renew itself no no I don't want
that

634
