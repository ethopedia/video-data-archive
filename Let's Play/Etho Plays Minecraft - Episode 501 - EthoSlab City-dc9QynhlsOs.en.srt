thought about it for a little bit here
 

51
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,200
thought about it for a little bit here
pondered it and what I decided is we

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,210
pondered it and what I decided is we
 

53
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,140

00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:37,619
maybe we can start doing some snapshots
 

63
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,440
maybe we can start doing some snapshots
with it but no it is not ready

64
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:41,450

it's the water update the water is gonna

76
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
it's the water update the water is gonna
 

77
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,130
it's the water update the water is gonna
be all glitched outs and it is a little

78
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,140
be all glitched outs and it is a little
 

79
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,800
be all glitched outs and it is a little
bit but especially it's just random

80
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:00,810
bit but especially it's just random
 

81
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,899
bit but especially it's just random
stuff not working like hoppers weren't

82
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:02,909
stuff not working like hoppers weren't
 

83
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,940
stuff not working like hoppers weren't
working and like just just a lot of

84
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:07,950
working and like just just a lot of
 

85
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,609
working and like just just a lot of
weird stuff I was broken that I tried

86
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:10,619
weird stuff I was broken that I tried
 

87
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,380
weird stuff I was broken that I tried
out so we're gonna have to wait with

88
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,390
out so we're gonna have to wait with
 

89
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,000
out so we're gonna have to wait with
that but the

90
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,010
that but the
 

91
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,509
that but the
and is to get into base building in the

92
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:17,519
and is to get into base building in the
 

93
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,220
and is to get into base building in the
next few episodes here we spent a lot of

94
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,230
next few episodes here we spent a lot of
 

95
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,259
next few episodes here we spent a lot of
time finishing up some old projects and

96
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:21,269
time finishing up some old projects and
 

97
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,270
time finishing up some old projects and
I think we're ready to start some new

98
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
I think we're ready to start some new
 

99
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,479
I think we're ready to start some new
stuff now and maybe I'll just clarify

100
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:26,489
stuff now and maybe I'll just clarify
 

101
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,220
stuff now and maybe I'll just clarify
what I mean by base building - like when

102
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,230
what I mean by base building - like when
 

103
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,660
what I mean by base building - like when
I say base building I don't mean

104
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,670
I say base building I don't mean
 

105
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,030
I say base building I don't mean
something like sandy city there that's

106
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
something like sandy city there that's
 

107
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,740
something like sandy city there that's
more of a decorative build I don't

108
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,750
more of a decorative build I don't
 

109
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,289
more of a decorative build I don't
really consider it a base and I thought

110
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,299
really consider it a base and I thought
 

111
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,580
really consider it a base and I thought
about this today like even something

112
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:37,590
about this today like even something
 

113
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,259
about this today like even something
like the amplified base even though we

114
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:39,269
like the amplified base even though we
 

115
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,110
like the amplified base even though we
call it that it's not really a base

116
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,120
call it that it's not really a base
 

117
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,960
call it that it's not really a base
either it's mostly decorative and we

118
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:44,970
either it's mostly decorative and we
 

119
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,759
either it's mostly decorative and we
have a few contraptions there but not

120
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:46,769
have a few contraptions there but not
 

121
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,270
have a few contraptions there but not
enough so when I say base building I

122
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,280
enough so when I say base building I
 

123
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,099
enough so when I say base building I
mean let's actually make a base like a

124
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:52,109
mean let's actually make a base like a
 

125
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:55,400
mean let's actually make a base like a
standalone base because like when I work

126
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,410
standalone base because like when I work
 

127
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,170
standalone base because like when I work
at the amplified base I have to run back

128
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,180
at the amplified base I have to run back
 

129
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,349
at the amplified base I have to run back
and forth to the man cave and there to

130
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:00,359
and forth to the man cave and there to
 

131
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,410
and forth to the man cave and there to
pick up resources and and stuff we want

132
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:03,420
pick up resources and and stuff we want
 

133
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,270
pick up resources and and stuff we want
to have all the farms all the

134
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
to have all the farms all the
 

135
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,860
to have all the farms all the
contraptions and stuff in our new base

136
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:06,870
contraptions and stuff in our new base
 

137
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,380
contraptions and stuff in our new base
so that we can just stay there if we

138
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,390
so that we can just stay there if we
 

139
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,110
so that we can just stay there if we
choose to which is not something we've

140
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,120
choose to which is not something we've
 

141
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,140
choose to which is not something we've
done in the world here before this is

142
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,150
done in the world here before this is
 

143
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,930
done in the world here before this is
our only real base in the world so

144
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:17,940
our only real base in the world so
 

145
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,789
our only real base in the world so
that's what I mean by base building and

146
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:19,799
that's what I mean by base building and
 

147
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,920
that's what I mean by base building and
we're gonna start a water like an

148
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:21,930
we're gonna start a water like an
 

149
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,170
we're gonna start a water like an
underwater base once that update comes

150
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:24,180
underwater base once that update comes
 

151
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,210
underwater base once that update comes
out but before that since it'll probably

152
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,220
out but before that since it'll probably
 

153
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,400
out but before that since it'll probably
be a couple months or so we're gonna

154
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,410
be a couple months or so we're gonna
 

155
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,860
be a couple months or so we're gonna
start a new base today with another one

156
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:30,870
start a new base today with another one
 

157
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,099
start a new base today with another one
of my ideas here all right guys very

158
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:34,109
of my ideas here all right guys very
 

159
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:35,509
of my ideas here all right guys very
good very good so I just spent some time

160
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
good very good so I just spent some time
 

161
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,640
good very good so I just spent some time
here gathering together some materials

162
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:37,650
here gathering together some materials
 

163
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,330
here gathering together some materials
for our base building and figured out

164
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,340
for our base building and figured out
 

165
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,159
for our base building and figured out
the location and I think we're good to

166
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,169
the location and I think we're good to
 

167
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,530
the location and I think we're good to
go now before we take off though I do

168
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:45,540
go now before we take off though I do
 

169
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,240
go now before we take off though I do
want to show you a couple things around

170
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,250
want to show you a couple things around
 

171
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,099
want to show you a couple things around
the worlds since the world tour I think

172
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:49,109
the worlds since the world tour I think
 

173
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,159
the worlds since the world tour I think
I spent like 10 or 15 hours just doing

174
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,169
I spent like 10 or 15 hours just doing
 

175
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,059
I spent like 10 or 15 hours just doing
random random stuff collecting resources

176
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:55,069
random random stuff collecting resources
 

177
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,710
random random stuff collecting resources
worked on the nether tunnels a bunch and

178
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,720
worked on the nether tunnels a bunch and
 

179
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,559
worked on the nether tunnels a bunch and
a couple little builds like I finished

180
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:00,569
a couple little builds like I finished
 

181
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,520
a couple little builds like I finished
up the wall here

182
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:01,530
up the wall here
 

183
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,229
up the wall here
so this is our snowy side and it's just

184
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
so this is our snowy side and it's just
 

185
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,960
so this is our snowy side and it's just
like a collection of random garbage

186
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:08,970
like a collection of random garbage
 

187
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,930
like a collection of random garbage
I guess this kind of represents the eye

188
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:11,940
I guess this kind of represents the eye
 

189
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,390
I guess this kind of represents the eye
spike biomes over here we have the mega

190
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
spike biomes over here we have the mega
 

191
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,110
spike biomes over here we have the mega
taiga you know with the mossy cobble

192
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
taiga you know with the mossy cobble
 

193
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120
taiga you know with the mossy cobble
this could be like ice Plains here maybe

194
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,130
this could be like ice Plains here maybe
 

195
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,300
this could be like ice Plains here maybe
with a big frozen lake and just regular

196
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,310
with a big frozen lake and just regular
 

197
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,490
with a big frozen lake and just regular
taiga and then like the extreme Hills

198
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:25,500
taiga and then like the extreme Hills
 

199
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,250
taiga and then like the extreme Hills
over here we

200
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,260
over here we
 

201
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,740
over here we
opening here so I had to like cover or

202
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:29,750
opening here so I had to like cover or
 

203
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,230
opening here so I had to like cover or
do something over top of it and I want

204
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
do something over top of it and I want
 

205
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,750
do something over top of it and I want
to change out the glass here with the

206
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:33,760
to change out the glass here with the
 

207
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,810
to change out the glass here with the
blue stained glass and kind of finish up

208
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:37,820
blue stained glass and kind of finish up
 

209
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,120
blue stained glass and kind of finish up
this part of it too but I didn't get

210
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,130
this part of it too but I didn't get
 

211
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,980
this part of it too but I didn't get
around to that just yet and then if we

212
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:41,990
around to that just yet and then if we
 

213
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,520
around to that just yet and then if we
go outside did one other pretty pretty

214
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,530
go outside did one other pretty pretty
 

215
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,550
go outside did one other pretty pretty
big scene here and I think we'll fly to

216
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
big scene here and I think we'll fly to
 

217
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,260
big scene here and I think we'll fly to
the new base location just so we can get

218
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,270
the new base location just so we can get
 

219
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,080
the new base location just so we can get
an idea of where it is in relation to

220
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,090
an idea of where it is in relation to
 

221
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,180
an idea of where it is in relation to
the man cave it's only like 2,000 blocks

222
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,190
the man cave it's only like 2,000 blocks
 

223
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,960
the man cave it's only like 2,000 blocks
away where we plan on building and I

224
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,970
away where we plan on building and I
 

225
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,220
away where we plan on building and I
don't know exactly what we're building

226
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,230
don't know exactly what we're building
 

227
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,630
don't know exactly what we're building
with and that kind of stuff we'll figure

228
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:01,640
with and that kind of stuff we'll figure
 

229
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,820
with and that kind of stuff we'll figure
it out here together today yeah but this

230
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:03,830
it out here together today yeah but this
 

231
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,670
it out here together today yeah but this
is the other thing I did the bottom of

232
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:06,680
is the other thing I did the bottom of
 

233
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,860
is the other thing I did the bottom of
the gold firm here was not finished for

234
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:08,870
the gold firm here was not finished for
 

235
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,390
the gold firm here was not finished for
the longest time we had random

236
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
the longest time we had random
 

237
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,270
the longest time we had random
scaffolding just sitting around forever

238
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
scaffolding just sitting around forever
 

239
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,880
scaffolding just sitting around forever
here too so I finally just was like okay

240
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:15,890
here too so I finally just was like okay
 

241
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,170
here too so I finally just was like okay
how long is this actually gonna take the

242
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,180
how long is this actually gonna take the
 

243
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,230
how long is this actually gonna take the
finish and I just I just did it here so

244
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
finish and I just I just did it here so
 

245
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,410
finish and I just I just did it here so
it's this random pattern or a simple

246
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,420
it's this random pattern or a simple
 

247
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,150
it's this random pattern or a simple
pattern I should say for the bottom hey

248
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,160
pattern I should say for the bottom hey
 

249
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,770
pattern I should say for the bottom hey
you leave us alone that's cool that's a

250
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:29,780
you leave us alone that's cool that's a
 

251
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,710
you leave us alone that's cool that's a
finish build now I'm happy about that

252
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:31,720
finish build now I'm happy about that
 

253
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,270
finish build now I'm happy about that
but we are gonna be going off I think

254
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,280
but we are gonna be going off I think
 

255
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,710
but we are gonna be going off I think
this direction actually we have nothing

256
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:37,720
this direction actually we have nothing
 

257
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,760
this direction actually we have nothing
built up this way is that the right way

258
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:39,770
built up this way is that the right way
 

259
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,730
built up this way is that the right way
we want to go to 170 and minus 1800 we

260
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:45,740
we want to go to 170 and minus 1800 we
 

261
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,200
we want to go to 170 and minus 1800 we
got nothing built up this way so this

262
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,210
got nothing built up this way so this
 

263
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,180
got nothing built up this way so this
should be interesting I never fly this

264
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,190
should be interesting I never fly this
 

265
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,060
should be interesting I never fly this
way either so we can check out some

266
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,070
way either so we can check out some
 

267
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,160
way either so we can check out some
stuff here I guess one go slightly this

268
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,170
stuff here I guess one go slightly this
 

269
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,940
stuff here I guess one go slightly this
direction to it and we'll just fly there

270
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:57,950
direction to it and we'll just fly there
 

271
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,790
direction to it and we'll just fly there
and just see what's on the way because

272
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
and just see what's on the way because
 

273
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,940
and just see what's on the way because
I'm kind of curious oh we have another

274
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:03,950
I'm kind of curious oh we have another
 

275
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,980
I'm kind of curious oh we have another
jungle here too

276
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:06,990

 

277
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,870

is this one better I want to build in

278
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
is this one better I want to build in
 

279
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,030
is this one better I want to build in
the jungle just for the green grass this

280
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,040
the jungle just for the green grass this
 

281
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,660
the jungle just for the green grass this
one's pretty big actually huh why are we

282
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:17,670
one's pretty big actually huh why are we
 

283
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,100
one's pretty big actually huh why are we
going so far away I don't know now how

284
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,110
going so far away I don't know now how
 

285
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,590
going so far away I don't know now how
did I miss this this is a huge jungle

286
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:24,600
did I miss this this is a huge jungle
 

287
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,950
did I miss this this is a huge jungle
okay interesting yeah okay so I checked

288
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
okay interesting yeah okay so I checked
 

289
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,480
okay interesting yeah okay so I checked
out the other jungle that I had in mind

290
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,490
out the other jungle that I had in mind
 

291
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,310
out the other jungle that I had in mind
I think this first one we found is

292
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,320
I think this first one we found is
 

293
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,820
I think this first one we found is
better it's bigger and also it's closer

294
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:34,830
better it's bigger and also it's closer
 

295
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,830
better it's bigger and also it's closer
to the man cave so at the very beginning

296
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:36,840
to the man cave so at the very beginning
 

297
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,090
to the man cave so at the very beginning
of Base building here we're not gonna

298
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,100
of Base building here we're not gonna
 

299
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,550
of Base building here we're not gonna
have our firm setup and I will have to

300
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
have our firm setup and I will have to
 

301
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,140
have our firm setup and I will have to
run back and forth so having it closer

302
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,150
run back and forth so having it closer
 

303
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,870
run back and forth so having it closer
is gonna be more convenient for me but

304
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
is gonna be more convenient for me but
 

305
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,610
is gonna be more convenient for me but
here's here comes the big reveal guys I

306
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:46,620
here's here comes the big reveal guys I
 

307
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,040
here's here comes the big reveal guys I
just spent the last half an hour to an

308
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,050
just spent the last half an hour to an
 

309
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,530
just spent the last half an hour to an
hour chopping down trees here and you

310
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:51,540
hour chopping down trees here and you
 

311
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,000
hour chopping down trees here and you
can see a lot more of the grass now

312
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,010
can see a lot more of the grass now
 

313
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,250
can see a lot more of the grass now
which is nice there's still some more

314
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,260
which is nice there's still some more
 

315
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,560
which is nice there's still some more
leaves I could get rid of and I would

316
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,570
leaves I could get rid of and I would
 

317
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,090
leaves I could get rid of and I would

out the axe I pretty much ran it right

320
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,190
out the axe I pretty much ran it right
 

321
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,800
out the axe I pretty much ran it right
down here

322
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:02,810
down here
 

323
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,290
down here
so I'll do it another time the reason

324
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,300
so I'll do it another time the reason
 

325
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,990
so I'll do it another time the reason
for that by the way if you look over

326
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,000
for that by the way if you look over
 

327
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,420
for that by the way if you look over
here if you just look at a raw untouched

328
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,430
here if you just look at a raw untouched
 

329
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,090
here if you just look at a raw untouched
jungle it's really hard for your eyes to

330
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,100
jungle it's really hard for your eyes to
 

331
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,010
jungle it's really hard for your eyes to
focus on anything it's just a bunch of

332
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,020
focus on anything it's just a bunch of
 

333
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,350
focus on anything it's just a bunch of
green leaves right well if you look over

334
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,360
green leaves right well if you look over
 

335
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,240
green leaves right well if you look over
here there's a little bit more character

336
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,250
here there's a little bit more character
 

337
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,700
here there's a little bit more character
to it it'll be even more once we build

338
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,710
to it it'll be even more once we build
 

339
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,840
to it it'll be even more once we build
something but also like this is bad for

340
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:26,850
something but also like this is bad for
 

341
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,460
something but also like this is bad for
YouTube videos it causes them to

342
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:28,470
YouTube videos it causes them to
 

343
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,910
YouTube videos it causes them to
pixelate really badly well if it's

344
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:31,920
pixelate really badly well if it's
 

345
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,180
pixelate really badly well if it's
smoother it's it's a lot easier so

346
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,190
smoother it's it's a lot easier so
 

347
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,710
smoother it's it's a lot easier so
that's why I did it

348
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
that's why I did it
 

349
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,380
that's why I did it
and I actually chopped down the trees I

350
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,390
and I actually chopped down the trees I
 

351
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,150
and I actually chopped down the trees I
didn't burn them down and this is what

352
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,160
didn't burn them down and this is what
 

353
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,880
didn't burn them down and this is what
we got at the end of things here on our

354
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:43,890
we got at the end of things here on our
 

355
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,010
we got at the end of things here on our
first run so quite a bit of logs and

356
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,020
first run so quite a bit of logs and
 

357
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,680
first run so quite a bit of logs and
stuff it's it's worth it I think a lot

358
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:48,690
stuff it's it's worth it I think a lot
 

359
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,210
stuff it's it's worth it I think a lot
of people they'll just burn it down cuz

360
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,220
of people they'll just burn it down cuz
 

361
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,040
of people they'll just burn it down cuz
it's a bit quicker to do it that way but

362
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,050
it's a bit quicker to do it that way but
 

363
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,670
it's a bit quicker to do it that way but
you don't get the materials a lot of

364
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
you don't get the materials a lot of
 

365
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,990
you don't get the materials a lot of
times when you burn down trees that

366
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,000
times when you burn down trees that
 

367
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,870
times when you burn down trees that
leaves chunks of leaves and wood in the

368
00:07:59,870 --> 00:07:59,880
leaves chunks of leaves and wood in the
 

369
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,570
leaves chunks of leaves and wood in the
air too and you've gotta climb up and

370
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:02,580
air too and you've gotta climb up and
 

371
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,970
air too and you've gotta climb up and
chop those down the only thing that

372
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:04,980
chop those down the only thing that
 

373
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,910
chop those down the only thing that
might be worth burning is this like the

374
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:07,920
might be worth burning is this like the
 

375
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,020
might be worth burning is this like the
bushes on the ground because it's

376
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,030
bushes on the ground because it's
 

377
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,610
bushes on the ground because it's
usually just one log or something it's

378
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:10,620
usually just one log or something it's
 

379
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,140
usually just one log or something it's
not really you're not gonna get a lot

380
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,150
not really you're not gonna get a lot
 

381
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,700
not really you're not gonna get a lot
out of it if you chop it down and

382
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:13,710
out of it if you chop it down and
 

383
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,710
out of it if you chop it down and
they're really annoying to get it cuz

384
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,720
they're really annoying to get it cuz
 

385
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,600
they're really annoying to get it cuz
you got to like break the leaves and

386
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:17,610
you got to like break the leaves and
 

387
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,930
you got to like break the leaves and
then you got to find the log too

388
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:20,940
then you got to find the log too
 

389
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,960
then you got to find the log too
usually pretty hidden and stuff so yeah

390
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:23,970
usually pretty hidden and stuff so yeah
 

391
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,300
usually pretty hidden and stuff so yeah
chop down the trees maybe burn the lower

392
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,310
chop down the trees maybe burn the lower
 

393
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,900
chop down the trees maybe burn the lower
stuff is what I'm trying to say here

394
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:28,910
stuff is what I'm trying to say here
 

395
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,760
stuff is what I'm trying to say here
anyways let's get to the base building I

396
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,770
anyways let's get to the base building I
 

397
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,830
anyways let's get to the base building I
think we're gonna start in this area

398
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:33,840
think we're gonna start in this area
 

399
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,529
think we're gonna start in this area
here cuz there's not a lot of water

400
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:36,539
here cuz there's not a lot of water
 

401
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,140
here cuz there's not a lot of water
nearby you see how the water changes the

402
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,150
nearby you see how the water changes the
 

403
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,690
nearby you see how the water changes the
biome and the grass color so we're

404
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:41,700
biome and the grass color so we're
 

405
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,780
biome and the grass color so we're
trying to avoid those spots if we can so

406
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:44,790
trying to avoid those spots if we can so
 

407
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,970
trying to avoid those spots if we can so
to get us started here guys we are gonna

408
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:46,980
to get us started here guys we are gonna
 

409
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,540
to get us started here guys we are gonna
press f3 and G to bring up our chunk

410
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:50,550
press f3 and G to bring up our chunk
 

411
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,170
press f3 and G to bring up our chunk
borders and I'll try to explain the idea

412
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,180
borders and I'll try to explain the idea
 

413
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,240
borders and I'll try to explain the idea
or the theme behind the space for all

414
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,250
or the theme behind the space for all
 

415
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,430
or the theme behind the space for all
the bases I build I like to have it a

416
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
the bases I build I like to have it a
 

417
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,640
the bases I build I like to have it a
theme like a building theme or general

418
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,650
theme like a building theme or general
 

419
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,240
theme like a building theme or general
set of rules we have to follow with the

420
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,250
set of rules we have to follow with the
 

421
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,400
set of rules we have to follow with the
building so we're gonna be using grass

422
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,410
building so we're gonna be using grass
 

423
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,770
building so we're gonna be using grass
and stone bricks as sort of our basic

424
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:09,780
and stone bricks as sort of our basic
 

425
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,910
and stone bricks as sort of our basic
theme materials and the rules set for

426
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
theme materials and the rules set for
 

427
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,700
theme materials and the rules set for
this base is we have to build it out of

428
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:16,710
this base is we have to build it out of
 

429
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,740
this base is we have to build it out of
slabs we're gonna call this slab City

430
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:18,750
slabs we're gonna call this slab City
 

431
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,550
slabs we're gonna call this slab City
and the slabs are gonna be 8 by 8 by 4

432
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
and the slabs are gonna be 8 by 8 by 4
 

433
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,520
and the slabs are gonna be 8 by 8 by 4
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this is the size of

434
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:28,530
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this is the size of
 

435
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:34,070
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this is the size of
one of our slabs went too far ok and

436
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
one of our slabs went too far ok and
 

437
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,000
one of our slabs went too far ok and
then 1 2 3 4 and we will have to play

438
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,010
then 1 2 3 4 and we will have to play
 

439
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,340
then 1 2 3 4 and we will have to play
around with this lot to like figure out

440
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:40,350
around with this lot to like figure out
 

441
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,960
around with this lot to like figure out
what actually is gonna look good and how

442
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:41,970
what actually is gonna look good and how
 

443
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,880
what actually is gonna look good and how
we're gonna do it here and that's sort

444
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:43,890
we're gonna do it here and that's sort
 

445
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,830
we're gonna do it here and that's sort
of the goal of today just to get an idea

446
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:45,840
of the goal of today just to get an idea
 

447
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,530
of the goal of today just to get an idea
of how to make this theme work this base

448
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,540
of how to make this theme work this base
 

449
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,440
of how to make this theme work this base
idea but I don't know if you guys have

450
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,450
idea but I don't know if you guys have
 

451
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,270
idea but I don't know if you guys have
ever seen like the chunky renders and

452
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:53,280
ever seen like the chunky renders and
 

453
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,620
ever seen like the chunky renders and
that on Reddit and stuff there's a 16 by

454
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:57,630
that on Reddit and stuff there's a 16 by
 

455
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,080
that on Reddit and stuff there's a 16 by
16 area while we're doing an 8 by 8 cuz

456
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,090
16 area while we're doing an 8 by 8 cuz
 

457
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,250
16 area while we're doing an 8 by 8 cuz
I think that'll be a little bit easier

458
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,260
I think that'll be a little bit easier
 

459
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,040
I think that'll be a little bit easier
for a survival minecraft to make a

460
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,050
for a survival minecraft to make a
 

461
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,430
for a survival minecraft to make a
make-work for us and like to build the

462
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
make-work for us and like to build the
 

463
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,000
make-work for us and like to build the
base all the crane is gonna be these

464
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,010
base all the crane is gonna be these
 

465
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,430
base all the crane is gonna be these
slabs so the next one if we want to put

466
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
slabs so the next one if we want to put
 

467
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
slabs so the next one if we want to put
one next to it is gonna go over here and

468
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,170
one next to it is gonna go over here and
 

469
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,620
one next to it is gonna go over here and
it's gonna follow the same 8 by 8 feet

470
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:18,630
it's gonna follow the same 8 by 8 feet
 

471
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,960
it's gonna follow the same 8 by 8 feet
and if we do buildings we're gonna want

472
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:20,970
and if we do buildings we're gonna want
 

473
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,720
and if we do buildings we're gonna want
to try align them either in an 8 by 8 or

474
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:23,730
to try align them either in an 8 by 8 or
 

475
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,630
to try align them either in an 8 by 8 or
8 by 16 area and try to make everything

476
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
8 by 16 area and try to make everything
 

477
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,630
8 by 16 area and try to make everything
look kind of square and chunky with the

478
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:29,640
look kind of square and chunky with the
 

479
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,190
look kind of square and chunky with the
build is the plan anyways awesome okay

480
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,200
build is the plan anyways awesome okay
 

481
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,850
build is the plan anyways awesome okay
so let's use

482
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:34,860
so let's use
 

483
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,310
so let's use
this starting example here we're gonna

484
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,320
this starting example here we're gonna
 

485
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,260
this starting example here we're gonna
build an intersection to begin with

486
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,270
build an intersection to begin with
 

487
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,510
build an intersection to begin with
and we'll use this to figure out what

488
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:41,520
and we'll use this to figure out what
 

489
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,550
and we'll use this to figure out what
rules we're gonna follow with the build

490
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,560
rules we're gonna follow with the build
 

491
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,240
rules we're gonna follow with the build
here so for one thing I think like these

492
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,250
here so for one thing I think like these
 

493
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,890
here so for one thing I think like these
four slabs are kind of connected

494
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:48,900
four slabs are kind of connected
 

495
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,120
four slabs are kind of connected
together right they're all at the same

496
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,130
together right they're all at the same
 

497
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,070
together right they're all at the same
height and everything I think when we do

498
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,080
height and everything I think when we do
 

499
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,420
height and everything I think when we do
that we're gonna remove the borders

500
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:53,430
that we're gonna remove the borders
 

501
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,460
that we're gonna remove the borders
between the tiles that are connected

502
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,470
between the tiles that are connected
 

503
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,150
between the tiles that are connected
together so we'll get rid of that bridge

504
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,160
together so we'll get rid of that bridge
 

505
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,590
together so we'll get rid of that bridge
the gap here with grass or whatever

506
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:00,600
the gap here with grass or whatever
 

507
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,070
the gap here with grass or whatever
material we're using and the key to

508
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,080
material we're using and the key to
 

509
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,770
material we're using and the key to
making basis interesting usually is to

510
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:06,780
making basis interesting usually is to
 

511
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,830
making basis interesting usually is to
have a lot of variation with like the

512
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:09,840
have a lot of variation with like the
 

513
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,750
have a lot of variation with like the
flatness and and stuff you don't want

514
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
flatness and and stuff you don't want
 

515
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,450
flatness and and stuff you don't want
things to be flat but that's sort of the

516
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,460
things to be flat but that's sort of the
 

517
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,300
things to be flat but that's sort of the
defining quality of this base I feel

518
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,310
defining quality of this base I feel
 

519
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,640
defining quality of this base I feel
like we want it to look chunky but in

520
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:19,650
like we want it to look chunky but in
 

521
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,650
like we want it to look chunky but in
order to like even though it's gonna be

522
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:21,660
order to like even though it's gonna be
 

523
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,110
order to like even though it's gonna be
flat to make it not look flat if that

524
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,120
flat to make it not look flat if that
 

525
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,650
flat to make it not look flat if that
makes sense

526
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:24,660
makes sense
 

527
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,480
makes sense
is we're gonna want to still have height

528
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:29,490
is we're gonna want to still have height
 

529
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,160
is we're gonna want to still have height
variations and stuff but the rule I

530
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,170
variations and stuff but the rule I
 

531
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,220
variations and stuff but the rule I
think will be like let's say we want to

532
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,230
think will be like let's say we want to
 

533
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,210
think will be like let's say we want to
put a staircase to go up here right and

534
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:38,220
put a staircase to go up here right and
 

535
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,650
put a staircase to go up here right and
we'll start a new slab next to this one

536
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:41,660
we'll start a new slab next to this one
 

537
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,210
we'll start a new slab next to this one
what I don't think we'll do is like we

538
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,220
what I don't think we'll do is like we
 

539
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,530
what I don't think we'll do is like we
don't want to like make a hill or

540
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,540
don't want to like make a hill or
 

541
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,210
don't want to like make a hill or
something like the okay just start out

542
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,220
something like the okay just start out
 

543
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,920
something like the okay just start out
one blocks and two blocks and then three

544
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:48,930
one blocks and two blocks and then three
 

545
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,840
one blocks and two blocks and then three
blocks but I think what we're gonna have

546
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:50,850
blocks but I think what we're gonna have
 

547
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,150
blocks but I think what we're gonna have
to do is follow the rule so every slab

548
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
to do is follow the rule so every slab
 

549
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,010
to do is follow the rule so every slab
is eight by eight by four so we'll go up

550
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,020
is eight by eight by four so we'll go up
 

551
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,580
is eight by eight by four so we'll go up
four blocks straight up here and we'll

552
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:01,590
four blocks straight up here and we'll
 

553
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,490
four blocks straight up here and we'll
use stone brick as our border in general

554
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:04,500
use stone brick as our border in general
 

555
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:12,230
use stone brick as our border in general
here and there and then any like in

556
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
here and there and then any like in
 

557
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,140
here and there and then any like in
between material that we fill in we want

558
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,150
between material that we fill in we want
 

559
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,540
between material that we fill in we want
to use stone I think

560
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,550
to use stone I think
 

561
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,970
to use stone I think
and these height variations are gonna be

562
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:19,980
and these height variations are gonna be
 

563
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,680
and these height variations are gonna be
the key to making the build look the

564
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:21,690
the key to making the build look the
 

565
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,320
the key to making the build look the
interesting actually let's not put it at

566
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,330
interesting actually let's not put it at
 

567
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,780
interesting actually let's not put it at
the bottom let's let's just have it at

568
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:26,790
the bottom let's let's just have it at
 

569
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,410
the bottom let's let's just have it at
the top there yeah I think that would be

570
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,420
the top there yeah I think that would be
 

571
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,300
the top there yeah I think that would be
better so if we want to if we want to do

572
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,310
better so if we want to if we want to do
 

573
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,010
better so if we want to if we want to do
this then we would put a staircase here

574
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,020
this then we would put a staircase here
 

575
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,620
this then we would put a staircase here
and when we do staircases maybe we'll

576
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:36,630
and when we do staircases maybe we'll
 

577
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,530
and when we do staircases maybe we'll
put like two blocks in this chunk and

578
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:39,540
put like two blocks in this chunk and
 

579
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,330
put like two blocks in this chunk and
then we'll remove two here okay so check

580
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,340
then we'll remove two here okay so check
 

581
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,800
then we'll remove two here okay so check
this out I did a little bit more here

582
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:45,810
this out I did a little bit more here
 

583
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,330
this out I did a little bit more here
just to get an idea of what it might

584
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:47,340
just to get an idea of what it might
 

585
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,830
just to get an idea of what it might
look like and

586
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:48,840
look like and
 

587
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,750
look like and
this is gonna work the cool thing about

588
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:50,760
this is gonna work the cool thing about
 

589
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,810
this is gonna work the cool thing about
this base is how we connect the tiles

590
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:53,820
this base is how we connect the tiles
 

591
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,370
this base is how we connect the tiles
together right we have a lot of options

592
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:55,380
together right we have a lot of options
 

593
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,680
together right we have a lot of options
with height variations and and stuff but

594
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:57,690
with height variations and and stuff but
 

595
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,750
with height variations and and stuff but
it's gonna be easy to do because it's

596
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
it's gonna be easy to do because it's
 

597
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,630
it's gonna be easy to do because it's
like either it connects next to the tile

598
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:02,640
like either it connects next to the tile
 

599
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,790
like either it connects next to the tile
or it's gonna be down or up or whatever

600
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
or it's gonna be down or up or whatever
 

601
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,160
or it's gonna be down or up or whatever
right it's not gonna be hard for me to

602
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,170
right it's not gonna be hard for me to
 

603
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,220
right it's not gonna be hard for me to
expand the base it's gonna be simple

604
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,230
expand the base it's gonna be simple
 

605
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,260
expand the base it's gonna be simple
you guys might remember a while ago on

606
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,270
you guys might remember a while ago on
 

607
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,850
you guys might remember a while ago on
the minecraft server I tried something

608
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:13,860
the minecraft server I tried something
 

609
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,450
the minecraft server I tried something
similar I made like a hexagon house out

610
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:17,460
similar I made like a hexagon house out
 

611
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,630
similar I made like a hexagon house out
of hexagon tiles that was like I thought

612
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:20,640
of hexagon tiles that was like I thought
 

613
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,980
of hexagon tiles that was like I thought
it was kind of cool but it was hard to

614
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:21,990
it was kind of cool but it was hard to
 

615
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,380
it was kind of cool but it was hard to
build the hexagons and since stuff is

616
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,390
build the hexagons and since stuff is
 

617
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,000
build the hexagons and since stuff is
square in Minecraft it didn't really

618
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,010
square in Minecraft it didn't really
 

619
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,210
square in Minecraft it didn't really
work out super great but this is gonna

620
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,220
work out super great but this is gonna
 

621
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,470
work out super great but this is gonna
be good I think

622
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
be good I think
 

623
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,000
be good I think
I hope so we'll fill this in with grass

624
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,010
I hope so we'll fill this in with grass
 

625
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,770
I hope so we'll fill this in with grass
and you can see like when we're up here

626
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:36,780
and you can see like when we're up here
 

627
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,120
and you can see like when we're up here
and we look down it looks kind of cool

628
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,130
and we look down it looks kind of cool
 

629
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,410
and we look down it looks kind of cool
right because we got the height

630
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,420
right because we got the height
 

631
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,010
right because we got the height
variation I thought for the middle here

632
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,020
variation I thought for the middle here
 

633
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,900
variation I thought for the middle here
we would try to do a triple slab so it's

634
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:44,910
we would try to do a triple slab so it's
 

635
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,890
we would try to do a triple slab so it's
it's 12 blocks tall right and then we're

636
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:48,900
it's 12 blocks tall right and then we're
 

637
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,030
it's 12 blocks tall right and then we're
gonna have to fill this all in with

638
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,040
gonna have to fill this all in with
 

639
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,350
gonna have to fill this all in with
stone and that's gonna make it look

640
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
stone and that's gonna make it look
 

641
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,720
stone and that's gonna make it look
really plain and flat and that's one of

642
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:53,730
really plain and flat and that's one of
 

643
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,070
really plain and flat and that's one of
our challenges we're gonna have to work

644
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,080
our challenges we're gonna have to work
 

645
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,260
our challenges we're gonna have to work
out here how do we take these big flat

646
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,270
out here how do we take these big flat
 

647
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,420
out here how do we take these big flat
surfaces and make them look interesting

648
00:13:59,420 --> 00:13:59,430
surfaces and make them look interesting
 

649
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,720
surfaces and make them look interesting
right and in general I think we will be

650
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:02,730
right and in general I think we will be
 

651
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,390
right and in general I think we will be
allowed to like maybe cross over into

652
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:05,400
allowed to like maybe cross over into
 

653
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,310
allowed to like maybe cross over into
this chunk a little bit with decorations

654
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,320
this chunk a little bit with decorations
 

655
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,930
this chunk a little bit with decorations
but we shouldn't do it too much we

656
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:11,940
but we shouldn't do it too much we
 

657
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
but we shouldn't do it too much we
should try to make it look like the bulk

658
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:13,950
should try to make it look like the bulk
 

659
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,780
should try to make it look like the bulk
of the mass is in the proper slab or

660
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:17,790
of the mass is in the proper slab or
 

661
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,130
of the mass is in the proper slab or
chunk area right you know what I mean

662
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,140
chunk area right you know what I mean
 

663
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,170
chunk area right you know what I mean
yeah anyways let's sleep here oh yeah I

664
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,180
yeah anyways let's sleep here oh yeah I
 

665
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,760
yeah anyways let's sleep here oh yeah I
think I had a good idea here guys

666
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:28,770
think I had a good idea here guys
 

667
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,310
think I had a good idea here guys
there's a trick in Minecraft if you want

668
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,320
there's a trick in Minecraft if you want
 

669
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,630
there's a trick in Minecraft if you want
a flat surface to look not flat you use

670
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:35,640
a flat surface to look not flat you use
 

671
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,720
a flat surface to look not flat you use
textures that sort of devil out from

672
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:38,730
textures that sort of devil out from
 

673
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,950
textures that sort of devil out from
each other so if you look at like the

674
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:39,960
each other so if you look at like the
 

675
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,080
each other so if you look at like the
stone and the stone brick here it kind

676
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,090
stone and the stone brick here it kind
 

677
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,280
stone and the stone brick here it kind
of looks like the stone brick is

678
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,290
of looks like the stone brick is
 

679
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,500
of looks like the stone brick is
sticking out further than the stone even

680
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:45,510
sticking out further than the stone even
 

681
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,700
sticking out further than the stone even
though it's not right

682
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:46,710
though it's not right
 

683
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,650
though it's not right
so one thing we can do and this is a

684
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:51,660
so one thing we can do and this is a
 

685
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,720
so one thing we can do and this is a
trick I've seen people do that looks

686
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:53,730
trick I've seen people do that looks
 

687
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,850
trick I've seen people do that looks
really cool is you break out every

688
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:55,860
really cool is you break out every
 

689
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
really cool is you break out every
second block here and just make it cross

690
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:57,870
second block here and just make it cross
 

691
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,460
second block here and just make it cross
over like that do and that'll

692
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,470
over like that do and that'll
 

693
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,650
over like that do and that'll
that'll kind of give it some

694
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,660
that'll kind of give it some
 

695
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,119
that'll kind of give it some
characteristics and some depth here even

696
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:06,129
characteristics and some depth here even
 

697
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,470
characteristics and some depth here even
though it's still gonna be a flat wall

698
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:07,480
though it's still gonna be a flat wall
 

699
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,210
though it's still gonna be a flat wall
and look really chunky all right do that

700
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,220
and look really chunky all right do that
 

701
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,699
and look really chunky all right do that
that's and we'll take a look at that as

702
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:17,709
that's and we'll take a look at that as
 

703
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,600
that's and we'll take a look at that as
I slowly build it here okay here we go

704
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:21,610
I slowly build it here okay here we go
 

705
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,819
I slowly build it here okay here we go
this is good now if we take a step back

706
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:23,829
this is good now if we take a step back
 

707
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:27,059
this is good now if we take a step back
I think that looks a lot better already

708
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:27,069
I think that looks a lot better already
 

709
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,309
I think that looks a lot better already
right and now we can do that with other

710
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:29,319
right and now we can do that with other
 

711
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,369
right and now we can do that with other
blocks too I did bring some andesite I

712
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:32,379
blocks too I did bring some andesite I
 

713
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:36,030
blocks too I did bring some andesite I
think yes we got Han to say how do you

714
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,040
think yes we got Han to say how do you
 

715
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,519
think yes we got Han to say how do you
polish it is it just like yeah I always

716
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:38,529
polish it is it just like yeah I always
 

717
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,019
polish it is it just like yeah I always
think you have to put in the furnace for

718
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:40,029
think you have to put in the furnace for
 

719
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,910
think you have to put in the furnace for
some reason I don't know why but these

720
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
some reason I don't know why but these
 

721
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,040
some reason I don't know why but these
really stick out from stone so if we mix

722
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,050
really stick out from stone so if we mix
 

723
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,540
really stick out from stone so if we mix
some of that into and maybe some

724
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:48,550
some of that into and maybe some
 

725
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,100
some of that into and maybe some
cobblestone and stuff it's gonna look

726
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,110
cobblestone and stuff it's gonna look
 

727
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,009
cobblestone and stuff it's gonna look
pretty good I think for these big flat

728
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:53,019
pretty good I think for these big flat
 

729
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,360
pretty good I think for these big flat
spots sure we'll put one there put that

730
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,370
spots sure we'll put one there put that
 

731
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,460
spots sure we'll put one there put that
they're kind of just random pattern like

732
00:15:59,460 --> 00:15:59,470
they're kind of just random pattern like
 

733
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,850
they're kind of just random pattern like
we usually do and I don't know how about

734
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:05,860
we usually do and I don't know how about
 

735
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,540
we usually do and I don't know how about
there okay so another rule with this I

736
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,550
there okay so another rule with this I
 

737
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,129
there okay so another rule with this I
think we're gonna be allowed to go

738
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:11,139
think we're gonna be allowed to go
 

739
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:16,170
think we're gonna be allowed to go
inside slabs right so we could possibly

740
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,180
inside slabs right so we could possibly
 

741
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,660
inside slabs right so we could possibly
have a tunnel here to go inside the

742
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,670
have a tunnel here to go inside the
 

743
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,449
have a tunnel here to go inside the
solid chunk of land right and maybe

744
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:21,459
solid chunk of land right and maybe
 

745
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,800
solid chunk of land right and maybe
that's how we do our buildings like

746
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:22,810
that's how we do our buildings like
 

747
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,749
that's how we do our buildings like
instead of building something on this

748
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:24,759
instead of building something on this
 

749
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,999
instead of building something on this
big flat spot and like building a roof

750
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:27,009
big flat spot and like building a roof
 

751
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,449
big flat spot and like building a roof
and everything maybe we just dig into a

752
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:29,459
and everything maybe we just dig into a
 

753
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,009
and everything maybe we just dig into a
slab and then kind of do it like we do

754
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:32,019
slab and then kind of do it like we do
 

755
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:35,879
slab and then kind of do it like we do
with the man cave and just I had a

756
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:35,889
with the man cave and just I had a
 

757
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:38,340
with the man cave and just I had a
little bit of a brain fart there what I

758
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,350
little bit of a brain fart there what I
 

759
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,410
little bit of a brain fart there what I
meant to say is we only have to build

760
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:40,420
meant to say is we only have to build
 

761
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,269
meant to say is we only have to build
the interior of the building that way

762
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:42,279
the interior of the building that way
 

763
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,150
the interior of the building that way
while if we were to build structures on

764
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,160
while if we were to build structures on
 

765
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,799
while if we were to build structures on
like flat pieces of land like this you

766
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:46,809
like flat pieces of land like this you
 

767
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,269
like flat pieces of land like this you
have to do the inside of the building

768
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:48,279
have to do the inside of the building
 

769
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,600
have to do the inside of the building
and the outside which is a lot harder to

770
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:51,610
and the outside which is a lot harder to
 

771
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,799
and the outside which is a lot harder to
do especially if you're working at a

772
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:52,809
do especially if you're working at a
 

773
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:56,040
do especially if you're working at a
small scale so I think I like that idea

774
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,050
small scale so I think I like that idea
 

775
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,019
small scale so I think I like that idea
and it's also easier to hide redstone if

776
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:58,029
and it's also easier to hide redstone if
 

777
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,369
and it's also easier to hide redstone if
you're working with void space so yeah I

778
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:02,379
you're working with void space so yeah I
 

779
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,689
you're working with void space so yeah I
think a lot of our buildings will be

780
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:03,699
think a lot of our buildings will be
 

781
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:08,460
think a lot of our buildings will be
like that and another thing is like we

782
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:08,470
like that and another thing is like we
 

783
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,590
like that and another thing is like we
should be allowed to go inside chunks or

784
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:10,600
should be allowed to go inside chunks or
 

785
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,299
should be allowed to go inside chunks or
slabs like this but I think we can also

786
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:12,309
slabs like this but I think we can also
 

787
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,050
slabs like this but I think we can also
stack slabs within a slab

788
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,060
stack slabs within a slab
 

789
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,110
stack slabs within a slab
right not just have like like if we're

790
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
right not just have like like if we're
 

791
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,420
right not just have like like if we're
in this this slab here it's not like

792
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:21,430
in this this slab here it's not like
 

793
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,070
in this this slab here it's not like
this is the only height variation

794
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:23,080
this is the only height variation
 

795
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,230
this is the only height variation
allowed within that slab we could for

796
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,240
allowed within that slab we could for
 

797
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,520
allowed within that slab we could for
example stack one on top of this well

798
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,530
example stack one on top of this well
 

799
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,370
example stack one on top of this well
stack it as close as possible so we'll

800
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:32,380
stack it as close as possible so we'll
 

801
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,320
stack it as close as possible so we'll
have a one slab spacing and then we'll

802
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,330
have a one slab spacing and then we'll
 

803
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,360
have a one slab spacing and then we'll
build a slab over top here and just see

804
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,370
build a slab over top here and just see
 

805
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,670
build a slab over top here and just see
what that looks like - I think that's

806
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:38,680
what that looks like - I think that's
 

807
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,920
what that looks like - I think that's
eight so there we go that is our

808
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:43,930
eight so there we go that is our
 

809
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,630
eight so there we go that is our
floating slab idea I think that looks

810
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:45,640
floating slab idea I think that looks
 

811
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,780
floating slab idea I think that looks
kind of cool right that'll work out it

812
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:48,790
kind of cool right that'll work out it
 

813
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,280
kind of cool right that'll work out it
looks interesting from a distance but

814
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,290
looks interesting from a distance but
 

815
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,850
looks interesting from a distance but
also a big thing when you're over here

816
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:52,860
also a big thing when you're over here
 

817
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,320
also a big thing when you're over here
it feels pretty cool - I liked in

818
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,330
it feels pretty cool - I liked in
 

819
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,930
it feels pretty cool - I liked in
Minecraft when you have things over your

820
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:57,940
Minecraft when you have things over your
 

821
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,370
Minecraft when you have things over your
head or when you're walking and you have

822
00:17:59,370 --> 00:17:59,380
head or when you're walking and you have
 

823
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,470
head or when you're walking and you have
something up high to your left and right

824
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:01,480
something up high to your left and right
 

825
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,840
something up high to your left and right
like this feels like you're being

826
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:03,850
like this feels like you're being
 

827
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,270
like this feels like you're being
sandwiched in or whatever I think it's

828
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,280
sandwiched in or whatever I think it's
 

829
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,880
sandwiched in or whatever I think it's
like a good idea so that's kind of the

830
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:08,890
like a good idea so that's kind of the
 

831
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,820
like a good idea so that's kind of the
basic rules to shaping our build here we

832
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:11,830
basic rules to shaping our build here we
 

833
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,140
basic rules to shaping our build here we
still got to figure out the decorative

834
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,150
still got to figure out the decorative
 

835
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,830
still got to figure out the decorative
side of things like how do we add

836
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
side of things like how do we add
 

837
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,740
side of things like how do we add
variation and make stuff look cool so

838
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:19,750
variation and make stuff look cool so
 

839
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,600
variation and make stuff look cool so
like with this for example it looks

840
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,610
like with this for example it looks
 

841
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,220
like with this for example it looks
weird on the skinny legs like that so

842
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,230
weird on the skinny legs like that so
 

843
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,800
weird on the skinny legs like that so
maybe this gives us an excuse to

844
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:25,810
maybe this gives us an excuse to
 

845
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,520
maybe this gives us an excuse to
possibly do arches and stuff you know I

846
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:29,530
possibly do arches and stuff you know I
 

847
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,950
possibly do arches and stuff you know I
like my arches

848
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
like my arches
 

849
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,100
like my arches
maybe we beefed up the legs like this

850
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,110
maybe we beefed up the legs like this
 

851
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,840
maybe we beefed up the legs like this
and like it looks weird when you look at

852
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:39,850
and like it looks weird when you look at
 

853
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,180
and like it looks weird when you look at
the corner here we got it going this way

854
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,190
the corner here we got it going this way
 

855
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,320
the corner here we got it going this way
and then it kind of goes this way all

856
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,330
and then it kind of goes this way all
 

857
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,390
and then it kind of goes this way all
right we need to blend that in some

858
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,400
right we need to blend that in some
 

859
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,780
right we need to blend that in some
house so we could do just a simple thing

860
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:48,790
house so we could do just a simple thing
 

861
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,930
house so we could do just a simple thing
like like so so I think we're allowed to

862
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:51,940
like like so so I think we're allowed to
 

863
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,780
like like so so I think we're allowed to
like step into the next tile or next

864
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:54,790
like step into the next tile or next
 

865
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,550
like step into the next tile or next
chunk to the one we're in like if we

866
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:56,560
chunk to the one we're in like if we
 

867
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,370
chunk to the one we're in like if we
look at f3g this is the line here and we

868
00:18:59,370 --> 00:18:59,380
look at f3g this is the line here and we
 

869
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,730
look at f3g this is the line here and we
kind of like make this build go into

870
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:02,740
kind of like make this build go into
 

871
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,710
kind of like make this build go into
this one by doing that but I think

872
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
this one by doing that but I think
 

873
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,270
this one by doing that but I think
that's okay as long as the bulk of the

874
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,280
that's okay as long as the bulk of the
 

875
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,120
that's okay as long as the bulk of the
materials in the other chunk if we don't

876
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,130
materials in the other chunk if we don't
 

877
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,220
materials in the other chunk if we don't
do that at all everything's gonna look

878
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,230
do that at all everything's gonna look
 

879
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,070
do that at all everything's gonna look
really flattened and boring in the end

880
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
really flattened and boring in the end
 

881
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,660
really flattened and boring in the end
of things here so we we should do it a

882
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:15,670
of things here so we we should do it a
 

883
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,390
of things here so we we should do it a
little bit I think just one or two

884
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
little bit I think just one or two
 

885
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,990
little bit I think just one or two
blocks not more than that though or

886
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
blocks not more than that though or
 

887
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,410
blocks not more than that though or
it'll it'll be too much probably uh-huh

888
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:25,420
it'll it'll be too much probably uh-huh
 

889
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,810
it'll it'll be too much probably uh-huh
so that's one idea we also have to add

890
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:27,820
so that's one idea we also have to add
 

891
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,550
so that's one idea we also have to add
more color to the bill that it's just

892
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:29,560
more color to the bill that it's just
 

893
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:29,820
more color to the bill that it's just
green

894
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:29,830
green
 

895
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,470
green
great right now that's not gonna fly

896
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,480
great right now that's not gonna fly
 

897
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,549
great right now that's not gonna fly
long-term we need other stuff so

898
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
long-term we need other stuff so
 

899
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,350
long-term we need other stuff so
possibly we will start building with

900
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
possibly we will start building with
 

901
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,539
possibly we will start building with
brick I did bring some brick here

902
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:39,549
brick I did bring some brick here
 

903
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,289
brick I did bring some brick here
I like brick a lot now like brick Casas

904
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:43,299
I like brick a lot now like brick Casas
 

905
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,940
I like brick a lot now like brick Casas
history if you don't know in Minecraft a

906
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:44,950
history if you don't know in Minecraft a
 

907
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,740
history if you don't know in Minecraft a
lot of people don't like it in building

908
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:48,750
lot of people don't like it in building
 

909
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,820
lot of people don't like it in building
because it didn't really go with many

910
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:50,830
because it didn't really go with many
 

911
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,039
because it didn't really go with many
blocks but I think it does more so now

912
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,049
blocks but I think it does more so now
 

913
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,269
blocks but I think it does more so now
it looks a little bit better with stuff

914
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:56,279
it looks a little bit better with stuff
 

915
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,380
it looks a little bit better with stuff
especially with like clays and stuff

916
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,390
especially with like clays and stuff
 

917
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,659
especially with like clays and stuff
like that so maybe we'll include those

918
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:00,669
like that so maybe we'll include those
 

919
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:01,169
like that so maybe we'll include those
too

920
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:01,179
too
 

921
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,269
too
I'm gonna move this staircase over I

922
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:03,279
I'm gonna move this staircase over I
 

923
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,620
I'm gonna move this staircase over I
don't think we need to Center everything

924
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:04,630
don't think we need to Center everything
 

925
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,720
don't think we need to Center everything
either well yeah actually let's hey you

926
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:11,730
either well yeah actually let's hey you
 

927
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,080
either well yeah actually let's hey you
that's twice I got I got burnt today

928
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,090
that's twice I got I got burnt today
 

929
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,430
that's twice I got I got burnt today
maybe we won't keep it centered on

930
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
maybe we won't keep it centered on
 

931
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,590
maybe we won't keep it centered on
second thought here so we'll build a

932
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:22,600
second thought here so we'll build a
 

933
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,529
second thought here so we'll build a
little bit out of brick I really like

934
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:25,539
little bit out of brick I really like
 

935
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:28,350
little bit out of brick I really like
dark dark oak with brick so let's mix in

936
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:28,360
dark dark oak with brick so let's mix in
 

937
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,690
dark dark oak with brick so let's mix in
some of that stuff will do the border

938
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:30,700
some of that stuff will do the border
 

939
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,750
some of that stuff will do the border
thing like I usually do there's gonna be

940
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
thing like I usually do there's gonna be
 

941
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,399
thing like I usually do there's gonna be
some similarities to the man cave I

942
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:35,409
some similarities to the man cave I
 

943
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,889
some similarities to the man cave I
think with this build because this is

944
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:37,899
think with this build because this is
 

945
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:39,269
think with this build because this is
something I do at the man cave but I use

946
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:39,279
something I do at the man cave but I use
 

947
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,509
something I do at the man cave but I use
oak when I do it and then I put fences

948
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:42,519
oak when I do it and then I put fences
 

949
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,480
oak when I do it and then I put fences
on top and I will be filling in all the

950
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,490
on top and I will be filling in all the
 

951
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,820
on top and I will be filling in all the
void spaces b-double oh you trust me on

952
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:47,830
void spaces b-double oh you trust me on
 

953
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,269
void spaces b-double oh you trust me on
that

954
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:48,279
that
 

955
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,330
that
I don't skip out what not when things

956
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:51,340
I don't skip out what not when things
 

957
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,430
I don't skip out what not when things
are finished but we're still in the

958
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
are finished but we're still in the
 

959
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,379
are finished but we're still in the
building process right now okay so let's

960
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:55,389
building process right now okay so let's
 

961
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:59,820
building process right now okay so let's
maybe get some fences in here too do we

962
00:20:59,820 --> 00:20:59,830
maybe get some fences in here too do we
 

963
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,289
maybe get some fences in here too do we
have we probably don't have any made

964
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:01,299
have we probably don't have any made
 

965
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,490
have we probably don't have any made
I'll do it off camera okay let's

966
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:04,500
I'll do it off camera okay let's
 

967
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,409
I'll do it off camera okay let's
experiment with this - this will add

968
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:07,419
experiment with this - this will add
 

969
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:08,940
experiment with this - this will add
more color it's got like a nice yellow

970
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:08,950
more color it's got like a nice yellow
 

971
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,350
more color it's got like a nice yellow
color goes well with brick and it'll add

972
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,360
color goes well with brick and it'll add
 

973
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,060
color goes well with brick and it'll add
a little bit of depth in the bill cuz it

974
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,070
a little bit of depth in the bill cuz it
 

975
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,730
a little bit of depth in the bill cuz it
sinks down a little bit if you go

976
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:20,740
sinks down a little bit if you go
 

977
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,930
sinks down a little bit if you go
straight - yeah I'll be pretty simple

978
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:24,940
straight - yeah I'll be pretty simple
 

979
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,659
straight - yeah I'll be pretty simple
all right oh yeah and by the way because

980
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:27,669
all right oh yeah and by the way because
 

981
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,430
all right oh yeah and by the way because
we didn't connect the two slabs or

982
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
we didn't connect the two slabs or
 

983
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,279
we didn't connect the two slabs or
chunks here to these four that means we

984
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:32,289
chunks here to these four that means we
 

985
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:34,049
chunks here to these four that means we
either have to go up or down with them

986
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:34,059
either have to go up or down with them
 

987
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,399
either have to go up or down with them
and we're probably gonna go down with

988
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:35,409
and we're probably gonna go down with
 

989
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:37,440
and we're probably gonna go down with
them it's gonna feel like we're like up

990
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,450
them it's gonna feel like we're like up
 

991
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,000
them it's gonna feel like we're like up
in the air here as we're walking I think

992
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,010
in the air here as we're walking I think
 

993
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,510
in the air here as we're walking I think
that'll be neat be pretty cool so I got

994
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,520
that'll be neat be pretty cool so I got
 

995
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,570
that'll be neat be pretty cool so I got
some fences made

996
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:43,580
some fences made
 

997
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,970
some fences made
I think we will also in places have

998
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:45,980
I think we will also in places have
 

999
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,040
I think we will also in places have
fences so we don't like fall down

1000
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,050
fences so we don't like fall down
 

1001
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,410
fences so we don't like fall down
maybe not everywhere it might be too

1002
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:50,420
maybe not everywhere it might be too
 

1003
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,990
maybe not everywhere it might be too
much if we do a lot of them but in

1004
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,000
much if we do a lot of them but in
 

1005
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,960
much if we do a lot of them but in
places will have some fences and stuff

1006
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:54,970
places will have some fences and stuff
 

1007
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:02,890
places will have some fences and stuff
and maybe along the top here I'm not

1008
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:02,900
and maybe along the top here I'm not
 

1009
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,040
and maybe along the top here I'm not
sure exactly how we'll connect that and

1010
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,050
sure exactly how we'll connect that and
 

1011
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,330
sure exactly how we'll connect that and
also I was thinking about it let's add

1012
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,340
also I was thinking about it let's add
 

1013
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,150
also I was thinking about it let's add
water to the base as well get that nice

1014
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:10,160
water to the base as well get that nice
 

1015
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,400
water to the base as well get that nice
blue color mixed in although it's not

1016
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,410
blue color mixed in although it's not
 

1017
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,750
blue color mixed in although it's not
really a nice blue color I wish they

1018
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
really a nice blue color I wish they
 

1019
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,070
really a nice blue color I wish they
would change to the water color before

1020
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,080
would change to the water color before
 

1021
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,770
would change to the water color before
the aqua updates finished making a nice

1022
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:19,780
the aqua updates finished making a nice
 

1023
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,470
the aqua updates finished making a nice
aqua color you know it's water it should

1024
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,480
aqua color you know it's water it should
 

1025
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,130
aqua color you know it's water it should
be an light blue not deep blue that's

1026
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,140
be an light blue not deep blue that's
 

1027
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,750
be an light blue not deep blue that's
the one thing they need to change to

1028
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:28,760
the one thing they need to change to
 

1029
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,620
the one thing they need to change to
make the update like perfect for me but

1030
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:32,630
make the update like perfect for me but
 

1031
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,790
make the update like perfect for me but
I kind of doubt they're going to I think

1032
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:33,800
I kind of doubt they're going to I think
 

1033
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,140
I kind of doubt they're going to I think
they would have done it already if they

1034
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,150
they would have done it already if they
 

1035
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,960
they would have done it already if they
were that I don't know too many people

1036
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:37,970
were that I don't know too many people
 

1037
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,720
were that I don't know too many people
in Minecraft that like the defaults blue

1038
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:40,730
in Minecraft that like the defaults blue
 

1039
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,090
in Minecraft that like the defaults blue
water color everybody use texture packs

1040
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,100
water color everybody use texture packs
 

1041
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,440
water color everybody use texture packs
get the nice color instead yeah when we

1042
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,450
get the nice color instead yeah when we
 

1043
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,820
get the nice color instead yeah when we
walk here now that feels a lot cooler

1044
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:48,830
walk here now that feels a lot cooler
 

1045
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,470
walk here now that feels a lot cooler
all right I like it I like it let's mix

1046
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:53,480
all right I like it I like it let's mix
 

1047
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,060
all right I like it I like it let's mix
in leaves and stuff with the build to

1048
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,070
in leaves and stuff with the build to
 

1049
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,030
in leaves and stuff with the build to
like maybe we will sneak some in here

1050
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,040
like maybe we will sneak some in here
 

1051
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,490
like maybe we will sneak some in here
somehow

1052
00:22:59,490 --> 00:22:59,500
somehow
 

1053
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,380
somehow
on this side and maybe a hang down area

1054
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,390
on this side and maybe a hang down area
 

1055
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,580
on this side and maybe a hang down area
over here I don't know how that's gonna

1056
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:06,590
over here I don't know how that's gonna
 

1057
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,090
over here I don't know how that's gonna
make sense logically but could be cool

1058
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,100
make sense logically but could be cool
 

1059
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,550
make sense logically but could be cool
oh this will come down like this I

1060
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:14,560
oh this will come down like this I
 

1061
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,840
oh this will come down like this I
always looks neat when you see hanging

1062
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:16,850
always looks neat when you see hanging
 

1063
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:25,750
always looks neat when you see hanging
leaves like that let's test that for

1064
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:25,760
leaves like that let's test that for
 

1065
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,860
leaves like that let's test that for
right now Oh take that hang down a

1066
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:29,870
right now Oh take that hang down a
 

1067
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,970
right now Oh take that hang down a
little bit more I just want to see what

1068
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:30,980
little bit more I just want to see what
 

1069
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,730
little bit more I just want to see what
it looks like from the other side I know

1070
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:33,740
it looks like from the other side I know
 

1071
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,430
it looks like from the other side I know
it looks terrible from this side well

1072
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:36,440
it looks terrible from this side well
 

1073
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,510
it looks terrible from this side well
yeah let's go over here

1074
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:40,520

 

1075
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,500

yeah that's a little bit cooler right

1076
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:42,510
yeah that's a little bit cooler right
 

1077
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:48,050
yeah that's a little bit cooler right
maybe it goes even more uh-huh I liked

1078
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,060
maybe it goes even more uh-huh I liked
 

1079
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,530
maybe it goes even more uh-huh I liked
it I liked it but anyways guys I think

1080
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:51,540
it I liked it but anyways guys I think
 

1081
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,030
it I liked it but anyways guys I think
it's about time we wrap up the episode

1082
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,040
it's about time we wrap up the episode
 

1083
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,790
it's about time we wrap up the episode
here for today we got a good start on

1084
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:55,800
here for today we got a good start on
 

1085
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,590
here for today we got a good start on
that bass I'm happy with it so far I

1086
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
that bass I'm happy with it so far I
 

1087
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,300
that bass I'm happy with it so far I
know it's not looking like super great

1088
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,310
know it's not looking like super great
 

1089
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,510
know it's not looking like super great
or anything but we just started it as we

1090
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,520
or anything but we just started it as we
 

1091
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,100
or anything but we just started it as we
add more details and as it gets bigger

1092
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,110
add more details and as it gets bigger
 

1093
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,140
add more details and as it gets bigger
it's gonna look a lot cooler and as we

1094
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,150
it's gonna look a lot cooler and as we
 

1095
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,120
it's gonna look a lot cooler and as we
build the firms and contraptions we will

1096
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,130
build the firms and contraptions we will
 

1097
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,920
build the firms and contraptions we will

00:25:59,620 --> 00:25:59,630
little bit different for me
 

1189
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,970

because I'm doing the YouTube thing so

1190
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:01,980

because I'm doing the YouTube thing so
it adds an extra challenge to it and I'm

always trying to push myself to do
 

1195
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,800
always trying to push myself to do
something different in the game I think

1196
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:09,810
something different in the game I think
 

1197
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,000
something different in the game I think
it's like that with a lot of things like

1198

it's like that with a lot of things like
a lot of people like music for example
