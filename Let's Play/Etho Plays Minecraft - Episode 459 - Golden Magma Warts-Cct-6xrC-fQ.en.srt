I am worried some of the XP is getting
stuck places so let's really watch for

88
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,170
stuck places so let's really watch for
 

89

here like there's some XP there let's
 

95
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,800
here like there's some XP there let's
see if that will get picked up next next

clock that's controlling this whole

112
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:31,900
clock that's controlling this whole
 

113
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,110
clock that's controlling this whole
thing right now so it goes from one arm

114
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,120
thing right now so it goes from one arm
 

115
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,180
thing right now so it goes from one arm
to the next arm to the next arm and then

116
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,190
to the next arm to the next arm and then
 

117
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,309
to the next arm to the next arm and then
the next one and it restarts the cycle

118
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
the next one and it restarts the cycle
 

119
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,370
the next one and it restarts the cycle
every time are these guys just like

120
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:41,380
every time are these guys just like
 

121
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,380
every time are these guys just like
falling down and not dying I wonder

122
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,390
falling down and not dying I wonder
 

123
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,880
falling down and not dying I wonder
let's try see how many hits they take to

124
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:47,890
let's try see how many hits they take to
 

125
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,110
let's try see how many hits they take to
kill their two hit kills yeah so they're

126
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,120
kill their two hit kills yeah so they're
 

127
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,080
kill their two hit kills yeah so they're
probably not falling quite far enough it

128
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,090
probably not falling quite far enough it
 

129
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,960
probably not falling quite far enough it
might be when this piston extends if

130
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:00,970
might be when this piston extends if
 

131
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,089
might be when this piston extends if
they land on it for a brief moment then

132
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:03,099
they land on it for a brief moment then
 

133
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,710
they land on it for a brief moment then
they don't die I should have built this

134
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
they don't die I should have built this
 

135
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,680
they don't die I should have built this
all one block lower probably than it is

136
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,690
all one block lower probably than it is
 

137
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,030
all one block lower probably than it is
but yeah let's go down here other than

138
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,040
but yeah let's go down here other than
 

139
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,150
but yeah let's go down here other than
that I don't really see too much trouble

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120
yeah so basically the way we got this
 

163
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,089
yeah so basically the way we got this
working guys we actually pick up the

164
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:44,099
working guys we actually pick up the
 

165
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,740
working guys we actually pick up the
items at the very end of each of the

166
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:45,750
items at the very end of each of the
 

167
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,690
items at the very end of each of the
arms here and then I use the hopper

168
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:47,700
arms here and then I use the hopper
 

169
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,390
arms here and then I use the hopper
chain to bring them to the center right

170
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
chain to bring them to the center right
 

171
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,369
chain to bring them to the center right
they meet in the center here and

172
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:52,379
they meet in the center here and
 

173
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,839
they meet in the center here and
converge I have a ring of hoppers here

174
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:56,849
converge I have a ring of hoppers here
 

175
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,449
converge I have a ring of hoppers here
they pull the items out of the hoppers

176
00:03:59,449 --> 00:03:59,459
they pull the items out of the hoppers
 

177
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,009
they pull the items out of the hoppers
you see how it passes over top of them

178
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:01,019
you see how it passes over top of them
 

179
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,979
you see how it passes over top of them
pulls them down they go into here then

180
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:03,989
pulls them down they go into here then
 

181
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,180
pulls them down they go into here then
they pass by these three item sorters we

182
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,190
they pass by these three item sorters we
 

183
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,599
they pass by these three item sorters we
have item filters so we have gold

184
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:11,609
have item filters so we have gold
 

185
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,660
have item filters so we have gold
nuggets gold bars and zombie flesh

186
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,670
nuggets gold bars and zombie flesh
 

187
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,920
nuggets gold bars and zombie flesh
anything that doesn't get sorted goes

188
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:15,930
anything that doesn't get sorted goes
 

189
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,379
anything that doesn't get sorted goes
further on into that dropper over there

190
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:18,389
further on into that dropper over there
 

191
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,120
further on into that dropper over there
and that's going to be the void items

192
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,130
and that's going to be the void items
 

193
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,820
and that's going to be the void items
that we shoot into lava so if any items

194
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:22,830
that we shoot into lava so if any items
 

195
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,920
that we shoot into lava so if any items
are in in that dropper then this clock

196
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:24,930
are in in that dropper then this clock
 

197
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,310
are in in that dropper then this clock
runs and shoots them out umm I'm not

198
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
runs and shoots them out umm I'm not
 

199
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,189
runs and shoots them out umm I'm not
trying to keep an eye out for any backup

200
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
trying to keep an eye out for any backup
 

201
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,469
trying to keep an eye out for any backup
happening and so far it seems like it

202
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
happening and so far it seems like it
 

203
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,360
happening and so far it seems like it
might be a little bit too slow to handle

204
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,370
might be a little bit too slow to handle
 

205
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,930
might be a little bit too slow to handle
all the items um so I might need to set

206
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:41,940
all the items um so I might need to set
 

207
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,180
all the items um so I might need to set
up two sets of item filters to deal with

208
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,190
up two sets of item filters to deal with
 

209
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,330
up two sets of item filters to deal with
all the items because it looks like it

210
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,340
all the items because it looks like it
 

211
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,230
all the items because it looks like it
might back up currently yeah other than

212
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,240
might back up currently yeah other than
 

213
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,029
might back up currently yeah other than
that I think this is a pretty good

214
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,039
that I think this is a pretty good
 

215
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,750

works replant it and that gives you a
 

273
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,299
works replant it and that gives you a
little bit of profit we got 21 from that

little bit of profit we got 21 from that
 

275
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,739
little bit of profit we got 21 from that
so pretty simple um but we want to

so pretty simple um but we want to
 

277
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,529
so pretty simple um but we want to
mass-produce this stuff right there's

278
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:16,539
mass-produce this stuff right there's
 

279
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,719
mass-produce this stuff right there's
not really a lot you can do with nether

280
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:18,729

you use fortune on it I believe you get

288
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:27,909
you use fortune on it I believe you get
 

289
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:31,529
you use fortune on it I believe you get
more so I got a fortune pick here we had

290
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:31,539
more so I got a fortune pick here we had
 

291
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,299

21 now we have 26 so we got five we got
 

293
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:43,619
21 now we have 26 so we got five we got
six that time four five if you don't use

294
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:43,629
six that time four five if you don't use
 

295
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,679
six that time four five if you don't use
fortune I think you get two to four they

296
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:46,689
fortune I think you get two to four they
 

297
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,859
fortune I think you get two to four they
have to get to their right three three

298
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:49,869
have to get to their right three three
 

299
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,889
have to get to their right three three
and I think four yeah so could get a

300
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:52,899
and I think four yeah so could get a
 

301
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,479
and I think four yeah so could get a
little bit more if we use fortune but I

302
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:54,489
little bit more if we use fortune but I
 

303
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,769
little bit more if we use fortune but I
don't know if it's really worth it I

304
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:55,779
don't know if it's really worth it I
 

305
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,359
don't know if it's really worth it I
think we'll just make a big field of

306
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:57,369
think we'll just make a big field of
 

307
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:00,980
think we'll just make a big field of
nether warts one thing I had in mind

nether warts one thing I had in mind
 

309
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,819
nether warts one thing I had in mind
let's see if this works

310
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:02,829
let's see if this works
 

311
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:05,819
let's see if this works
if you there might be one way to

312
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:05,829
if you there might be one way to
 

313
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,719
if you there might be one way to
automate it a little bit easier if you

314
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:09,729
automate it a little bit easier if you
 

315
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,089
automate it a little bit easier if you
click on the dirt block does that plant

oh it doesn't
oh darn I was thinking like you could

320
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:16,990
oh darn I was thinking like you could
 

321
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,619
oh darn I was thinking like you could
have a bunch of soul sand down like this

322
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:19,629
have a bunch of soul sand down like this
 

323
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,869
have a bunch of soul sand down like this
if you click on the nether wart in front

324
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:21,879
if you click on the nether wart in front
 

325
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,149
if you click on the nether wart in front
of you it would plant it that looks like

326
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:24,159
of you it would plant it that looks like
 

327
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,790
of you it would plant it that looks like
you actually have to click on the on the

328
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
you actually have to click on the on the
 

329
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,329
you actually have to click on the on the
soul sand because I get if you use a

330
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:29,339
soul sand because I get if you use a
 

331
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,089
soul sand because I get if you use a
redstone for example it'll place it or

332
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:33,099
redstone for example it'll place it or
 

333
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,859
redstone for example it'll place it or
if you place it on the dirt it places it

334
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:34,869
if you place it on the dirt it places it
 

335
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:36,689
if you place it on the dirt it places it
on the soul sand I thought it would do

336
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:36,699
on the soul sand I thought it would do
 

337
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:39,389
on the soul sand I thought it would do
that as well but I guess not I guess

338
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:39,399
that as well but I guess not I guess
 

339
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,859
that as well but I guess not I guess
because it's a crop and not a block hmm

340
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:43,869
because it's a crop and not a block hmm
 

341
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:45,209
because it's a crop and not a block hmm
any other ideas

342
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:45,219
any other ideas
 

343
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,829
any other ideas
oh yeah you can't grow this stuff with

344
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:46,839
oh yeah you can't grow this stuff with
 

345
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,850
oh yeah you can't grow this stuff with
the bone meal so yeah we we really can't

346
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:50,860
the bone meal so yeah we we really can't
 

347
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,319
the bone meal so yeah we we really can't
do much with it

348
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,329
do much with it
 

349
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,029
do much with it
where this gonna make a big field of it

350
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:54,039
where this gonna make a big field of it
 

351
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,469
where this gonna make a big field of it
I think okay guys so I got a plan now I

352
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
I think okay guys so I got a plan now I
 

353
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,299
I think okay guys so I got a plan now I
thought about for a little bit we're

354
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:00,309
thought about for a little bit we're
 

355
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:02,879
thought about for a little bit we're
going to expand the man cave into a new

356
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:02,889
going to expand the man cave into a new
 

357
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,279
going to expand the man cave into a new
region today off this way towards the

358
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:05,289
region today off this way towards the
 

359
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,239
region today off this way towards the
swamp we haven't

360
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:07,249
swamp we haven't
 

361
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:10,449
swamp we haven't
really built anything underground we've

362
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:10,459
really built anything underground we've
 

363
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,009
really built anything underground we've
done a little bit above ground over here

364
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:12,019
done a little bit above ground over here
 

365
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,899
done a little bit above ground over here
just a little bit of decorative stuff

366
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:13,909
just a little bit of decorative stuff
 

367
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,709
just a little bit of decorative stuff
nothing too much if we look in the

368
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:17,719
nothing too much if we look in the
 

369
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:19,389
nothing too much if we look in the
ravine down here you see how we got the

370
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:19,399
ravine down here you see how we got the
 

371
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,219
ravine down here you see how we got the
birch wood and spruce that is actually

372
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:21,229
birch wood and spruce that is actually
 

373
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:24,609
birch wood and spruce that is actually
the tree farm in the man cave if we go a

374
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:24,619
the tree farm in the man cave if we go a
 

375
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,309
the tree farm in the man cave if we go a
little bit further on here though like I

376
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:27,319
little bit further on here though like I
 

377
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,199
little bit further on here though like I
think past this point there's nothing we

378
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,209
think past this point there's nothing we
 

379
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,209
think past this point there's nothing we
haven't done anything underground or

380
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:31,219
haven't done anything underground or
 

381
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,939
haven't done anything underground or
above-ground here really um so we're

382
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:33,949
above-ground here really um so we're
 

383
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,550
above-ground here really um so we're
going to start expanding out to this

384
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
going to start expanding out to this
 

385
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,719
going to start expanding out to this
region we're going to build the nether

386
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:37,729
region we're going to build the nether
 

387
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,329
region we're going to build the nether
work farm underground probably it's

388
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:40,339
work farm underground probably it's
 

389
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:41,850
work farm underground probably it's
going to take a fair bit of space and

390
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:41,860
going to take a fair bit of space and
 

391
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,019
going to take a fair bit of space and
then above ground we're going to try

392
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:44,029
then above ground we're going to try
 

393
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,619
then above ground we're going to try
decorate it some more one thing that

394
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:47,629
decorate it some more one thing that
 

395
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,559
decorate it some more one thing that
we'll probably be doing in this area you

396
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:50,569
we'll probably be doing in this area you
 

397
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,119
we'll probably be doing in this area you
can make some pretty cool-looking

398
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:52,129
can make some pretty cool-looking
 

399
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,009
can make some pretty cool-looking
mushrooms using the new nether wart

400
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:54,019
mushrooms using the new nether wart
 

401
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,040
mushrooms using the new nether wart
blocks so once we start amassing a ton

402
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,050
blocks so once we start amassing a ton
 

403
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,540
blocks so once we start amassing a ton
of those we'll build lots of these

404
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:58,550
of those we'll build lots of these
 

405
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,090
of those we'll build lots of these
probably different sizes and shapes I'll

406
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,100
probably different sizes and shapes I'll
 

407
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,150
probably different sizes and shapes I'll
try to do a sample one here though

408
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,160
try to do a sample one here though
 

409
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,429
try to do a sample one here though
yeah bone blocks work great as the stems

410
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:06,439
yeah bone blocks work great as the stems
 

411
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:10,210
yeah bone blocks work great as the stems
and then let's kind of do something

412
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,220
and then let's kind of do something
 

413
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,650
and then let's kind of do something
round it out

414
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:11,660
round it out
 

415
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,240
round it out
I also saw on the reddit some people

416
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,250
I also saw on the reddit some people
 

417
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,160
I also saw on the reddit some people
were growing jungle trees and then they

418
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,170
were growing jungle trees and then they
 

419
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,170
were growing jungle trees and then they
change the leaves with this nether wart

420
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,180
change the leaves with this nether wart
 

421
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,329
change the leaves with this nether wart
block and it looks really good it looks

422
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:19,339
block and it looks really good it looks
 

423
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,049
block and it looks really good it looks
like giant mushrooms

424
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:22,059
like giant mushrooms
 

425
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,920
like giant mushrooms
wait isn't on uh-oh they changed it Oh

426
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:26,930
wait isn't on uh-oh they changed it Oh
 

427
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,329
wait isn't on uh-oh they changed it Oh
weird that's really weird because you

428
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:31,339
weird that's really weird because you
 

429
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:32,740
weird that's really weird because you
used to be able to harvest it with your

430
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:32,750
used to be able to harvest it with your
 

431
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,689
used to be able to harvest it with your
axe right and now in 1.10 you can't

432
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:36,699
axe right and now in 1.10 you can't
 

433
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,449
axe right and now in 1.10 you can't
uh-huh anyways so kind of smooth this

434
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:40,459

438
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:46,660

 

439
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,519

AHA there we go

440
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:48,529
AHA there we go
 

441
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,710
AHA there we go
that's my sample mushroom for you guys

442
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
that's my sample mushroom for you guys
 

443
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,470
that's my sample mushroom for you guys
so maybe in the future we will plan to

444
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:53,480
so maybe in the future we will plan to
 

445
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,809
so maybe in the future we will plan to
transform the swamp area into like a

446
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:55,819
transform the swamp area into like a
 

447
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:57,400
transform the swamp area into like a
mushroom forest we'll have like big

448
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,410
mushroom forest we'll have like big
 

449
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,679
mushroom forest we'll have like big
mushrooms little mushrooms try to make

450
00:09:59,679 --> 00:09:59,689
mushrooms little mushrooms try to make
 

451
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:02,740
mushrooms little mushrooms try to make
it look rundown and and creepy and

452
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:02,750
it look rundown and and creepy and
 

453
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,040
it look rundown and and creepy and
whatnot I don't know we'll see but for

454
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,050
whatnot I don't know we'll see but for
 

455
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,449
whatnot I don't know we'll see but for
today we're just going to build a nether

456
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:07,459
today we're just going to build a nether
 

457
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,999
today we're just going to build a nether
wart farm underground probably in this

458
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:10,009
wart farm underground probably in this
 

459
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,949
wart farm underground probably in this
big flat spot and then connect it to the

460
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:11,959
big flat spot and then connect it to the
 

461
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,509
big flat spot and then connect it to the
man cave probably at that tree farm area

462
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
man cave probably at that tree farm area
 

463
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,759
man cave probably at that tree farm area
so gonna need a fair bit of space I

464
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:18,769
so gonna need a fair bit of space I
 

465
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,180
so gonna need a fair bit of space I
guess I'll just dig down

466
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,190
guess I'll just dig down
 

467
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,840
guess I'll just dig down
and try to make a big area here and then

468
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:25,850
and try to make a big area here and then
 

469
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,130
and try to make a big area here and then
we'll get to it I guess okay guys so I

470
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,140
we'll get to it I guess okay guys so I
 

471
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,930
we'll get to it I guess okay guys so I
got a dual beacon set up now with that

472
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:31,940
got a dual beacon set up now with that
 

473
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,090
got a dual beacon set up now with that
haste - and speed - just to make the

474
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,100
haste - and speed - just to make the
 

475
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,130
haste - and speed - just to make the
school a little bit quicker and I got a

476
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,140
school a little bit quicker and I got a
 

477
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,280
school a little bit quicker and I got a
path to go down here and this is

478
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,290
path to go down here and this is
 

479
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,500
path to go down here and this is
probably going to be about the center of

480
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:41,510
probably going to be about the center of
 

481
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,590
probably going to be about the center of
our farm right around here I got a seven

482
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:44,600
our farm right around here I got a seven
 

483
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,300
our farm right around here I got a seven
by seven thing of soul sand down right

484
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,310
by seven thing of soul sand down right
 

485
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,199
by seven thing of soul sand down right
now not exactly sure what we're doing

486
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:50,209
now not exactly sure what we're doing
 

487
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,550
now not exactly sure what we're doing
but we're probably going to be

488
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:51,560
but we're probably going to be
 

489
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,710
but we're probably going to be
harvesting this the nether wart using

490
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:53,720
harvesting this the nether wart using
 

491
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,350
harvesting this the nether wart using
water streams it's probably the easiest

492
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:56,360
water streams it's probably the easiest
 

493
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,240
water streams it's probably the easiest
way of doing it um and I think we'll try

494
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,250
way of doing it um and I think we'll try
 

495
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,530
way of doing it um and I think we'll try
to collect all the nether work together

496
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:02,540
to collect all the nether work together
 

497
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,639
to collect all the nether work together
in the very center here so we're going

498
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:06,649
in the very center here so we're going
 

499
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,889
in the very center here so we're going
to be making a big plus sign probably is

500
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:08,899
to be making a big plus sign probably is
 

501
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,220
to be making a big plus sign probably is
the plan so water streams will push the

502
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,230
the plan so water streams will push the
 

503
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,319
the plan so water streams will push the
nether work to here so we can probably

504
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:14,329
nether work to here so we can probably
 

505
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:17,980
nether work to here so we can probably
go at the most since water streams only

506
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:17,990
go at the most since water streams only
 

507
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,790
go at the most since water streams only
travel eight blocks maybe let's do six

508
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:21,800
travel eight blocks maybe let's do six
 

509
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,750
travel eight blocks maybe let's do six
blocks from that center hole there yeah

510
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
blocks from that center hole there yeah
 

511
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,240
blocks from that center hole there yeah
let's try six blocks around the border

512
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,250
let's try six blocks around the border
 

513
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,620
let's try six blocks around the border
of the soul sand here I'll probably put

514
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:29,630
of the soul sand here I'll probably put
 

515
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,939
of the soul sand here I'll probably put
the red nether brick I think that'll

516
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:30,949
the red nether brick I think that'll
 

517
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:38,829
the red nether brick I think that'll
look pretty good with this alright cool

518
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:38,839
look pretty good with this alright cool
 

519
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,569
look pretty good with this alright cool
so this is probably what we'll do here

520
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:40,579
so this is probably what we'll do here
 

521
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,850
so this is probably what we'll do here
we'll test it out in a second but first

522
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:42,860
we'll test it out in a second but first
 

523
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,850
we'll test it out in a second but first
I gotta find these spiders man they are

524
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:45,860
I gotta find these spiders man they are
 

525
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,160
I gotta find these spiders man they are
driving me crazy and yes I just said

526
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,170
driving me crazy and yes I just said
 

527
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:59,199
driving me crazy and yes I just said
spider-man oh really okay I know where

528
00:11:59,199 --> 00:11:59,209
spider-man oh really okay I know where
 

529
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,189
spider-man oh really okay I know where
we are this is the old old dual cape

530
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:03,199
we are this is the old old dual cape
 

531
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,740
we are this is the old old dual cape
spider farm is over here right

532
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:04,750
spider farm is over here right
 

533
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,250
spider farm is over here right
underneath okay mmm can't really shut

534
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,260
underneath okay mmm can't really shut
 

535
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,949
underneath okay mmm can't really shut
this off mm maybe I'll just have to live

536
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
this off mm maybe I'll just have to live
 

537
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,430
this off mm maybe I'll just have to live
with it then all right let's uh let's do

538
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:18,440
with it then all right let's uh let's do
 

539
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,470
with it then all right let's uh let's do
one of these babies while we work on

540
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
one of these babies while we work on
 

541
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,180
one of these babies while we work on
this nether wart firm cuz I'm not

542
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,190
this nether wart firm cuz I'm not
 

543
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,199
this nether wart firm cuz I'm not
breaking those spawners

544
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:23,209
breaking those spawners
 

545
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,009
breaking those spawners
or we're lighting them up I guess okay

546
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:27,019
or we're lighting them up I guess okay
 

547
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:30,480
or we're lighting them up I guess okay
let's go up here throw a torch in there

548
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,490
let's go up here throw a torch in there
 

549
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,829
let's go up here throw a torch in there
so I got to test out the water streams

550
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:32,839
so I got to test out the water streams
 

551
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,020
so I got to test out the water streams
now make sure they

552
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,030
now make sure they
 

553
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,150
now make sure they
you wash the nether words to the center

554
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
you wash the nether words to the center
 

555
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,300
you wash the nether words to the center
like I want so probably

556
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,310
like I want so probably
 

557
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,610
like I want so probably
let's go up one more block right yeah so

558
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:44,620
let's go up one more block right yeah so
 

559
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,470
let's go up one more block right yeah so
basically let's do this I got some ice

560
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
basically let's do this I got some ice
 

561
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,730
basically let's do this I got some ice
on me is it gonna be able to push

562
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:49,740
on me is it gonna be able to push
 

563
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,190
on me is it gonna be able to push
overtop the nether word here let's see

564
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,200
overtop the nether word here let's see
 

565
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,930
overtop the nether word here let's see
or does he get stuck it does get stuck

566
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:54,940
or does he get stuck it does get stuck
 

567
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,270
or does he get stuck it does get stuck
okay so we can't have anything fancy at

568
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,280
okay so we can't have anything fancy at
 

569
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,760
okay so we can't have anything fancy at
all man

570
00:12:59,760 --> 00:12:59,770
all man
 

571
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,670
all man
no fancy borders or anything this has to

572
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:02,680
no fancy borders or anything this has to
 

573
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,830
no fancy borders or anything this has to
be soul sand all the way through here

574
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:06,840

 

575
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,330

okay so let's try this again our goal is

576
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,340
okay so let's try this again our goal is
 

577
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,070
okay so let's try this again our goal is
to get all the nether wart to the center

578
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,080
to get all the nether wart to the center
 

579
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,320
to get all the nether wart to the center
hole right so if we have one stream

580
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,330
hole right so if we have one stream
 

581
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,080
hole right so if we have one stream
going there and another stream on this

582
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,090
going there and another stream on this
 

583
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,400
going there and another stream on this
side I keep placing like two two blocks

584
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,410
side I keep placing like two two blocks
 

585
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,220
side I keep placing like two two blocks
when I only want to place one definitely

586
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,230
when I only want to place one definitely
 

587
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,900
when I only want to place one definitely
getting a new Mouse tomorrow because

588
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:24,910
getting a new Mouse tomorrow because
 

589
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,650
getting a new Mouse tomorrow because
this is getting really frustrating okay

590
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:28,660
this is getting really frustrating okay
 

591
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,890
this is getting really frustrating okay
yeah this looks good I think that'll

592
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:31,900
yeah this looks good I think that'll
 

593
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,690
yeah this looks good I think that'll
work out pretty good uh-huh

594
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:36,700
work out pretty good uh-huh
 

595
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,460
work out pretty good uh-huh
so I've done a bunch of digging here

596
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:38,470
so I've done a bunch of digging here
 

597
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,440
so I've done a bunch of digging here
guys bunch of building I think we pretty

598
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,450
guys bunch of building I think we pretty
 

599
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,150
guys bunch of building I think we pretty
much got the nether wart part of our

600
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
much got the nether wart part of our
 

601
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
much got the nether wart part of our
firm done here and I really liked how

602
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,370
firm done here and I really liked how
 

603
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,590
firm done here and I really liked how
they look when they're all bunched

604
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:46,600
they look when they're all bunched
 

605
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,060
they look when they're all bunched
together like this too it's pretty cool

606
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,070
together like this too it's pretty cool
 

607
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,550
together like this too it's pretty cool
so this is the plus sign shape I was

608
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
so this is the plus sign shape I was
 

609
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,400
so this is the plus sign shape I was
talking about so we could go up step by

610
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,410
talking about so we could go up step by
 

611
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,110
talking about so we could go up step by
step as high as we want here as far out

612
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
step as high as we want here as far out
 

613
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,050
step as high as we want here as far out
as we want but this is probably enough

614
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,060
as we want but this is probably enough
 

615
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,750
as we want but this is probably enough
in other words I would say each of these

616
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
in other words I would say each of these
 

617
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,480
in other words I would say each of these
steps we have is a seven by seven so

618
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:03,490
steps we have is a seven by seven so
 

619
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,190
steps we have is a seven by seven so
like one of these things from there to

620
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,200
like one of these things from there to
 

621
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,430
like one of these things from there to
there is seven by seven that's 49 plants

622
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:08,440
there is seven by seven that's 49 plants
 

623
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,430
there is seven by seven that's 49 plants
so we've got eight eight of those step

624
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
so we've got eight eight of those step
 

625
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,400
so we've got eight eight of those step
things so that's about 400 and then this

626
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,410
things so that's about 400 and then this
 

627
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,990
things so that's about 400 and then this
middle parts probably probably at least

628
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
middle parts probably probably at least
 

629
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,790
middle parts probably probably at least
100 if I was to guess so that's like 500

630
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:17,800
100 if I was to guess so that's like 500
 

631
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,880
100 if I was to guess so that's like 500
plants I think that's good enough if we

632
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:20,890
plants I think that's good enough if we
 

633
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,240
plants I think that's good enough if we
get three on average which I'm not sure

634
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,250
get three on average which I'm not sure
 

635
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,410
get three on average which I'm not sure
if that's correct but I think it's about

636
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:25,420
if that's correct but I think it's about
 

637
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,170
if that's correct but I think it's about
three and we got to use one to replant

638
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,180
three and we got to use one to replant
 

639
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,070
three and we got to use one to replant
that means we're gonna get about

640
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,080
that means we're gonna get about
 

641
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,130
that means we're gonna get about
thousand each harvest um oh got some

642
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,140
thousand each harvest um oh got some
 

643
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,010
thousand each harvest um oh got some
lighting issues here too uh I think a

644
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,020
lighting issues here too uh I think a
 

645
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,480
lighting issues here too uh I think a
thousand is pretty good though it's only

646
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,490
thousand is pretty good though it's only
 

647
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,580
thousand is pretty good though it's only
that's not even two stacks in other word

648
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,590
that's not even two stacks in other word
 

649
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,840
that's not even two stacks in other word
blocks but yeah it's it's good I think

650
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:44,850
blocks but yeah it's it's good I think
 

651
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,970
blocks but yeah it's it's good I think
so I'm gonna put water buckets in

652
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:47,980
so I'm gonna put water buckets in
 

653
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,870
so I'm gonna put water buckets in
these dispensers on each of the arms

654
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
these dispensers on each of the arms
 

655
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,950
these dispensers on each of the arms
that'll wash all the netherwart

656
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:52,960
that'll wash all the netherwart
 

657
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,230
that'll wash all the netherwart
to the middle then we'll probably pick

658
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,240
to the middle then we'll probably pick
 

659
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,270
to the middle then we'll probably pick
it up with a hopper or something and put

660
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,280
it up with a hopper or something and put
 

661
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,000
it up with a hopper or something and put
it into chests and to actually replant

662
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,010
it into chests and to actually replant
 

663
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,890
it into chests and to actually replant
the nether wart I I don't think there's

664
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:01,900
the nether wart I I don't think there's
 

665
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,630
the nether wart I I don't think there's
any way around it I have to go and like

666
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:03,640
any way around it I have to go and like
 

667
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,720
any way around it I have to go and like
place it manually there are some designs

668
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,730
place it manually there are some designs
 

669
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,970
place it manually there are some designs
that use minecarts that movie around and

670
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:08,980
that use minecarts that movie around and
 

671
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,250
that use minecarts that movie around and
you just hold right click which worked

672
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,260
you just hold right click which worked
 

673
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,880
you just hold right click which worked
pretty good too but for for mass

674
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:14,890
pretty good too but for for mass
 

675
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,470
pretty good too but for for mass
production I think it's just easier to

676
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
production I think it's just easier to
 

677
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,820
production I think it's just easier to
do this all right so do that and now we

678
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:20,830
do this all right so do that and now we
 

679
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,580
do this all right so do that and now we
also want to decorate the farm as soon

680
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,590
also want to decorate the farm as soon
 

681
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:38,880
also want to decorate the farm as soon
as I kill this fool mm-hmm

682
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:38,890
as I kill this fool mm-hmm
 

683
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,800
as I kill this fool mm-hmm
I probably won't be doing much of my

684
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:40,810
I probably won't be doing much of my
 

685
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,630
I probably won't be doing much of my
redstone on this red nether brick right

686
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:42,640
redstone on this red nether brick right
 

687
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,590
redstone on this red nether brick right
it's like invisible on it but yeah we're

688
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:46,600
it's like invisible on it but yeah we're
 

689
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,670
it's like invisible on it but yeah we're
gonna we're going to power the

690
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
gonna we're going to power the
 

691
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,350
gonna we're going to power the
dispensers in the back like that I put a

692
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
dispensers in the back like that I put a
 

693
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,350
dispensers in the back like that I put a
thing of the brick over top of it's this

694
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,360
thing of the brick over top of it's this
 

695
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,840
thing of the brick over top of it's this
area here around the farm is going to be

696
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:54,850
area here around the farm is going to be
 

697
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,510
area here around the farm is going to be
a path that we can walk walk around what

698
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,520
a path that we can walk walk around what
 

699
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,120
a path that we can walk walk around what
block do we want to use for this I have

700
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,130
block do we want to use for this I have
 

701
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,190
block do we want to use for this I have
a couple ideas we could try mycelium

702
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,200
a couple ideas we could try mycelium
 

703
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,670
a couple ideas we could try mycelium
let's pick our favorite here mycelium

704
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
let's pick our favorite here mycelium
 

705
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,650
let's pick our favorite here mycelium
might look good grass because this is

706
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:07,660
might look good grass because this is
 

707
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,270
might look good grass because this is
going to be part of the man cave so we

708
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,280
going to be part of the man cave so we
 

709
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,370
going to be part of the man cave so we
might want to keep this grass theme and

710
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,380
might want to keep this grass theme and
 

711
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,710
might want to keep this grass theme and
the dark green looks pretty good with

712
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:13,720
the dark green looks pretty good with
 

713
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,160
the dark green looks pretty good with
this red brick I think the other option

714
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,170
this red brick I think the other option
 

715
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,850
this red brick I think the other option
is to use bone blocks I would say which

716
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:20,860
is to use bone blocks I would say which
 

717
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,430
is to use bone blocks I would say which
also probably looks pretty good if we

718
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
also probably looks pretty good if we
 

719
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,550
also probably looks pretty good if we
just did a three wide path let's see

720
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
just did a three wide path let's see
 

721
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
just did a three wide path let's see
what do we want to do definitely not

722
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:28,810
what do we want to do definitely not
 

723
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,000
what do we want to do definitely not
mycelium mmm let's put some more red

724
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,010
mycelium mmm let's put some more red
 

725
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,050

brick on this side for the walls I plan

726
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,060
brick on this side for the walls I plan
 

727
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,660
brick on this side for the walls I plan
on using magma maybe we'll put these

728
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:39,670
on using magma maybe we'll put these
 

729
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,190
on using magma maybe we'll put these
down too just to see which works better

730
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,200
down too just to see which works better
 

731
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,770
down too just to see which works better
with them I plan on using these magma

732
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:43,780
with them I plan on using these magma
 

733
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,570
with them I plan on using these magma
blocks for the walls and maybe some

734
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:45,580
blocks for the walls and maybe some
 

735
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,230
blocks for the walls and maybe some
brown clay or maybe bone blocks for the

736
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,240
brown clay or maybe bone blocks for the
 

737
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,060
brown clay or maybe bone blocks for the
walls as well do two to this stuff

738
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,070
walls as well do two to this stuff
 

739

walls as well do two to this stuff
doesn't hurt you could touch it on the

740
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,150
doesn't hurt you could touch it on the
 

741
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,820
doesn't hurt you could touch it on the
side it's only if you step on it right

742

gray clay it is great okay looks really
 

751
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,480
gray clay it is great okay looks really
good with this stuff now which do we

752
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,490
good with this stuff now which do we
 

753
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,130
good with this stuff now which do we
prefer with that the green works with it

754
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,140
prefer with that the green works with it
 

755
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,000
prefer with that the green works with it
but the bone I would create a real real

756
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,010
but the bone I would create a real real
 

757
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,559
but the bone I would create a real real
big contrast if we use the bone maybe

758
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:23,569
big contrast if we use the bone maybe
 

759
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:34,570
big contrast if we use the bone maybe
we'll stick with the grass then oh yeah

760

a good choice now check this out on the
 

771
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,470
a good choice now check this out on the
wall I was just going to do like a 3x3

772
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,480
wall I was just going to do like a 3x3
 

773

thing of this this what do you call it
 

775
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,649
thing of this this what do you call it
again make my block ah maybe we do an

776
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:53,659
again make my block ah maybe we do an
 

777
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,510
again make my block ah maybe we do an
arch it's a man cave we got to have

778
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
arch it's a man cave we got to have
 

779
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,580
arch it's a man cave we got to have
arches right maybe we do an arch of this

780

stuff that goes all the way across to

782
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
stuff that goes all the way across to
 

783
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,770
stuff that goes all the way across to
the other side would look really good

784
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:02,780
the other side would look really good
 

785
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,510
the other side would look really good
and I'm also playing around with the

786
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:04,520
and I'm also playing around with the
 

787
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,060
and I'm also playing around with the
sandstone the red sandstone I never use

788
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,070
sandstone the red sandstone I never use
 

789
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,950
sandstone the red sandstone I never use
this stuff but it goes really good with

790
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
this stuff but it goes really good with
 

791
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,409
this stuff but it goes really good with
the Megane blocks as well and not too

792
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:11,419
the Megane blocks as well and not too
 

793
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:13,870
the Megane blocks as well and not too
bad with the red nether brick so I got

794
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:13,880
bad with the red nether brick so I got
 

795
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,700
bad with the red nether brick so I got
on the ground here I tried using it on

796
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:15,710
on the ground here I tried using it on
 

797
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,899
on the ground here I tried using it on
the wall I'm still trying to figure it

798
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:16,909
the wall I'm still trying to figure it
 

799
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,270
the wall I'm still trying to figure it
out exactly but I think we're going to

800
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
out exactly but I think we're going to
 

801
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,049
out exactly but I think we're going to
go with something like this and then in

802
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:23,059
go with something like this and then in
 

803
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,399
go with something like this and then in
the very middle here I thought it'd look

804
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:24,409
the very middle here I thought it'd look
 

805
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,649
the very middle here I thought it'd look
cool if we did what you might call it

806
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:28,659
cool if we did what you might call it
 

807
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,159
cool if we did what you might call it
what's the word

808
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:30,169
what's the word
 

809
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:34,960
what's the word
oh no it's escaped me skylight I think

810
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:34,970
oh no it's escaped me skylight I think
 

811
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,130
oh no it's escaped me skylight I think
your skylight is what I'm looking for

812
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,140
your skylight is what I'm looking for
 

813
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,990
your skylight is what I'm looking for
right in the middle here do a big

814
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
right in the middle here do a big
 

815
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,130
right in the middle here do a big
skylight because I think we're pretty

816
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,140
skylight because I think we're pretty
 

817
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,250
skylight because I think we're pretty
close to the surface actually how far do

818
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:42,260
close to the surface actually how far do
 

819
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,880
close to the surface actually how far do
we got to go up to hit the surface

820
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:44,890
we got to go up to hit the surface
 

821
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,010
we got to go up to hit the surface
that's right there it's right there so

822
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,020
that's right there it's right there so
 

823
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,039
that's right there it's right there so
maybe we do like a glass skylight over

824
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,049
maybe we do like a glass skylight over
 

825
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,580
maybe we do like a glass skylight over
here we'll put the the clay as a border

826
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:54,590
here we'll put the the clay as a border
 

827
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,380
here we'll put the the clay as a border
around it as well maybe like an octagon

828
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,390
around it as well maybe like an octagon
 

829
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,549
around it as well maybe like an octagon
shape or something like that well I've

830
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
shape or something like that well I've
 

831
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,950
shape or something like that well I've
done some more building here guys and

832
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:01,960
done some more building here guys and
 

833
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,600
done some more building here guys and
it's really coming together I'm loving

834
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,610
it's really coming together I'm loving
 

835
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,940
it's really coming together I'm loving
this block theme we got going on here I

836
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:06,950
this block theme we got going on here I
 

837
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,310
this block theme we got going on here I
think it's pretty cool

838
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
think it's pretty cool
 

839
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,510
think it's pretty cool
very interesting I've never built

840
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:10,520
very interesting I've never built
 

841
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,990
very interesting I've never built
anything quite like this before so these

842
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
anything quite like this before so these
 

843
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,910
anything quite like this before so these
red nether brick blocks they're pretty

844
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:15,920
red nether brick blocks they're pretty
 

845
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,710
red nether brick blocks they're pretty
cheap they're not a problem bone blocks

846
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:17,720
cheap they're not a problem bone blocks
 

847
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,930
cheap they're not a problem bone blocks
are fairly cheap but the ones that

848
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:19,940
are fairly cheap but the ones that
 

849
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,750
are fairly cheap but the ones that
really seem expensive now that I've

850
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:22,760
really seem expensive now that I've
 

851
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,370
really seem expensive now that I've
actually done some building like this is

852
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:24,380
actually done some building like this is
 

853
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,400
actually done some building like this is
my first time using the Magna blocks and

854
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,410
my first time using the Magna blocks and
 

855
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,550
my first time using the Magna blocks and
I've used a little bit of nether wart

856
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:29,560
I've used a little bit of nether wart
 

857
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,170
I've used a little bit of nether wart
like on that mushroom and stuff those

858
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:32,180
like on that mushroom and stuff those
 

859
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,290
like on that mushroom and stuff those
are expensive and these magma blocks are

860
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:35,300
are expensive and these magma blocks are
 

861
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,000
are expensive and these magma blocks are
actually pretty pricey too each one

862
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,010
actually pretty pricey too each one
 

863
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,020
actually pretty pricey too each one
takes four magma cream yeah that's

864
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,030
takes four magma cream yeah that's
 

865
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,380
takes four magma cream yeah that's
that's a lot so I have ran out of magma

866
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,390
that's a lot so I have ran out of magma
 

867
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,720
that's a lot so I have ran out of magma
cream I even afk dat the blaze firm for

868
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:46,730
cream I even afk dat the blaze firm for
 

869
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,060
cream I even afk dat the blaze firm for
a while I might have to do some more AF

870
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,070
a while I might have to do some more AF
 

871
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,550
a while I might have to do some more AF
game to get more but I got about half of

872
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:51,560
game to get more but I got about half of
 

873
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,910
game to get more but I got about half of
this done now I did a skylight over here

874
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:54,920
this done now I did a skylight over here
 

875
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,740
this done now I did a skylight over here
in the middle seems to be collecting

876
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:56,750
in the middle seems to be collecting
 

877
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,760
in the middle seems to be collecting
slimes from the swamp area but of course

878
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:00,770
slimes from the swamp area but of course
 

879
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,260
slimes from the swamp area but of course
we'll do some terraforming out there so

880
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,270
we'll do some terraforming out there so
 

881
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,310
we'll do some terraforming out there so
it's not going to be a big circle out of

882
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
it's not going to be a big circle out of
 

883
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,600
it's not going to be a big circle out of
the land or anything like that it'll be

884
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,610
the land or anything like that it'll be
 

885
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,090
the land or anything like that it'll be
evened out I'm sure and I think I got

886
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,100
evened out I'm sure and I think I got
 

887
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,280
evened out I'm sure and I think I got
the water budget hooked up here too

888
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,290
the water budget hooked up here too
 

889
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,880
the water budget hooked up here too
let's try that out which side was it

890
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:14,890
let's try that out which side was it
 

891
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,380
let's try that out which side was it
over here yeah over here okay so

892
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,390
over here yeah over here okay so
 

893
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,800
over here yeah over here okay so
basically all I did it's very simple it

894
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:20,810
basically all I did it's very simple it
 

895
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,470
basically all I did it's very simple it
just ran a wire from here goes out this

896
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:23,480
just ran a wire from here goes out this
 

897
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,820
just ran a wire from here goes out this
way actually I don't know if I finished

898
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:24,830
way actually I don't know if I finished
 

899
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,670
way actually I don't know if I finished
it now that I I see that it goes out

900
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:27,680
it now that I I see that it goes out
 

901
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,310
it now that I I see that it goes out
over here there's a repeater back there

902
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
over here there's a repeater back there
 

903
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,780
over here there's a repeater back there
powers this wire goes on to the next one

904
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:34,790
powers this wire goes on to the next one
 

905
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,310
powers this wire goes on to the next one
yeah there's some of these you're

906
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
yeah there's some of these you're
 

907
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,190
yeah there's some of these you're
missing it's gotta have those blocks

908
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
missing it's gotta have those blocks
 

909
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,250
missing it's gotta have those blocks
there to work yeah if we if we put a

910
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:42,260
there to work yeah if we if we put a
 

911
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,020
there to work yeah if we if we put a
button here and press it should activate

912
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,030
button here and press it should activate
 

913
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,590
button here and press it should activate
this all the way down yeah that one's

914
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
this all the way down yeah that one's
 

915
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,110
this all the way down yeah that one's
good that one's good sweet oh you know I

916
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
good that one's good sweet oh you know I
 

917
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,000
good that one's good sweet oh you know I
was worried about this actually some of

918
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,010
was worried about this actually some of
 

919
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,880
was worried about this actually some of
the nether words bouncing off off up to

920
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:57,890
the nether words bouncing off off up to
 

921
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,980
the nether words bouncing off off up to
the edge here mmm

922
00:20:59,980 --> 00:20:59,990
the edge here mmm
 

923
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,190
the edge here mmm
I wonder maybe I should raise this by

924
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
I wonder maybe I should raise this by
 

925
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,630
I wonder maybe I should raise this by
one block then but it doesn't look like

926
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:07,640
one block then but it doesn't look like
 

927
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,510
one block then but it doesn't look like
we have any dead zones in the water

928
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
we have any dead zones in the water
 

929
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,620
we have any dead zones in the water
which is cool everything is getting

930
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:11,630
which is cool everything is getting
 

931
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:17,380
which is cool everything is getting
washed to the middle and after we'll

932
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,390
washed to the middle and after we'll
 

933
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,730
washed to the middle and after we'll
probably need a hopper clock to actually

934
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:18,740
probably need a hopper clock to actually
 

935
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,650
probably need a hopper clock to actually
to time this and then after a while this

936
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:20,660
to time this and then after a while this
 

937
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,750
to time this and then after a while this
will shut off and then they should all

938
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:22,760
will shut off and then they should all
 

939
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,560
will shut off and then they should all
disappear again cool and then just go by

940
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:26,570
disappear again cool and then just go by
 

941
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,370
disappear again cool and then just go by
replant

942
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:28,380
replant
 

943
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,770
replant
so you see how dark that red nether

944
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:30,780
so you see how dark that red nether
 

945
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,960
so you see how dark that red nether
brick is in the middle there if we put a

946
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:32,970
brick is in the middle there if we put a
 

947
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,970
brick is in the middle there if we put a
torch here it should save the lighting

948
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:34,980
torch here it should save the lighting
 

949

1107
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,060
that get this I did something else I did
a couple tech videos on on game

1108
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,070
a couple tech videos on on game
 

1109
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,039
a couple tech videos on on game
programming like I was doing experiments

1110
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:22,049
programming like I was doing experiments
 

1111
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,200
programming like I was doing experiments
with game programming and I was

1112
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,210
with game programming and I was
 

1113
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,350
with game programming and I was
uploading my results of like making a

1114
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360

 

1115
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,289

not a 3d engine but a 2d engine that had

1116
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:33,299
not a 3d engine but a 2d engine that had
 

1117
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,570
not a 3d engine but a 2d engine that had
3d capabilities I figured out and an

1118
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:35,580
3d capabilities I figured out and an
 

1119
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,940
3d capabilities I figured out and an
algorithm that allowed you to do 3d and

1120
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:37,950
algorithm that allowed you to do 3d and
 

1121
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,430
algorithm that allowed you to do 3d and
2d and it was kind of cool and now that

1122
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
2d and it was kind of cool and now that
 

1123
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,110
2d and it was kind of cool and now that
I've said that I realize it probably

1124
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
I've said that I realize it probably
 

1125
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,450
I've said that I realize it probably
doesn't make much sense because I

1126
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,460
doesn't make much sense because I
 

1127
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,039
doesn't make much sense because I
probably contradicted myself there but

1128
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:49,049
probably contradicted myself there but
 

1129
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,990
probably contradicted myself there but
you would understand if you saw it kind

1130
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,000
you would understand if you saw it kind
 

1131
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,590
you would understand if you saw it kind
of made sense actually 2.5 D let's say

1132
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:54,600
of made sense actually 2.5 D let's say
 

1133
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,650
of made sense actually 2.5 D let's say
that

1134
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:55,660
that
 

1135
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,900
that
but anyways let's wrap it up here guys

1136
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:57,910
but anyways let's wrap it up here guys
 

1137
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,970
but anyways let's wrap it up here guys
if you have any ideas on this new region

1138
00:25:59,970 --> 00:25:59,980
if you have any ideas on this new region
 

1139
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,070
if you have any ideas on this new region
we're working on here on how to make it

1140
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
we're working on here on how to make it
 

1141
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,360
we're working on here on how to make it
look cool please let me know in the

1142

look cool please let me know in the
comments or any ideas for our another
