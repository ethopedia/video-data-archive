how you doing things are good I thought

14
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,630
how you doing things are good I thought
 

15
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,900
how you doing things are good I thought
to get us going here to begin with we

16
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:23,910
to get us going here to begin with we
 

17
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,040
to get us going here to begin with we
would spend some more time at our

18
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,050
would spend some more time at our
 

19
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,310
would spend some more time at our
stronghold base on this crazy bomb

20
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
stronghold base on this crazy bomb
 

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,310
stronghold base on this crazy bomb
factory project we were working on so we

22
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,320
factory project we were working on so we
 

23
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,920
factory project we were working on so we
got that working very well last episode

24
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:33,930
got that working very well last episode
 

25
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,470
got that working very well last episode
if I do say so myself but we needed to

26
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
if I do say so myself but we needed to
 

27
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,810
if I do say so myself but we needed to
build a mob sorter still which is what

28
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:38,820
build a mob sorter still which is what
 

29
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,990
build a mob sorter still which is what
we're what I wanted to show you at the

30
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
we're what I wanted to show you at the
 

31
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,720
we're what I wanted to show you at the
begin with here there was a lot of

32
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:44,730
begin with here there was a lot of
 

33
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,520
begin with here there was a lot of
confusion about that project basically

34
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:46,530
confusion about that project basically
 

35
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,639
confusion about that project basically
our goal we built the bomb factory so we

36
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:49,649
our goal we built the bomb factory so we
 

37
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,100
our goal we built the bomb factory so we
can remote detonate creepers wherever we

38
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,110
can remote detonate creepers wherever we
 

39
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,869
can remote detonate creepers wherever we
want and ultimately I would like to

40
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:53,879
want and ultimately I would like to
 

41
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,840
want and ultimately I would like to
build a tree farm where we can remote

42
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:56,850
build a tree farm where we can remote
 

43
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,639
build a tree farm where we can remote
detonate the creepers to explode the

44
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:58,649
detonate the creepers to explode the
 

45
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,740
detonate the creepers to explode the
wood and then and then harvest it

46
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:00,750
wood and then and then harvest it
 

47
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,130
wood and then and then harvest it
automatically you know what I mean

48
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,140
automatically you know what I mean
 

49
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,149
automatically you know what I mean
that's that was kind of the original

50
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,159
that's that was kind of the original
 

51
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,120
that's that was kind of the original
intent with this whole build here and

52
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,130
intent with this whole build here and
 

53
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,850
intent with this whole build here and
we'll see if we can pull it off still

54
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:09,860
we'll see if we can pull it off still
 

55
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,770
we'll see if we can pull it off still
but it's kind of just for fun too so

56
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:12,780
but it's kind of just for fun too so
 

57
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,350
but it's kind of just for fun too so
let's talk about this mob sorter thing I

58
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
let's talk about this mob sorter thing I
 

59
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,050
let's talk about this mob sorter thing I
decided to change it we're gonna try do

60
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,060
decided to change it we're gonna try do
 

61
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,510
decided to change it we're gonna try do
like a vertical sorter here and we're

62
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,520
like a vertical sorter here and we're
 

63
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,550
like a vertical sorter here and we're
gonna separate the mobs by sighs first

64
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
gonna separate the mobs by sighs first
 

65
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,330
gonna separate the mobs by sighs first
off so the smallest mobs maybe zombats

66
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,340
off so the smallest mobs maybe zombats
 

67
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,039
off so the smallest mobs maybe zombats
they're gonna fall down like random mobs

68
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,049
they're gonna fall down like random mobs
 

69
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,120
they're gonna fall down like random mobs
down this tube and you can see this

70
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,130
down this tube and you can see this
 

71
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,240
down this tube and you can see this
first set of Pistons over here there's a

72
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:35,250
first set of Pistons over here there's a
 

73
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,569
first set of Pistons over here there's a
block there right behind this one right

74
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:38,579
block there right behind this one right
 

75
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,300
block there right behind this one right
there we are going to have the mobs

76
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,310
there we are going to have the mobs
 

77
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,280
there we are going to have the mobs
stand on that and you can see this

78
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,290
stand on that and you can see this
 

79
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,660
stand on that and you can see this
piston over here it extends and then

80
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:47,670
piston over here it extends and then
 

81
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,310
piston over here it extends and then
this one retracts at the bottom very

82
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:49,320
this one retracts at the bottom very
 

83
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,830
this one retracts at the bottom very
quickly and then extends again so this

84
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
quickly and then extends again so this
 

85
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,810
quickly and then extends again so this
piston up here is gonna push whatever is

86
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:53,820
piston up here is gonna push whatever is
 

87
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,209
piston up here is gonna push whatever is
over here against this wall so we want

88
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:56,219
over here against this wall so we want
 

89
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,450
over here against this wall so we want
to push baby zombats which are only one

90
00:01:59,450 --> 00:01:59,460
to push baby zombats which are only one
 

91
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,310
to push baby zombats which are only one
block tall through here and they'll go

92
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
block tall through here and they'll go
 

93
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,410
block tall through here and they'll go
into a water stream over here and then

94
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,420
into a water stream over here and then
 

95
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,570
into a water stream over here and then
we can move them wherever we want so

96
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:08,580
we can move them wherever we want so
 

97
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,190
we can move them wherever we want so
that's like our first little step to

98
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
that's like our first little step to
 

99
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,860
that's like our first little step to
this let's block that up

100
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:12,870
this let's block that up
 

101
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,850
this let's block that up
so they'll be water here I think so the

102
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:16,860
so they'll be water here I think so the
 

103
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,860
so they'll be water here I think so the
baby zombies they get pushed that way

104
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:18,870
baby zombies they get pushed that way
 

105
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,660
baby zombies they get pushed that way
and then anything left in that tube is

106
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:20,670
and then anything left in that tube is
 

107
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,670
and then anything left in that tube is
gonna fall down when this retracts and

108
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,680
gonna fall down when this retracts and
 

109
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
gonna fall down when this retracts and
extends and they'll fall to this next

110
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,690
extends and they'll fall to this next
 

111
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,350
extends and they'll fall to this next
set of Pistons down here which we will

112
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
set of Pistons down here which we will
 

113
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,150
set of Pistons down here which we will
separate the creepers out of because

114
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
separate the creepers out of because
 

115
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,809
separate the creepers out of because
they're the next smallest mobs and to do

116
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:32,819
they're the next smallest mobs and to do
 

117
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,410
they're the next smallest mobs and to do
that let's see so they get pushed over

118
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:36,420
that let's see so they get pushed over
 

119
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,600
that let's see so they get pushed over
here they are over one block tall so

120
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:38,610
here they are over one block tall so
 

121
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,870
here they are over one block tall so
we'll have to move this block here to

122
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:43,880

 

123
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,120

put a trapdoor there and I think we'll

124
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,130
put a trapdoor there and I think we'll
 

125
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,160
put a trapdoor there and I think we'll
have to do a little bit of a ninja move

126
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,170
have to do a little bit of a ninja move
 

127
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,229
have to do a little bit of a ninja move
here oh just in time so they'll fit

128
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
here oh just in time so they'll fit
 

129
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,420
here oh just in time so they'll fit
through here and then we'll have another

130
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,430
through here and then we'll have another
 

131
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,640
through here and then we'll have another
water stream to move them and then

132
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,650
water stream to move them and then
 

133
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,130
water stream to move them and then
there's gonna be zombies skeletons and

134
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,140
there's gonna be zombies skeletons and
 

135
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,009
there's gonna be zombies skeletons and
witches and not the last bit of the mob

136
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:04,019
witches and not the last bit of the mob
 

137
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,600
witches and not the last bit of the mob
mix which we'll have to separate

138
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:05,610
mix which we'll have to separate
 

139
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,069
mix which we'll have to separate
separate out a different way because

140
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:07,079
separate out a different way because
 

141
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,069
separate out a different way because
they aren't different sizes from each

142
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:10,079
they aren't different sizes from each
 

143
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,690
they aren't different sizes from each
other okay creepers okay that worked

144
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:14,700
other okay creepers okay that worked
 

145
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,690
other okay creepers okay that worked
pretty good did any creepers get stuck

146
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:17,700
pretty good did any creepers get stuck
 

147
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,840
pretty good did any creepers get stuck
in the mix down there I don't see any

148
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:22,850

 

149
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,250

yeah that worked really well actually

150
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,260
yeah that worked really well actually
 

151
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,180
yeah that worked really well actually
I'm happy with that

152
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,190
I'm happy with that
 

153
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,900
I'm happy with that
any creepers in here you know if there

154
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:29,910
any creepers in here you know if there
 

155
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,039
any creepers in here you know if there
was they wouldn't have exploded

156
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,049
was they wouldn't have exploded
 

157
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,849
was they wouldn't have exploded
I should probably close that that could

158
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:34,859
I should probably close that that could
 

159
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,330
I should probably close that that could
have been bad all right so we got one

160
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,340
have been bad all right so we got one
 

161
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,949
have been bad all right so we got one
baby zombie there he just walked through

162
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:39,959
baby zombie there he just walked through
 

163
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,259
baby zombie there he just walked through
on his own without the Pistons help even

164
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:44,269
on his own without the Pistons help even
 

165
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,000
on his own without the Pistons help even
and you can see like we can have mobs up

166
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,010
and you can see like we can have mobs up
 

167
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,699
and you can see like we can have mobs up
there and at that level there and then

168
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:49,709
there and at that level there and then
 

169
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,229
there and at that level there and then
they kind of switch places when we press

170
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,239
they kind of switch places when we press
 

171
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,040
they kind of switch places when we press
this I think yeah

172
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,050

 

173
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,020

seems to work pretty good so we'll have

174
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,030
seems to work pretty good so we'll have
 

175
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,610
seems to work pretty good so we'll have
this probably running on a clock or

176
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:01,620
this probably running on a clock or
 

177
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,340
this probably running on a clock or
something every few seconds to separate

178
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,350
something every few seconds to separate
 

179
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,980
something every few seconds to separate
them all right it's very good very good

180
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:06,990
them all right it's very good very good
 

181
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,290
them all right it's very good very good
so we got the baby zombies and the

182
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,300
so we got the baby zombies and the
 

183
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,800
so we got the baby zombies and the
creepers getting separated out now one

184
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:12,810
creepers getting separated out now one
 

185
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,940
creepers getting separated out now one
thing we're gonna have to watch out for

186
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:15,950
thing we're gonna have to watch out for
 

187
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,790
thing we're gonna have to watch out for
that's if we get to my mom's in one spot

188
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:19,800
that's if we get to my mom's in one spot
 

189
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,250
that's if we get to my mom's in one spot
the mob cramming is gonna kill them I

190
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,260
the mob cramming is gonna kill them I
 

191
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,100
the mob cramming is gonna kill them I
just blocked this up right now so they

192
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,110
just blocked this up right now so they
 

193
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,330
just blocked this up right now so they
don't really have a spot to go when

194
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:26,340
don't really have a spot to go when
 

195
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,720
don't really have a spot to go when
they're getting backed up what we're

196
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,730
they're getting backed up what we're
 

197
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,250
they're getting backed up what we're
gonna try to do now is separate the

198
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,260
gonna try to do now is separate the
 

199
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,380
gonna try to do now is separate the
zombies the skeletons and the witches so

200
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:33,390
zombies the skeletons and the witches so
 

201
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,830
zombies the skeletons and the witches so
I've started building a thing here we're

202
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
I've started building a thing here we're
 

203
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,050
I've started building a thing here we're
gonna put a wolf right on top of this

204
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,060
gonna put a wolf right on top of this
 

205
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,550
gonna put a wolf right on top of this
cyan block here and then we're gonna

206
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
cyan block here and then we're gonna
 

207
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,960
cyan block here and then we're gonna
break this and I guess I forgot a block

208
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:44,970
break this and I guess I forgot a block
 

209
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,870
break this and I guess I forgot a block
back there we put one there without

210
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880
back there we put one there without
 

211
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,660
back there we put one there without
triggering all the mobs yeah okay

212
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:50,670
triggering all the mobs yeah okay
 

213
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,600
triggering all the mobs yeah okay
put that there we'll slide this guy over

214
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:53,610
put that there we'll slide this guy over
 

215
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,430
put that there we'll slide this guy over
to his spot and then he'll stay there

216
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
to his spot and then he'll stay there
 

217
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,290
to his spot and then he'll stay there
forever hopefully come on guy this is a

218
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,300
forever hopefully come on guy this is a
 

219
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,300
forever hopefully come on guy this is a
really old wolf and I think his AI is

220
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,310
really old wolf and I think his AI is
 

221
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,340
really old wolf and I think his AI is
broken like a Python to stand up he

222
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,350
broken like a Python to stand up he
 

223
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,330
broken like a Python to stand up he
doesn't actually follow me anymore so

224
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,340
doesn't actually follow me anymore so
 

225
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,710
doesn't actually follow me anymore so
it's kind of a good stout wolf but I

226
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:09,720
it's kind of a good stout wolf but I
 

227
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,160
it's kind of a good stout wolf but I
think you'll still work okay come on get

228
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,170
think you'll still work okay come on get
 

229
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,300
think you'll still work okay come on get
to your spots and there we go so we're

230
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,310
to your spots and there we go so we're
 

231
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,370
to your spots and there we go so we're
gonna seal them in there so the

232
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:19,380
gonna seal them in there so the
 

233
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,750
gonna seal them in there so the
skeletons are gonna be able to see them

234
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:20,760
skeletons are gonna be able to see them
 

235
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,730
skeletons are gonna be able to see them
when they're in that spot right right

236
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:22,740
when they're in that spot right right
 

237
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,500
when they're in that spot right right
where they are

238
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:23,510
where they are
 

239
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,650
where they are
break all this and I'll try to explain

240
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:27,660
break all this and I'll try to explain
 

241
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,720
break all this and I'll try to explain
the plan here so you see I moved the

242
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:29,730
the plan here so you see I moved the
 

243
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,140
the plan here so you see I moved the
villagers well he's in front and the

244
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,150
villagers well he's in front and the
 

245
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,650
villagers well he's in front and the
zombies can see him I think I left us

246
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:36,660
zombies can see him I think I left us
 

247
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,240
zombies can see him I think I left us
left it open anyways all right so they

248
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,250
left it open anyways all right so they
 

249
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,920
left it open anyways all right so they
got a direct line of sight to him so

250
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:42,930
got a direct line of sight to him so
 

251
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,150
got a direct line of sight to him so
they're gonna go that way towards the

252
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
they're gonna go that way towards the
 

253
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,130
they're gonna go that way towards the
villager the wolf is gonna chase the

254
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,140
villager the wolf is gonna chase the
 

255
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,560
villager the wolf is gonna chase the
skeletons away this direction so they'll

256
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,570
skeletons away this direction so they'll
 

257
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,100
skeletons away this direction so they'll
run down this tunnel here and then we

258
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,110
run down this tunnel here and then we
 

259
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,720
run down this tunnel here and then we
got the trap door trick going on so

260
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:53,730
got the trap door trick going on so
 

261
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,640
got the trap door trick going on so
they'll try to walk overtop them they

262
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,650
they'll try to walk overtop them they
 

263
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,410
they'll try to walk overtop them they
they see him as full blocks and then

264
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:57,420
they see him as full blocks and then
 

265
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,810
they see him as full blocks and then
they just fall down so we got to break

266
00:05:59,810 --> 00:05:59,820
they just fall down so we got to break
 

267
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,600
they just fall down so we got to break
that block

268
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:03,610

 

269
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,700

which block is it I find it really hard

270
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:06,710
which block is it I find it really hard
 

271
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,260
which block is it I find it really hard
to work with this glass like it plays

272
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,270
to work with this glass like it plays
 

273
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,290
to work with this glass like it plays
with my eyes a little bit I can't tell

274
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:10,300
with my eyes a little bit I can't tell
 

275
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,450
with my eyes a little bit I can't tell
what is what I think it's this one here

276
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:13,460
what is what I think it's this one here
 

277
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:21,480
what is what I think it's this one here
oh and oh we can't oh they're in the way

278
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,490
oh and oh we can't oh they're in the way
 

279
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,180
oh and oh we can't oh they're in the way
so you can see that piston over there is

280
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,190
so you can see that piston over there is
 

281
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,180
so you can see that piston over there is
gonna retract and then any skeletons in

282
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,190
gonna retract and then any skeletons in
 

283
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,500
gonna retract and then any skeletons in
there are free to go this way and

284
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,510
there are free to go this way and
 

285
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,750
there are free to go this way and
likewise there's a piston over there

286
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:31,760
likewise there's a piston over there
 

287
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,190
likewise there's a piston over there
let's just make sure I've never moved

288
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,200
let's just make sure I've never moved
 

289
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,140
let's just make sure I've never moved
that block oh I did it

290
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,150
that block oh I did it
 

291
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,480
that block oh I did it
so basically we're giving the mobs a

292
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,490
so basically we're giving the mobs a
 

293
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,040
so basically we're giving the mobs a
choice here that you neither go towards

294
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,050
choice here that you neither go towards
 

295
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,570
choice here that you neither go towards
the villager which the zombies will

296
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:40,580
the villager which the zombies will
 

297
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,180
the villager which the zombies will
hopefully do or they can run away from

298
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,190
hopefully do or they can run away from
 

299
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,010
hopefully do or they can run away from
the wolf which is what the skeletons

300
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,020
the wolf which is what the skeletons
 

301
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,830
the wolf which is what the skeletons
will hopefully do or they can choose to

302
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
will hopefully do or they can choose to
 

303
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,510
will hopefully do or they can choose to
do nothing and that's what that piston

304
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
do nothing and that's what that piston
 

305
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,320
do nothing and that's what that piston
down down there that one we're looking

306
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,330
down down there that one we're looking
 

307
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,990
down down there that one we're looking
at is four it'll retract and then any

308
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
at is four it'll retract and then any
 

309
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,790
at is four it'll retract and then any
mob that decides to do nothing is it's

310
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:57,800
mob that decides to do nothing is it's
 

311
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,170
mob that decides to do nothing is it's
gonna fall down into another chamber

312
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,180
gonna fall down into another chamber
 

313
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,450
gonna fall down into another chamber
which will hopefully be for the witches

314
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:01,460
which will hopefully be for the witches
 

315
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,980
which will hopefully be for the witches
and maybe for chicken jockeys as well

316
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:04,990
and maybe for chicken jockeys as well
 

317
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,440
and maybe for chicken jockeys as well
and this is what we got controlling the

318
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,450
and this is what we got controlling the
 

319
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,240
and this is what we got controlling the
whole thing so that we send power to

320
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,250
whole thing so that we send power to
 

321
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,910
whole thing so that we send power to
this block here it'll cause that piston

322
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:12,920
this block here it'll cause that piston
 

323
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,180
this block here it'll cause that piston
to retract for the zombies this piston

324
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,190
to retract for the zombies this piston
 

325
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,100
to retract for the zombies this piston
for the skeletons and then after eight

326
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,110
for the skeletons and then after eight
 

327
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,140
for the skeletons and then after eight
ticks here then it's gonna retract the

328
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,150
ticks here then it's gonna retract the
 

329
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,330
ticks here then it's gonna retract the
floor and drop down the witches so

330
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,340
floor and drop down the witches so
 

331
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,570
floor and drop down the witches so
they'd have like 0.8 seconds to decide

332
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:25,580
they'd have like 0.8 seconds to decide
 

333
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,740
they'd have like 0.8 seconds to decide
if they're gonna go somewhere if they

334
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:26,750
if they're gonna go somewhere if they
 

335
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,810
if they're gonna go somewhere if they
don't then they get dropped into the

336
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:28,820
don't then they get dropped into the
 

337
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,750
don't then they get dropped into the
default chamber which is hopefully

338
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:31,760
default chamber which is hopefully
 

339
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,060
default chamber which is hopefully
enough time if not we can add more delay

340
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,070
enough time if not we can add more delay
 

341
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,490
enough time if not we can add more delay
here later and now all we got to do is

342
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:36,500
here later and now all we got to do is
 

343
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,830
here later and now all we got to do is
add some sort of clock to this thing and

344
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:38,840
add some sort of clock to this thing and
 

345
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,050
add some sort of clock to this thing and
I think we'll put a pulse extender on

346
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,060
I think we'll put a pulse extender on
 

347
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,630
I think we'll put a pulse extender on
this as well he's my plan let's maybe do

348
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:46,640
this as well he's my plan let's maybe do
 

349
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,290
this as well he's my plan let's maybe do
it like like this so we'll run wire here

350
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,300
it like like this so we'll run wire here
 

351
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,060
it like like this so we'll run wire here
then we will put blocks here and here

352
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,070
then we will put blocks here and here
 

353
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:02,400
then we will put blocks here and here
I've got to go back a bit more and maybe

354
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,410
I've got to go back a bit more and maybe
 

355
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,240
I've got to go back a bit more and maybe
like this yes very good

356
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,250
like this yes very good
 

357
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,310
like this yes very good
okay now we got to set up a hopper clock

358
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:09,320
okay now we got to set up a hopper clock
 

359
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,180
okay now we got to set up a hopper clock
to go to that so that'll make the signal

360
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,190
to go to that so that'll make the signal
 

361
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,760
to go to that so that'll make the signal
four plus four plus four one point two

362
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:15,770
four plus four plus four one point two
 

363
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,620
four plus four plus four one point two
seconds long with this pulse extender oh

364
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:19,630
seconds long with this pulse extender oh
 

365
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,750
seconds long with this pulse extender oh
boy you know what guys I made a huge

366
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:22,760

I'll remember for next time don't don't
 

399
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,750
I'll remember for next time don't don't
eat spring rolls even though they

400
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
eat spring rolls even though they
 

401
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,740
eat spring rolls even though they
they're pretty good it's not worth it

402
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:10,750
they're pretty good it's not worth it
 

403
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,030
they're pretty good it's not worth it
because there's nothing worse than than

404
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
because there's nothing worse than than
 

405
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,380
because there's nothing worse than than
cabbage burps I tell you all right

cabbage burps I tell you all right
 

407
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,880
cabbage burps I tell you all right
we are just about ready here I think run

408
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:21,890
we are just about ready here I think run
 

409
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,890
we are just about ready here I think run
this to here up our staircase and this

410
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:26,900
this to here up our staircase and this
 

411
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,720
this to here up our staircase and this
is about ready to go we just got to turn

412
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:28,730
is about ready to go we just got to turn
 

413
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,230
is about ready to go we just got to turn
on the clock it's probably not gonna

414
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
on the clock it's probably not gonna
 

415
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,420
on the clock it's probably not gonna
work if we have a bunch of mobs piled up

416
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,430
work if we have a bunch of mobs piled up
 

417
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,329
work if we have a bunch of mobs piled up
here we need to sort them like one or

418
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:37,339
here we need to sort them like one or
 

419
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,070
here we need to sort them like one or
two at a time if possible so we want

420
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,080
two at a time if possible so we want
 

421
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,270
two at a time if possible so we want
this to run fairly frequently and let's

422
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,280
this to run fairly frequently and let's
 

423
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,370
this to run fairly frequently and let's
throw in some items here how many I'm

424
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,380
throw in some items here how many I'm
 

425
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,970
throw in some items here how many I'm
gonna guess maybe six we will see

426
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:50,980

 

427
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,410

okay and let's go over here and just see

428
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:53,420
okay and let's go over here and just see
 

429
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,759
okay and let's go over here and just see
what's happening with this because I'm

430
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:54,769
what's happening with this because I'm
 

431
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,350
what's happening with this because I'm
not sure if it's gonna work the way we

432
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,360
not sure if it's gonna work the way we
 

433
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,009
not sure if it's gonna work the way we
have it and it's not working it's

434
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:03,019
have it and it's not working it's
 

435
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,210
have it and it's not working it's
supposed to be a clog it's supposed to

436
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:04,220
supposed to be a clog it's supposed to
 

437
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,009
supposed to be a clog it's supposed to
keep running what's wrong

438
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:06,019
keep running what's wrong
 

439
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,139
keep running what's wrong
I built the hopper clock wrong got to

440
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:08,149
I built the hopper clock wrong got to
 

441
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,879
I built the hopper clock wrong got to
use sticky pistons not to regular

442
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:09,889
use sticky pistons not to regular
 

443
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:15,249
use sticky pistons not to regular
Pistons I should know that and there we

444
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:15,259
Pistons I should know that and there we
 

445
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,470
Pistons I should know that and there we
go okay let's get this going again

446
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:17,480
go okay let's get this going again
 

447
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,879
go okay let's get this going again
we'll try six items and let's go see

448
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:21,889
we'll try six items and let's go see
 

449
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,210
we'll try six items and let's go see
what's going on where is a good place to

450
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,220
what's going on where is a good place to
 

451
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,420
what's going on where is a good place to
view its how about over here

452
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,430
view its how about over here
 

453
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,889
view its how about over here
yeah we need a spot for those creepers

454
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:29,899
yeah we need a spot for those creepers
 

455
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,329
yeah we need a spot for those creepers
to go to because they're all totally

456
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:31,339
to go to because they're all totally
 

457
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:37,240
to go to because they're all totally
backed up nope that one piston is not

458
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,250
backed up nope that one piston is not
 

459
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,300
backed up nope that one piston is not
working at all hmm the one in the back

460
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,310
working at all hmm the one in the back
 

461
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,490
working at all hmm the one in the back
here this one here why not

462
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:47,500
here this one here why not
 

463
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,389
here this one here why not
there's supposed to be a piece of

464
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:49,399
there's supposed to be a piece of
 

465
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:59,439
there's supposed to be a piece of
redstone here there is okay is this not

466
00:10:59,439 --> 00:10:59,449
redstone here there is okay is this not
 

467
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:02,499
redstone here there is okay is this not
oh I know why this is supposed to be a

468
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:02,509
oh I know why this is supposed to be a
 

469
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:03,569
oh I know why this is supposed to be a
repeater

470
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:03,579
repeater
 

471
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,889
repeater
but then this won't get extended by this

472
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:05,899
but then this won't get extended by this
 

473
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,470
but then this won't get extended by this
um okay well let's try without that for

474
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
um okay well let's try without that for
 

475
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,879
um okay well let's try without that for
now oh okay let's go take a step back

476
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:15,889
now oh okay let's go take a step back
 

477
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:18,400
now oh okay let's go take a step back

see that he fell right through okay we
got to change of timing on that then

486
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720

 

487
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,340

519
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,510
he's not going at all maybe he needs
more time for the pathfinding to kick in

520
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:37,520
more time for the pathfinding to kick in
 

521
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,760
more time for the pathfinding to kick in
or hizzy

522
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:39,770

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:48,830

 

527
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:56,290

that worked fine they both tried to go

528
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:56,300
that worked fine they both tried to go
 

529
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,370
that worked fine they both tried to go
but they couldn't there we go

530
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:00,380
but they couldn't there we go
 

531
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,280
but they couldn't there we go
get them out of the way yeah alright

532
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,290
get them out of the way yeah alright
 

533
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,780
get them out of the way yeah alright
guys well I've been doing some tweaking

534
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:04,790
guys well I've been doing some tweaking
 

535
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,790
guys well I've been doing some tweaking
watching this trying to figure out how

536
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
watching this trying to figure out how
 

537
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,310
watching this trying to figure out how
to make it better in the end of things

538
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,320
to make it better in the end of things
 

539
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,900
to make it better in the end of things
here we're gonna disable those three

540
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:10,910
here we're gonna disable those three
 

541
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,490
here we're gonna disable those three
Pistons after all we're not even gonna

542
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:12,500
Pistons after all we're not even gonna
 

543
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,770
Pistons after all we're not even gonna
bother trying to separate out the

544
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:14,780
bother trying to separate out the
 

545
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,110
bother trying to separate out the
witches and even still having a lot of

546
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,120
witches and even still having a lot of
 

547
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,190
witches and even still having a lot of
trouble you see how long it takes the

548
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
trouble you see how long it takes the
 

549
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,500
trouble you see how long it takes the
skeletons to run away that's our big

550
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,510
skeletons to run away that's our big
 

551
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,380
skeletons to run away that's our big
issue here

552
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,390
issue here
 

553
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,170
issue here
it just takes them a really long time

554
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,180
it just takes them a really long time
 

555
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,270
it just takes them a really long time
and usually like if we were to give them

556
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:31,280
and usually like if we were to give them
 

557
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,700
and usually like if we were to give them
that much time the whole system would

558
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:33,710
that much time the whole system would
 

559
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,380
that much time the whole system would
back up quite a bit

560
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,390

 

561
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,580

sometimes the zombies will walk that way

562
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:39,590
sometimes the zombies will walk that way
 

563
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,500
sometimes the zombies will walk that way
too I tried giving the skeletons a

564
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:41,510
too I tried giving the skeletons a
 

565
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,080
too I tried giving the skeletons a
bigger platform so that they would go

566
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,090
bigger platform so that they would go
 

567
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,240
bigger platform so that they would go
there quicker run that direction quicker

568
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,250
there quicker run that direction quicker
 

569
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,010
there quicker run that direction quicker
it didn't seem to help though and I

570
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,020
it didn't seem to help though and I
 

571
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,240
it didn't seem to help though and I
think it just made the zombie

572
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,250
think it just made the zombie
 

573
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,890
think it just made the zombie
pathfinding worse because sometimes they

574
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:50,900
pathfinding worse because sometimes they
 

575
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,450
pathfinding worse because sometimes they
don't chase the villager they'll run

576
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:52,460
don't chase the villager they'll run
 

577
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,640
don't chase the villager they'll run
that way too and we have two wolves one

578
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:57,650
that way too and we have two wolves one
 

579
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,960
that way too and we have two wolves one
at the villager there and one over there

580
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:00,970
at the villager there and one over there
 

581
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,070
at the villager there and one over there
I'm not sure that made a difference but

582
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm not sure that made a difference but
 

583
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm not sure that made a difference but
at the very least the skeleton shouldn't

584
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:08,930
at the very least the skeleton shouldn't
 

585
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,390
at the very least the skeleton shouldn't
get stuck around the corner or something

586
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,400
get stuck around the corner or something
 

587
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,030
get stuck around the corner or something
like that and all in all I think it's

588
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,040
like that and all in all I think it's
 

589
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,350
like that and all in all I think it's
good enough whoa the good news is the

590
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:20,360
good enough whoa the good news is the
 

591
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,720
good enough whoa the good news is the
creepers work 100% there's no issues at

592
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:22,730
creepers work 100% there's no issues at
 

593
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,270
creepers work 100% there's no issues at
all with the creepers which is a really

594
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,280
all with the creepers which is a really
 

595
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,120
all with the creepers which is a really
big part of this this is the skeletons

596
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,130
big part of this this is the skeletons
 

597
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,650
big part of this this is the skeletons
and the zombies and the witches that are

598
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:29,660
and the zombies and the witches that are
 

599
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,840
and the zombies and the witches that are
a little bit tricky because we can't

600
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:31,850
a little bit tricky because we can't
 

601
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,600
a little bit tricky because we can't
really control it entirely we have to

602
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:34,610
really control it entirely we have to
 

603
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:41,080
really control it entirely we have to
rely on the back finding here we go

604
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,090
rely on the back finding here we go
 

605
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,210
rely on the back finding here we go
everybody this is the big moment

606
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,220
everybody this is the big moment
 

607
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,890
everybody this is the big moment
I've worked double time on this I got

608
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:44,900
I've worked double time on this I got
 

609
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,220
I've worked double time on this I got
the bomb factory hooked up now and we're

610
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,230
the bomb factory hooked up now and we're
 

611
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,290
the bomb factory hooked up now and we're
running our first test is it gonna blow

612
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:50,300
running our first test is it gonna blow
 

613
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,630
running our first test is it gonna blow
up I have no idea that's what makes it

614
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:52,640
up I have no idea that's what makes it
 

615
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,460
up I have no idea that's what makes it
so exciting and possibly frustrating I

616
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,470
so exciting and possibly frustrating I
 

617
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,410
so exciting and possibly frustrating I
thought we would have got some mobs by

618
00:14:59,410 --> 00:14:59,420
thought we would have got some mobs by
 

619
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,770
thought we would have got some mobs by
now come on I cleared everything out

620
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:02,780
now come on I cleared everything out
 

621
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,640
now come on I cleared everything out
okay here we go first skeleton I'll try

622
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:06,650
okay here we go first skeleton I'll try
 

623
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,570
okay here we go first skeleton I'll try
explain this as it goes though we're off

624
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:10,580
explain this as it goes though we're off
 

625
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,100
explain this as it goes though we're off
to a terrible start okay there we go he

626
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,110
to a terrible start okay there we go he
 

627
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,680
to a terrible start okay there we go he
figured out what to do he's good so you

628
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:14,690
figured out what to do he's good so you
 

629
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,750
figured out what to do he's good so you
can see the creepers now take a new path

630
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:16,760
can see the creepers now take a new path
 

631
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,220
can see the creepers now take a new path
here they go they fall down and you see

632
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,230
here they go they fall down and you see
 

633
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,740
here they go they fall down and you see
we got skeletons in that tube creepers

634
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:23,750
we got skeletons in that tube creepers
 

635
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,570
we got skeletons in that tube creepers
in that one and there's a trapdoor there

636
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:25,580
in that one and there's a trapdoor there
 

637
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,090
in that one and there's a trapdoor there
holding them in place if we press a

638
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,100
holding them in place if we press a
 

639
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,940
holding them in place if we press a
button down there it's gonna flip both

640
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:30,950
button down there it's gonna flip both
 

641
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,560
button down there it's gonna flip both
those trapdoors and let them into the

642
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:32,570
those trapdoors and let them into the
 

643
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,290
those trapdoors and let them into the
bomb factory that's the one thing I'm

644
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:35,300
bomb factory that's the one thing I'm
 

645
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,610
bomb factory that's the one thing I'm
manually controlling right now cuz I

646
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:36,620
manually controlling right now cuz I
 

647
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,230
manually controlling right now cuz I
don't know if it's gonna be explosive in

648
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,240
don't know if it's gonna be explosive in
 

649
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,060
don't know if it's gonna be explosive in
a way that it'll destroy everything so

650
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,070
a way that it'll destroy everything so
 

651
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,460
a way that it'll destroy everything so
let's manually do it possibly it'll send

652
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:48,470
let's manually do it possibly it'll send
 

653
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,530
let's manually do it possibly it'll send
down more than one mob is what I'm

654
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:50,540
down more than one mob is what I'm
 

655
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,810
down more than one mob is what I'm
worried about

656
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:51,820
worried about
 

657
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,400
worried about
that'd look pretty good skeletons still

658
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,410
that'd look pretty good skeletons still
 

659
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,760
that'd look pretty good skeletons still
stuck on that snow golem though okay

660
00:15:59,760 --> 00:15:59,770
stuck on that snow golem though okay
 

661
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,000
stuck on that snow golem though okay
okay

662
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,010
okay
 

663
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,130
okay
might not blow up now cuz I took a long

664
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,140
might not blow up now cuz I took a long
 

665
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,520
might not blow up now cuz I took a long
time okay very good first first one that

666
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:06,530
time okay very good first first one that
 

667
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,200
time okay very good first first one that
could success oh yeah see we got two

668
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,210
could success oh yeah see we got two
 

669
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,820
could success oh yeah see we got two
skeletons in there mmm is that gonna be

670
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:15,830
skeletons in there mmm is that gonna be
 

671
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,040
skeletons in there mmm is that gonna be
a big problem if that keeps happening we

672
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,050
a big problem if that keeps happening we
 

673
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,240
a big problem if that keeps happening we
kind of got to keep this thing running

674
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,250
kind of got to keep this thing running
 

675
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,990
kind of got to keep this thing running
otherwise it backs up you know uh-huh

676
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,000
otherwise it backs up you know uh-huh
 

677
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,080
otherwise it backs up you know uh-huh
okay this time we got one skeleton

678
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,090
okay this time we got one skeleton
 

679
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,390
okay this time we got one skeleton
that's good yeah let's keep it going

680
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,400
that's good yeah let's keep it going
 

681
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,160
that's good yeah let's keep it going
keep it going

682
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,170
keep it going
 

683
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,020
keep it going
so this will probably run on a clock -

684
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,030
so this will probably run on a clock -
 

685
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:44,950
so this will probably run on a clock -
maybe not as quick as that bill uh-huh

686
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:44,960
maybe not as quick as that bill uh-huh
 

687
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,630
maybe not as quick as that bill uh-huh
they're not blowing up though because

688
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:46,640
they're not blowing up though because
 

689
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,610
they're not blowing up though because
it's taking the skeleton too long to get

690
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:48,620
it's taking the skeleton too long to get
 

691
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,120
it's taking the skeleton too long to get
there

692
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,130
there
 

693
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,950
there
and then the creeper loses interest I

694
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:52,960
and then the creeper loses interest I
 

695
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,420
and then the creeper loses interest I
think they're all primed properly so I

696
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:55,430
think they're all primed properly so I
 

697
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,600
think they're all primed properly so I
think I think we're good

698
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:00,610

 

699
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,490

so go ahead skeleton skeleton shoots

700
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:03,500
so go ahead skeleton skeleton shoots
 

701
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,730
so go ahead skeleton skeleton shoots
creeper ants

702
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:05,740
creeper ants
 

703
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,809
creeper ants
kablammo nice size shirt in the tube

704
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:10,819
kablammo nice size shirt in the tube
 

705
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,910
kablammo nice size shirt in the tube
here just so that the skeleton again to

706
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:12,920
here just so that the skeleton again to
 

707
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,380
here just so that the skeleton again to
place quick enough that's one thing

708
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,390
place quick enough that's one thing
 

709
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,540
place quick enough that's one thing
we'll have to look into in the future

710
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:16,550
we'll have to look into in the future
 

711
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,610
we'll have to look into in the future
how to make them travel long distances

712
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:18,620
how to make them travel long distances
 

713
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,390
how to make them travel long distances
without losing interest in each other

714
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:21,400
without losing interest in each other
 

715
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,650
without losing interest in each other
which we kind of figured out already we

716
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:23,660
which we kind of figured out already we
 

717
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,870
which we kind of figured out already we
just gotta keep them close to each other

718
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:25,880
just gotta keep them close to each other
 

719
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,800
just gotta keep them close to each other
oh and snow golems dead that's why we

720
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:29,810
oh and snow golems dead that's why we
 

721
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,650
oh and snow golems dead that's why we
can't really detonate this close to the

722
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:32,660
can't really detonate this close to the
 

723
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,420
can't really detonate this close to the
thing uh-huh

724
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,430
thing uh-huh
 

725
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,680
thing uh-huh
it looks like it's gonna be working

726
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:35,690
it looks like it's gonna be working
 

727
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,740
it looks like it's gonna be working
that's good we'll probably use minecarts

728
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:38,750
that's good we'll probably use minecarts
 

729
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,330
that's good we'll probably use minecarts
to move them not water streams

730
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:40,340
to move them not water streams
 

731
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,250
to move them not water streams
especially with the new update coming

732
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,260
especially with the new update coming
 

733
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,540
especially with the new update coming
out that's gonna change all the water

734
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:43,550
out that's gonna change all the water
 

735
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,320
out that's gonna change all the water
stream mechanics I don't know what's

736
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,330
stream mechanics I don't know what's
 

737
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,700
stream mechanics I don't know what's
gonna have to change with what we built

738
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:48,710
gonna have to change with what we built
 

739
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,220
gonna have to change with what we built
here but we only have like four water

740
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,230
here but we only have like four water
 

741
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,020
here but we only have like four water
streams and the whole thing so hopefully

742
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,030
streams and the whole thing so hopefully
 

743
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,090
streams and the whole thing so hopefully
not too much trouble I'll get the dog

744
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,100
not too much trouble I'll get the dog
 

745
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,230
not too much trouble I'll get the dog
he's like shaking his head at us yeah

746
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
he's like shaking his head at us yeah
 

747
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,930
he's like shaking his head at us yeah
anyway so we got our mob sorter pretty

748
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:04,940
anyway so we got our mob sorter pretty
 

749
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,580
anyway so we got our mob sorter pretty
much working there maybe eighty ninety

750
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:06,590
much working there maybe eighty ninety
 

751
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,320
much working there maybe eighty ninety
percent accurate and we got our bomb

752
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,330
percent accurate and we got our bomb
 

753
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,880
percent accurate and we got our bomb
factory hooked up so I'm pretty happy

754
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:09,890
factory hooked up so I'm pretty happy
 

755
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,370
factory hooked up so I'm pretty happy
with that and we'll probably expand more

756
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,380
with that and we'll probably expand more
 

757
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,950
with that and we'll probably expand more
on that later but we still got a few

758
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
on that later but we still got a few
 

759
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,360
on that later but we still got a few
minutes left this episode I thought we

760
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,370
minutes left this episode I thought we
 

761
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,280
minutes left this episode I thought we
would change it up do some building and

762
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,290
would change it up do some building and
 

763
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,050
would change it up do some building and
I have a great idea absolutely

764
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,060
I have a great idea absolutely
 

765
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,450
I have a great idea absolutely
magnificent vision for this building

766
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:25,460
magnificent vision for this building
 

767
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,240
magnificent vision for this building
here are you ready for its it's gonna

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,250
here are you ready for its it's gonna
 

769
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,910
here are you ready for its it's gonna
look pretty weird actually probably if

770
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:30,920
look pretty weird actually probably if
 

771
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,190
look pretty weird actually probably if
you guys don't remember this is our sand

772
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
you guys don't remember this is our sand

yeah it still works so the yellow sand

778
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:41,559
yeah it still works so the yellow sand
 

779
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,520
yeah it still works so the yellow sand
turns to orange sands and then goes into

780
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,530
turns to orange sands and then goes into
 

781
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,210
turns to orange sands and then goes into
storage down here and there's some

782
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,220
storage down here and there's some
 

783
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,029
storage down here and there's some
garbage here too apparently uh-huh but

784
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
garbage here too apparently uh-huh but
 

785
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,130
garbage here too apparently uh-huh but
we still don't have a skin for this so I

786
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,140
we still don't have a skin for this so I
 

787
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,870
we still don't have a skin for this so I
thought we tried make a building around

788
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
thought we tried make a building around
 

789
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,669
thought we tried make a building around
it's it's so we don't see the Pistons

790
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:56,679
it's it's so we don't see the Pistons
 

791
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,820
it's it's so we don't see the Pistons
and stuff and I have an idea for an

792
00:18:59,820 --> 00:18:59,830
and stuff and I have an idea for an
 

793
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,610
and stuff and I have an idea for an
abstract build which might look a little

794
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:02,620
abstract build which might look a little
 

795
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,330
abstract build which might look a little
funny we'll see if we make it look cool

796
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:05,340
funny we'll see if we make it look cool
 

797
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,370
funny we'll see if we make it look cool
we're gonna mix prismarine the dark

798
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:08,380
we're gonna mix prismarine the dark
 

799
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,120
we're gonna mix prismarine the dark
prismarine with orange maybe terracotta

800
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,130
prismarine with orange maybe terracotta
 

801
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,980
prismarine with orange maybe terracotta
maybe sandstone would be cool because

802
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:13,990
maybe sandstone would be cool because
 

803
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,890
maybe sandstone would be cool because
this is a sandstone maker right if we

804
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:16,900
this is a sandstone maker right if we
 

805
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,049
this is a sandstone maker right if we
mix some of that into it would be a good

806
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:19,059
mix some of that into it would be a good
 

807
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:24,570
mix some of that into it would be a good
idea if I want to do like basically the

808
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:24,580
idea if I want to do like basically the
 

809
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:31,169
idea if I want to do like basically the
rough idea is to I hope it doesn't stand

810
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:31,179
rough idea is to I hope it doesn't stand
 

811
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:33,000
rough idea is to I hope it doesn't stand
out too much in this area too is another

812
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,010
out too much in this area too is another
 

813
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,560
out too much in this area too is another
concern of mine cuz it's gonna be a

814
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:34,570
concern of mine cuz it's gonna be a
 

815
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,970
concern of mine cuz it's gonna be a
little bit different than what we built

816
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:35,980
little bit different than what we built
 

817
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,060
little bit different than what we built
over there basically we're gonna have on

818
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,070
over there basically we're gonna have on
 

819
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,169
over there basically we're gonna have on
one side of the building like a curved

820
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:43,179
one side of the building like a curved
 

821
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,750
one side of the building like a curved
up like that and then on the other side

822
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
up like that and then on the other side
 

823
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,250
up like that and then on the other side
we're gonna have a curve going the

824
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:47,260
we're gonna have a curve going the
 

825
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,200
we're gonna have a curve going the
opposite way

826
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,210
opposite way
 

827
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,000
opposite way
let's space it let's see one two three

828
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,010
let's space it let's see one two three
 

829
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,210
let's space it let's see one two three
four five six seven eight nine maybe

830
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:54,220
four five six seven eight nine maybe
 

831
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,930
four five six seven eight nine maybe
nine blocks apart so we'll go up like

832
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:57,940
nine blocks apart so we'll go up like
 

833
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,720
nine blocks apart so we'll go up like
that and then start curving it this way

834
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:00,730
that and then start curving it this way
 

835
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,320
that and then start curving it this way
and this is gonna be the big curve so

836
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,330
and this is gonna be the big curve so
 

837
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,830
and this is gonna be the big curve so
it's gonna go like amazing right I know

838
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
it's gonna go like amazing right I know
 

839
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,590
it's gonna go like amazing right I know
uh-huh very good okay let's go see it

840
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:16,600
uh-huh very good okay let's go see it
 

841
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,880
uh-huh very good okay let's go see it
this is gonna be amazing

842
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:17,890
this is gonna be amazing
 

843
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,279
this is gonna be amazing
oh my goodness

844
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:22,289
oh my goodness
 

845
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:27,210
oh my goodness
so beautiful alright let's remove this

846
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:27,220
so beautiful alright let's remove this
 

847
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,070
so beautiful alright let's remove this
eye space the two more blocks apart so

848
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,080
eye space the two more blocks apart so
 

849
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,950
eye space the two more blocks apart so
it's 11 wide very simple concept right

850
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
it's 11 wide very simple concept right
 

851
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,890
it's 11 wide very simple concept right
looks incredible I don't know how I do

852
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:37,900
looks incredible I don't know how I do
 

853
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,310
looks incredible I don't know how I do
it

854
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
it
 

855
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,560
it
basically all we gotta do now is fill in

856
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:40,570
basically all we gotta do now is fill in
 

857
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,470
basically all we gotta do now is fill in
here with orange clay probably mix some

858
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:43,480
here with orange clay probably mix some
 

859
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,640
here with orange clay probably mix some
sandstone in with that too and then

860
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:47,650
sandstone in with that too and then
 

861
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,200
sandstone in with that too and then
we'll take it from there we'll see what

862
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,210
we'll take it from there we'll see what
 

863
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,860
we'll take it from there we'll see what
it looks like

864
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:50,870
it looks like
 

865
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,930
it looks like
okay let's just do a little bit actually

866
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:52,940
okay let's just do a little bit actually
 

867
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,550
okay let's just do a little bit actually
and then we'll we'll step back and look

868
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:54,560
and then we'll we'll step back and look
 

869
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:02,070
and then we'll we'll step back and look
at it and be impressed oh yeah

870
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080

 

871
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,210

incredible I think the curve is too long

872
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,220
incredible I think the curve is too long
 

873
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,830
incredible I think the curve is too long
I think we got to remove one of the one

874
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
I think we got to remove one of the one
 

875
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,520
I think we got to remove one of the one
of the tails there you know what it's

876
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:09,530
of the tails there you know what it's
 

877
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,680
of the tails there you know what it's
hard to tweak perfection but I found a

878
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,690
hard to tweak perfection but I found a
 

879
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,470
hard to tweak perfection but I found a
way somehow here so I made it a little

880
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
way somehow here so I made it a little
 

881
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,390
way somehow here so I made it a little
bit less crazy a little bit smaller and

882
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
bit less crazy a little bit smaller and
 

883
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
bit less crazy a little bit smaller and
I don't think it's quite as wide anymore

884
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,410
I don't think it's quite as wide anymore
 

885
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:18,910
I don't think it's quite as wide anymore
either

886
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:18,920
either
 

887
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,490
either
and I think this is our shape I think we

888
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:21,500
and I think this is our shape I think we
 

889
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,590
and I think this is our shape I think we
got it figured out kind of reminds you

890
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
got it figured out kind of reminds you
 

891
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,500
got it figured out kind of reminds you
of day of the tentacle huh no maybe a

892
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,510
of day of the tentacle huh no maybe a
 

893
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,930
of day of the tentacle huh no maybe a
little bit that is the inspiration for

894
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:28,940
little bit that is the inspiration for
 

895
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,560
little bit that is the inspiration for
the build which is why it is such a good

896
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:32,570
the build which is why it is such a good
 

897
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:38,620
the build which is why it is such a good
build okay so now what we got to do the

898
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:38,630
build okay so now what we got to do the
 

899
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,140
build okay so now what we got to do the
trick guys with all builds is the

900
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,150
trick guys with all builds is the
 

901
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,530
trick guys with all builds is the
details right always with the details so

902
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:44,540
details right always with the details so
 

903
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,710
details right always with the details so
I want to try put the tentacley thingies

904
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:47,720
I want to try put the tentacley thingies
 

905
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,770
I want to try put the tentacley thingies
in I don't know they're called the

906
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:50,780
in I don't know they're called the
 

907
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:57,750
in I don't know they're called the
suction cups you know go to for I guess

908
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
suction cups you know go to for I guess
 

909
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:05,040
suction cups you know go to for I guess
maybe three oh hello

910
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,050
maybe three oh hello
 

911
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,090
maybe three oh hello
okay very good

912
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:09,100
okay very good
 

913
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,280
okay very good
what if we go to two three only because

914
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,290
what if we go to two three only because
 

915
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,890
what if we go to two three only because
the kind of messes up that the order

916
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:14,900
the kind of messes up that the order
 

917
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:21,220
the kind of messes up that the order
here or the proportions yeah yeah okay

918
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,230
here or the proportions yeah yeah okay
 

919
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,750
here or the proportions yeah yeah okay
okay now next plan we are gonna grab

920
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:25,760
okay now next plan we are gonna grab
 

921
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,930
okay now next plan we are gonna grab
some of this glowstone and possibly

922
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:28,940
some of this glowstone and possibly
 

923
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,450
some of this glowstone and possibly
fences dark oak let's make some dark oak

924
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:31,460
fences dark oak let's make some dark oak
 

925
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:38,640
fences dark oak let's make some dark oak
stairs as well do that and let's use the

926
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:38,650
stairs as well do that and let's use the
 

927
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,900
stairs as well do that and let's use the
cool crafting system there we go we got

928
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,910
cool crafting system there we go we got
 

929
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,550
cool crafting system there we go we got
some dark oak stairs and what we're

930
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:45,560
some dark oak stairs and what we're
 

931
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,380
some dark oak stairs and what we're
gonna do

932
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:46,390
gonna do
 

933
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,610
gonna do
it's good it's nighttime million I see

934
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:48,620
it's good it's nighttime million I see
 

935
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,350
it's good it's nighttime million I see
we can get a better idea of how the

936
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,360
we can get a better idea of how the
 

937
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,140
we can get a better idea of how the
lighting is gonna look here we're gonna

938
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,150
lighting is gonna look here we're gonna
 

939
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,000
lighting is gonna look here we're gonna
make this come out two blocks then

940
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,010
make this come out two blocks then
 

941
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:01,660
make this come out two blocks then
stairs then glowstone yeah that helps a

942
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:01,670
stairs then glowstone yeah that helps a
 

943
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,790
stairs then glowstone yeah that helps a
lot okay and then around that we'll

944
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:03,800
lot okay and then around that we'll
 

945
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,810
lot okay and then around that we'll
probably put some trap

946
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:04,820
probably put some trap
 

947
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,310
probably put some trap
do we have screws yeah I did bring some

948
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
do we have screws yeah I did bring some
 

949
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,360
do we have screws yeah I did bring some
all right yes yes it's very good right

950
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,370
all right yes yes it's very good right
 

951
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,730
all right yes yes it's very good right
very good but it's missing our secret

952
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:15,740
very good but it's missing our secret
 

953
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,420
very good but it's missing our secret
weapon

954

what does every build Nev Nev oh I gave

956
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:20,570
what does every build Nev Nev oh I gave
 

957
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,330
what does every build Nev Nev oh I gave
a little spoiler need is birch leaves

958
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:25,340
