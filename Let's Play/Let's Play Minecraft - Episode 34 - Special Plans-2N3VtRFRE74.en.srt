and I've built this sort of wall thing

42
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
and I've built this sort of wall thing
 

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,530
and I've built this sort of wall thing
so the items in the dispensers are

44

so the items in the dispensers are
 

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,080
so the items in the dispensers are
represented above more or less they're a

46
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,090
represented above more or less they're a
 

47
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,700
represented above more or less they're a
little bit hard to see though but but

48
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:52,710
little bit hard to see though but but
 

49
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,190
little bit hard to see though but but
they're pretty good I might make this

50
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
they're pretty good I might make this
 

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,709
they're pretty good I might make this
track one block higher have like this

52
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
track one block higher have like this
 

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,130
track one block higher have like this
center part raised so that there's a

54
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:03,140
center part raised so that there's a
 

55
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,859
center part raised so that there's a
wooden stair on the side and this side

56
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:06,869
wooden stair on the side and this side
 

57
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,980
wooden stair on the side and this side
and this will be one block higher

58
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:09,990
and this will be one block higher
 

59
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,840
and this will be one block higher
as if you're on a block you can see them

60

116
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
rate is dropping I think it might be
 

117
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,750
rate is dropping I think it might be
because of this wall here I'm not sure

118
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:22,760
because of this wall here I'm not sure
 

119
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,280
because of this wall here I'm not sure
which kind of sucks because I still got

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,290
which kind of sucks because I still got
 

121
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,920
which kind of sucks because I still got
a lot of things I want to build here I

122
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:26,930
a lot of things I want to build here I
 

123
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,140
a lot of things I want to build here I
might get rid of this lava place it with

124
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,150
might get rid of this lava place it with
 

125
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,720
might get rid of this lava place it with
torches and see if that helps over here

126
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:35,730
torches and see if that helps over here
 

127
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,260
torches and see if that helps over here
I got torches all along these are wooden

128
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,270
I got torches all along these are wooden
 

129
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,460
I got torches all along these are wooden
stairs and that allows light to pass

130
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:43,470
stairs and that allows light to pass
 

131
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:54,530
stairs and that allows light to pass
through them and I might try to destroy

132
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:54,540
through them and I might try to destroy
 

133
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,780
through them and I might try to destroy
this wall and see if it increases my

134
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:56,790
this wall and see if it increases my
 

135
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,940
this wall and see if it increases my
framerate because I think it's started

136
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:58,950
framerate because I think it's started
 

137
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:08,810
framerate because I think it's started
to drop after I built it so something I

138
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:08,820
to drop after I built it so something I
 

139
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,570
to drop after I built it so something I
just did now as I replaced my water

140
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:11,580
just did now as I replaced my water
 

141
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,360
just did now as I replaced my water
block at the top of ladder

143
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,350

and I've always been afraid to do that

144
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
and I've always been afraid to do that
 

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
and I've always been afraid to do that
because I thought it some of the drops

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,570
because I thought it some of the drops
 

147
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,830
because I thought it some of the drops
from the mobs get burnt but it seems to

148
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
from the mobs get burnt but it seems to
 

149
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,080
from the mobs get burnt but it seems to
be working 100% I haven't seen any of

150
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,090
be working 100% I haven't seen any of
 

151
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,980
be working 100% I haven't seen any of
them get run yet it's nice because I

152
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:39,990
them get run yet it's nice because I
 

153
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,230
them get run yet it's nice because I
don't have to listen to them screaming

154
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
don't have to listen to them screaming
 

155
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,770
don't have to listen to them screaming
in that for nearly as long so okay I'm

156
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:48,780
in that for nearly as long so okay I'm
 

157
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,650
in that for nearly as long so okay I'm
going to keep it there I'm probably

158
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:51,660
going to keep it there I'm probably
 

159
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,969
going to keep it there I'm probably
going to overhaul my whole mob system

160
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:55,979
going to overhaul my whole mob system
 

161
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,469
going to overhaul my whole mob system

door stay open for two seconds or longer
 

181
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,040

if you press a button on a door a lot of
 

185
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,610
if you press a button on a door a lot of
times you'll try to walk through it and

186
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:53,620
times you'll try to walk through it and
 

187
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,230
times you'll try to walk through it and
it's closed by the time you get there

188

this is what I came up with works pretty

192
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
this is what I came up with works pretty
 

193
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,890
this is what I came up with works pretty
good

194
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:10,900

 

195
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,879

it's an RS nor latch by fault

196
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:14,889
it's an RS nor latch by fault
 

197
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,120
it's an RS nor latch by fault
it sends no power to the door when you

198
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,130
it sends no power to the door when you
 

199
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,149
it sends no power to the door when you
press a button it switches the latch so

200
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:21,159
press a button it switches the latch so
 

201
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:26,070
press a button it switches the latch so
that it's powered and then it also sends

202
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
that it's powered and then it also sends
 

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,430
that it's powered and then it also sends
power to this delay here which you can

204
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
power to this delay here which you can
 

205
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,029
power to this delay here which you can
make is however long you want and

206
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:32,039
make is however long you want and
 

207
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,159
make is however long you want and
that'll just how long the door stays

208
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,169
that'll just how long the door stays
 

209
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,370
that'll just how long the door stays
open then it goes back to the RS nor

210
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,380
open then it goes back to the RS nor
 

211
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,650
open then it goes back to the RS nor
latch and sets it off again

212
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:44,660

577
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,940
idea for me because I get to build
cannons which I love doing and it's a

578
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:05,950
cannons which I love doing and it's a
 

579
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,740
cannons which I love doing and it's a
fun idea for you guys because you got to

580
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:07,750
fun idea for you guys because you got to
 

581
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,240
fun idea for you guys because you got to
watch the cannon display and you get to

582
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,250
watch the cannon display and you get to
 

583
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,550
watch the cannon display and you get to
see the champions too and I was making

584
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:17,560
see the champions too and I was making
 

585
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,380
see the champions too and I was making
every one of them different but then

586
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,390
every one of them different but then
 

587
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,379
every one of them different but then
yeah

588
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:25,389

 

589
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,359

I thought this cannon was going to be

590
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:27,369
I thought this cannon was going to be
 

591
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:28,889
I thought this cannon was going to be
really awesome because it has a

592
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:28,899
really awesome because it has a
 

593
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,729
really awesome because it has a
compressor system which makes all the TV

594
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:32,739
compressor system which makes all the TV
 

595
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:36,269
compressor system which makes all the TV
boosters gather in the same place close

596
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:36,279
boosters gather in the same place close
 

597
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,119
boosters gather in the same place close
to the payload which should increase the

598
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:39,129
to the payload which should increase the
 

599
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,599
to the payload which should increase the
power of the cannon by a lot but I

600
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:42,609
power of the cannon by a lot but I
 

601
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:46,169
power of the cannon by a lot but I
overlooked the fact that the TNT blast

602
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:46,179
overlooked the fact that the TNT blast
 

603
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:52,259
overlooked the fact that the TNT blast
doesn't transfer with it and haven't

604
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:52,269
doesn't transfer with it and haven't
 

605
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:58,259
doesn't transfer with it and haven't
been back to your since that kind of

606
00:18:58,259 --> 00:18:58,269
been back to your since that kind of
 

607
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,599
been back to your since that kind of
sucked

00:18:59,599 --> 00:18:59,609
