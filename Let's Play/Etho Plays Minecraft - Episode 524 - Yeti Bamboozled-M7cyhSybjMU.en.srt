redstone is working yeah

84
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:13,530
redstone is working yeah
 

85
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,440
redstone is working yeah
right so it's it's not quite done it's

86
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,450
right so it's it's not quite done it's
 

87
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,380
right so it's it's not quite done it's
almost done we got to build one more

88
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,390
almost done we got to build one more
 

89
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,930
almost done we got to build one more
piece to this thing it's gonna be quick

90
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:20,940
piece to this thing it's gonna be quick
 

91
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,680
piece to this thing it's gonna be quick
though we need to add some way of

92
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,690
though we need to add some way of
 

93
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,510
though we need to add some way of
clipping all the ice together so it

94
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:26,520
clipping all the ice together so it
 

95
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,600
clipping all the ice together so it
funnels down each of these lanes falls

96
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,610
funnels down each of these lanes falls
 

97
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,520
funnels down each of these lanes falls
down this hole let's go down you see it

98
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,530
down this hole let's go down you see it
 

99
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,010
down this hole let's go down you see it
all combines to here that shouldn't be

100
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,020
all combines to here that shouldn't be
 

101
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,740
all combines to here that shouldn't be
there goes and it just ends right here

102
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:39,750
there goes and it just ends right here
 

103
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,320
there goes and it just ends right here
so we got to make some way of funneling

104
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,330
so we got to make some way of funneling
 

105
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,610
so we got to make some way of funneling
this up and putting in a chest or

106
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:43,620
this up and putting in a chest or
 

107
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,009
this up and putting in a chest or
something is the last step to this whole

108
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:46,019
something is the last step to this whole
 

109
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,949
something is the last step to this whole
process so we'll probably put like water

110
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
process so we'll probably put like water
 

111
00:02:48,959 --> 00:03:02,900
process so we'll probably put like water
elevator here all right good stuff so

112
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:02,910
elevator here all right good stuff so
 

113
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,910
elevator here all right good stuff so
now whenever ice falls down one of these

114
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:04,920
now whenever ice falls down one of these
 

115
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,890
now whenever ice falls down one of these
holes it's all clicks together and it

116
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:06,900
holes it's all clicks together and it
 

117
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,870
holes it's all clicks together and it
ends up at the top of our water elevator

118
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:08,880
ends up at the top of our water elevator
 

119
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,460
ends up at the top of our water elevator
here well that actually really flies

120
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:10,470
here well that actually really flies
 

121
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,460
here well that actually really flies
doesn't it okay let's maybe put a

122
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,470
doesn't it okay let's maybe put a
 

123
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,210
doesn't it okay let's maybe put a
covering over this so it doesn't do that

124
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,220
covering over this so it doesn't do that
 

125
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,380
covering over this so it doesn't do that
because if it's got a little bit of

126
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,390
because if it's got a little bit of
 

127
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,449
because if it's got a little bit of
horizontal momentum it's gonna fly out

128
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:20,459
horizontal momentum it's gonna fly out
 

129
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,970
horizontal momentum it's gonna fly out
of there all right that'll stop that

130
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:22,980
of there all right that'll stop that
 

131
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,819
of there all right that'll stop that
from happening so one thing we're gonna

132
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:25,829
from happening so one thing we're gonna
 

133
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,220
from happening so one thing we're gonna
set up a chest array now to store this I

134
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,230
set up a chest array now to store this I
 

135
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,640
set up a chest array now to store this I
think we want to start knot right here

136
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:31,650
think we want to start knot right here
 

137
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,310
think we want to start knot right here
actually yeah I'm just gonna put down

138
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,320
actually yeah I'm just gonna put down
 

139
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,289
actually yeah I'm just gonna put down
five rows of chess like a so so with our

140
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:39,299
five rows of chess like a so so with our
 

141
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,550
five rows of chess like a so so with our
ice farm we're probably gonna be

142
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
ice farm we're probably gonna be
 

143
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,110
ice farm we're probably gonna be
harvesting ice at about 10 10 icebox per

144
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
harvesting ice at about 10 10 icebox per
 

145
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,849
harvesting ice at about 10 10 icebox per
second maybe even more than that which

146
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:46,859
second maybe even more than that which
 

147
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,099
second maybe even more than that which
is like way faster than a hopper can

148
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:49,109
is like way faster than a hopper can
 

149
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,920
is like way faster than a hopper can
keep up with so we need multiple hoppers

150
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:51,930
keep up with so we need multiple hoppers
 

151
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,560
keep up with so we need multiple hoppers
running and storing this ice all at once

152
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,570
running and storing this ice all at once
 

153
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,120
running and storing this ice all at once
otherwise it's gonna back up and

154
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,130
otherwise it's gonna back up and
 

155
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,690
otherwise it's gonna back up and
overflow and it'll just despawn on us so

156
00:03:59,690 --> 00:03:59,700
overflow and it'll just despawn on us so
 

157
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,970
overflow and it'll just despawn on us so
I'm gonna try set up a chest array like

158
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:01,980
I'm gonna try set up a chest array like
 

159
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,060
I'm gonna try set up a chest array like
this it's a bunch of them together

160
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,070
this it's a bunch of them together
 

161
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,130
this it's a bunch of them together
nothing too fancy right oh that was a

162
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,140
nothing too fancy right oh that was a
 

163
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,080
nothing too fancy right oh that was a
bad place I did so good until the very

164
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,090
bad place I did so good until the very
 

165
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,050
bad place I did so good until the very
last one oh now I can't do it so it does

166
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,060
last one oh now I can't do it so it does
 

167
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,949
last one oh now I can't do it so it does
it not attach if it's facing that way

168
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
it not attach if it's facing that way
 

169
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,659
it not attach if it's facing that way
seems that way so it has to attach to

170
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:17,669
seems that way so it has to attach to
 

171
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,920
seems that way so it has to attach to
the side now that it's side facing it

172
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:21,930
the side now that it's side facing it
 

173
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,469
the side now that it's side facing it
will attach yeah Oh interesting still

174
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
will attach yeah Oh interesting still
 

175
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,430
will attach yeah Oh interesting still
getting used to that

176
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
getting used to that
 

177
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,170
getting used to that
it's very strange

178
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,180
it's very strange
 

179
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,390
it's very strange
so what we do we just set up hoppers

180
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,400
so what we do we just set up hoppers
 

181
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,590
so what we do we just set up hoppers
running all along here underneath so

182
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
running all along here underneath so
 

183
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,659
running all along here underneath so
that way like when this one fills up

184
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:35,669
that way like when this one fills up
 

185
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,279
that way like when this one fills up
it'll go to the next one that'll fill up

186
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,289
it'll go to the next one that'll fill up
 

187
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,200
it'll go to the next one that'll fill up
then the next one next one next one that

188
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,210
then the next one next one next one that
 

189
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,270
then the next one next one next one that
way five sets of hoppers will be running

190
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
way five sets of hoppers will be running
 

191
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,370
way five sets of hoppers will be running
at the same time and be able to keep up

192
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:43,380
at the same time and be able to keep up
 

193
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,430
at the same time and be able to keep up
with the rate we're getting nice and

194
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:46,440
with the rate we're getting nice and
 

195
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,610
with the rate we're getting nice and
I'll split into the chests you know

196
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:48,620
I'll split into the chests you know
 

197
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,840
I'll split into the chests you know
it'll fill up from the bottom first and

198
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:50,850
it'll fill up from the bottom first and
 

199
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,390
it'll fill up from the bottom first and
then fill its way up to the top chest in

200
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,400
then fill its way up to the top chest in
 

201
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,570
then fill its way up to the top chest in
each of the rows so all we got to do is

202
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:56,580
each of the rows so all we got to do is
 

203
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,020
each of the rows so all we got to do is
add one more block of water to this

204
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,030
add one more block of water to this
 

205
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,770
add one more block of water to this
right and it's good to go oh and I do

206
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:03,780
right and it's good to go oh and I do
 

207
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,540
right and it's good to go oh and I do
have water very good yeah and I guess

208
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,550
have water very good yeah and I guess
 

209
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,200
have water very good yeah and I guess
I'll just cover this all - all right

210
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,210
I'll just cover this all - all right

214
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:15,570
our first harvest now that the the farm
 

215
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,510
our first harvest now that the the farm
is complete and hopefully working

216
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
is complete and hopefully working
 

217
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,999
is complete and hopefully working
flawlessly Oh sometimes on the start you

218
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,009
flawlessly Oh sometimes on the start you
 

219
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,140
flawlessly Oh sometimes on the start you
got to get a good rhythm going

220
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,150
got to get a good rhythm going
 

221
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,730

223
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,230
good rim you know you need that rim all
right this is good so I think the pick

224
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
right this is good so I think the pick
 

225
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,390
right this is good so I think the pick
isn't gonna last the whole farm though

226
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
isn't gonna last the whole farm though
 

227
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,129
isn't gonna last the whole farm though
we're gonna run out of durability so

228
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:40,139
we're gonna run out of durability so
 

229
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,320
we're gonna run out of durability so
I'll just go until that happens but we

230
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,330
I'll just go until that happens but we
 

231
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,570
I'll just go until that happens but we
should be able to do most of it and

232
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,580
should be able to do most of it and
 

233
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,420
should be able to do most of it and
basically we just go along here there's

234
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,430
basically we just go along here there's
 

235
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,939
basically we just go along here there's
a spot there that doesn't freeze because

236
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:49,949
a spot there that doesn't freeze because
 

237
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,610
a spot there that doesn't freeze because
it's a different vial and we got little

238
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:52,620
it's a different vial and we got little
 

239
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,200
it's a different vial and we got little
pushers here so when we get to the end

240
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,210
pushers here so when we get to the end
 

241
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,450
pushers here so when we get to the end
it like launches us forward so we don't

242
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,460
it like launches us forward so we don't
 

243
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,670
it like launches us forward so we don't
have to walk forward and you saw some

244
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,680
have to walk forward and you saw some
 

245
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,290
have to walk forward and you saw some
Isis fell down the hole there so then we

246
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,300
Isis fell down the hole there so then we
 

247
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,950
Isis fell down the hole there so then we
go to the next one and the same thing as

248
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:03,960
go to the next one and the same thing as
 

249
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,050
go to the next one and the same thing as

bit lag has me worried I think that ice
 

257
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,740
bit lag has me worried I think that ice
should be going into those chests like

258
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:18,750
should be going into those chests like
 

259
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,670
should be going into those chests like
that look good right we'll see if the

260
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:22,680
that look good right we'll see if the
 

261
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,560
that look good right we'll see if the
primary tanks anymore if it does we

262
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,570
primary tanks anymore if it does we
 

263
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,409
primary tanks anymore if it does we
probably have a problem somewhere

264
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:26,419
probably have a problem somewhere
 

265
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,930

whole thing is it frozen at the start
here not quite so we would have to wait

316
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,320
here not quite so we would have to wait
 

317
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,370
here not quite so we would have to wait
awhile for the next batch when we made

318
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,380
awhile for the next batch when we made
 

319
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,870
awhile for the next batch when we made
the farm the kind of the goal was to

320
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:41,880
the farm the kind of the goal was to
 

321
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,940
the farm the kind of the goal was to
have it all frozen at the start by the

322
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:43,950
have it all frozen at the start by the
 

323
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,240
have it all frozen at the start by the
time we got back there but it looks like

324
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,250
time we got back there but it looks like
 

325
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,680
time we got back there but it looks like
we got to wait probably 5 minutes or 10

326
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:48,690
we got to wait probably 5 minutes or 10
 

327
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,280
we got to wait probably 5 minutes or 10
minutes for this to finish freezing

328
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,290
minutes for this to finish freezing
 

329
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,340
minutes for this to finish freezing
close though it's very close this is

330
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,350
close though it's very close this is
 

331
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,630
close though it's very close this is
this backed up at all there's 5 hoppers

332
00:07:59,630 --> 00:07:59,640
this backed up at all there's 5 hoppers
 

333
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,040
this backed up at all there's 5 hoppers
enough it looks like 5 hoppers isn't

334
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,050
enough it looks like 5 hoppers isn't
 

335
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,630
enough it looks like 5 hoppers isn't
enough soon assuming it went in here

336
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:02,640
enough soon assuming it went in here
 

337
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,650
enough soon assuming it went in here
even yeah it's going in excellent

338
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:06,660
even yeah it's going in excellent
 

339
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,450
even yeah it's going in excellent
oh yeah so these last two barely got

340
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:08,460
oh yeah so these last two barely got
 

341
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,300
oh yeah so these last two barely got
used even just a little bit of overflow

342
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,310
used even just a little bit of overflow
 

343
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,640
used even just a little bit of overflow
in there so it's mainly the first 3 so 3

344
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:13,650
in there so it's mainly the first 3 so 3
 

345
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,550
in there so it's mainly the first 3 so 3
hoppers is kind of enough oh man yeah

346
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
hoppers is kind of enough oh man yeah
 

347
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,810
hoppers is kind of enough oh man yeah
that actually worked really well I'm

348
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:17,820
that actually worked really well I'm
 

349
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,330
that actually worked really well I'm
very happy with that so it took about 7

350
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,340
very happy with that so it took about 7
 

351
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,920
very happy with that so it took about 7
minutes I just checked the video 7

352
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:21,930
minutes I just checked the video 7
 

353
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,810
minutes I just checked the video 7
minutes to do the full harvest all 15

354
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:23,820
minutes to do the full harvest all 15
 

355
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,740
minutes to do the full harvest all 15
rows which is not too bad and I guess a

356
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:27,750
rows which is not too bad and I guess a
 

357
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,080
rows which is not too bad and I guess a
lot of the ice was in these top 5 chests

358
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,090
lot of the ice was in these top 5 chests
 

359
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,540
lot of the ice was in these top 5 chests
so it fills up the top and the bottom at

360
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:32,550
so it fills up the top and the bottom at
 

361
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,060
so it fills up the top and the bottom at
the same time so if we take some ice

362
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,070
the same time so if we take some ice
 

363
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,540
the same time so if we take some ice
here put in this hopper here so half

364
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:38,550
here put in this hopper here so half
 

365
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,180
here put in this hopper here so half
goes into here half goes into the bottom

366
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,190
goes into here half goes into the bottom
 

367
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,250
goes into here half goes into the bottom
when the bottom fills up and the top

368
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,260
when the bottom fills up and the top
 

369
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,290
when the bottom fills up and the top
fills up it's gonna go into the two

370
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,300
fills up it's gonna go into the two
 

371
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,000
fills up it's gonna go into the two
middle ones at the same time so that

372
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,010
middle ones at the same time so that
 

373
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,350
middle ones at the same time so that
means the hoppers are kind of running at

374
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,360
means the hoppers are kind of running at
 

375
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,090
means the hoppers are kind of running at
the speed of 6 hoppers because they're

376
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,100
the speed of 6 hoppers because they're
 

377
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,800
the speed of 6 hoppers because they're
at

378
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:50,810
at
 

379
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,170
at
double efficient efficiency uh-huh-huh

380
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:55,180
double efficient efficiency uh-huh-huh
 

381
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,519
double efficient efficiency uh-huh-huh
anyways I've moved all the ice together

382
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:57,529
anyways I've moved all the ice together
 

383
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,130
anyways I've moved all the ice together
here just kind of get an idea of how

384
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,140
here just kind of get an idea of how
 

385
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,350
here just kind of get an idea of how
much we got and there's 50 or 95 stacks

386
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,360
much we got and there's 50 or 95 stacks
 

387
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,510
much we got and there's 50 or 95 stacks
plus 41 here and we didn't finish that

388
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:07,520
plus 41 here and we didn't finish that
 

389
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,490
plus 41 here and we didn't finish that
last row we left about three stacks

390
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:09,500
last row we left about three stacks
 

391
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,960
last row we left about three stacks
there and remember what I said there's

392
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:10,970
there and remember what I said there's
 

393
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,019
there and remember what I said there's
like 98 stacks in total so I think we're

394
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:14,029
like 98 stacks in total so I think we're
 

395
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,890
like 98 stacks in total so I think we're
very close to 100% efficiency with this

396
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:16,900
very close to 100% efficiency with this
 

397
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,140
very close to 100% efficiency with this
which is really cool I'm sure we lost a

398
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,150
which is really cool I'm sure we lost a
 

399
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,240
which is really cool I'm sure we lost a
couple blocks here and there but all in

400
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,250
couple blocks here and there but all in
 

401
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,090
couple blocks here and there but all in
all we got a pretty good nice firm and

402
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,100
all we got a pretty good nice firm and
 

403
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,940
all we got a pretty good nice firm and
then when we go to craft them what we'll

404
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:27,950
then when we go to craft them what we'll
 

405
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,970
then when we go to craft them what we'll
probably just do is get like that a

406
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:29,980
probably just do is get like that a
 

407
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,750
probably just do is get like that a
crafting table genius I know all right

408
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
crafting table genius I know all right
 

409
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,250
crafting table genius I know all right
now you have a crafting table we move it

410
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,260
now you have a crafting table we move it
 

411
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,010
now you have a crafting table we move it
kind of close here and like as these

412
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,020
kind of close here and like as these
 

413
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,870
kind of close here and like as these
chests fill up then I'll just bust them

414
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
chests fill up then I'll just bust them
 

415
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,180
chests fill up then I'll just bust them
and like stand here and do the craft so

416
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,190
and like stand here and do the craft so
 

417
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,880
and like stand here and do the craft so
one chest one double chest gives you how

418
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:48,890
one chest one double chest gives you how
 

419
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,380
one chest one double chest gives you how

CA a brief glimpse of me without the
 

427
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,040
CA a brief glimpse of me without the
mask on today I know I'm beautiful can't

428
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,050
mask on today I know I'm beautiful can't
 

429
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,720
mask on today I know I'm beautiful can't
I can't hide it anymore yeah so that's a

430
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:10,730
I can't hide it anymore yeah so that's a
 

431
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,950
I can't hide it anymore yeah so that's a
little strange it actually wouldn't let

432
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:11,960
little strange it actually wouldn't let
 

433
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,930
little strange it actually wouldn't let
me log on in offline mode which

434
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:13,940
me log on in offline mode which
 

435
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,910
me log on in offline mode which
surprised me like I can't play minecraft

436
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
surprised me like I can't play minecraft
 

437
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,190
surprised me like I can't play minecraft
if I don't have internet but it came on

438
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,200
if I don't have internet but it came on
 

439
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,370
if I don't have internet but it came on
briefly enough where I was able to get

440
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,380
briefly enough where I was able to get
 

441
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,520
briefly enough where I was able to get
on and then it went off but I'm still

442
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:24,530
on and then it went off but I'm still
 

443
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,190
on and then it went off but I'm still
logged in I just lost my skin I guess I

don't know it's kind of weird anyways we
 

447
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,240
don't know it's kind of weird anyways we
got a bunch of levels here we're gonna

448
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,250
got a bunch of levels here we're gonna
 

449
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,760
got a bunch of levels here we're gonna
do some enchanting no protection three

450
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:33,770
do some enchanting no protection three
 

451
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,350
do some enchanting no protection three
is not good enough for us weeping edge

452
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
is not good enough for us weeping edge
 

453
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,350
is not good enough for us weeping edge
yeah yeah I think we'll go for a book

454
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,360
yeah yeah I think we'll go for a book
 

455
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,090
yeah yeah I think we'll go for a book
respiration three that's always a great

456
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:40,100
respiration three that's always a great
 

457
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,300
respiration three that's always a great
one yet I like it that's still the same

458
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,310
one yet I like it that's still the same
 

459
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,530
one yet I like it that's still the same
knock back - we can do better efficiency

460
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:47,540

supposed to be a room over here like
 

627
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,910
supposed to be a room over here like
with a wall running along probably and

628
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:28,920
with a wall running along probably and
 

629
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,320
with a wall running along probably and
then for this side of the wall we're

630
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,330
then for this side of the wall we're
 

631
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,240
then for this side of the wall we're
gonna leave it as this glass we just set

632
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,250
gonna leave it as this glass we just set
 

633
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,579
gonna leave it as this glass we just set
up cuz I like I like to have this looks

634
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:34,589
up cuz I like I like to have this looks
 

635
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:35,810
up cuz I like I like to have this looks
I want to be able to see the wiring

636
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:35,820
I want to be able to see the wiring
 

637
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,460
I want to be able to see the wiring
because that's the most interesting part

638
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:37,470
because that's the most interesting part
 

639
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,829
because that's the most interesting part
of the Nexus right you look at it it's

640
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
of the Nexus right you look at it it's
 

641
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,680
of the Nexus right you look at it it's
like whoa that looks crazy so we want to

642
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,690
like whoa that looks crazy so we want to
 

643
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,540
like whoa that looks crazy so we want to
have that see-through but just having

644
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:44,550
have that see-through but just having
 

645
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,829
have that see-through but just having
the glass there makes it feel a little

646
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
the glass there makes it feel a little
 

647
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,050
the glass there makes it feel a little
bit more finished and we don't have to

648
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,060
bit more finished and we don't have to
 

649
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,610
bit more finished and we don't have to
worry about creepers like wandering out

650
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:49,620
worry about creepers like wandering out
 

651
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,590
worry about creepers like wandering out
and blowing up if they spawn in there or

652
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
and blowing up if they spawn in there or
 

653
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,810
and blowing up if they spawn in there or
something although I think it's pretty

654
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:53,820
something although I think it's pretty
 

655
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,290
something although I think it's pretty
much lit up I'm not sure though for the

656
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,300
much lit up I'm not sure though for the
 

657
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,050
much lit up I'm not sure though for the
main area here not super happy with how

658
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,060
main area here not super happy with how
 

659
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,790
main area here not super happy with how
this looks but it's I don't think we'll

660
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:01,800
this looks but it's I don't think we'll
 

661
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,940
this looks but it's I don't think we'll
change it I was kind of curious I think

662
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:04,950
change it I was kind of curious I think
 

663
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,940
change it I was kind of curious I think
we've tried this in the past and I

664
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:07,950
we've tried this in the past and I
 

665
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,079
we've tried this in the past and I
didn't like it but I'm gonna try it

666
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:09,089
didn't like it but I'm gonna try it
 

667
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,050
didn't like it but I'm gonna try it
again now that the textures have changed

668
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,060
again now that the textures have changed
 

669
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,290
again now that the textures have changed
and my viewpoint has probably changed a

670
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:15,300
and my viewpoint has probably changed a
 

671
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,560
and my viewpoint has probably changed a
bit too I feel like we need a border

672
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,570
bit too I feel like we need a border
 

673
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,150
bit too I feel like we need a border
along this path I think it looks kind of

674
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
along this path I think it looks kind of
 

675
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,730
along this path I think it looks kind of
try me the way it is is that what we do

676
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:24,740
try me the way it is is that what we do
 

677
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,070
try me the way it is is that what we do
no I tried a few different things here

678
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,080
no I tried a few different things here
 

679
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,680
no I tried a few different things here
we got some smooth stone it doesn't

680
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:30,690
we got some smooth stone it doesn't
 

681
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,720
we got some smooth stone it doesn't
quite fit it nether brick I do like

682
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:32,730
quite fit it nether brick I do like
 

683
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,210
quite fit it nether brick I do like
but I feel it's it's too dark and we

684
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,220
but I feel it's it's too dark and we
 

685
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,460
but I feel it's it's too dark and we
haven't used nether brick anywhere else

686
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,470
haven't used nether brick anywhere else
 

687
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,710
haven't used nether brick anywhere else
in this build so it kind of stands out a

688
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:39,720
in this build so it kind of stands out a
 

689
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,560
in this build so it kind of stands out a
bit too much we have used diorite in

690
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:42,570
bit too much we have used diorite in
 

691
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,840
bit too much we have used diorite in
quite a few places so we could use that

692
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:44,850
quite a few places so we could use that
 

693
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,240
quite a few places so we could use that
but I don't know if I actually like it

694
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,250

 

695
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,040

yeah I don't know that it's probably my

696
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,050
yeah I don't know that it's probably my
 

697
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,540
yeah I don't know that it's probably my
second choice so I think we're gonna go

698
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:53,550
second choice so I think we're gonna go
 

699
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,820
second choice so I think we're gonna go
with just this here I think that's fine

700
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:55,830
with just this here I think that's fine
 

701
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,560
with just this here I think that's fine
because we have like light courts a

702
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,570
because we have like light courts a
 

703
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,110
because we have like light courts a
bright block here dark blotch here I

704
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,120
bright block here dark blotch here I
 

705
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,260
bright block here dark blotch here I
kind of want something in between to

706
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:02,270
kind of want something in between to
 

707
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,150
kind of want something in between to
transition between you know and if you

708
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,160
transition between you know and if you
 

709
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,280
transition between you know and if you
look from a distance it kind of changes

710
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,290
look from a distance it kind of changes
 

711
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,020
look from a distance it kind of changes
your view maybe of what they look like

712
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,030
your view maybe of what they look like
 

713
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,880
your view maybe of what they look like
like I I did like the nether brick up

714
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:10,890
like I I did like the nether brick up
 

715
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,820
like I I did like the nether brick up
close but from a distance I think it

716
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:13,830
close but from a distance I think it
 

717
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:23,120
close but from a distance I think it
would look pretty bad uh-huh well we

718
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,130
would look pretty bad uh-huh well we
 

719
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,560
would look pretty bad uh-huh well we
ended up going with something totally

720
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,570
ended up going with something totally
 

721
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,510
ended up going with something totally
different here but still pretty close to

722
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:26,520
different here but still pretty close to
 

723
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,010
different here but still pretty close to
what we had originally we still got the

724
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,020
what we had originally we still got the
 

725
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,960
what we had originally we still got the
prismarine but a different color in the

726
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:29,970
prismarine but a different color in the
 

727
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,660
prismarine but a different color in the
middle and just put glass over top of it

728
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:32,670
middle and just put glass over top of it
 

729
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,660
middle and just put glass over top of it
this is kind of like a cool tricky in do

730
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:34,670
this is kind of like a cool tricky in do
 

731
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,950
this is kind of like a cool tricky in do
generally whenever you make a path like

732
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:36,960
generally whenever you make a path like
 

733
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,360
generally whenever you make a path like
this it looks pretty good because it

734
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,370
this it looks pretty good because it
 

735
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,480
this it looks pretty good because it
creates lots of shadows and stuff having

736
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:41,490
creates lots of shadows and stuff having
 

737
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,650
creates lots of shadows and stuff having
the the middle lowered by a block and

738
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:44,660
the the middle lowered by a block and
 

739
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,910
the the middle lowered by a block and
the glass allows it to feel like it's

740
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:46,920
the glass allows it to feel like it's
 

741
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,560
the glass allows it to feel like it's
flat ground still though which is which

742
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:48,570
flat ground still though which is which
 

743
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,960
flat ground still though which is which
is cool without the glass here like the

744
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:50,970
is cool without the glass here like the
 

745
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,970
is cool without the glass here like the
color difference is a lot more extreme

746
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:52,980
color difference is a lot more extreme
 

747
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,670
color difference is a lot more extreme
as well like this is quite a bit

748
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
as well like this is quite a bit
 

749
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,080
as well like this is quite a bit
brighter than this right but when you

750
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,090
brighter than this right but when you
 

751
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,340
brighter than this right but when you
put the glass over top

752
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,350
put the glass over top
 

753
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,710
put the glass over top
it sort of mellows it it up Nell's out

754
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
it sort of mellows it it up Nell's out
 

755
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,290
it sort of mellows it it up Nell's out
the look a little bit and it's pretty

756
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:03,300
the look a little bit and it's pretty
 

757
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,180
the look a little bit and it's pretty
easy on the eyes I think so I'm happy

758
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,190
easy on the eyes I think so I'm happy
 

759
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,640
easy on the eyes I think so I'm happy
with that I ended up doing that in the

760
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:07,650
with that I ended up doing that in the
 

761
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,400
with that I ended up doing that in the
main room as well just to keep the the

762
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,410
main room as well just to keep the the
 

763
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,030
main room as well just to keep the the
theme and I wasn't really sure what to

764
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,040
theme and I wasn't really sure what to
 

765
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,970
theme and I wasn't really sure what to
do okay so to finish the Nexus what do

766
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:16,980
do okay so to finish the Nexus what do
 

767
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,430
do okay so to finish the Nexus what do
we have to do guys what is all involved

768
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:19,440
we have to do guys what is all involved
 

769
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,420
we have to do guys what is all involved
well we have to build like some kind of

770
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:22,430
well we have to build like some kind of
 

771
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,120
well we have to build like some kind of
finished looking front to this thing

772
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,130
finished looking front to this thing
 

773
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,230
finished looking front to this thing
that needs to be done we got to build

774
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,240
that needs to be done we got to build
 

775
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,730
that needs to be done we got to build
these side rooms that are supposed to be

776
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:28,740
these side rooms that are supposed to be
 

777
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,650
these side rooms that are supposed to be
here

778
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:30,660
here
 

779
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,830
here
some staircase to go up and down and I

780
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
some staircase to go up and down and I
 

781
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,070
some staircase to go up and down and I
just noticed like we never did add the

782
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
just noticed like we never did add the
 

783
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,350
just noticed like we never did add the
second there's like no roof on the

784
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
second there's like no roof on the
 

785
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,870
second there's like no roof on the
second floor I think I ran out of quartz

786
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:41,880
second floor I think I ran out of quartz
 

787
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,320
second floor I think I ran out of quartz
and I didn't want to get more at that at

788
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,330
and I didn't want to get more at that at
 

789
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,540
and I didn't want to get more at that at
that time I was tired

790
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:46,550
that time I was tired
 

791
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,580
that time I was tired
on this so I never just never finished

792
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:48,590
on this so I never just never finished
 

793
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,340
on this so I never just never finished
it right and then at the back part here

794
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,350
it right and then at the back part here
 

795
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,450
it right and then at the back part here
it's like I got a connection tunnel to

796
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:55,460
it's like I got a connection tunnel to
 

797
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,520
it's like I got a connection tunnel to
the two sides but that's that's where it

798
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:57,530
the two sides but that's that's where it
 

799
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:57,970
the two sides but that's that's where it
ends

800
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:57,980
ends
 

801
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,460
ends
so we might want to build some walls and

802
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,470
so we might want to build some walls and
 

803
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,950
so we might want to build some walls and
stuff here to finish it off

804
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
stuff here to finish it off
 

805
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,570
stuff here to finish it off
maybe block this all off so you can't

806
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:04,580
maybe block this all off so you can't
 

807
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,730
maybe block this all off so you can't
see this or we could just put an end on

808
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:09,740
see this or we could just put an end on
 

809
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,500
see this or we could just put an end on
both of the tunnels here would be fine

810
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,510
both of the tunnels here would be fine
 

811
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,140
both of the tunnels here would be fine
too probably and not even worry about

812
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,150
too probably and not even worry about
 

813
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,960
too probably and not even worry about
that area yeah like just you know what I

814
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:16,970
that area yeah like just you know what I
 

815
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,340
that area yeah like just you know what I
mean like build a wall here and just

816
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,350
mean like build a wall here and just
 

817
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,060
mean like build a wall here and just
like forget about all this extra stuff

818
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,070
like forget about all this extra stuff
 

819
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,940
like forget about all this extra stuff
because that has no purpose it's

820
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,950
because that has no purpose it's
 

821
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,260
because that has no purpose it's
probably smarter to do that the only

822
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,270
probably smarter to do that the only
 

823
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,700
probably smarter to do that the only
purpose of this is to connect the two

824
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:27,710
purpose of this is to connect the two
 

825
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:41,090
purpose of this is to connect the two
sides together

826
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,100

 

827
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:56,870

yeah b7 okay okay let's do this

828
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880

 

829
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:07,800

b7 it's so slow this is why we can't we

830
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:07,810
b7 it's so slow this is why we can't we
 

831
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,210
b7 it's so slow this is why we can't we
can't show it in the episodes of guys

832
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,220
can't show it in the episodes of guys
 

833
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,890
can't show it in the episodes of guys
it's embarrassing okay if I made an X's

834
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:13,900
it's embarrassing okay if I made an X's
 

835
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,080
it's embarrassing okay if I made an X's
nowadays oh I would do it so much better

836
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,090
nowadays oh I would do it so much better
 

837
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,420
nowadays oh I would do it so much better
I tell you what guys I don't know what I

838
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:18,430
I tell you what guys I don't know what I
 

839
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,350
I tell you what guys I don't know what I
would do but it would be so much better

840
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
would do but it would be so much better
 

841
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,090
would do but it would be so much better
alright alright well we spent a fair bit

842
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,100
alright alright well we spent a fair bit
 

843
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,670
alright alright well we spent a fair bit
of time on this we got a lot of it done

844
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:26,680
of time on this we got a lot of it done
 

845
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,320
of time on this we got a lot of it done
but unfortunately there's still no

846
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,330
but unfortunately there's still no
 

847
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,950
but unfortunately there's still no
ceiling ran out of quartz locks what

848
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:31,960
ceiling ran out of quartz locks what
 

849
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,380
ceiling ran out of quartz locks what
else is new right oh my goodness so

850
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:34,390
else is new right oh my goodness so
 

851
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,580
else is new right oh my goodness so
that's probably as far as we're gonna

852
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,590
that's probably as far as we're gonna
 

853
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,900
that's probably as far as we're gonna
get on this today but that's about what

854
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:39,910
get on this today but that's about what
 

855
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,520
get on this today but that's about what
it looks like on the other side as well

856
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:41,530
it looks like on the other side as well
 

857
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,170
it looks like on the other side as well
ooh yeah this is the other tunnel yeah

858
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,180
ooh yeah this is the other tunnel yeah
 

859
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,520
ooh yeah this is the other tunnel yeah
gotta do a little bit of mining up here

860
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:47,530
gotta do a little bit of mining up here
 

861
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,490
gotta do a little bit of mining up here
too to finish it off but there was one

862
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:50,500
too to finish it off but there was one
 

863
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,900
too to finish it off but there was one
other little project I wanted to do

864
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:51,910
other little project I wanted to do
 

865
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,970
other little project I wanted to do
today something I keep putting off but

866
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:53,980
today something I keep putting off but
 

867
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,540
today something I keep putting off but
we desperately need bamboo you know we

868
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:57,550
we desperately need bamboo you know we
 

869
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,550
we desperately need bamboo you know we
got this bamboo a few episodes ago and

870
00:19:59,550 --> 00:19:59,560
got this bamboo a few episodes ago and
 

871
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,440
got this bamboo a few episodes ago and
still haven't done anything with it I

872
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,450
still haven't done anything with it I
 

873
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,140
still haven't done anything with it I
don't have any scaffolding I've got a

874
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,150
don't have any scaffolding I've got a
 

875
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,490
don't have any scaffolding I've got a
lot of comments about that's like oh

876
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:05,500
lot of comments about that's like oh
 

877
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,560
lot of comments about that's like oh
those still pillar enough with the logs

878
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,570
those still pillar enough with the logs
 

879
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,420
those still pillar enough with the logs
and whatever yeah I don't have I don't

880
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:09,430
and whatever yeah I don't have I don't
 

881
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,400
and whatever yeah I don't have I don't
have the scaffolding so we're gonna make

882
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,410
have the scaffolding so we're gonna make
 

883
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,370
have the scaffolding so we're gonna make
a farm just a little simple one one

884
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:14,380
a farm just a little simple one one
 

885
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,750
a farm just a little simple one one
thing you will notice it grows quite

886
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
thing you will notice it grows quite
 

887
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,570
thing you will notice it grows quite
tall and I think this is all fully grown

888
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:18,580
tall and I think this is all fully grown
 

889
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,600
tall and I think this is all fully grown
and some of its taller than others so I

890
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:21,610
and some of its taller than others so I
 

891
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,620
and some of its taller than others so I
think the height is random as well and

892
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:25,630
think the height is random as well and
 

893
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,570
think the height is random as well and
you can break it with pistons so that's

894
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:27,580
you can break it with pistons so that's
 

895
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,240
you can break it with pistons so that's
probably the way we'll we'll do it cool

896
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,250
probably the way we'll we'll do it cool
 

897
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,830
probably the way we'll we'll do it cool
all right well I figured we would start

898
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
all right well I figured we would start
 

899
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,620
all right well I figured we would start
building one of these firms at slab city

900
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:34,630
building one of these firms at slab city
 

901
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,950
building one of these firms at slab city
we might build several of them but we'll

902
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:37,960
we might build several of them but we'll
 

903
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,210
we might build several of them but we'll
put one here for sure because we haven't

904
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:39,220
put one here for sure because we haven't
 

905
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,230
put one here for sure because we haven't
been here in a long time

906
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
been here in a long time
 

907
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,710
been here in a long time
and it's gonna be like a squarish firm

908
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:43,720
and it's gonna be like a squarish firm
 

909
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,800
and it's gonna be like a squarish firm
this is a square city alright it kind of

910
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:46,810
this is a square city alright it kind of
 

911
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,200
this is a square city alright it kind of
works out and also there's a lot of

912
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,210
works out and also there's a lot of
 

913
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,430
works out and also there's a lot of
heights and stuff here so it would be

914
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:50,440
heights and stuff here so it would be
 

915
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,650
heights and stuff here so it would be
nice to have a source of scaffolding at

916
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:52,660
nice to have a source of scaffolding at
 

917
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,180
nice to have a source of scaffolding at
this actual city I

918
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,190
this actual city I
 

919
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,100
this actual city I
so that's what we'll do I'm gonna put it

920
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,110
so that's what we'll do I'm gonna put it
 

921
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,770
so that's what we'll do I'm gonna put it
over here just a seven wide one and I

922
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:02,780
over here just a seven wide one and I
 

923
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,470
over here just a seven wide one and I
may eventually end up making a huge one

924
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:05,480
may eventually end up making a huge one
 

925
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,360
may eventually end up making a huge one
of these as well I'm not sure we don't

926
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,370
of these as well I'm not sure we don't
 

927
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,180
of these as well I'm not sure we don't
need anything crazy just yet though

928
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,190
need anything crazy just yet though
 

929
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,830
need anything crazy just yet though
because you can't make bamboo farms for

930
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
because you can't make bamboo farms for
 

931
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,130
because you can't make bamboo farms for
sticks and maybe we'll want to hook that

932
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,140
sticks and maybe we'll want to hook that
 

933
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,990
sticks and maybe we'll want to hook that
up to our super smelter or something

934
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,000
up to our super smelter or something
 

935
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,400
up to our super smelter or something
but I don't know there might be better

936
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,410
but I don't know there might be better
 

937
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,500
but I don't know there might be better
things to do yet so what is this seven

938
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,510
things to do yet so what is this seven
 

939
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:31,360
things to do yet so what is this seven
wide right three four five six well um

940
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,370
wide right three four five six well um
 

941
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,909
wide right three four five six well um
oh I think it's supposed to go this way

942
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
oh I think it's supposed to go this way
 

943
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,200
oh I think it's supposed to go this way
actually interesting yeah this is the

944
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,210
actually interesting yeah this is the
 

945
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,630
actually interesting yeah this is the
other pillar okay so now it's seven wide

946
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
other pillar okay so now it's seven wide
 

947
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,299
other pillar okay so now it's seven wide
so we'll hollow this out this is where

948
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:43,309
so we'll hollow this out this is where
 

949
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:46,630
so we'll hollow this out this is where
we're gonna put the bamboo probably dig

950
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
we're gonna put the bamboo probably dig
 

951
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,820
we're gonna put the bamboo probably dig
a hole it's gonna be hard to visualize

952
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:48,830
a hole it's gonna be hard to visualize
 

953
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,190
a hole it's gonna be hard to visualize
this until it's actually done but we're

954
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
this until it's actually done but we're
 

955
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,250
this until it's actually done but we're
gonna have a hole here where we're gonna

956
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,260
gonna have a hole here where we're gonna
 

957
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,390
gonna have a hole here where we're gonna
put the bamboo down and it'll grow up

958
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:57,400
put the bamboo down and it'll grow up
 

959
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,919
put the bamboo down and it'll grow up
until we can see it here and it'll look

960
00:21:59,919 --> 00:21:59,929
until we can see it here and it'll look
 

961
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:00,789
until we can see it here and it'll look
kind of cool right

962
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
kind of cool right
 

963
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,700
kind of cool right
we'll have glass in front like at this

964
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:03,710
we'll have glass in front like at this
 

965
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,450
we'll have glass in front like at this
level here and some sort of piston

966
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:07,460
level here and some sort of piston
 

967
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,539
level here and some sort of piston
harvesting device down here as well okay

968
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:10,549
harvesting device down here as well okay
 

969
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:15,419
harvesting device down here as well okay
so we're gonna have dirt bamboo pistons

970
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:15,429
so we're gonna have dirt bamboo pistons
 

971
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:17,860
so we're gonna have dirt bamboo pistons
border yes

972
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:17,870
border yes
 

973
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,210
border yes
that's gonna work okay that's the height

974
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:19,220
that's gonna work okay that's the height
 

975
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,570
that's gonna work okay that's the height
we're gonna go for here by the way not

976
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:22,580
we're gonna go for here by the way not
 

977
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,049
we're gonna go for here by the way not
depressed just morning voice this is the

978
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:26,059
depressed just morning voice this is the
 

979
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,360
depressed just morning voice this is the
next day and yeah my Internet's working

980
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,370
next day and yeah my Internet's working
 

981
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,330
next day and yeah my Internet's working
again woohoo got my skin back on and

982
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:31,340
again woohoo got my skin back on and
 

983
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,299
again woohoo got my skin back on and
everything was able to login

984
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:34,309
everything was able to login
 

985
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:38,110
everything was able to login
we're gonna have some whatcha McCall

986
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,120
we're gonna have some whatcha McCall
 

987
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,299
we're gonna have some whatcha McCall
it's sticky blocks what are they called

988
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:40,309
it's sticky blocks what are they called
 

989
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:43,590
it's sticky blocks what are they called
slime blocks yeah at this level here

990
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
slime blocks yeah at this level here
 

991
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,700
slime blocks yeah at this level here
which means they're gonna stick to

992
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:45,710
which means they're gonna stick to
 

993
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,409
which means they're gonna stick to
everything that's what we're gonna push

994
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:47,419
everything that's what we're gonna push
 

995
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,370
everything that's what we're gonna push
to harvest the bamboo but in order to

996
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,380
to harvest the bamboo but in order to
 

997
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,080
to harvest the bamboo but in order to
make them not stick to everything we

998
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,090
make them not stick to everything we
 

999
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,380
make them not stick to everything we
have to put terracotta or something non

1000
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,390
have to put terracotta or something non
 

1001
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,740
have to put terracotta or something non
movable by them so that's what's going

1002
00:22:59,740 --> 00:22:59,750
movable by them so that's what's going
 

1003
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,770
movable by them so that's what's going
at this level oh yeah I guess we'll have

1004
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:02,780
at this level oh yeah I guess we'll have
 

1005
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,260
at this level oh yeah I guess we'll have
to put them underneath and above as well

1006
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,270
to put them underneath and above as well
 

1007
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,070
to put them underneath and above as well
right so their eyes they'll stick

1008
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,080
right so their eyes they'll stick
 

1009
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,930
right so their eyes they'll stick
okay now that should be fine we're only

1010
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:11,940
okay now that should be fine we're only
 

1011
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,700
okay now that should be fine we're only
gonna have to use one piston to move the

1012
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:13,710
gonna have to use one piston to move the
 

1013
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,669
gonna have to use one piston to move the
whole slime block arm thing here and

1014
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:16,679
whole slime block arm thing here and
 

1015
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,360
whole slime block arm thing here and
we'll just put that over here and then

1016
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,370
we'll just put that over here and then
 

1017
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,340
we'll just put that over here and then
basically we put a observer up higher

1018
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,350
basically we put a observer up higher
 

1019
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,409
basically we put a observer up higher
and connect that to the piston so when

1020
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:24,419
and connect that to the piston so when
 

1021
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,450
and connect that to the piston so when
it grows to a certain height then it'll

1022
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:26,460
it grows to a certain height then it'll
 

1023
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,120
it grows to a certain height then it'll
do a harvest so bamboo can grow twelve

1024
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,130
do a harvest so bamboo can grow twelve
 

1025
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,690
do a harvest so bamboo can grow twelve
to sixteen blocks tall one two three

1026
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:32,700
to sixteen blocks tall one two three
 

1027
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,450
to sixteen blocks tall one two three
four five six seven eight

1028
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:35,460
four five six seven eight
 

1029
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,789
four five six seven eight
we got the observer at the eighth block

1030
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:37,799
we got the observer at the eighth block
 

1031
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,220
we got the observer at the eighth block
here as long as it's at the minimum of

1032
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,230
here as long as it's at the minimum of
 

1033
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,590
here as long as it's at the minimum of
twelve we'll be fine

1034
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:42,600
twelve we'll be fine
 

1035
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,270
twelve we'll be fine
so we could go even for blocks higher if

1036
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:44,280
so we could go even for blocks higher if
 

1037
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,820
so we could go even for blocks higher if
we wanted with us but it'll be it'll be

1038
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:46,830
we wanted with us but it'll be it'll be
 

1039
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,060
we wanted with us but it'll be it'll be
fine over there I think and then we got

1040
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,070
fine over there I think and then we got
 

1041
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,750
fine over there I think and then we got
the piston right over there we just run

1042
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
the piston right over there we just run
 

1043
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:01,340
the piston right over there we just run
a redstone up to this and oh we gotta go

1044
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,350
a redstone up to this and oh we gotta go
 

1045
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,299
a redstone up to this and oh we gotta go
one more up right yeah let's put it over

1046
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:05,309
one more up right yeah let's put it over
 

1047
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,190
one more up right yeah let's put it over
here so now the observer will power this

1048
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
here so now the observer will power this
 

1049
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,549
here so now the observer will power this
line power the piston actually we need a

1050
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
line power the piston actually we need a
 

1051
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,580
line power the piston actually we need a
repeater in there don't we otherwise the

1052
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:13,590
repeater in there don't we otherwise the
 

1053
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,930
repeater in there don't we otherwise the
slime blocks are gonna get stuck out oh

1054
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:16,940
slime blocks are gonna get stuck out oh
 

1055
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:23,810
slime blocks are gonna get stuck out oh
did that do nothing hmm I'm good at this

1056
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:23,820
did that do nothing hmm I'm good at this
 

1057
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,470
did that do nothing hmm I'm good at this
game guys trust me all right yeah I

1058
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,480
game guys trust me all right yeah I
 

1059
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,200
game guys trust me all right yeah I
think we need a repeater okay I got the

1060
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,210
think we need a repeater okay I got the
 

1061
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,760
think we need a repeater okay I got the
repeater up there but that wasn't the

1062
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:31,770
repeater up there but that wasn't the
 

1063
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,860
repeater up there but that wasn't the
problem I figured it out though we're

1064
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:33,870
problem I figured it out though we're
 

1065
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,919
problem I figured it out though we're
gonna set this one to two that way when

1066
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:36,929
gonna set this one to two that way when
 

1067
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:39,320
gonna set this one to two that way when
the piston extends it doesn't leave the

1068
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,330
the piston extends it doesn't leave the
 

1069
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,789
the piston extends it doesn't leave the
slime blocks like where the bamboo is

1070
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
slime blocks like where the bamboo is
 

1071
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,620
slime blocks like where the bamboo is
that it'll pull it back but you know

1072
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,630
that it'll pull it back but you know
 

1073
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,010
that it'll pull it back but you know
what the issue is we need terracotta

1074
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,020
what the issue is we need terracotta
 

1075
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,320
what the issue is we need terracotta
behind here as well it's sticking to the

1076
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,330
behind here as well it's sticking to the
 

1077
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:58,280
behind here as well it's sticking to the
stone ah man okay easy fix

1078
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,290
stone ah man okay easy fix
 

1079
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,130
stone ah man okay easy fix
not a big deal let's pretend that never

1080
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,140
not a big deal let's pretend that never
 

1081
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,930
not a big deal let's pretend that never
happened

1082
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:01,940
happened
 

1083
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,210
happened
okay now we put this back now it

1084
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,220
okay now we put this back now it
 

1085
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,830
okay now we put this back now it
shouldn't be able to stick to anything

1086
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:06,840
shouldn't be able to stick to anything
 

1087
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,650
shouldn't be able to stick to anything
right we got it all taken care of okay

1088
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:11,660
right we got it all taken care of okay
 

1089
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,860
right we got it all taken care of okay
it's kind of weird they like grow random

1090
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:15,870
it's kind of weird they like grow random
 

1091
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,450
it's kind of weird they like grow random
distances apart from each other like I

1092
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:17,460
distances apart from each other like I
 

1093
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,149
distances apart from each other like I
can't fit between these two it won't let

1094
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
can't fit between these two it won't let
 

1095
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,310
can't fit between these two it won't let
me fall down but I can fit between

1096
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
me fall down but I can fit between
 

1097
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,870
me fall down but I can fit between
these two here yeah so I pulled it back

1098
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
these two here yeah so I pulled it back
 

1099
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,160
these two here yeah so I pulled it back
so if we left this at one tick bambam

1100
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,170
so if we left this at one tick bambam
 

1101
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,530
so if we left this at one tick bambam
I think the slime blocks would get left

1102
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:33,540
I think the slime blocks would get left
 

1103
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,870
I think the slime blocks would get left
behind yeah you see they would do this

1104
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:35,880
behind yeah you see they would do this
 

1105
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,920
behind yeah you see they would do this
instead so that's why you need the

1106
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:36,930
instead so that's why you need the
 

1107
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,370
instead so that's why you need the
repeater okay so now we got it so that

1108
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,380
repeater okay so now we got it so that
 

1109
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,450
repeater okay so now we got it so that
when this grows up place that there yeah

1110
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:44,460
when this grows up place that there yeah
 

1111
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,320
when this grows up place that there yeah
it'll grow up to the observer and that

1112
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,330
it'll grow up to the observer and that
 

1113
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,380
it'll grow up to the observer and that
makes the slime blocks go out and break

1114
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,390
makes the slime blocks go out and break
 

1115
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,260
makes the slime blocks go out and break
all the bamboos right the odd piece will

1116
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,270
all the bamboos right the odd piece will
 

1117
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,570
all the bamboos right the odd piece will
land on top of the bamboo but I think

1118
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:56,580
land on top of the bamboo but I think
 

1119
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,850
land on top of the bamboo but I think
most of it should land on the dirt and

1120
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:58,860
most of it should land on the dirt and
 

1121
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,100
most of it should land on the dirt and
then we need some way of collecting it

1122
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,110
then we need some way of collecting it
 

1123
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,570
then we need some way of collecting it
right so what we'll do from this wire

1124
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,580
right so what we'll do from this wire
 

1125
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,900
right so what we'll do from this wire
that we're using for the piston right we

1126
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:07,910
that we're using for the piston right we
 

1127
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,840
that we're using for the piston right we
will just trail it down to here and then

1128
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:11,850
will just trail it down to here and then
 

1129
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,340
will just trail it down to here and then
we'll set up a minecart

1130
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,350
we'll set up a minecart
 

1131
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,370
we'll set up a minecart
hopper to run underneath the dirt to

1132
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:16,380
hopper to run underneath the dirt to
 

1133
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,420
hopper to run underneath the dirt to
pick up everything up basically so and

1134
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:20,430
pick up everything up basically so and
 

1135
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,800
pick up everything up basically so and
then we got to put in a chest somewhere

1136
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:21,810
then we got to put in a chest somewhere
 

1137
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,240
then we got to put in a chest somewhere
too which I haven't figure out where

1138
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,250
too which I haven't figure out where
 

1139
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,770
too which I haven't figure out where
we're doing that just yet

1140
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:24,780
we're doing that just yet
 

1141
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,430
we're doing that just yet
might save that for another episode if

1142
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:28,440
might save that for another episode if
 

1143
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,280
might save that for another episode if
we can't finish this today yeah uh too

1144
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,290
we can't finish this today yeah uh too
 

1145
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,990
we can't finish this today yeah uh too
big of a project no I'm actually running

rails are powered put the hopper
 

1177
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,490
rails are powered put the hopper
minecart over there so now whenever that

1178
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:13,500
minecart over there so now whenever that
 

1179
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
minecart over there so now whenever that
extends it's gonna make that my cart go

1180
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:15,510
extends it's gonna make that my cart go
 

1181
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,200
extends it's gonna make that my cart go
and pick up all the bamboo that's on the

1182
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,210
and pick up all the bamboo that's on the
 

1183
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,480
and pick up all the bamboo that's on the
dirt let's test that out just trigger

1184
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:20,490
dirt let's test that out just trigger
 

1185
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:27,090
dirt let's test that out just trigger
this oh I didn't hear it go

1186
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,100

 

1187
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,980

they moved a little bit right oh we need

1188
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:32,990
they moved a little bit right oh we need
 

1189
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,590
they moved a little bit right oh we need
a longer pulse that's the problem

1190
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
a longer pulse that's the problem
 

1191
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,860
a longer pulse that's the problem
yeah okay um well it's not a big deal if

1192
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:38,870
yeah okay um well it's not a big deal if
 

1193
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,880
yeah okay um well it's not a big deal if
we just extend this right go to four and

1194
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:42,890
we just extend this right go to four and
 

1195
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,500
we just extend this right go to four and
let's try that again

1196
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:46,510

 

1197
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,080

yeah now I think it went okay let's try

1198
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,090
yeah now I think it went okay let's try
 

1199
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,280
yeah now I think it went okay let's try
one more time make sure that's not

1200
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,290
one more time make sure that's not
 

1201
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,450
one more time make sure that's not
messed up yeah here it go cool so that

1202
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:55,460
messed up yeah here it go cool so that
 

1203
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
messed up yeah here it go cool so that
I'll pick up everything there and then

1204
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:57,470
I'll pick up everything there and then
 

1205
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,690
I'll pick up everything there and then
we just got dropped off at chess

1206
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:58,700
we just got dropped off at chess
 

1207
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,610
we just got dropped off at chess
somewhere but that's probably as far as

1208
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:00,620
somewhere but that's probably as far as
 

1209
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,930
somewhere but that's probably as far as
we'll get with this so we need a wall

1210
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:01,940
we'll get with this so we need a wall
 

1211
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,590
we'll get with this so we need a wall
here and then we need glass here going

1212
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
here and then we need glass here going
 

1213
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,720
here and then we need glass here going
all the way up huh this place is really

1214
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,730
all the way up huh this place is really
