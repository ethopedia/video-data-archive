and and hopefully we can
 

23
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,150
and and hopefully we can
blend it into this area a little bit

24
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
blend it into this area a little bit
 

25
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,750
blend it into this area a little bit
because it sort of sticks out at the

26
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
because it sort of sticks out at the
 

27
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,389
because it sort of sticks out at the
moment

28
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
moment
 

29
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,470
moment
which i i don't really like we want to

30
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
which i i don't really like we want to

so let me show you this first off okay

36
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
so let me show you this first off okay
 

37
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,830
so let me show you this first off okay
so i uh

38
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
so i uh
 

39
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,029
so i uh
i just built like a lane out here a lane

40
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
i just built like a lane out here a lane
 

41
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,389
i just built like a lane out here a lane
um scaffolding that we can walk across

42
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
um scaffolding that we can walk across
 

43
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,389
um scaffolding that we can walk across
and then i planted the coarse fruit down

44
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
and then i planted the coarse fruit down
 

45
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,110
and then i planted the coarse fruit down
there and this is how it grew around it

46
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
there and this is how it grew around it
 

47
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,630
there and this is how it grew around it
and i think this is going to work out

48
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
and i think this is going to work out
 

49
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,869
and i think this is going to work out
perfect for getting the seeds

50
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
perfect for getting the seeds
 

51
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,950
perfect for getting the seeds
so the plant look at the plants they

52
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
so the plant look at the plants they
 

53
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,310
so the plant look at the plants they
still grow pretty tall

54
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
still grow pretty tall
 

55
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,790
still grow pretty tall
right so we'll still get a lot of the

56
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
right so we'll still get a lot of the
 

57
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,270
right so we'll still get a lot of the
purpur blocks off of them

58
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
purpur blocks off of them
 

59
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,590
purpur blocks off of them
but it's really easy to harvest the

60
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
but it's really easy to harvest the
 

61
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,030
but it's really easy to harvest the
seeds from up here

62
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
seeds from up here
 

63
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,550
seeds from up here
look at this they're like they're like

64
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
look at this they're like they're like
 

65
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,630
look at this they're like they're like
right there

if i ever run a low on seeds i just have

72
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
if i ever run a low on seeds i just have
 

73
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,870
if i ever run a low on seeds i just have
to do a little seed harvest like this

74
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
to do a little seed harvest like this
 

75
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,870

it too
 

79
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,230
it too
because each plant's probably going to

80
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
because each plant's probably going to
 

81
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,230
because each plant's probably going to
give me about two or three at least by

82
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
give me about two or three at least by
 

83
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,910
give me about two or three at least by
the looks of it

84
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
the looks of it
 

85
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,270

some of them like those down there i
 

87
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,550
some of them like those down there i
can't reach but for the most part

88
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
can't reach but for the most part
 

89
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,069
can't reach but for the most part
it's pretty easy to reach everything

90
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
it's pretty easy to reach everything
 

91
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,550
it's pretty easy to reach everything

thing here i just set up some pistons
 

103
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,990
thing here i just set up some pistons
running along the the back of the farm

104
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
running along the the back of the farm
 

105
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,870
running along the the back of the farm
we're gonna fill these up with water and

we're gonna fill these up with water and
 

107
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,990
we're gonna fill these up with water and
the pistons will hold the water

108
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
the pistons will hold the water
 

109
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,109
the pistons will hold the water
in place until we release it

110
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
in place until we release it
 

111
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,069
in place until we release it
okay this is going to start harvesting

112
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
okay this is going to start harvesting
 

113

okay i'll have to deal with that um
 

127
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,309
okay i'll have to deal with that um
man it would be a pain to move all the

128
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
man it would be a pain to move all the
 

129
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,910
man it would be a pain to move all the
all the pistons here maybe i'll just

130
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
all the pistons here maybe i'll just
 

131
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,750
all the pistons here maybe i'll just
get rid of the stairs here then

132
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760

 

133
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,110

yeah okay so that's what i ended up

134
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
yeah okay so that's what i ended up
 

135
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,790
yeah okay so that's what i ended up
doing here i just moved the stairs one

136
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
doing here i just moved the stairs one
 

137
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,470
doing here i just moved the stairs one
block over to the right here

138
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
block over to the right here
 

139
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,990
block over to the right here
so they're in line with the end stone

140
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
so they're in line with the end stone
 

141
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,390
so they're in line with the end stone
they used to be down this row here

142
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
they used to be down this row here
 

143
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,710
they used to be down this row here
if i had moved the pistons over to the

144
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
if i had moved the pistons over to the
 

145
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,949
if i had moved the pistons over to the
left they would have been

146
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
left they would have been
 

147
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,309
left they would have been
uh in this area here and then the

148
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
uh in this area here and then the
 

149
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,790
uh in this area here and then the
the chorus fruit we plant right here is

150
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
the chorus fruit we plant right here is
 

151
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,229
the chorus fruit we plant right here is
going to get blocked by this so that

152
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
going to get blocked by this so that
 

153
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,030
going to get blocked by this so that
would have worked

154
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
would have worked
 

155
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,790
would have worked
really so this is probably the best way

156
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
really so this is probably the best way
 

157
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,229
really so this is probably the best way
of doing it

158
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
of doing it
 

159
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,309
of doing it
anyways we are gonna do our first

160
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
anyways we are gonna do our first
 

161
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,070
anyways we are gonna do our first
harvest here we're gonna try this out

162
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
harvest here we're gonna try this out
 

163
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,270
harvest here we're gonna try this out
make sure it works are you ready

164
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
make sure it works are you ready
 

165
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,430
make sure it works are you ready
and

166
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440

 

167
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,430

169
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,390
we got to make sure all the the fruit
flows down it doesn't get stuck anywhere

170
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
flows down it doesn't get stuck anywhere
 

171
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,910
flows down it doesn't get stuck anywhere
that was pretty cool oh yeah look at

172
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
that was pretty cool oh yeah look at
 

173
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,750
that was pretty cool oh yeah look at
that they they bounce out of the water

174
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
that they they bounce out of the water
 

175
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,990
that they they bounce out of the water
when they go over the stairs that's cool

176
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
when they go over the stairs that's cool
 

177
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,509
when they go over the stairs that's cool
i like that all right looks like things

178
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
i like that all right looks like things
 

179
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,030
i like that all right looks like things
are going down pretty good

180
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040

 

181
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,630

very nice very nice

182
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640

 

183
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,110

all right let's shut the water off if i

184
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
all right let's shut the water off if i
 

185
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,789
all right let's shut the water off if i
do this at night all the mycelium is

186
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
do this at night all the mycelium is
 

187
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,470
do this at night all the mycelium is
going to die so i need to definitely get

188
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
going to die so i need to definitely get
 

189
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,030
going to die so i need to definitely get
some

190
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
some
 

191
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,630
some
glowstone on the ground or something

192
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
glowstone on the ground or something
 

193
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,430
glowstone on the ground or something
so that the mycelium stays alive when

194
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
so that the mycelium stays alive when
 

195
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,750
so that the mycelium stays alive when
it's dark

196
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
it's dark
 

197
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,830
it's dark
okay i don't see any fruit stuck on the

198
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
okay i don't see any fruit stuck on the
 

199
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,509
okay i don't see any fruit stuck on the
stairs or anything that's good he's a

200
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
stairs or anything that's good he's a
 

201
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,750
stairs or anything that's good he's a
little worried about that

202
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
little worried about that
 

203
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,350
little worried about that
and it all ends up over here so we're

204
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
and it all ends up over here so we're
 

205
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,110
and it all ends up over here so we're
going to need either another water

206
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
going to need either another water
 

207
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,869
going to need either another water
stream to push them

208
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
stream to push them
 

209
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,110
stream to push them
this way and gather them all together or

210
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
this way and gather them all together or
 

211
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,789
this way and gather them all together or
i'm going to set up a hopper minecart

212
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
i'm going to set up a hopper minecart
 

213
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,030
i'm going to set up a hopper minecart
down this middle part

214
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
down this middle part
 

215
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,110
down this middle part
oh man i'm all full here

216
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
oh man i'm all full here
 

217
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,830
oh man i'm all full here
not awful all full i'm not an awful

218
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
not awful all full i'm not an awful
 

219
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,830
not awful all full i'm not an awful
person

220
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
person
 

221
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,830
person
bad pun okay all right cool so now uh

222
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
bad pun okay all right cool so now uh
 

223
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,830
bad pun okay all right cool so now uh
what i'm going to do

224
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
what i'm going to do
 

225
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,589
what i'm going to do
next i'm gonna try uh make the

226
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
next i'm gonna try uh make the
 

227
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,189
next i'm gonna try uh make the
scaffolding things look a little bit

228
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
scaffolding things look a little bit
 

229
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,390
scaffolding things look a little bit
better

230
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
better
 

231
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,749
better
and i probably didn't pick up all these

232
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
and i probably didn't pick up all these
 

233
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,789
and i probably didn't pick up all these
but it's fine we're gonna be getting a

234
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
but it's fine we're gonna be getting a
 

235
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,909
but it's fine we're gonna be getting a
lot lots of stuff

236
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
lot lots of stuff
 

237
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,510
lot lots of stuff
in in a second here okay so i

238
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
in in a second here okay so i
 

239
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,030
in in a second here okay so i
firmed up some acacia wood i think

240
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
firmed up some acacia wood i think
 

241
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,230
firmed up some acacia wood i think
that's what we're going to use instead

242
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
that's what we're going to use instead
 

243
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,870
that's what we're going to use instead
of

244
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
of
 

245
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,070
of
the dirt here and we'll put ladders on

246
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
the dirt here and we'll put ladders on
 

247
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,629
the dirt here and we'll put ladders on
on the pillars so i want one over here

248
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
on the pillars so i want one over here
 

249
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,870
on the pillars so i want one over here
one over here another one there

250
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
one over here another one there
 

251
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,070
one over here another one there
and i'm going to try to connect them

252
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
and i'm going to try to connect them
 

253
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,070
and i'm going to try to connect them
together at the top as well so i can i

254
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
together at the top as well so i can i
 

255
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,629
together at the top as well so i can i
can cross between the different rows

256
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639

 

257
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,430

all right and get the ladders going up

258
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
all right and get the ladders going up
 

259
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,230
all right and get the ladders going up
so i have it

260
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
so i have it
 

261
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,350
so i have it
these uh these are going up 12 blocks

262
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
these uh these are going up 12 blocks
 

263
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,350
these uh these are going up 12 blocks
from the ground level here

264
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
from the ground level here
 

265
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,830
from the ground level here
is is what i'm doing and that seems to

266
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
is is what i'm doing and that seems to
 

267
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,270
is is what i'm doing and that seems to
be a pretty good height where the plants

268
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
be a pretty good height where the plants
 

269
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,469
be a pretty good height where the plants
grow

270
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
grow
 

271
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,350
grow
pretty much to their full full extent

272
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
pretty much to their full full extent
 

273
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,230
pretty much to their full full extent
because once uh

274
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
because once uh
 

275
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,390
because once uh
once they reach these scaffoldings it

276
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
once they reach these scaffoldings it
 

277
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,230
once they reach these scaffoldings it
kind of affects their growth pattern a

278
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
kind of affects their growth pattern a
 

279
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,749
kind of affects their growth pattern a
little bit makes them shorter

280
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759

 

281
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,510

like it blocks them from growing that's

282
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
like it blocks them from growing that's
 

283
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,870
like it blocks them from growing that's
what i'm trying to say

284
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
what i'm trying to say
 

285
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,270
what i'm trying to say
so at 12 blocks doesn't seem to cause

286
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
so at 12 blocks doesn't seem to cause
 

287
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,990
so at 12 blocks doesn't seem to cause
too much trouble

288
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
too much trouble
 

289
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,110
too much trouble
all right and then i'll probably just go

290
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
all right and then i'll probably just go
 

291
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:33,670
all right and then i'll probably just go
across like this

292
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680

 

293
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,270

aha this this feels like a roadblock

294
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
aha this this feels like a roadblock
 

295
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,749
aha this this feels like a roadblock
one two three four five six yeah there's

296
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
one two three four five six yeah there's
 

297
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,270
one two three four five six yeah there's
a there's a few creepers there

298
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
a there's a few creepers there
 

299
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,310
a there's a few creepers there
okay moving on

300
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320

 

301
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,909

okay so check that out guys i got the

302
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
okay so check that out guys i got the
 

303
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,830
okay so check that out guys i got the
beams running across the top here

304
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
beams running across the top here
 

305
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,029
beams running across the top here
that's what we're gonna walk on to

306
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
that's what we're gonna walk on to
 

307
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,270
that's what we're gonna walk on to
harvest the seeds and

308
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
harvest the seeds and
 

309
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,870
harvest the seeds and
i like the way it makes it feel too it's

310
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
i like the way it makes it feel too it's
 

311
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,310
i like the way it makes it feel too it's
almost like a building now that we have

312
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
almost like a building now that we have
 

313
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,710
almost like a building now that we have
something over our head instead of just

314
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
something over our head instead of just
 

315
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,270
something over our head instead of just
some random plants growing here actually

316
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
some random plants growing here actually
 

317
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,110
some random plants growing here actually
feels like they belong more so

318
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
feels like they belong more so
 

319
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,270
feels like they belong more so
and i got it stepping down every time

320
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
and i got it stepping down every time
 

321
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,950
and i got it stepping down every time
just threw some beams on the side there

322
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
just threw some beams on the side there
 

323
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,950
just threw some beams on the side there
to try to make it look better

324
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
to try to make it look better
 

325
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,830
to try to make it look better
and i was going to add some lights near

326
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
and i was going to add some lights near
 

327
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,270
and i was going to add some lights near
the top as well

328
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
the top as well
 

329
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,590
the top as well
going down i like this like gradual

330
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
going down i like this like gradual
 

331
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,029
going down i like this like gradual
sloping it has

332
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039

 

333
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,950

gives it kind of a cool look i don't

334
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
gives it kind of a cool look i don't
 

335
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,790
gives it kind of a cool look i don't
like the fences on the top here but i

336
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
like the fences on the top here but i
 

337
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,430
like the fences on the top here but i
might have them on the bottom

338
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
might have them on the bottom
 

339
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,110
might have them on the bottom
let's try and decide what color i want

340
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
let's try and decide what color i want
 

341
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,510
let's try and decide what color i want
to use i think birchwood looks pretty

342
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
to use i think birchwood looks pretty
 

343
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,309
to use i think birchwood looks pretty
good

344
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319

 

345
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,070

i don't like the dark oak here so

346
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
i don't like the dark oak here so
 

347
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,870
i don't like the dark oak here so
definitely not these

348
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
definitely not these
 

349
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,390
definitely not these
get rid of these uh the orange doesn't

350
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
get rid of these uh the orange doesn't
 

351
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,909
get rid of these uh the orange doesn't
really suit the area

352
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
really suit the area
 

353
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,430
really suit the area
because nothing else is orange around

354
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
because nothing else is orange around
 

355
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,150
because nothing else is orange around
here so it's between these two

356
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160

 

357
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,990

maybe the birch because this is yellow

358
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
maybe the birch because this is yellow
 

359
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,309
maybe the birch because this is yellow
and and the birch is yellow right

360
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
and and the birch is yellow right
 

361
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,110
and and the birch is yellow right
yeah let's do that okay and then along

362
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
yeah let's do that okay and then along
 

363
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,550
yeah let's do that okay and then along
the top here we should probably get some

364
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
the top here we should probably get some
 

365
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,029
the top here we should probably get some
lights in two because

366
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
lights in two because
 

367
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,029
lights in two because
uh at night time i don't want mobs up on

368
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
uh at night time i don't want mobs up on
 

369
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,309
uh at night time i don't want mobs up on
top here i want to be able to use this

370
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
top here i want to be able to use this
 

371
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,510
top here i want to be able to use this
farm at night time if i

372
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
farm at night time if i
 

373
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,029
farm at night time if i
if i choose to as well so

374
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
if i choose to as well so
 

375
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,390
if i choose to as well so
i think i have some lamps yeah okay

376
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
i think i have some lamps yeah okay
 

377
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,070
i think i have some lamps yeah okay
let's do lamps do we have any

378
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
let's do lamps do we have any
 

379
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,629
let's do lamps do we have any
cobblestone here

380
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
cobblestone here
 

381
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,749
cobblestone here
got a little bit oh we got levers

382
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
got a little bit oh we got levers
 

383
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,790
got a little bit oh we got levers
already sweets planned ahead

384
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
already sweets planned ahead
 

385
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,150
already sweets planned ahead
all right uh so just uh occasionally at

386
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
all right uh so just uh occasionally at
 

387
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,830
all right uh so just uh occasionally at
the top here every so often

388
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
the top here every so often
 

389
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,909
the top here every so often
i think we'll just throw in like a lamp

390
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
i think we'll just throw in like a lamp
 

391
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,150
i think we'll just throw in like a lamp
maybe put a lever on top i don't really

392
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
maybe put a lever on top i don't really
 

393
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,990
maybe put a lever on top i don't really
want to put like a glowstone here

394
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
want to put like a glowstone here
 

395
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,110
want to put like a glowstone here
with trapdoors on the side because that

396
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
with trapdoors on the side because that
 

397
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,309
with trapdoors on the side because that
will affect the growth

398
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
will affect the growth
 

399
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,070
will affect the growth
if it's just a lever on top though it

400
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
if it's just a lever on top though it
 

401
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,270
if it's just a lever on top though it
wouldn't matter so much

402
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
wouldn't matter so much
 

403
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,550
wouldn't matter so much
does that look good like that yeah so if

404
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
does that look good like that yeah so if
 

405
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,589
does that look good like that yeah so if
we had those going

406
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
we had those going
 

407
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,589
we had those going
along every so often i think that would

408
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
along every so often i think that would
 

409
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,110
along every so often i think that would
probably be okay

410
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
probably be okay
 

411
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,110
probably be okay
um it'll light up the course fruit too

412
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
um it'll light up the course fruit too
 

413
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,710
um it'll light up the course fruit too
so the farm will look nice at night

414
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
so the farm will look nice at night
 

415
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,950
so the farm will look nice at night
uh-huh so this is the nighttime look now

416
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
uh-huh so this is the nighttime look now
 

417
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,629
uh-huh so this is the nighttime look now
i got lights in the top

418
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
i got lights in the top
 

419
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,309
i got lights in the top
along the scaffolding and i also put

420
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
along the scaffolding and i also put
 

421
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,830
along the scaffolding and i also put
some lights in the bottom

422
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
some lights in the bottom
 

423
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,749
some lights in the bottom
i think there's a nine block gap between

424
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
i think there's a nine block gap between
 

425
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,150
i think there's a nine block gap between
them and i tried to alternate them

426
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
them and i tried to alternate them
 

427
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,390
them and i tried to alternate them
two per row so it's in the middle on

428
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
two per row so it's in the middle on
 

429
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,749
two per row so it's in the middle on
this row

430
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
this row
 

431
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,990
this row
and then they're left and right here and

432
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
and then they're left and right here and
 

433
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,510
and then they're left and right here and
as far as i can tell the block lighting

434
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
as far as i can tell the block lighting
 

435
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,469
as far as i can tell the block lighting
in here doesn't

436
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
in here doesn't
 

437
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,830
in here doesn't
drop below 8 anywhere so that's pretty

438
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
drop below 8 anywhere so that's pretty
 

439
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,390
drop below 8 anywhere so that's pretty
good

440
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
good
 

441
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,469
good
this back row i i don't know if i like

442
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
this back row i i don't know if i like
 

443
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,990
this back row i i don't know if i like
this but that's what it is right now

444
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
this but that's what it is right now
 

445
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,950
this but that's what it is right now
oh i never even finished whoops i

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
oh i never even finished whoops i
 

447
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,270
oh i never even finished whoops i
thought i did

448
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280

00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
i think i put the lamps away already i
 

453
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,070
i think i put the lamps away already i
just been putting down two levers and

454
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
just been putting down two levers and
 

455
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,949
just been putting down two levers and
then the

456
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
then the
 

457
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,709
then the
lamps over top that's the way i've been

458
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
lamps over top that's the way i've been
 

459
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,070
lamps over top that's the way i've been
doing this

460
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
doing this
 

461
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,110
doing this
all right so we got uh a full crop

462
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
all right so we got uh a full crop
 

463
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,550
all right so we got uh a full crop
growing here too this is the first time

464
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
growing here too this is the first time
 

465
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,310
growing here too this is the first time
i had enough seeds to fill the whole

466
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
i had enough seeds to fill the whole
 

467
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,269
i had enough seeds to fill the whole
farm

468
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
farm
 

469
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,430
farm
it's 173 plants

470
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
it's 173 plants
 

471
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,470
it's 173 plants
so every harvest i need to get 173 seeds

472
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
so every harvest i need to get 173 seeds
 

473
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,870
so every harvest i need to get 173 seeds
to break even

474
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
to break even
 

475
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,710
to break even
all right okay so i think maybe let's

476
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
all right okay so i think maybe let's
 

477
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,829
all right okay so i think maybe let's
work on this uh

478
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
work on this uh
 

479
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,790
work on this uh
stream part next uh let me get the stuff

480
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
stream part next uh let me get the stuff
 

481
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,750
stream part next uh let me get the stuff
together for that

482
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760

 

483
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,670

all right so i'm trying to think what to

484
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
all right so i'm trying to think what to
 

485
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,430
all right so i'm trying to think what to
do here we're gonna have a problem with

486
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
do here we're gonna have a problem with
 

487
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,190
do here we're gonna have a problem with
this water stream

488
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
this water stream
 

489
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,110
this water stream
uh let me show you what i mean so if we

490
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
uh let me show you what i mean so if we
 

491
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,790
uh let me show you what i mean so if we
just run

492
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
just run
 

493
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,630
just run
ice over here and then put a bucket of

494
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
ice over here and then put a bucket of
 

495
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,790
ice over here and then put a bucket of
water over here

496
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
water over here
 

497
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,389
water over here
you know it only travels eight blocks

498
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
you know it only travels eight blocks
 

499
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,230
you know it only travels eight blocks
then it gets to this point

500
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
then it gets to this point
 

501
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,750
then it gets to this point
so we need a another bucket of water

502
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
so we need a another bucket of water
 

503
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,070
so we need a another bucket of water
let's get some more ice down

504
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,080
let's get some more ice down
 

505
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,430
let's get some more ice down
and okay there we go so we need another

506
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
and okay there we go so we need another
 

507
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,550
and okay there we go so we need another
one like over here

508
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
one like over here
 

509
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,310
one like over here
it's going to flow back like that so i

510
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
it's going to flow back like that so i
 

511
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,870
it's going to flow back like that so i
got to put a sign there

512
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
got to put a sign there
 

513
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,470
got to put a sign there
to stop that from happening and now the

514
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
to stop that from happening and now the
 

515
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,910
to stop that from happening and now the
items can flow through

516
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
items can flow through
 

517
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,710
items can flow through
the only thing is if something washes

518
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
the only thing is if something washes
 

519
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,430
the only thing is if something washes
down over here

520
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
down over here
 

521
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,230
down over here
is gonna stop it's not gonna get washed

522
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
is gonna stop it's not gonna get washed
 

523
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,710
is gonna stop it's not gonna get washed
down

524
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
down
 

525
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,230
down
so i think what i'm going to do

526
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
so i think what i'm going to do
 

527
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,550
so i think what i'm going to do
to to combat that have a second

528
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
to to combat that have a second
 

529
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,630
to to combat that have a second
ice stream below this one

530
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640

 

531
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,949

like this and then wherever it falls

532
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
like this and then wherever it falls
 

533
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,069
like this and then wherever it falls
down like

534
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
down like
 

535
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,269
down like
like over here have water in that spot

536
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
like over here have water in that spot
 

537
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,710
like over here have water in that spot
and the real ice stream is going to be

538
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
and the real ice stream is going to be
 

539
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,509
and the real ice stream is going to be
this lower one

540
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
this lower one
 

541
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,509
this lower one
i think the other way we could do it is

542
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
i think the other way we could do it is
 

543
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,509
i think the other way we could do it is
you could just keep going down gradually

544
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
you could just keep going down gradually
 

545
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,670
you could just keep going down gradually
one one block at a time but by the time

546
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
one one block at a time but by the time
 

547
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,509
one one block at a time but by the time
we get to the end of this farm it's

548
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
we get to the end of this farm it's
 

549
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,310
we get to the end of this farm it's
going to be a really deep hole

550
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
going to be a really deep hole
 

551
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,030
going to be a really deep hole
and i don't want to fall constantly in

552
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
and i don't want to fall constantly in
 

553
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,590
and i don't want to fall constantly in
this

554
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
this
 

555
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,710
this
this uh deep deep hole we did make down

556
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
this uh deep deep hole we did make down
 

557
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,590
this uh deep deep hole we did make down
the middle because it'll

558
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
the middle because it'll
 

559
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,550
the middle because it'll
get down like to about this point here

560
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
get down like to about this point here
 

561
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,110
get down like to about this point here
um

562
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
um
 

563
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,870
um
towards the end all right so i got a lot

564
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
towards the end all right so i got a lot
 

565
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,470
towards the end all right so i got a lot
of stuff to show you guys now i've done

566
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
of stuff to show you guys now i've done
 

567
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,389
of stuff to show you guys now i've done
a bit of work off camera here working on

568
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
a bit of work off camera here working on
 

569
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,750
a bit of work off camera here working on
this water stream business

570
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
this water stream business
 

571
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,350
this water stream business
and uh we're gonna get this farm

572
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
and uh we're gonna get this farm
 

573
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,910
and uh we're gonna get this farm
functional today for sure

574
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
functional today for sure
 

575
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,949
functional today for sure
um so first off i did the thing we have

576
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
um so first off i did the thing we have
 

577
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,630
um so first off i did the thing we have
a second water stream underneath like

578
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
a second water stream underneath like
 

579
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,230
a second water stream underneath like
this i've never actually done this

580
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
this i've never actually done this
 

581
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,030
this i've never actually done this
technique before the nice thing about is

582
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
technique before the nice thing about is
 

583
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,150
technique before the nice thing about is
it keeps keeps everything level like

584
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
it keeps keeps everything level like
 

585
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,470
it keeps keeps everything level like
normally i just go down one block if i

586
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
normally i just go down one block if i
 

587
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,190
normally i just go down one block if i
need it to be

588
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
need it to be
 

589
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,790
need it to be
a long water water stream sort of thing

590
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
a long water water stream sort of thing
 

591
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,509
a long water water stream sort of thing
um but this way everything just fits

592
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
um but this way everything just fits
 

593
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,190
um but this way everything just fits
within a four block height or so

594
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
within a four block height or so
 

595
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,350
within a four block height or so
which is kind of cool got ladders here

596
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
which is kind of cool got ladders here
 

597
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,710
which is kind of cool got ladders here
in case i accidentally fall in i can

598
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
in case i accidentally fall in i can
 

599
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,710
in case i accidentally fall in i can
climb out and i'm hoping that when the

600
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
climb out and i'm hoping that when the
 

601
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,110
climb out and i'm hoping that when the
stuff washes over the side here

602
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
stuff washes over the side here
 

603
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,150
stuff washes over the side here
it's not going to hit that ladder but

604
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
it's not going to hit that ladder but
 

605
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,509
it's not going to hit that ladder but
i'll have to double check i don't think

606
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
i'll have to double check i don't think
 

607
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,230
i'll have to double check i don't think
it will

608
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
it will
 

609
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,030
it will
but we'll have to see all right so all

610
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
but we'll have to see all right so all
 

611
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,430
but we'll have to see all right so all
the

612
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
the
 

613
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,430
the
all the fruit all the seeds and stuff

614
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
all the fruit all the seeds and stuff
 

615
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,750
all the fruit all the seeds and stuff
that i pop off the plants that are on

616
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
that i pop off the plants that are on
 

617
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,350
that i pop off the plants that are on
the ground they're gonna all wash down

618
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
the ground they're gonna all wash down
 

619
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,110
the ground they're gonna all wash down
into this middle

620
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
into this middle
 

621
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,389
into this middle
all right so let's go down here and i've

622
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
all right so let's go down here and i've
 

623
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:42,790
all right so let's go down here and i've
done

624
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
done
 

625
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,030
done
a bunch of stuff so first off it hits

626
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
a bunch of stuff so first off it hits
 

627
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,389
a bunch of stuff so first off it hits
these hoppers and

628
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
these hoppers and
 

629
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,670
these hoppers and
uh redstone crazy gizmo stuff

630
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
uh redstone crazy gizmo stuff
 

631
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,230
uh redstone crazy gizmo stuff
so these hoppers to start off with are

632
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
so these hoppers to start off with are
 

633
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,430
so these hoppers to start off with are
to

634
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
to
 

635
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,670
to
sort the items so we have one that sorts

636
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
sort the items so we have one that sorts
 

637
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,310
sort the items so we have one that sorts
out the flowers the seeds

638
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
out the flowers the seeds
 

639
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,430
out the flowers the seeds
and another one that sorts out the fruit

640
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
and another one that sorts out the fruit
 

641
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,990
and another one that sorts out the fruit
anything that doesn't get picked up by

642
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
anything that doesn't get picked up by
 

643
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,910
anything that doesn't get picked up by
these goes into this chest this is like

644
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
these goes into this chest this is like
 

645
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,230
these goes into this chest this is like
the garbage collection chest

646
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
the garbage collection chest
 

647
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,150
the garbage collection chest
alright if they go into

648
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
alright if they go into
 

649
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,430
alright if they go into
man i did not leave a lot of uh walking

650
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
man i did not leave a lot of uh walking
 

651
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,590
man i did not leave a lot of uh walking
space down here didn't i

652
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
space down here didn't i
 

653
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,269
space down here didn't i
uh if they go into the seed one

654
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
uh if they go into the seed one
 

655
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,310
uh if they go into the seed one
then uh it ends up in this dropper and

656
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
then uh it ends up in this dropper and
 

657
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,629
then uh it ends up in this dropper and
this

658
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
this
 

659
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,629
this
is a special dropper that

660
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639

 

661
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,550

automatically shoots any items in it

662
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
automatically shoots any items in it
 

663
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,230
automatically shoots any items in it
they get shot out over here

664
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240

 

665
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,509

up this item elevator right

666
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
up this item elevator right
 

667
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,590
up this item elevator right
and then i want those blocks back i

668
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
and then i want those blocks back i
 

669
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,310
and then i want those blocks back i
don't have them

670
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
don't have them
 

671
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,350
don't have them
whoops i guess i'll just cover it with

672
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
whoops i guess i'll just cover it with
 

673
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,470
whoops i guess i'll just cover it with
stone

674
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
stone
 

675
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,590
stone
it's fine it's all good not that picky

676
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
it's fine it's all good not that picky
 

677
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,110
it's fine it's all good not that picky
so yeah this is just uh how did i do

678
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
so yeah this is just uh how did i do
 

679
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,030
so yeah this is just uh how did i do
this

680
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
this
 

681
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,470
this
okay so if there's an item in this

682
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
okay so if there's an item in this
 

683
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,550
okay so if there's an item in this
dropper this comparator detects it

684
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
dropper this comparator detects it
 

685
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,350
dropper this comparator detects it
and then into the repeater and then back

686
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
and then into the repeater and then back
 

687
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,150
and then into the repeater and then back
around

688
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
around
 

689
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,269
around
to the dropper there's a more compact

690
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
to the dropper there's a more compact
 

691
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,710
to the dropper there's a more compact
way of doing that but just because of

692
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
way of doing that but just because of
 

693
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,350
way of doing that but just because of
the space

694
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
the space
 

695
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,870
the space
constraints there i had to do it like

696
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
constraints there i had to do it like
 

697
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,670
constraints there i had to do it like
that so the item elevator goes up to

698
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
that so the item elevator goes up to
 

699
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,790
that so the item elevator goes up to
here

700
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
here
 

701
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,990
here
and actually we can just throw some

702
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
and actually we can just throw some
 

703
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,389
and actually we can just throw some
seeds in to show you

704
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
seeds in to show you
 

705
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,990
seeds in to show you
of course since i threw the stone in

706
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
of course since i threw the stone in
 

707
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,509
of course since i threw the stone in
there it's in the in the chest here

708
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
there it's in the in the chest here
 

709
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,030
there it's in the in the chest here
yeah i'll show you what i mean so if we

710
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
yeah i'll show you what i mean so if we
 

711
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,509
yeah i'll show you what i mean so if we
just throw in the seeds

712
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
just throw in the seeds
 

713
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,870
just throw in the seeds
oh that hit the ladders oops uh it

714
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
oh that hit the ladders oops uh it
 

715
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,550
oh that hit the ladders oops uh it
shouldn't hit the ladders

716
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
shouldn't hit the ladders
 

717
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,829
shouldn't hit the ladders
because i don't think they have enough

718
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
because i don't think they have enough
 

719
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,150
because i don't think they have enough
enough momentum to do that

720
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
enough momentum to do that
 

721
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,430
enough momentum to do that
and i'll throw in a little bit of dirt

722
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
and i'll throw in a little bit of dirt
 

723
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,670
and i'll throw in a little bit of dirt
just to show you that it actually does

724
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
just to show you that it actually does
 

725
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,470
just to show you that it actually does
the separating so those seeds are coming

726
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
the separating so those seeds are coming
 

727
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,470
the separating so those seeds are coming
up the item elevator on top of a hopper

728
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
up the item elevator on top of a hopper
 

729
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,590
up the item elevator on top of a hopper
here

730
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
here
 

731
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,389
here
and that just puts in the chest so we

732
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
and that just puts in the chest so we
 

733
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,990
and that just puts in the chest so we
threw 16 in there we got

734
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
threw 16 in there we got
 

735
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,629
threw 16 in there we got
16 in there very good it's close to the

736
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
16 in there very good it's close to the
 

737
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,550
16 in there very good it's close to the
farm so it'll be easy like if

738
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
farm so it'll be easy like if
 

739
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,910
farm so it'll be easy like if
i need to do some replanting

740
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
i need to do some replanting

00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
everything's going to be right here
 

743
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,910
everything's going to be right here
right next to it which is nice

744
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
right next to it which is nice
 

745
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,230
right next to it which is nice
um the garbage should go in here yeah we

746
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
um the garbage should go in here yeah we
 

747
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,069
um the garbage should go in here yeah we
got the dirt there

748

very good and then uh
coarse fruit gets sent into this dropper

752
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
coarse fruit gets sent into this dropper
 

753
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,110
coarse fruit gets sent into this dropper
this is the more compact way of doing it

754
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
this is the more compact way of doing it
 

755
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,550
this is the more compact way of doing it
by the way

756
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
by the way
 

757
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,509
by the way
all right goes over here shoots items

758
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
all right goes over here shoots items
 

759
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,230
all right goes over here shoots items
into this

760
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
into this
 

761
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,870
into this
ice stream that we got to set up yet so

762
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
ice stream that we got to set up yet so
 

763
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,430
ice stream that we got to set up yet so
i think

764
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
i think
 

765
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,350
i think
so to start working on this as we go

766
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
so to start working on this as we go
 

767
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,590
so to start working on this as we go
check out this other thing

768
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
check out this other thing
 

769
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,389
check out this other thing
all right throw down some signs this

770
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
all right throw down some signs this
 

771
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:26,870
all right throw down some signs this
goes

772
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
goes
 

773
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,189
goes
to that blacksmith house we were we were

774
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
to that blacksmith house we were we were
 

775
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,069
to that blacksmith house we were we were
working on

776
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
working on
 

777
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,750
working on
just to give that a little bit more of a

778
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
just to give that a little bit more of a
 

779
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,230
just to give that a little bit more of a
purpose i want to

780
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
purpose i want to
 

781
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,069
purpose i want to
set up something in that that building

782
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
set up something in that that building
 

783
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,430
set up something in that that building
instead of doing it right at the farm

784
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
instead of doing it right at the farm
 

785
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,750
instead of doing it right at the farm
here

786
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760

 

787
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,189

all right so this might take a little

788
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
all right so this might take a little
 

789
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,590
all right so this might take a little
while

790
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600

 

791
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,910

yeah let's not do the whole thing it's

792
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
yeah let's not do the whole thing it's
 

793
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,790
yeah let's not do the whole thing it's
going to take too long

794
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
going to take too long
 

795
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,269
going to take too long
so i'll just run ahead here and show you

796
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
so i'll just run ahead here and show you
 

797
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,350
so i'll just run ahead here and show you
we'll lay down some ice as we go though

798
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360

 

799
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,030

all right so it's not a super long

800
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
all right so it's not a super long
 

801
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,870
all right so it's not a super long
tunnel it's a little bit long

802
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
tunnel it's a little bit long
 

803
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,310
tunnel it's a little bit long
but there's going to be another item

804
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
but there's going to be another item
 

805
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,710
but there's going to be another item
elevator up here

806
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
elevator up here
 

807
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,750
elevator up here
finish this off oh and

808
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
finish this off oh and
 

809
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,310
finish this off oh and
items should pop up over here

810
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
items should pop up over here
 

811
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,949
items should pop up over here
this is right at the house you know i've

812
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
this is right at the house you know i've
 

813
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:11,350
this is right at the house you know i've
never

814
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
never
 

815
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,910
never
seen a acacia forest by the like this by

816
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
seen a acacia forest by the like this by
 

817
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,470
seen a acacia forest by the like this by
the way

818
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
the way
 

819
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,870
the way
this is kind of cool all right if you

820
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
this is kind of cool all right if you
 

821
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,389
this is kind of cool all right if you
took out a few of the logs and you just

822
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
took out a few of the logs and you just
 

823
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,910
took out a few of the logs and you just
had the canopy cover i think it would be

824
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
had the canopy cover i think it would be
 

825
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,990
had the canopy cover i think it would be
a nice effect

826
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
a nice effect
 

827
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,150
a nice effect
um i don't like the color of these logs

828
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
um i don't like the color of these logs
 

829
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,350
um i don't like the color of these logs
really

830
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
really
 

831
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,949
really
i think it would look better if it was a

832
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
i think it would look better if it was a
 

833
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,590
i think it would look better if it was a
like a spruce spruce forest or something

834
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
like a spruce spruce forest or something
 

835
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,310
like a spruce spruce forest or something
but

836
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
but
 

837
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,590
but
i like the canopy it creates all right

838
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
i like the canopy it creates all right
 

839
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,629
i like the canopy it creates all right
so we're gonna

840
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
so we're gonna
 

841
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,110
so we're gonna
send these down another water stream at

842
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
send these down another water stream at
 

843
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,189
send these down another water stream at
the top here

844
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
the top here
 

845
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,030
the top here
so we'll put down some ice to that

846
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040

 

847
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,670

okay so items will pop up right here and

848
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
okay so items will pop up right here and
 

849
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,629
okay so items will pop up right here and
we want them to go this way get some

850
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
we want them to go this way get some
 

851
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,790
we want them to go this way get some
more stone

852
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
more stone
 

853
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,949
more stone
all right let's uh i am a little picky

854
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
all right let's uh i am a little picky
 

855
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,629
all right let's uh i am a little picky
about dirt though i don't like having

856
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
about dirt though i don't like having
 

857
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,150
about dirt though i don't like having
dirt with the water streams

858
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
dirt with the water streams
 

859
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,590
dirt with the water streams
i always like to change that out so

860
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
i always like to change that out so
 

861
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,470
i always like to change that out so
we'll use stone bricks

862
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
we'll use stone bricks
 

863
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,829
we'll use stone bricks
okay all the way to

864
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
okay all the way to
 

865
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,189
okay all the way to
here is this going to reach i don't

866
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
here is this going to reach i don't
 

867
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,790
here is this going to reach i don't
think it is

868
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
think it is
 

869
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,110
think it is
anyway let's just put a sign there then

870
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
anyway let's just put a sign there then
 

871
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,949
anyway let's just put a sign there then
because we'll need two water streams

872
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
because we'll need two water streams
 

873
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,509
because we'll need two water streams
here

874
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519

 

875
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,189

okay that'll wash over here and then

876
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
okay that'll wash over here and then
 

877
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,230
okay that'll wash over here and then
we'll have another one over there i'm

878
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
we'll have another one over there i'm
 

879
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,590
we'll have another one over there i'm
going to have to put

880
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
going to have to put
 

881
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,150
going to have to put
some stone in front of these hoppers i

882
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
some stone in front of these hoppers i
 

883
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,030
some stone in front of these hoppers i
did a really

884
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
did a really
 

885
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,350
did a really
lazy auto smelting setup here i'll show

886
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
lazy auto smelting setup here i'll show
 

887
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,430
lazy auto smelting setup here i'll show
you

888
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
you
 

889
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,590
you
oh or i don't know if lazy is the right

890
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
oh or i don't know if lazy is the right
 

891
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,110
oh or i don't know if lazy is the right
term quick

892
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
term quick
 

893
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,150
term quick
yeah let's call it quick so it's uh

894
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
yeah let's call it quick so it's uh
 

895
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,749
yeah let's call it quick so it's uh
when the course fruit comes by here it's

896
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
when the course fruit comes by here it's
 

897
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,749
when the course fruit comes by here it's
going to go into this first topper first

898
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
going to go into this first topper first
 

899
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,110
going to go into this first topper first
and then the second one third fourth

900
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
and then the second one third fourth
 

901
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,030
and then the second one third fourth
fifth it doesn't actually spread out the

902
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
fifth it doesn't actually spread out the
 

903
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,310
fifth it doesn't actually spread out the
items

904
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
items
 

905
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,110
items
uh like some of these do it just fills

906
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
uh like some of these do it just fills
 

907
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,710
uh like some of these do it just fills
this one up then fills this one up and

908
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
this one up then fills this one up and
 

909
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,030
this one up then fills this one up and
then

910
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
then
 

911
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,470
then
goes all the way down to the front so

912
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
goes all the way down to the front so
 

913
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,030
goes all the way down to the front so
uh we might only have one furnace going

914
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
uh we might only have one furnace going
 

915
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,870
uh we might only have one furnace going
at a time because of that

916
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
at a time because of that
 

917
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,390
at a time because of that
um and then in the back here we have our

918
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
um and then in the back here we have our
 

919
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,789
um and then in the back here we have our
coal

920
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
coal
 

921
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,429
coal
injection going into the side so if we

922
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
injection going into the side so if we
 

923
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,630
injection going into the side so if we
drop coal into here

924
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
drop coal into here
 

925
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,150
drop coal into here
goes into the furnace like so

926
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
goes into the furnace like so
 

927
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,510
goes into the furnace like so
let me get these back i want to split

928
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
let me get these back i want to split
 

929
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,909
let me get these back i want to split
them up but i have hoppers running along

930
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
them up but i have hoppers running along
 

931
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,429
them up but i have hoppers running along
the top as well

932
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
the top as well
 

933
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,429
the top as well
and again that's this is kind of a lazy

934
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
and again that's this is kind of a lazy
 

935
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,710
and again that's this is kind of a lazy
way of doing it where it's going to go

936
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
way of doing it where it's going to go
 

937
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,549
way of doing it where it's going to go
into this one first and then this one

938
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
into this one first and then this one
 

939
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,029
into this one first and then this one
and then

940
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
and then
 

941
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,390
and then
all the way down but it works if we put

942
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
all the way down but it works if we put
 

943
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,110
all the way down but it works if we put
enough colon

944
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120

 

945
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,150

oh and oh i wonder if they fixed this by

946
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
oh and oh i wonder if they fixed this by
 

947
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,630
oh and oh i wonder if they fixed this by
the way there's a glitch where if you

948
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
the way there's a glitch where if you
 

949
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,830
the way there's a glitch where if you
break a block of coal or a block of

950
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
break a block of coal or a block of
 

951
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,710
break a block of coal or a block of
diamonds

952
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
diamonds
 

953
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,150
diamonds
into the individual pieces you lose some

954
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
into the individual pieces you lose some
 

955
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,590
into the individual pieces you lose some
so we should get let's see that used up

956
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
so we should get let's see that used up
 

957
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,630
so we should get let's see that used up
eight eight times

958
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
eight eight times
 

959
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,070
eight eight times
nine is not 64. so they haven't fixed it

960
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
nine is not 64. so they haven't fixed it
 

961
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,710
nine is not 64. so they haven't fixed it
yet

962
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
yet
 

963
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,549
yet
72 right

964
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559

 

965
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,789

i think so let's hope so all right

966
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
i think so let's hope so all right
 

967
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,470
i think so let's hope so all right
but yeah all the coarse fruits going to

968
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
but yeah all the coarse fruits going to
 

969
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,750
but yeah all the coarse fruits going to
go into these hoppers down to the

970
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
go into these hoppers down to the
 

971
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,350
go into these hoppers down to the
furnace auto smelt

972
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
furnace auto smelt
 

973
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,870
furnace auto smelt
and these ones in the bottom pull it out

974
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
and these ones in the bottom pull it out
 

975
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,470
and these ones in the bottom pull it out
from there and they're going to put

976
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
from there and they're going to put
 

977
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,270
from there and they're going to put
everything in these chests here

978
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
everything in these chests here
 

979
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,870
everything in these chests here
cool so we got quite a bit of stuff done

980
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
cool so we got quite a bit of stuff done
 

981
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,470
cool so we got quite a bit of stuff done
on this farm already uh

982
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
on this farm already uh
 

983
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,990
on this farm already uh
we're going to give it the big test now

984
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
we're going to give it the big test now
 

985
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,110
we're going to give it the big test now
though i want to make sure everything

986
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
though i want to make sure everything
 

987
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,870
though i want to make sure everything
works the way i hope it does make sure

988
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
works the way i hope it does make sure
 

989
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,070
works the way i hope it does make sure
everything

990
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
everything
 

991
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,470
everything
functions properly and it auto smelts

992
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
functions properly and it auto smelts
 

993
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,909
functions properly and it auto smelts
the purple blocks and all that kind of

994
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
the purple blocks and all that kind of
 

995
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,789
the purple blocks and all that kind of
stuff

996
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
stuff
 

997
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,230
stuff
so to begin with i'm going to get rid of

998
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
so to begin with i'm going to get rid of
 

999
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,470
so to begin with i'm going to get rid of
the seeds here we got to make sure we

1000
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
the seeds here we got to make sure we
 

1001
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,990
the seeds here we got to make sure we
get 173c seeds from a single

1002
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
get 173c seeds from a single
 

1003
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,950
get 173c seeds from a single
pass-through if we don't we might need

1004
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
pass-through if we don't we might need
 

1005
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,909
pass-through if we don't we might need
to make some other way of getting seeds

1006
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
to make some other way of getting seeds
 

1007
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,430
to make some other way of getting seeds
for this first test i'm not going to

1008
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
for this first test i'm not going to
 

1009
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,350
for this first test i'm not going to
harvest these lower ones if we don't get

1010
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
harvest these lower ones if we don't get
 

1011
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,870
harvest these lower ones if we don't get
enough seeds though i might have to do

1012
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
enough seeds though i might have to do
 

1013
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,510
enough seeds though i might have to do
that

1014
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
that
 

1015
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,870
that
because these are these are pretty easy

1016
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
because these are these are pretty easy
 

1017
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,950
because these are these are pretty easy
to get to if we just run through

1018
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:44,960
to get to if we just run through
 

1019
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,430
to get to if we just run through
but i'm just gonna get the top ones all

1020
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
but i'm just gonna get the top ones all
 

1021
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,070
but i'm just gonna get the top ones all
right

1022
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
right
 

1023
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,990
right
the problem is i only got five minutes

1024
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
the problem is i only got five minutes
 

1025
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,190
the problem is i only got five minutes
to

1026
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
to
 

1027
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,029
to
to chop all these seeds and like get

1028
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
to chop all these seeds and like get
 

1029
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,310
to chop all these seeds and like get
them in those hoppers there otherwise

1030
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
them in those hoppers there otherwise
 

1031
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,230
them in those hoppers there otherwise
they're gonna start despawning so

1032
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
they're gonna start despawning so
 

1033
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,070
they're gonna start despawning so
as soon as i start breaking these it's

1034
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
as soon as i start breaking these it's
 

1035
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,350
as soon as i start breaking these it's
it's on

hoppers can handle the load of all these
 

1103

1117
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,830
that's a problem i wonder if they went
to the second one oh that sucks

1118
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:46,840

 

1119
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,630

yeah we got a problem uh
it's too many items all at once and i

1124
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
it's too many items all at once and i
 

1125
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,149
it's too many items all at once and i
didn't realize that they could skip a

1126
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
didn't realize that they could skip a
 

1127
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,029
didn't realize that they could skip a
hopper

1128
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
hopper
 

1129
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,710
hopper
they went to the second one

1130
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
they went to the second one
 

1131
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,710
they went to the second one
let's just grab these before they d

1132
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
let's just grab these before they d
 

1133
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,750
let's just grab these before they d
these spawn on us i guess

1134
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
these spawn on us i guess
 

1135
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,390
these spawn on us i guess
okay so i'm gonna take the seeds out

1136
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400

 

1137
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,110

yeah we have to change a few things here

1138
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
yeah we have to change a few things here
 

1139
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,310
yeah we have to change a few things here
because now these are going to go to the

1140
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
because now these are going to go to the
 

1141
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,909
because now these are going to go to the
garbage

1142
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
garbage
 

1143
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,669
garbage
i'm pretty sure

1144
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679

 

1145
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,470

or no no um

1146
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480

 

1147
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,470

if we had more coarse fruit they would

1148
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
if we had more coarse fruit they would
 

1149
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,149
if we had more coarse fruit they would
have they would have been standing there

1150
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
have they would have been standing there
 

1151
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,190
have they would have been standing there
too though

1152
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
too though
 

1153
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,630
too though
because there's only room for three more

1154
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
because there's only room for three more
 

1155
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,549
because there's only room for three more
stacks and we have like 10

1156
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
stacks and we have like 10
 

1157
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,390
stacks and we have like 10
extra stacks on us so that would have

1158
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
extra stacks on us so that would have
 

1159
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,510
extra stacks on us so that would have
been way way too many

1160
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
been way way too many
 

1161
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,590
been way way too many
oh and i need a block covering here

1162

473 128
 

1181
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,350
473 128
plus 50 is 178 plus 7

1182
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
plus 50 is 178 plus 7
 

1183
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,789
plus 50 is 178 plus 7
is uh 185

1184
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
is uh 185
 

1185
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,390
is uh 185
so we got a little bit of a profit there

1186

1211
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,149
gonna do with the ladders since we need
a sign here

a sign here
 

1213
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,230
a sign here
ladder will do the same thing just put

1214
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
ladder will do the same thing just put
 

1215
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,669
ladder will do the same thing just put
it like that

it like that
 

1217
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,190
it like that
nice and simple gets rid of the sign

1218
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
nice and simple gets rid of the sign
 

1219
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,789
nice and simple gets rid of the sign
adds a ladder and then the ladder's high

1220
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
adds a ladder and then the ladder's high
 

1221
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,310
adds a ladder and then the ladder's high
enough that the items won't land on top

1222
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
enough that the items won't land on top
 

1223
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,830
enough that the items won't land on top
of it

1224
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
of it
 

1225
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,590
of it

um i'm noticing something with our
dispenser

1230
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
dispenser
 

1231
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,510
dispenser
thing down there as well

1232
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
thing down there as well
 

1233
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,390
thing down there as well
let's finish this up okay let's go over

here now
 

1237
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,149
here now
i want to add a button on the front

1238
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
i want to add a button on the front
 

1239
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,270
i want to add a button on the front
maybe by this

1240
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,280
maybe by this
 

1241
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,190
maybe by this
chest that's going to activate the water

1242
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
chest that's going to activate the water
 

1243
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,110
chest that's going to activate the water
and i'm going to set it on a timer so

1244
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
and i'm going to set it on a timer so
 

1245
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,149
and i'm going to set it on a timer so
that it will

1246
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:22,159
that it will
 

1247
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,110
that it will
automatically close or shut off the

1248
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
automatically close or shut off the
 

1249
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,630
automatically close or shut off the
water after a certain amount of time

1250
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
water after a certain amount of time
 

1251
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,390
water after a certain amount of time
that it takes all the items to flow from

1252
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
that it takes all the items to flow from
 

1253
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,669
that it takes all the items to flow from
the back to the water stream

1254
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
the back to the water stream
 

1255
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,270
the back to the water stream
that'll simplify things a little bit and

1256
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
that'll simplify things a little bit and
 

1257
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,710
that'll simplify things a little bit and
all we got to do here is add a block

1258
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
all we got to do here is add a block
 

1259
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,310
all we got to do here is add a block
so it doesn't go to this hopper we

1260
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
so it doesn't go to this hopper we
 

1261
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,630
so it doesn't go to this hopper we
probably need to add

1262
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640

 

1263
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,470

i don't know how to do this we need some

1264
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480
i don't know how to do this we need some
 

1265
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,830
i don't know how to do this we need some
way of picking up the items faster

1266
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
way of picking up the items faster
 

1267
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,230
way of picking up the items faster
though

1268
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
though
 

1269
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,789
though
i have to think about that uh this here

1270
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
i have to think about that uh this here
 

1271
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,710
i have to think about that uh this here
we can actually speed up

1272
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
we can actually speed up
 

1273
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,310
we can actually speed up
this doesn't need to be on a two-tick

1274
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
this doesn't need to be on a two-tick
 

1275
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,190
this doesn't need to be on a two-tick
delay so what i'm going to try to do

1276
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200

 

1277
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,750

is do a quick pulsar as fast as we can

1278
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
is do a quick pulsar as fast as we can
 

1279
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,909
is do a quick pulsar as fast as we can
if i run this back

1280
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
if i run this back
 

1281
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:20,230
if i run this back
oh wait a second

1282
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240

 

1283
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,990

yeah that's right right i

1284
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,000
yeah that's right right i
 

1285
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,830
yeah that's right right i
i'm confused by that

1286
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840

 

1287
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,590

1289
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,430

yeah i think that'll work right or is

1290
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
yeah i think that'll work right or is
 

1291
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,750
yeah i think that'll work right or is
this gonna let's take these out

1292
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760

 

1293
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,470

oh no that's not gonna work yeah we need

1294
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
oh no that's not gonna work yeah we need
 

1295
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,990
oh no that's not gonna work yeah we need
that repeater

1296
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
that repeater
 

1297
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,909
that repeater
okay gonna put the repeater back like so

1298
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
okay gonna put the repeater back like so
 

1299
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,269
okay gonna put the repeater back like so
and

1300
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
and
 

1301
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,029
and
this is the last of my redstone again by

1302
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
this is the last of my redstone again by
 

1303
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,470
this is the last of my redstone again by
the way we got to get that which farm up

1304
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
the way we got to get that which farm up
 

1305
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,310
the way we got to get that which farm up
and running

1306
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
and running
 

1307
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,390
and running
it's a little bit faster not quite as

1308
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
it's a little bit faster not quite as
 

1309
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,710
it's a little bit faster not quite as
quick as i'd like though

1310
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
quick as i'd like though
 

1311
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,110
quick as i'd like though
and let's go double check on the

1312
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
and let's go double check on the
 

1313
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,470
and let's go double check on the
blacksmith building there to make sure

1314
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
blacksmith building there to make sure
 

1315
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,830
blacksmith building there to make sure
we're actually getting the purpure

1316
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
we're actually getting the purpure
 

1317
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,190
we're actually getting the purpure
blocks melting

1318
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200

 

1319
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,110

and so i never did finish the inside of

1320
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
and so i never did finish the inside of
 

1321
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,710
and so i never did finish the inside of
this and i want to try

1322
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
this and i want to try
 

1323
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,070
this and i want to try
