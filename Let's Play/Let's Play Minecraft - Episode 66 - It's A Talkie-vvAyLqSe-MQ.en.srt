all be done and then I'll be able to
 

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,210
all be done and then I'll be able to
play Minecraft a lot more again which is

play Minecraft a lot more again which is
 

15
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:33,020
play Minecraft a lot more again which is
very cool during the month of May pretty

much the only time I've played this game

18
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,530
much the only time I've played this game
 

19
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,090
much the only time I've played this game
is why I was recording episodes to post

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,100
is why I was recording episodes to post
 

21
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,389
is why I was recording episodes to post
on YouTube and other than that I really

on YouTube and other than that I really
 

23
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,330
on YouTube and other than that I really
haven't played much so it'll be fun to

24
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,340
haven't played much so it'll be fun to
 

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,590
haven't played much so it'll be fun to
play again do things off-camera I'm

26
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:48,600
play again do things off-camera I'm
 

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,930
play again do things off-camera I'm
running really low on resources because

28
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:50,940
running really low on resources because
 

29
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,850
running really low on resources because
normally when I play you know I

30
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:52,860
normally when I play you know I

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,300
mean looking for resources and other
 

35
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,189
mean looking for resources and other
things I'm almost out of sand out of

36
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
things I'm almost out of sand out of
 

37
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,840
things I'm almost out of sand out of
glass and I think my meat supplies low

38
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:08,850
glass and I think my meat supplies low
 

39
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,000
glass and I think my meat supplies low
not that that's really hard to replenish

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,010
not that that's really hard to replenish
 

41
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,320
not that that's really hard to replenish
I know I'm out of gold low on redstone

42
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,330
I know I'm out of gold low on redstone
 

43
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,630
I know I'm out of gold low on redstone
low on coal so

44
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:19,640

 

45
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,880

oh yeah and I like ran out of wood too

46
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:21,890
oh yeah and I like ran out of wood too
 

47
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,730
oh yeah and I like ran out of wood too
but I just did a bunch of tree

48
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:24,740
but I just did a bunch of tree
 

49
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,620
but I just did a bunch of tree
harvesting so I should be good again for

50
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:26,630
harvesting so I should be good again for
 

51
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,690
harvesting so I should be good again for
a while and the only thing I've really

52
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:31,700
a while and the only thing I've really
 

53
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,930
a while and the only thing I've really
done off-camera recently is I added

54
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:34,940
done off-camera recently is I added
 

55
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,719
done off-camera recently is I added
these double doors which are not in sync

56
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:39,729
these double doors which are not in sync
 

57
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,730
these double doors which are not in sync
and I can't get them in sync

58
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:42,740
and I can't get them in sync
 

59
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,200
and I can't get them in sync
because there's a glitch where one of

60
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,210
because there's a glitch where one of
 

61
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,800
because there's a glitch where one of
the redstone torches is only being

62
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:50,810
the redstone torches is only being
 

63
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,749
the redstone torches is only being
delayed by one tick instead of the

64
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:52,759
delayed by one tick instead of the
 

65
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,310
delayed by one tick instead of the
normal of two so even though I have a

66
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,320
normal of two so even though I have a
 

67
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,990
normal of two so even though I have a
repeater set to the other door there's

68
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,000
repeater set to the other door there's
 

69
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,690
repeater set to the other door there's
no way to balance it out because it's an

70
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:01,700
no way to balance it out because it's an
 

71
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,430
no way to balance it out because it's an
even number and other doors an odd

72
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:03,440
even number and other doors an odd
 

73
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,420
even number and other doors an odd
number so I'm gonna have to check the

74
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:07,430
number so I'm gonna have to check the
 

75
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,359
number so I'm gonna have to check the
wiki on how to deal with that glitch

76
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:10,369
wiki on how to deal with that glitch
 

77
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:12,430
wiki on how to deal with that glitch
because I don't quite fully understand

78
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,440
because I don't quite fully understand
 

79
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,970
because I don't quite fully understand
it and the other thing I've done is I've

80
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:15,980
it and the other thing I've done is I've
 

81
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,410
it and the other thing I've done is I've
added blasts around the wolf cage here

82
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:19,420
added blasts around the wolf cage here
 

83
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,850
added blasts around the wolf cage here
got rid of the fences because they look

84
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:21,860
got rid of the fences because they look
 

85
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,750
got rid of the fences because they look
really ugly and I added this lever here

86
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:28,760
really ugly and I added this lever here
 

87
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,750
really ugly and I added this lever here
which is basically a quick-release so

88
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:34,760
which is basically a quick-release so
 

89
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,990
which is basically a quick-release so
it's F four sets of double doors all

90
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
it's F four sets of double doors all
 

91
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,410
it's F four sets of double doors all
controlled by one lever and they're not

92
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:44,420
controlled by one lever and they're not
 

93
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,229
controlled by one lever and they're not
in sync either but I don't care

94
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
in sync either but I don't care
 

95
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,150
in sync either but I don't care
because I'm not going to even bother

96
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,160
because I'm not going to even bother
 

97
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,009
because I'm not going to even bother
doing all the extra wiring to get them

98
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:51,019
doing all the extra wiring to get them
 

99
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,090
doing all the extra wiring to get them
in sync at the moment there's no animals

100
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,100
in sync at the moment there's no animals

in sync at the moment there's no animals
coming in here because I have it to

102
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:57,580
coming in here because I have it to
 

103
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,110
coming in here because I have it to
demolish the passive mob evader I built

104
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
demolish the passive mob evader I built
 

105
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,430
demolish the passive mob evader I built
in that tutorial and then this is the

106
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:06,440
in that tutorial and then this is the
 

107
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,300
in that tutorial and then this is the
wiring which you can't see very well

108
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,310
wiring which you can't see very well
 

109
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,170
wiring which you can't see very well
because it's a enclosed circle but I'm

110
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,180
because it's a enclosed circle but I'm
 

111
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,640
because it's a enclosed circle but I'm
sure eventually I'll put my world up for

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:15,650
sure eventually I'll put my world up for

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,569
sure eventually I'll put my world up for
download again and you can mine your way

114
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:19,579
download again and you can mine your way
 

115
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,340

through that if you want to look closer

116
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,350
through that if you want to look closer
 

117
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,390
through that if you want to look closer
at the wiring and the one point six

118
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
at the wiring and the one point six
 

119
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,550
at the wiring and the one point six
point six patch came out I think that's

120
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
point six patch came out I think that's
 

121
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,470
point six patch came out I think that's
what it is they don't show it on the top

122
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
what it is they don't show it on the top
 

123
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,460
what it is they don't show it on the top
left of the screen

124
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:33,470
left of the screen
 

125
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,560
left of the screen
anymore which I don't really like but I

126
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,570
anymore which I don't really like but I
 

127
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,510
anymore which I don't really like but I
think my game is running a little bit

128
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:40,520
think my game is running a little bit
 

129
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,870
think my game is running a little bit
slower now but I see there's different

130
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:43,880
slower now but I see there's different
 

131
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,570
slower now but I see there's different
options here I'll have to play around

132
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:46,580
options here I'll have to play around
 

133
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,700
options here I'll have to play around
with them I can't record at 1080p

134
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:51,710
with them I can't record at 1080p
 

135
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:58,380
with them I can't record at 1080p
anymore so there's definitely some

136
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,390

 

137
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,270

141
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,200

nothing has changed on my computer so it

142
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,210
nothing has changed on my computer so it
 

143
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:17,199
nothing has changed on my computer so it
must be the game you know let's go to

like this was a good idea I think it

368
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:31,480
like this was a good idea I think it
 

369
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,870
like this was a good idea I think it
just didn't work quite like I wanted it

370
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:33,880
just didn't work quite like I wanted it
 

371
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,240
just didn't work quite like I wanted it
to it takes them too long to fall down

372
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,250
to it takes them too long to fall down
 

373
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,509
to it takes them too long to fall down
the holes and I saw the other day that

374
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
the holes and I saw the other day that
 

375
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,030
the holes and I saw the other day that
more than one can fall down each hole so

376
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,040
more than one can fall down each hole so
 

377
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,769
more than one can fall down each hole so
it doesn't even separate them like I

378
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:43,779
it doesn't even separate them like I
 

379
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,900
it doesn't even separate them like I
wanted it to because animals are under a

380
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:48,910
wanted it to because animals are under a
 

381
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,600
wanted it to because animals are under a
block and a half in height so it didn't

382
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,610
block and a half in height so it didn't
 

383
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,490
block and a half in height so it didn't
work and some people suggested I should

384
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:56,500
work and some people suggested I should
 

385
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,290
work and some people suggested I should
have water currents pushing them in yeah

386
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:58,300
have water currents pushing them in yeah
 

387
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,030
have water currents pushing them in yeah
that might work but again it's still

388
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,040
that might work but again it's still
 

389
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,180
that might work but again it's still
gonna take a long time even with the

390
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,190
gonna take a long time even with the
 

391
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,079
gonna take a long time even with the
water currents helping so I'd rather

392
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:07,089
water currents helping so I'd rather
 

393
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:08,759
water currents helping so I'd rather
just punch a hole in the floor somewhere

394
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:08,769
just punch a hole in the floor somewhere
 

395
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:14,699
just punch a hole in the floor somewhere
and drop them all down so that not cuz

396
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:14,709
and drop them all down so that not cuz
 

397
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,750
and drop them all down so that not cuz
idea was I wanted to come in here at any

398
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:18,760
idea was I wanted to come in here at any
 

399
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,490
idea was I wanted to come in here at any
random time and have a ton of animals

400
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:20,500
random time and have a ton of animals
 

401
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,819
random time and have a ton of animals
walking around or on each of these

402
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:23,829
walking around or on each of these
 

403
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,210
walking around or on each of these
things and it's just not working

404
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:26,220
things and it's just not working
 

405
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,730
things and it's just not working
there'll be one or two sometimes but

406
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:28,740
there'll be one or two sometimes but
 

407
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,050
there'll be one or two sometimes but
most of the time they're wandering

408
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,060
most of the time they're wandering
 

409
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,769
most of the time they're wandering
around up there so it's not quite how I

410
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:33,779
around up there so it's not quite how I
 

411
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,749
around up there so it's not quite how I
envisioned this wolf cage is working

412
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:35,759
envisioned this wolf cage is working
 

413
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,499
envisioned this wolf cage is working
good though and I added I added this

414
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:39,509
good though and I added I added this
 

415
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,420
good though and I added I added this
lever here just to balance it out I

416
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:41,430
lever here just to balance it out I
 

417
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:49,360
lever here just to balance it out I
might make it do something not sure yet

418
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,370

 

419
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,179

and I'll have a balcony yet probably

420
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:53,189
and I'll have a balcony yet probably
 

421
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,800
and I'll have a balcony yet probably
move the ocean out somehow and probably

422
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:57,810
move the ocean out somehow and probably
 

423
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,590
move the ocean out somehow and probably
pretty chasing around this wiring

424
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:02,600

 

425
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:14,900

I never finished it which is a little

444
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,180
I never finished it which is a little
 

445
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,850
I never finished it which is a little
strange I've never actually built a nice

446

strange I've never actually built a nice
 

447
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,620

road that I use which is kind of weird

448
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:48,630
road that I use which is kind of weird
 

449
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,900
road that I use which is kind of weird
because I'm one that kind of invented it

450
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,910
because I'm one that kind of invented it
 

451
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,939
because I'm one that kind of invented it
a lot of people have added to it of

452
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:52,949
a lot of people have added to it of
 

453
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:58,220
a lot of people have added to it of
course I should really finish it

454
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,230
course I should really finish it
 

455
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,189
course I should really finish it
I'll try finish it sometime soon let's

456
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
I'll try finish it sometime soon let's
 

457
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:11,180
I'll try finish it sometime soon let's
see if it works though

458
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,190

 

459
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:17,150

get all the new ez loader is broken

460
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,160

 

461
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,160

that's one reason why I think I've never

462
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,170
that's one reason why I think I've never
 

463
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,260
that's one reason why I think I've never
finished this because it's just so

464
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,270
finished this because it's just so
 

465
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,780
finished this because it's just so
frustrating having it break all the time

466
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,790
frustrating having it break all the time
 

467
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:31,170
frustrating having it break all the time
I think water currents get messed around

468
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,180
I think water currents get messed around
 

469
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:39,290
I think water currents get messed around
with more than anything in the game code

470
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:39,300

 

471
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,570

okay let's try the old-style

472
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:44,580

 

473
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:51,780

old-style works again that's good and

474
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:51,790
old-style works again that's good and
 

475
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,810
old-style works again that's good and
that comes up much faster now it is also

476
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:54,820
that comes up much faster now it is also
 

477
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,710
that comes up much faster now it is also
very good I believe you still need to

478
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
very good I believe you still need to
 

479
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
very good I believe you still need to
put solid water source blocks in your

480
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:00,730
put solid water source blocks in your
 

481
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:10,410
put solid water source blocks in your
elevator and I'm pretty sure this will

482
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:10,420
elevator and I'm pretty sure this will
 

483
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,210
elevator and I'm pretty sure this will
still release two boats unless you have

484
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,220
still release two boats unless you have
 

485
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,000
still release two boats unless you have
a monostable circuit hooked up to the

486
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,010
a monostable circuit hooked up to the
 

487
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,950
a monostable circuit hooked up to the
door to keep it open shorter yeah it let

488
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:19,960
door to keep it open shorter yeah it let
 

489
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,310
door to keep it open shorter yeah it let
to up there's a pressure plate keeps the

490
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:23,320
to up there's a pressure plate keeps the
 

491
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,780
to up there's a pressure plate keeps the
door open too long now the boat or the

492
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:27,790
door open too long now the boat or the
 

493
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,700
door open too long now the boat or the
road is working though from what I can

494
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:29,710
road is working though from what I can
 

495
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,980
road is working though from what I can
tell like wondering about this thing

496
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:31,990
tell like wondering about this thing
 

497
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,710
tell like wondering about this thing
here no homework

498
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720

 

499
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,350

has to be solid water source blocks and

500
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
has to be solid water source blocks and
 

501
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,819
has to be solid water source blocks and
I never changed that but overall it

502
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:43,829
I never changed that but overall it
 

503
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:46,389
I never changed that but overall it
seems to be working a lot better now

504
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
seems to be working a lot better now
 

505
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,470
seems to be working a lot better now
so I should work on finishing it I

506
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:53,480

 

507
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,240

actually made it pretty far here I just

508
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,250
actually made it pretty far here I just
 

509
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:03,800
actually made it pretty far here I just
need to extend the road and I'm almost

510
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:03,810
need to extend the road and I'm almost
 

511
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:10,160
need to extend the road and I'm almost
at the other Island finally uh-huh

512
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,170
at the other Island finally uh-huh
 

513
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,340
at the other Island finally uh-huh
so each Road working again I'm happy

514
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,350
so each Road working again I'm happy
 

515
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,309
so each Road working again I'm happy
with that let's hope it stays working

516
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:16,319
with that let's hope it stays working
 

517
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,249
with that let's hope it stays working
because I'm going to need it for my a

518
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:19,259
because I'm going to need it for my a
 

519
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,319
because I'm going to need it for my a
secret project which is another thing I

00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:27,569
want to talk about actually I've been
 

523
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,980
want to talk about actually I've been
mentioning this project for a while

524
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:29,990
mentioning this project for a while
 

525
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,230
mentioning this project for a while
basically what happened about five

526
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,240
basically what happened about five
 

527
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,600
basically what happened about five
months ago or so four or five months ago

528

months ago or so four or five months ago
I started working on a big project that

530
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,660
I started working on a big project that
 

531
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,389
I started working on a big project that
I call the secret project and I had just

532
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
I call the secret project and I had just
 

533
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,809
I call the secret project and I had just
laid the foundation for it and as I was

534
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:47,819
laid the foundation for it and as I was
 

535
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:50,840
laid the foundation for it and as I was
building it I discovered something which

536
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:50,850
building it I discovered something which
 

537
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,949
building it I discovered something which
you all know as eats now the idea kind

538
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
you all know as eats now the idea kind
 

539
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,829
you all know as eats now the idea kind
of came to me while I was building my

540
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
of came to me while I was building my
 

541
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,920
of came to me while I was building my
project because it uses it for something

542
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:00,930
project because it uses it for something
 

543
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:08,829
project because it uses it for something
and well when I first showed my eats

544
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:08,839
and well when I first showed my eats
 

545
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,689
and well when I first showed my eats
examples the people kept asking me for

546
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:11,699
examples the people kept asking me for
 

547
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,929
examples the people kept asking me for
tutorials so I spent some time on that

548
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:14,939
tutorials so I spent some time on that
 

549
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,039
tutorials so I spent some time on that
and then I made an LP which I took

550
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,049
and then I made an LP which I took
 

551
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,870
and then I made an LP which I took
forever to get established but now I'm

552
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
forever to get established but now I'm
 

553
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,270
forever to get established but now I'm
finally established in my LP that I can

554
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
finally established in my LP that I can
 

555
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,059
finally established in my LP that I can
that tackle a big project like I have

556
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:26,069
that tackle a big project like I have
 

557
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,049
that tackle a big project like I have
planned so that's what I'm gonna work on

558
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,059

559
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,779
planned so that's what I'm gonna work on
but it is a secret project which means

560
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:34,789
but it is a secret project which means
 

561
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:37,820
but it is a secret project which means
you guys are not going to see it until

562
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:37,830
you guys are not going to see it until
 

563
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,409

566
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build it
 

567
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,700
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build it
away from my base far away from my base

568
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:46,710
away from my base far away from my base
 

569
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,770
away from my base far away from my base
somewhere

570
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:48,780
somewhere
 

571
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,240
somewhere
and I want you guys to watch me build it

572
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,250
and I want you guys to watch me build it
 

573
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,800
and I want you guys to watch me build it
but at the same time I want you to be

574
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:55,810
but at the same time I want you to be
 

575

580
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,370
and I'm also hoping to kind of make like
 

581
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,630
and I'm also hoping to kind of make like
a viral minecraft video that spits at

582
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
a viral minecraft video that spits at
 

583
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,800
a viral minecraft video that spits at
least at least a hundred thousand views

584
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:09,810
least at least a hundred thousand views
 

585
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,420

587
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,100
and I want to make a nice polished video
because if you guys watch me build it

588
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,110
because if you guys watch me build it
 

589
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,140
because if you guys watch me build it
when I finally release a nice polished

590
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,150
when I finally release a nice polished
 

591
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,150
when I finally release a nice polished
video it's like oh well you seen you

592
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
video it's like oh well you seen you
 

593
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,410
video it's like oh well you seen you
build this and it won't be as impressive

594
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:22,420
build this and it won't be as impressive
 

595
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,610
build this and it won't be as impressive
so you know build a I'm gonna build a

596
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:26,620
so you know build a I'm gonna build a
 

597
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,610
so you know build a I'm gonna build a
project off camera but as I do that I'm

598
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:29,620
project off camera but as I do that I'm
 

599
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,660
project off camera but as I do that I'm
going to record it and I'll have kind of

600
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:33,670
going to record it and I'll have kind of
 

601
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,300
going to record it and I'll have kind of
secrets let's play episodes that I'll

602
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:36,310
secrets let's play episodes that I'll
 

603
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,920
secrets let's play episodes that I'll
release after it's finished I'll kind of

604
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:39,930
release after it's finished I'll kind of
 

605
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,580
release after it's finished I'll kind of
record it as I'm building it and then

606
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:44,590
record it as I'm building it and then
 

607
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,650
record it as I'm building it and then
you can still watch me build it but it

608
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:46,660
you can still watch me build it but it
 

609
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,710
you can still watch me build it but it
won't be until after it's actually done

610
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:49,720
won't be until after it's actually done
 

611
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,040
won't be until after it's actually done
which might be a little confusing but I

612
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,050
which might be a little confusing but I
 

613
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,990
which might be a little confusing but I
think it works out best in both worlds

614
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,000
think it works out best in both worlds
 

615
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,220
think it works out best in both worlds
it'll still be a surprise and you can

616
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,230
it'll still be a surprise and you can
 

617
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,990
it'll still be a surprise and you can
still watch me build it that way the

618
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,000
still watch me build it that way the
 

619
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,750
still watch me build it that way the
only downside is you can't give me help

620
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
only downside is you can't give me help
 

621
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,900
only downside is you can't give me help
as I'm building it but I'll have to try

622
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:06,910
as I'm building it but I'll have to try
 

623
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,480
as I'm building it but I'll have to try
manage without you guys so I'm guessing

624
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,490
manage without you guys so I'm guessing
 

625
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,640
manage without you guys so I'm guessing
there will be about five of these

626
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:14,650
there will be about five of these
 

627
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,230
there will be about five of these
secrets LPS I probably won't record me

628
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:19,240
secrets LPS I probably won't record me
 

629
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,180
secrets LPS I probably won't record me
building it in super detail but just

630
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,190
building it in super detail but just
 

631
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,250
building it in super detail but just
like all the stages I go through maybe

632
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,260
like all the stages I go through maybe
 

633
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,000
like all the stages I go through maybe
some of my fails as I'm building it just

634
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,010
some of my fails as I'm building it just
 

635
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,770
some of my fails as I'm building it just
to give you a good idea of how it all

636
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:28,780
to give you a good idea of how it all
 

637
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,520
to give you a good idea of how it all
came to be

638
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:29,530
came to be
 

639
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,210
came to be
and then I'll release all five in a row

640
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,220
and then I'll release all five in a row
 

641
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,970
and then I'll release all five in a row
probably a week or so after I released

642
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:38,980
probably a week or so after I released
 

643
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,130
probably a week or so after I released
the polished video of my project and the

644
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,140
the polished video of my project and the
 

645
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,310
the polished video of my project and the
project isn't really something I need

646
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
project isn't really something I need
 

647
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,350
project isn't really something I need
around my base here it's kind of unique

648
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
around my base here it's kind of unique
 

649
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,730
around my base here it's kind of unique
and somewhat useless it's just kind of

650
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:53,740
and somewhat useless it's just kind of
 

651
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,270
and somewhat useless it's just kind of
it has that cool factor I should say so

652
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
it has that cool factor I should say so
 

653
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,409
it has that cool factor I should say so
I can build it far away from my base

654
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:02,419

 

655
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,860

so I'll be building it away from my base

656
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:06,870
so I'll be building it away from my base
 

657
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,649
so I'll be building it away from my base
you guys won't be able to see it that

658
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:09,659
you guys won't be able to see it that
 

659
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,960
you guys won't be able to see it that
way either while I'm building it and

660
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:11,970
way either while I'm building it and
 

661
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:18,740
way either while I'm building it and
then that means I won't be releasing my

662
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:18,750
then that means I won't be releasing my
 

663
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,690
then that means I won't be releasing my
world for download until it's finished

664
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:20,700
world for download until it's finished
 

665
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,700
world for download until it's finished
once I started and I'll also be able to

666
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:25,710
once I started and I'll also be able to
 

667
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,009
once I started and I'll also be able to
continue making LP episodes while I'm

668
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:28,019
continue making LP episodes while I'm
 

669
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,340
continue making LP episodes while I'm
building it because they'll be far away

670
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,350
building it because they'll be far away
 

671
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,159
building it because they'll be far away
and there's no chance of you seeing it

672
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:34,169
and there's no chance of you seeing it
 

673
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:40,909
and there's no chance of you seeing it
so talked a lot about that no hints as

674
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:40,919
so talked a lot about that no hints as
 

675
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,509
so talked a lot about that no hints as
to what it is so don't even bother

676
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:44,519
to what it is so don't even bother
 

677
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,259
to what it is so don't even bother
