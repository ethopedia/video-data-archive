00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,260
it's actually an animated gif for their
channel icon so I saw it next to their

162
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,270
channel icon so I saw it next to their
 

163
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,070
channel icon so I saw it next to their
comments and it reminded me of that and

164
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080

 

165
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,300

166
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,310
it gave me a laugh in it
 

167
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,190
it gave me a laugh in it
I started looking at is like you know I

168
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,200
I started looking at is like you know I
 

169
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,900
I started looking at is like you know I
bet you I could build that in this game

170
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:41,910
bet you I could build that in this game
 

171
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,810
bet you I could build that in this game
and it would look pretty cool so that's

172
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:44,820
and it would look pretty cool so that's
 

173
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,030
and it would look pretty cool so that's
what we're gonna try to do so this I'm

174
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
what we're gonna try to do so this I'm
 

175
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,550
what we're gonna try to do so this I'm
gonna show it to you now this animated

looks like oh man it's so awesome sink
cracks me up every time I see it I got

184
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:10,860
cracks me up every time I see it I got
 

185
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,680
cracks me up every time I see it I got
so much sass in this animation it's like

186
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:12,690
so much sass in this animation it's like
 

187
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:19,540
so much sass in this animation it's like
nuh you're wrong you've been easy

188
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,550

 

189
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,800

alright so that's what we're trying to

190
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:21,810
alright so that's what we're trying to
 

191
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,770
alright so that's what we're trying to
build guys and we're not just doing like

192
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:24,780
build guys and we're not just doing like
 

193
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,660
build guys and we're not just doing like
a flat 2d image of it I want to do like

194
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:26,670
a flat 2d image of it I want to do like
 

195
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,970
a flat 2d image of it I want to do like
a 3d sculpture of it so I got to build

196
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:28,980
a 3d sculpture of it so I got to build
 

197
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,790
a 3d sculpture of it so I got to build
myself and I thought it would look

198
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:31,800
myself and I thought it would look
 

199
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,210
myself and I thought it would look
really really cool if I put it on a side

200
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:35,220
really really cool if I put it on a side
 

201
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,880
really really cool if I put it on a side
of a mountain so we're this spot here

202
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:37,890
of a mountain so we're this spot here
 

203
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,390
of a mountain so we're this spot here
we're gonna try like put the red circle

204
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
we're gonna try like put the red circle
 

205
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,030
we're gonna try like put the red circle
around the mountain here and then my guy

206
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,040
around the mountain here and then my guy
 

207
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,860
around the mountain here and then my guy
coming out of the mountain like sticking

208
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:45,870
coming out of the mountain like sticking
 

209
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,810
coming out of the mountain like sticking
out of it I think it's gonna look really

210
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:47,820
out of it I think it's gonna look really
 

211
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,230
out of it I think it's gonna look really
cool I don't know how tough it's gonna

212
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,240
cool I don't know how tough it's gonna
 

213
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,620
cool I don't know how tough it's gonna
be to do I'm gonna use set blings a 3d

214
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,630
be to do I'm gonna use set blings a 3d
 

215
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,350
be to do I'm gonna use set blings a 3d
sculpture filter for mcedit to to get

216
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
sculpture filter for mcedit to to get
 

217
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,460
sculpture filter for mcedit to to get
get my character you know to make him

218
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:03,470
get my character you know to make him
 

219
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,140
get my character you know to make him
his filter doesn't work with the new

220
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,150
his filter doesn't work with the new
 

221
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,760
his filter doesn't work with the new
clay blocks and stuff though like it

222
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:07,770
clay blocks and stuff though like it
 

223
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,250
clay blocks and stuff though like it
doesn't use use them so I'm not gonna

224
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,260
doesn't use use them so I'm not gonna
 

225
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,490
doesn't use use them so I'm not gonna
look too too similar to what I look like

226
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,500
look too too similar to what I look like
 

227
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,760
look too too similar to what I look like
here really but then I'm just gonna

228
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:16,770
here really but then I'm just gonna
 

229
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,540
here really but then I'm just gonna
change

230
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:17,550
change
 

231
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,580
change
most of the blocks over with clay and

232
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,590
most of the blocks over with clay and
 

233
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,120
most of the blocks over with clay and
just use that as a reference I want to

234
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,130
just use that as a reference I want to
 

235
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,560
just use that as a reference I want to
use it for my hair because my hair is

236
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,570
use it for my hair because my hair is
 

237
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:31,520
use it for my hair because my hair is
really complicated so we got to flatten

238
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,530
really complicated so we got to flatten
 

239
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,900
really complicated so we got to flatten
out this mountain a little

240
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:32,910
out this mountain a little
 

241
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,080
out this mountain a little
I'll probably get rid of this tree yard

242
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,090
I'll probably get rid of this tree yard
 

243
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,010
I'll probably get rid of this tree yard
of the tree and move this back a bit to

244
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,020
of the tree and move this back a bit to
 

245
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,450
of the tree and move this back a bit to
let me take this whole mountain back a

246
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:41,460
let me take this whole mountain back a
 

247
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,690
let me take this whole mountain back a
bit flatten it out and I was trying to

248
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:47,700
bit flatten it out and I was trying to
 

249
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,180
bit flatten it out and I was trying to
guess that the dimensions of stuff here

250
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,190
guess that the dimensions of stuff here
 

251
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,060
guess that the dimensions of stuff here
and I think we're gonna do like a 24

252
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,070
and I think we're gonna do like a 24
 

253
00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:02,720
and I think we're gonna do like a 24
diameter circle yeah so maybe maybe I'll

254
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:02,730
diameter circle yeah so maybe maybe I'll
 

255
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,220
diameter circle yeah so maybe maybe I'll
work on this for a little bit

256
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,230
work on this for a little bit
 

257
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,830
work on this for a little bit
tried to get it nice and flat and then

258
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
tried to get it nice and flat and then
 

259
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,780
tried to get it nice and flat and then
we will start working on the circle or

260
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:08,790
we will start working on the circle or
 

261
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,780
we will start working on the circle or
something together and see how it goes

262
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:13,790

 

263
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,610

this poor sheet man he's been falling

264
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:16,620
this poor sheet man he's been falling
 

265
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,580
this poor sheet man he's been falling
for so long like for months and months

266
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:19,590
for so long like for months and months
 

267
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,440
for so long like for months and months
in my world here I've noticed this guy

268
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,450
in my world here I've noticed this guy
 

269
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,530
in my world here I've noticed this guy
he's keeps falling over and over I'm

270
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,540
he's keeps falling over and over I'm
 

271
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,120
he's keeps falling over and over I'm
tempted to help him out but at the same

272
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,130
tempted to help him out but at the same
 

273
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,850
tempted to help him out but at the same
time I just want to leave him because I

274
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:28,860
time I just want to leave him because I
 

275
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,050
time I just want to leave him because I
think he'll be there forever

276
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,060
think he'll be there forever
 

277
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,010
think he'll be there forever
and it's kind of cool this is our our

278
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,020
and it's kind of cool this is our our
 

279
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,020
and it's kind of cool this is our our
hunk of marble here this is what we're

280
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,030
hunk of marble here this is what we're
 

281
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,880
hunk of marble here this is what we're
gonna build our sculpture out of nice

282
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:40,890
gonna build our sculpture out of nice
 

283
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,010
gonna build our sculpture out of nice
and flat surface to work off of it's

284
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,020
and flat surface to work off of it's
 

285
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,790
and flat surface to work off of it's
really smooth at the moment but we're

286
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
really smooth at the moment but we're
 

287
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,300
really smooth at the moment but we're
gonna we're gonna it's not gonna look

288
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,310
gonna we're gonna it's not gonna look
 

289
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,520
gonna we're gonna it's not gonna look
like this at the end of it because the

290
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,530
like this at the end of it because the
 

291
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,870
like this at the end of it because the
circle this is 26 blocks across and I

292
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:56,880
circle this is 26 blocks across and I
 

293
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,930
circle this is 26 blocks across and I
think like 28 up the circle we're making

294
00:07:59,930 --> 00:07:59,940
think like 28 up the circle we're making
 

295
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,210
think like 28 up the circle we're making
has a diameter of 24 so it goes pretty

296
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,220
has a diameter of 24 so it goes pretty
 

297
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,909
has a diameter of 24 so it goes pretty
much to the edge and the only place

298
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:04,919
much to the edge and the only place
 

299
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,560
much to the edge and the only place
that's gonna be really flat afterwards

300
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:06,570
that's gonna be really flat afterwards
 

301
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,320
that's gonna be really flat afterwards
is in the corners a little bit

302
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,330
is in the corners a little bit
 

303
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,970
is in the corners a little bit
and we can smooth that out we can put

304
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:10,980
and we can smooth that out we can put
 

305
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,830
and we can smooth that out we can put
some land there it'll look pretty good

306
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:12,840
some land there it'll look pretty good
 

307
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,780
some land there it'll look pretty good
we'll plant trees and maybe make some

308
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:14,790
we'll plant trees and maybe make some
 

309
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,260
we'll plant trees and maybe make some
fake waterfalls on the sides I think

310
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,270
fake waterfalls on the sides I think
 

311
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,720
fake waterfalls on the sides I think
it's gonna be good

312
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:19,730
it's gonna be good
 

313
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,450
it's gonna be good
so let's get to actually building a

314
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,460
so let's get to actually building a
 

315
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,610
so let's get to actually building a
thing here I brought a bunch of colored

316
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:25,620
thing here I brought a bunch of colored
 

317
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,060
thing here I brought a bunch of colored
clay blocks with me we're gonna we're

318
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,070
clay blocks with me we're gonna we're
 

319
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:34,150
clay blocks with me we're gonna we're
gonna use I think red for the circle and

320
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,160
gonna use I think red for the circle and
 

321
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,909
gonna use I think red for the circle and
since it's 24 and that's about 28 I got

322
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
since it's 24 and that's about 28 I got
 

323
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,820
since it's 24 and that's about 28 I got
to start it 2 or 3 blocks off the ground

324
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:42,830
to start it 2 or 3 blocks off the ground
 

325
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,800
to start it 2 or 3 blocks off the ground
I think I'm gonna go 3 and I might have

326
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:45,810
I think I'm gonna go 3 and I might have
 

327
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,280
I think I'm gonna go 3 and I might have
to add

328
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,290
to add
 

329
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,730
to add
some more to the top there we'll see how

330
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:49,740
some more to the top there we'll see how
 

331
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,379
some more to the top there we'll see how
this looks so I think gonna go eight

332
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:54,389
this looks so I think gonna go eight
 

333
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,310
this looks so I think gonna go eight
blocks at the bottom here I think that

334
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
blocks at the bottom here I think that
 

335
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,319
blocks at the bottom here I think that
that'll be the start of it and actually

336
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:00,329
that'll be the start of it and actually
 

337
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:03,019
that'll be the start of it and actually
you know what I just kind of want to see

338
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:03,029
you know what I just kind of want to see
 

339
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,449
you know what I just kind of want to see
what these look like with my character I

340
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:05,459
what these look like with my character I
 

341
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,210
what these look like with my character I
couldn't decide between blue clay and

342
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,220
couldn't decide between blue clay and
 

343
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,850
couldn't decide between blue clay and
cyan and I think we're gonna use this

344
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:13,860
cyan and I think we're gonna use this
 

345
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,999
cyan and I think we're gonna use this
for my shirts okay I think it's the

346
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:20,009
for my shirts okay I think it's the
 

347
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,639
for my shirts okay I think it's the
closest match my my shirt and my mask

348
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:25,649
closest match my my shirt and my mask
 

349
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,290
closest match my my shirt and my mask
and headband and everything it's like

350
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
and headband and everything it's like
 

351
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,540
and headband and everything it's like
it's it's navy blue right the cyan the

352
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:32,550
it's it's navy blue right the cyan the
 

353
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,280
it's it's navy blue right the cyan the
one I'm buy right now it's it's not

354
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,290
one I'm buy right now it's it's not
 

355
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,710
one I'm buy right now it's it's not
quite blue enough but this one next to

356
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
quite blue enough but this one next to
 

357
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
quite blue enough but this one next to
it is like too blue there's no

358
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:39,690
it is like too blue there's no
 

359
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,559
it is like too blue there's no
in-between so I have to decide between

360
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:42,569
in-between so I have to decide between
 

361
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:45,860
in-between so I have to decide between
the two I think I'm gonna go with the

362
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:45,870
the two I think I'm gonna go with the
 

363
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,699
the two I think I'm gonna go with the
cyan just because ninjas they're usually

364
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:49,709
cyan just because ninjas they're usually
 

365
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,769
cyan just because ninjas they're usually
like wearing dark clothing and stuff and

366
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:51,779
like wearing dark clothing and stuff and
 

367
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,259
like wearing dark clothing and stuff and
I would rather be gray than really

368
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:54,269
I would rather be gray than really
 

369
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,569
I would rather be gray than really
bright blue I think so we'll go with

370
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:56,579
bright blue I think so we'll go with
 

371
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:57,110
bright blue I think so we'll go with
that

372
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
that
 

373
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,230
that
and again there's not really quite a

374
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
and again there's not really quite a
 

375
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,199
and again there's not really quite a
match for this shirt of mine but I think

376
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:03,209
match for this shirt of mine but I think
 

377
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,009
match for this shirt of mine but I think
we'll go with lime for the most of it

378
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:07,019
we'll go with lime for the most of it
 

379
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,189
we'll go with lime for the most of it
and then those like the the e in the

380
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:10,199
and then those like the the e in the
 

381
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,110
and then those like the the e in the
backwards II that you see will probably

382
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,120
backwards II that you see will probably
 

383
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,569
backwards II that you see will probably
be the dark green and I think the skin

384
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:17,579
be the dark green and I think the skin
 

385
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,430
be the dark green and I think the skin
did I bring anything for the skin I

386
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
did I bring anything for the skin I
 

387
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,280
did I bring anything for the skin I
think we're gonna use white I think this

388
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,290
think we're gonna use white I think this
 

389
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,129
think we're gonna use white I think this
is like the ideal thing to use for skin

390
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:25,139
is like the ideal thing to use for skin
 

391
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,400
is like the ideal thing to use for skin
with people like that's almost exact

392
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,410
with people like that's almost exact
 

393
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,340
with people like that's almost exact
match in color that's pretty good okay

394
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,350

 

395
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,900

so we got that our blocks figured out

396
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:35,910
so we got that our blocks figured out
 

397
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,769
so we got that our blocks figured out
let's get to it here I looked at a

398
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:39,779
let's get to it here I looked at a
 

399
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,710
let's get to it here I looked at a
circle generator before I started we

400
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
circle generator before I started we
 

401
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,840
circle generator before I started we
gotta go to threes and then a couple I

402
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:47,850
gotta go to threes and then a couple I
 

403
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,519
gotta go to threes and then a couple I
think three twos like that and then go

404
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:52,529
think three twos like that and then go
 

405
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,970
think three twos like that and then go
back up two threes a couple more of

406
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:55,980
back up two threes a couple more of
 

407
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,660
back up two threes a couple more of
those Oh

408
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:58,670

 

409
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,550

is this smaller than I thought it was

410
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,560
is this smaller than I thought it was
 

411
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,520
is this smaller than I thought it was
there should be a one block gap from

412
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,530
there should be a one block gap from
 

413
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,790
there should be a one block gap from
this wall here I thought because it goes

414
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:07,800
this wall here I thought because it goes
 

415
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,480
this wall here I thought because it goes
out one more three four five six seven

416
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,490
out one more three four five six seven
 

417
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:19,090
out one more three four five six seven
oh oh I wonder if I measured wrong

418
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,100
oh oh I wonder if I measured wrong
 

419
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:28,210
oh oh I wonder if I measured wrong
what's going on here

420
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,220

 

421
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,130

it looks like if I do that the circles

422
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,140
it looks like if I do that the circles
 

423
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,670
it looks like if I do that the circles
gonna be like way up in the air too

424
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
gonna be like way up in the air too
 

425
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,200
gonna be like way up in the air too
I'm gonna double-check my circle I might

426
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,210
I'm gonna double-check my circle I might
 

427
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,540
I'm gonna double-check my circle I might
have got this wrong okay so what the

428
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,550
have got this wrong okay so what the
 

429
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,510
have got this wrong okay so what the
problem was this red ring the circle I

430
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:44,520
problem was this red ring the circle I
 

431
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,280
problem was this red ring the circle I
wanted to make was actually 26 blocks

432
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,290
wanted to make was actually 26 blocks
 

433
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,400
wanted to make was actually 26 blocks
diameter the one I was looking at the 24

434
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,410
diameter the one I was looking at the 24
 

435
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,730
diameter the one I was looking at the 24
it does not have as nice of it doesn't

436
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:52,740
it does not have as nice of it doesn't
 

437
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,190
it does not have as nice of it doesn't
round as nicely so we're gonna stick

438
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
round as nicely so we're gonna stick
 

439
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,240
round as nicely so we're gonna stick
with this I think now what we got to do

440
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,250
with this I think now what we got to do
 

441
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,090
with this I think now what we got to do
it starts hollowing out some of this

442
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,100
it starts hollowing out some of this
 

443
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,130
it starts hollowing out some of this
cliff face because the idea is I'm gonna

444
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,140
cliff face because the idea is I'm gonna
 

445
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,950
cliff face because the idea is I'm gonna
be in behind the ring and then sort of

446
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:06,960
be in behind the ring and then sort of
 

447
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,590
be in behind the ring and then sort of
come out like and be leaning forward

448
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
come out like and be leaning forward
 

449
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
come out like and be leaning forward
from the ring so kind of like this like

450
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:14,730
from the ring so kind of like this like
 

451
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,980
from the ring so kind of like this like
when I'm holding shift pointing let's do

452
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:18,990
when I'm holding shift pointing let's do
 

453
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:25,400
when I'm holding shift pointing let's do
my let's do my fist out ah something

454
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,410
my let's do my fist out ah something
 

455
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,000
my let's do my fist out ah something
like that

456
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,010
like that
 

457
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,790
like that
so TNT time okay I set it up in a way we

458
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:31,800
so TNT time okay I set it up in a way we
 

459
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,310
so TNT time okay I set it up in a way we
can have some fun here so let's let's

460
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
can have some fun here so let's let's
 

461
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,980
can have some fun here so let's let's
see how bad my name is higher whoa not

462
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:39,990
see how bad my name is higher whoa not
 

463
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,990
see how bad my name is higher whoa not
that high Ariel I'm so glad you see

464
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,000
that high Ariel I'm so glad you see
 

465
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that high Ariel I'm so glad you see
Aeros rendering in the distance now Oh

466
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,010

 

467
00:12:52,010 --> 00:13:03,530

get them all quickly there we go there

468
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:03,540
get them all quickly there we go there
 

469
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,189
get them all quickly there we go there
we go

470
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:04,199
we go
 

471
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:13,819
we go
and two more down here perfect and I did

472
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:13,829
and two more down here perfect and I did
 

473
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,590
and two more down here perfect and I did
it without blowing up the clay that's I

474

it without blowing up the clay that's I
was worried about that okay so I'm gonna

476
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:18,990
was worried about that okay so I'm gonna
 

477
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,290
was worried about that okay so I'm gonna
polish that up and we'll start building

478
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:21,300
polish that up and we'll start building
 

479
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,439

back we might try to do that later let's

492
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:44,699
back we might try to do that later let's
 

493
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:50,230
back we might try to do that later let's
do that let's do my guy first though

494
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240

 

495
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,750

awesome I got five blocks clear doubts

496
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
awesome I got five blocks clear doubts
 

497
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,810
awesome I got five blocks clear doubts
in depth now it should be enough space

498
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:56,820
in depth now it should be enough space
 

499
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,840
in depth now it should be enough space
to start building so let's get to it

500
00:13:59,840 --> 00:13:59,850
to start building so let's get to it
 

501
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,340
to start building so let's get to it
let's make me oh boy I've never actually

502
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,350
let's make me oh boy I've never actually

think we're going to go two pixels two

514
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
think we're going to go two pixels two
 

515
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,059
think we're going to go two pixels two

on me I tell you

524
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:49,550
on me I tell you
 

525
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,730
on me I tell you
let's I'm gonna build it I think one

526
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:52,740
let's I'm gonna build it I think one
 

527
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,639
let's I'm gonna build it I think one
block away from this ring just a little

528
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:55,649
block away from this ring just a little
 

529
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,530
block away from this ring just a little
bit of a buffer and

530
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:58,540
bit of a buffer and
 

531
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,170
bit of a buffer and
let's get with the cyan to start off

532
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:01,180
let's get with the cyan to start off
 

533
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,410
let's get with the cyan to start off
with here so eight blocks should end

534
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:04,420
with here so eight blocks should end
 

535
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,720
with here so eight blocks should end
right where this ring bottom ends

536
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:06,730
right where this ring bottom ends
 

537
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,010
right where this ring bottom ends
because that's eight blocks as well and

538
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,020
because that's eight blocks as well and
 

539
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,570
because that's eight blocks as well and
we'll go here I'm just gonna do the

540
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:12,580
we'll go here I'm just gonna do the
 

541
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,960
we'll go here I'm just gonna do the
front I think on camera here or at least

542
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:15,970
front I think on camera here or at least
 

543
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,360
front I think on camera here or at least
some of the fronts and then I'll do the

544
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,370
some of the fronts and then I'll do the
 

545
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,560
some of the fronts and then I'll do the
sides in the back on my own so I think

546
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,570
sides in the back on my own so I think
 

547
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,950
sides in the back on my own so I think
it's just solid blue yeah I like to I

548
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:25,960
it's just solid blue yeah I like to I
 

549
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,930
it's just solid blue yeah I like to I
can just use myself as a reference as I

550
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:27,940
can just use myself as a reference as I
 

551
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,240
can just use myself as a reference as I
build this then I guess we should do the

552
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,250
build this then I guess we should do the
 

553
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,070
build this then I guess we should do the
arm on the side too as we go that would

554
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,080
arm on the side too as we go that would
 

555
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,040
arm on the side too as we go that would
probably make this easier so I'm gonna

556
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,050
probably make this easier so I'm gonna
 

557
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,740
probably make this easier so I'm gonna
have my right arm sticking out so I have

558
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:40,750
have my right arm sticking out so I have
 

559
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,630
have my right arm sticking out so I have
to put the arm on this side

560
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:42,640
to put the arm on this side
 

561
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,540
to put the arm on this side
and we'll make that match up with the

562
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:45,550
and we'll make that match up with the
 

563
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:50,430
and we'll make that match up with the
bottom of our waist so over here I guess

564
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:50,440
bottom of our waist so over here I guess
 

565
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,510
bottom of our waist so over here I guess
and I have got my wrist bands I'm gonna

566
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,520
and I have got my wrist bands I'm gonna
 

567
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,210
and I have got my wrist bands I'm gonna
put that over here and my vest

568
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:03,220
put that over here and my vest
 

569
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,340
put that over here and my vest
so my vest looks like it's mostly green

570
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,350
so my vest looks like it's mostly green
 

571
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,200
so my vest looks like it's mostly green
all that all the way across except I'm

572
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,210
all that all the way across except I'm
 

573
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:16,020
all that all the way across except I'm
gonna use clay for the zipper let's see

574
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,030
gonna use clay for the zipper let's see
 

575
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:21,620
gonna use clay for the zipper let's see
so let's do it like which side is it on

576
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:21,630
so let's do it like which side is it on
 

577
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:29,010
so let's do it like which side is it on
zippers on the left mostly so I'm

578
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,020
zippers on the left mostly so I'm
 

579
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,600
zippers on the left mostly so I'm
looking this way that would be right

580
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:30,610
looking this way that would be right
 

581
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,120
looking this way that would be right
there and like that okay this is stuff I

582
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,130
there and like that okay this is stuff I
 

583
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,430
there and like that okay this is stuff I
gotta like flip the image so many times

584
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,440

so what was it was dark dark in the
corners right this will have to be moved

614
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:48,460

 

615
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,850

that will go here then I think let's

616
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:54,860
that will go here then I think let's
 

617
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,180
that will go here then I think let's
just check this alright

618
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,190
just check this alright
 

619
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,650
just check this alright
oh but you know what I'm not doing I'm

620
00:17:59,650 --> 00:17:59,660
oh but you know what I'm not doing I'm
 

621
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,420
oh but you know what I'm not doing I'm
not making them lean in okay ah this is

622
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:04,430
not making them lean in okay ah this is
 

623
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,790
not making them lean in okay ah this is
still tough I want I think every three

624
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:06,800
still tough I want I think every three
 

625
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,440
still tough I want I think every three
blocks we go vertically we're gonna lean

626
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,450
blocks we go vertically we're gonna lean
 

627
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,150
blocks we go vertically we're gonna lean
in one block so we'll basically start

628
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,160
in one block so we'll basically start
 

629
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,990
in one block so we'll basically start
bleeding here yeah okay and same with

630
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
bleeding here yeah okay and same with
 

631
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,380
bleeding here yeah okay and same with
the arm that's and I'll I'll take out

632
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,390
the arm that's and I'll I'll take out
 

633
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,840
the arm that's and I'll I'll take out
this this line later let's keep going

634
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:28,850
this this line later let's keep going
 

635
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,420
this this line later let's keep going
here so then it looks like we got light

636
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,430
here so then it looks like we got light
 

637
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:40,720
here so then it looks like we got light
on the two sides dark for two blocks so

638
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:40,730
on the two sides dark for two blocks so
 

639
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:47,500
on the two sides dark for two blocks so
lights over here lights two blocks dark

640
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:47,510
lights over here lights two blocks dark
 

641
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:55,480
lights over here lights two blocks dark
and then zipper and then light again

642
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:55,490
and then zipper and then light again
 

643
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,920
and then zipper and then light again
actually it's light all the way up

644
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:56,930
actually it's light all the way up
 

645
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,370
actually it's light all the way up
pretty much but maybe let's do the sides

646
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:00,380
pretty much but maybe let's do the sides
 

647
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,740
pretty much but maybe let's do the sides
first oh yeah that is looking good

648
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:05,750
first oh yeah that is looking good
 

649
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,890
first oh yeah that is looking good
that's pretty accurate I would say let's

650
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:08,900
that's pretty accurate I would say let's
 

651
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,410
that's pretty accurate I would say let's
get our slant going here yeah it's that

652
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:14,420
get our slant going here yeah it's that
 

653
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,750
get our slant going here yeah it's that
it's pretty similar I would say

654
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:16,760
it's pretty similar I would say
 

655
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,919
it's pretty similar I would say
I'm gonna work on my right arm now and I

656
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:21,929
I'm gonna work on my right arm now and I
 

657
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,270
I'm gonna work on my right arm now and I
might do my head off camera here because

658
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
might do my head off camera here because
 

659
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,980
might do my head off camera here because
it's pretty complicated and it will be

660
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:24,990
it's pretty complicated and it will be
 

661
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,640
it's pretty complicated and it will be
tough to record lots lots of detail to

662
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:28,650
tough to record lots lots of detail to
 

663
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,610
tough to record lots lots of detail to
my hair and stuff so I'll be right back

664
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:33,620

 

665
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,430

so this is what I've been using as my

666
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
so this is what I've been using as my
 

667
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,160
so this is what I've been using as my
main guide throughout this build

668
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,170
main guide throughout this build
 

669
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,480
main guide throughout this build
especially for the head because the

670
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:41,490
especially for the head because the
 

671
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,540
especially for the head because the
heads the complicated part but I got my

672
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:44,550
heads the complicated part but I got my
 

673
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,910
heads the complicated part but I got my
chiseled good looks like nice nice

674
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:46,920
chiseled good looks like nice nice
 

675
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,530
chiseled good looks like nice nice
sandstone face there I have look how

676
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:50,540
sandstone face there I have look how
 

677
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,120
sandstone face there I have look how
look how firm my my pecs in my abs are

678
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,130
look how firm my my pecs in my abs are
 

679
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,690
look how firm my my pecs in my abs are
they're nice stone brick and we have

680
00:19:59,690 --> 00:19:59,700
they're nice stone brick and we have
 

681
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,630
they're nice stone brick and we have
like birch plank arms and yeah so it

682
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:05,640
like birch plank arms and yeah so it
 

683
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,380
like birch plank arms and yeah so it
doesn't look quite right that's why I

684
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,390
doesn't look quite right that's why I
 

685
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,970
doesn't look quite right that's why I
wanted to do it with the clay box and

686
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:10,980
wanted to do it with the clay box and
 

687
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,840
wanted to do it with the clay box and
this is the outcome yep there we have it

688
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:17,850
this is the outcome yep there we have it
 

689
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:23,360
this is the outcome yep there we have it
I am one snazzy-looking guy I tell ya so

690
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,370
I am one snazzy-looking guy I tell ya so
 

691
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,100
I am one snazzy-looking guy I tell ya so
that turned out pretty good a lot more

692
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,110
that turned out pretty good a lot more
 

693
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,950
that turned out pretty good a lot more
lifelike and a lot more true to my

694
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:27,960
lifelike and a lot more true to my
 

695
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,190
lifelike and a lot more true to my
actual guide these these clay blocks are

696
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
actual guide these these clay blocks are
 

697
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,100
actual guide these these clay blocks are
a huge help they introduce colors that

698
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,110
a huge help they introduce colors that
 

699
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,840
a huge help they introduce colors that
we didn't have before and it makes a big

700
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:35,850
we didn't have before and it makes a big
 

701
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,570
we didn't have before and it makes a big
difference and I would say that is very

702
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:40,580
difference and I would say that is very
 

703
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,310
difference and I would say that is very
very close you even though they are

704
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,320
very close you even though they are
 

705
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,380
very close you even though they are
somewhat limited like I can't get exact

706
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,390
somewhat limited like I can't get exact
 

707
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,450
somewhat limited like I can't get exact
colors it definitely looks pretty close

708
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:49,460
colors it definitely looks pretty close
 

709
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,190
colors it definitely looks pretty close
that's pretty cool we'll take a couple

710
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,200
that's pretty cool we'll take a couple
 

711
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,410
that's pretty cool we'll take a couple
looks around here in just a sec I'm

712
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:54,420
looks around here in just a sec I'm
 

713
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,530
looks around here in just a sec I'm
gonna try one last thing before I'm I'm

714
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:57,540
gonna try one last thing before I'm I'm
 

715
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,660
gonna try one last thing before I'm I'm
kind of done with this build of course I

716
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,670
kind of done with this build of course I
 

717
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,890
kind of done with this build of course I
got to smooth out the mountains and

718
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:00,900
got to smooth out the mountains and
 

719
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,419
got to smooth out the mountains and
stuff still but I'll probably do that

720
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:02,429
stuff still but I'll probably do that
 

721
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,240
stuff still but I'll probably do that
another day but I want to try put

722
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,250
another day but I want to try put
 

723
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,210
another day but I want to try put
glowstone in the back and I've been

724
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,220
glowstone in the back and I've been
 

725
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,710
glowstone in the back and I've been
trying to decide between doing like a

726
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:09,720
trying to decide between doing like a
 

727
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,000
trying to decide between doing like a
semicircle behind my guy you know or

728
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,010
semicircle behind my guy you know or
 

729
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,760
semicircle behind my guy you know or
trying to do a flat wall of glowstone

730
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:16,770
trying to do a flat wall of glowstone
 

731
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,840
trying to do a flat wall of glowstone
and I think what we're gonna do is a

732
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:20,850
and I think what we're gonna do is a
 

733
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,940
and I think what we're gonna do is a
flat wall of glowstone for a couple

734
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:22,950
flat wall of glowstone for a couple
 

735
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,820
flat wall of glowstone for a couple
reasons the semicircle is better because

736
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:27,830
reasons the semicircle is better because
 

737
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,500
reasons the semicircle is better because
it it's cheaper

738
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,510
it it's cheaper
 

739
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,790
it it's cheaper
like I don't think you'll take as much

740
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:31,800
like I don't think you'll take as much
 

741
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,510
like I don't think you'll take as much
clothes stone do you do it that way but

742
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
clothes stone do you do it that way but
 

743
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
clothes stone do you do it that way but
Oh like it's better in that sense but

744
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,010
Oh like it's better in that sense but
 

745
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,490
Oh like it's better in that sense but
overall the flat walls better because I

746
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:40,500
overall the flat walls better because I
 

747
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,010
overall the flat walls better because I
think the semicircles gonna create a lot

748
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,020
think the semicircles gonna create a lot
 

749
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,740
think the semicircles gonna create a lot
of shadows and stuff which will instead

750
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:45,750
of shadows and stuff which will instead
 

751
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,790
of shadows and stuff which will instead
of looking like a just a flat glowing

752
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:48,800
of looking like a just a flat glowing
 

753
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,950
of looking like a just a flat glowing
background it's gonna really stick out

754
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:51,960
background it's gonna really stick out
 

755
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,410
background it's gonna really stick out
if it's a semicircle so we don't want

756
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:54,420
if it's a semicircle so we don't want
 

757
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,440
if it's a semicircle so we don't want
that but I'm gonna make up backup just

758
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,450
that but I'm gonna make up backup just
 

759
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,180
that but I'm gonna make up backup just
in case it looks really bad we can

760
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,190
in case it looks really bad we can
 

761
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,800
in case it looks really bad we can
revert before we do the glowstone but

762
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:02,810
revert before we do the glowstone but
 

763
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,850
revert before we do the glowstone but
I'll try it out and see what it looks

764
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:04,860
I'll try it out and see what it looks
 

765
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,860
I'll try it out and see what it looks
like here all right well this is what it

766
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:09,870
like here all right well this is what it
 

767
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,560
like here all right well this is what it
looks like at night there's no torches

768
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,570
looks like at night there's no torches
 

769
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,040
looks like at night there's no torches
around or anything so it is kind of dark

770
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,050
around or anything so it is kind of dark
 

771
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,930
around or anything so it is kind of dark
still even with the glowstone but it

772
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:17,940
still even with the glowstone but it
 

773
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,010
still even with the glowstone but it
does help quite a bit

774
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,020
does help quite a bit
 

775
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:28,090
does help quite a bit
I let's get a day shot though here I

776
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,100
I let's get a day shot though here I
 

777
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,230
I let's get a day shot though here I
just pull hotter in the middle of the

778
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
just pull hotter in the middle of the
 

779
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,290
just pull hotter in the middle of the
water to get a better perspective of

780
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:33,300
water to get a better perspective of
 

781
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,170
water to get a better perspective of
things here so let me know what you guys

782
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,180
things here so let me know what you guys
 

783
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,000
things here so let me know what you guys
think of the glowstone is it worth it I

784
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,010
think of the glowstone is it worth it I
 

785
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,460
think of the glowstone is it worth it I
