00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:44,979
to place down some glowing pumpkins to
 

163
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,799
to place down some glowing pumpkins to
try keep the grass alive I don't know if

164
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:46,809
try keep the grass alive I don't know if
 

165
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:50,039
try keep the grass alive I don't know if
I'm not sure if I want to keep it alive

166
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:50,049
I'm not sure if I want to keep it alive
 

167
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:57,989
I'm not sure if I want to keep it alive
yet or not but if I choose I want to

168
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:57,999
yet or not but if I choose I want to
 

169
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,879
yet or not but if I choose I want to
then it'll still be alive after we do

170
00:05:59,879 --> 00:05:59,889
then it'll still be alive after we do
 

171
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,749
then it'll still be alive after we do
this so got that we're going to fill it

172
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
this so got that we're going to fill it
 

173
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,109
this so got that we're going to fill it
in with water

174
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:09,119

 

175
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:14,039

OOP still not used to water stacking on

176
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:14,049
OOP still not used to water stacking on
 

177
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:17,069
OOP still not used to water stacking on
top of each on top of itself it's a

178
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:17,079
top of each on top of itself it's a
 

179
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:31,769
top of each on top of itself it's a
little weird okay good okay so we have a

180
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:31,779
little weird okay good okay so we have a
 

181
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,429
little weird okay good okay so we have a
pool of water now I want to work on

182
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:35,439
pool of water now I want to work on
 

183
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:44,309
pool of water now I want to work on
elevation changes so if I have full like

184
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
elevation changes so if I have full like
 

185
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,959
elevation changes so if I have full like
that I don't know if I can get up there

186
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:45,969
that I don't know if I can get up there
 

187
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:54,229
that I don't know if I can get up there
with a boat you see how difficult it is

188
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:54,239
with a boat you see how difficult it is
 

189
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,519
with a boat you see how difficult it is
so let's make a boat hopefully I have

190
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:56,529
so let's make a boat hopefully I have
 

191
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:59,729
so let's make a boat hopefully I have
some planks on me I never checked I do

192
00:06:59,729 --> 00:06:59,739
some planks on me I never checked I do
 

193
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:06,449
some planks on me I never checked I do
good so it'll be a mix of still water in

194
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:06,459
good so it'll be a mix of still water in
 

195
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,409
good so it'll be a mix of still water in
places and eats roads so I'll have a

196
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:10,419
places and eats roads so I'll have a
 

197
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:16,949
places and eats roads so I'll have a
still water over here and let's see if

198
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:16,959
still water over here and let's see if
 

199
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,569
still water over here and let's see if
we can make it up here if it's difficult

200
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:18,579
we can make it up here if it's difficult
 

201
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:21,850
we can make it up here if it's difficult
or not

202
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:21,860

 

203
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:31,689

it is very difficult darn it so yeah

204
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:31,699
it is very difficult darn it so yeah
 

205
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:32,950
it is very difficult darn it so yeah
this is the one thing I'm a little

206
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
this is the one thing I'm a little
 

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,189
this is the one thing I'm a little
concerned about we can make it work

208
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:36,199
concerned about we can make it work
 

209
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,929
concerned about we can make it work
using fence gates but it might look

210
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:37,939
using fence gates but it might look
 

211
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,659
using fence gates but it might look
really ugly

212
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:39,669
really ugly
 

213
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:46,719
really ugly
it could also use signs um mm okay well

214
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:46,729
it could also use signs um mm okay well
 

215
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,219
it could also use signs um mm okay well
I'll get some fence gates and try it out

216
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:48,229
I'll get some fence gates and try it out
 

217
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:54,749
I'll get some fence gates and try it out
see how it looks and I don't know guys

218
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:54,759
see how it looks and I don't know guys
 

219
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,679
see how it looks and I don't know guys
it doesn't look that great in my opinion

220
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:58,689
it doesn't look that great in my opinion
 

221
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,899
it doesn't look that great in my opinion
signs would probably look better but

222
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:01,909
signs would probably look better but
 

223
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:06,040
signs would probably look better but
still not great does work really well

224
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,050
still not great does work really well
 

225
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,790
still not great does work really well
though exactly like I wanted it to it's

226
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:09,800
though exactly like I wanted it to it's
 

227
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,830
though exactly like I wanted it to it's
very easy to go up and down still water

228
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:14,840
very easy to go up and down still water
 

229
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,559
very easy to go up and down still water
that way but I don't know I think I'm

230
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:20,569
that way but I don't know I think I'm
 

231
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,959
that way but I don't know I think I'm
going to try to avoid elevation changes

232
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:22,969
going to try to avoid elevation changes
 

233
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,769
going to try to avoid elevation changes
if I do still water just because it

234
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:26,779
if I do still water just because it
 

235
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,079
if I do still water just because it
doesn't look that great

236
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,089

 

237
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:38,920

mmm-hmm okay so I lowered this area down

238
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:38,930
mmm-hmm okay so I lowered this area down
 

239
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,500
mmm-hmm okay so I lowered this area down
one block so now they're even so we'll

240
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,510
one block so now they're even so we'll
 

241
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,829
one block so now they're even so we'll
fill this with water and I'm planning

242
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:44,839
fill this with water and I'm planning
 

243
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,670
fill this with water and I'm planning
now to have a drop here free drop down

244
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:48,680
now to have a drop here free drop down
 

245
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,980
now to have a drop here free drop down
to a pool below down there I think would

246
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:53,990
to a pool below down there I think would
 

247
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,430
to a pool below down there I think would
be pretty cool and put these signs here

248
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
be pretty cool and put these signs here
 

249
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,150
be pretty cool and put these signs here
to hold the water back um I noticed

250
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,160
to hold the water back um I noticed
 

251
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,040
to hold the water back um I noticed
something too and it's really bugging me

252
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,050
something too and it's really bugging me
 

253
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,670
something too and it's really bugging me
now but this this is a center basically

254
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:06,680
now but this this is a center basically
 

255
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,730
now but this this is a center basically
and that's off-center by one block and

256
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:09,740
and that's off-center by one block and
 

257
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:18,009
and that's off-center by one block and
it's just bugging me now hmm no I don't

258
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:18,019
it's just bugging me now hmm no I don't
 

259
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,590
it's just bugging me now hmm no I don't
know if I really like the style of

260
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
know if I really like the style of
 

261
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,490
know if I really like the style of
elevator I think I'm going to stick to

262
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:21,500
elevator I think I'm going to stick to
 

263
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,319
elevator I think I'm going to stick to
using the solid block styles the four by

264
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:26,329
using the solid block styles the four by
 

265
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:28,509
using the solid block styles the four by
four the nice thing about this is it's

266
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:28,519
four the nice thing about this is it's
 

267
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,210
four the nice thing about this is it's
three by three so it's smaller but I

268
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:31,220
three by three so it's smaller but I
 

269
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,680
three by three so it's smaller but I
don't I don't like how it looks as much

270
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:32,690
don't I don't like how it looks as much
 

271
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,900
don't I don't like how it looks as much
and these floating signs are weird

272
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:35,910
and these floating signs are weird
 

273
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:45,040
and these floating signs are weird
I don't might rip that out and redo it

274
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,050

 

275
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,120

okay what was I going to do I had a plan

276
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,130
okay what was I going to do I had a plan
 

277
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,120
okay what was I going to do I had a plan
yeah we got to do the water down here

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,130

 

279
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,410

we'll stick some pumpkins in again I

280
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:57,420
we'll stick some pumpkins in again I
 

281
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,080
we'll stick some pumpkins in again I
guess these are mostly just to give

282
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,090
guess these are mostly just to give
 

283
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:09,290
guess these are mostly just to give
light through the water to three now if

284
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,300
light through the water to three now if
 

285
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:18,410
light through the water to three now if
it matters much we'll fill this in

286
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:18,420

 

287
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:26,389

like so

288
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399

 

289
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,859

and it's done okay so one issue I'm

290
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:31,869
and it's done okay so one issue I'm
 

291
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:35,249
and it's done okay so one issue I'm
having is the pumpkin lighting the light

292
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:35,259
having is the pumpkin lighting the light
 

293
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,319
having is the pumpkin lighting the light
doesn't seem to spread very evenly when

294
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:37,329
doesn't seem to spread very evenly when
 

295
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,079
doesn't seem to spread very evenly when
it's underwater so I might remove them

296
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,089
it's underwater so I might remove them
 

297
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,869
it's underwater so I might remove them
they kind of kind of stand out too much

298
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:42,879
they kind of kind of stand out too much
 

299
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,840
they kind of kind of stand out too much
I didn't notice it as much up here low

300
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:47,850
I didn't notice it as much up here low
 

301
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,269
I didn't notice it as much up here low
but oh well I'll try to instead light

302
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
but oh well I'll try to instead light
 

303
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,840
but oh well I'll try to instead light
around any still water I place oh and I

304
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:57,850
around any still water I place oh and I
 

305
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,369
around any still water I place oh and I
got to be careful to find a nice balance

306
00:10:59,369 --> 00:10:59,379
got to be careful to find a nice balance
 

307
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:01,679
got to be careful to find a nice balance
here I don't want to get too overboard

308
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:01,689
here I don't want to get too overboard
 

309
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:08,009
here I don't want to get too overboard
with the Stillwater stuff otherwise this

310
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:08,019
with the Stillwater stuff otherwise this
 

311
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,900
with the Stillwater stuff otherwise this
whole place will be water just it'll

312
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:12,910
whole place will be water just it'll
 

313
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,489
whole place will be water just it'll
take some tweaking to get it looking

314
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:14,499
take some tweaking to get it looking
 

315
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:19,049
take some tweaking to get it looking
just the way I want it to but anyway

316
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:19,059
just the way I want it to but anyway
 

317
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,150
just the way I want it to but anyway
let's try out the drop here I think

318
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,160
let's try out the drop here I think
 

319
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:30,119
let's try out the drop here I think
it'll work nicely very cool

320
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:30,129
it'll work nicely very cool
 

321
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:36,720
it'll work nicely very cool
okay so we'll have to have a way back up

322
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:36,730
okay so we'll have to have a way back up
 

323
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,739
okay so we'll have to have a way back up
and eats Road somewhere you can tell I

324
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:43,749
and eats Road somewhere you can tell I
 

325
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,629
and eats Road somewhere you can tell I
keep changing my mind about things

326
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:45,639
keep changing my mind about things
 

327
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,369
keep changing my mind about things
because I'm I don't it's different once

328
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:50,379
because I'm I don't it's different once
 

329
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,689
because I'm I don't it's different once
you actually do it in it

330
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:51,699
you actually do it in it
 

331
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:54,479
you actually do it in it
now I'm thinking have different ways of

332
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:54,489
now I'm thinking have different ways of
 

333
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,019
now I'm thinking have different ways of
doing this

334
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:55,029
doing this
 

335
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:00,030
doing this
I took a little bit of a break from the

336
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,040
I took a little bit of a break from the
 

337
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,650
I took a little bit of a break from the
water stuff to mess around with some

338
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:01,660
water stuff to mess around with some
 

339
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,409
water stuff to mess around with some
minecart stuff here I'm starting to

340
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:04,419
minecart stuff here I'm starting to
 

341
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,179
minecart stuff here I'm starting to
figure things out the way I want it to

342
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:06,189
figure things out the way I want it to
 

343
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:11,129
figure things out the way I want it to
work a little tough to explain what I

344
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:11,139
work a little tough to explain what I
 

345
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:13,739
work a little tough to explain what I
want to do I like to keep it as simple

346
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:13,749
want to do I like to keep it as simple
 

347
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:22,100
want to do I like to keep it as simple
as possible so maybe I'll show you

348
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,110

 

349
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,350

so basically the way I like my card

350
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
so basically the way I like my card
 

351
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,990
so basically the way I like my card
systems is you hop in a minecart and you

352
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
systems is you hop in a minecart and you
 

353
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,010
systems is you hop in a minecart and you
go alright from point A to point B is

354
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,020
go alright from point A to point B is
 

355
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,970
go alright from point A to point B is
what I would like the thing is if you do

356
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:35,980
what I would like the thing is if you do
 

357
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,800
what I would like the thing is if you do
that then the minecart is no longer on

358
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:37,810
that then the minecart is no longer on
 

359
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,340
that then the minecart is no longer on
this end it's at this end right so say I

360
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,350
this end it's at this end right so say I
 

361
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,640
this end it's at this end right so say I
will just walk back here guess what

362
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,650
will just walk back here guess what
 

363
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,560
will just walk back here guess what
there's no minecart here so that's a

364
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,570
there's no minecart here so that's a
 

365
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,920
there's no minecart here so that's a
problem so you need to have two my carts

366
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:49,930
problem so you need to have two my carts
 

367
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,820
problem so you need to have two my carts
on the track one at each end the easiest

368
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:53,830
on the track one at each end the easiest
 

369
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,150
on the track one at each end the easiest
way to do that is to have two tracks but

370
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,160
way to do that is to have two tracks but
 

371
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,010
way to do that is to have two tracks but
I'm trying to make it so there's only

372
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,020
I'm trying to make it so there's only
 

373
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,640
I'm trying to make it so there's only
one track to save on rails but that

374
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,650
one track to save on rails but that
 

375
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:11,930
one track to save on rails but that
means we need to do something fancy and

376
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:11,940
means we need to do something fancy and
 

377
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,330
means we need to do something fancy and
the idea is you would have another one

378
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:15,340
the idea is you would have another one
 

379
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,700
the idea is you would have another one
of these things at this end as well and

380
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:17,710
of these things at this end as well and
 

381
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,780
of these things at this end as well and
so if a minecart comes from this way

382
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:21,790
so if a minecart comes from this way
 

383
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,970
so if a minecart comes from this way
this minecart needs to get out of the

384
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:23,980
this minecart needs to get out of the
 

385
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:29,820
this minecart needs to get out of the
way and get sent back right so that's

386
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:29,830
way and get sent back right so that's
 

387
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,930
way and get sent back right so that's
what this contraption does here this

388
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:33,940
what this contraption does here this
 

389
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,750
what this contraption does here this
then pushes it to over here this one

390
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:36,760
then pushes it to over here this one
 

391
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,060
then pushes it to over here this one
goes up around here and it also aligns

392
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,070
goes up around here and it also aligns
 

393
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,250
goes up around here and it also aligns
it so it's half on the pressure plate so

394
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:41,260
it so it's half on the pressure plate so
 

395
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,450
it so it's half on the pressure plate so
when you hop in you boost it and you

396
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:45,460
when you hop in you boost it and you
 

397
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,260
when you hop in you boost it and you
also hit the pressure plates is the way

398
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,270
also hit the pressure plates is the way
 

399
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,310
also hit the pressure plates is the way
that I'm trying to do this

400
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320

 

401
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,110

yeah so I think this is the way I'll do

402
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
yeah so I think this is the way I'll do
 

403
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,470
yeah so I think this is the way I'll do
the minecart track stuff this is good

404
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
the minecart track stuff this is good
 

405
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,570
the minecart track stuff this is good
for only for short travel distances

406
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:02,580
for only for short travel distances
 

407
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,370
for only for short travel distances
because if you try to send the minecart

408
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:05,380
because if you try to send the minecart
 

409
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,420
because if you try to send the minecart
back and it goes to an unloaded chunk I

410
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:08,430
back and it goes to an unloaded chunk I
 

411
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,770
back and it goes to an unloaded chunk I
believe you will have some problems so

412
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:10,780
believe you will have some problems so
 

413
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,510
believe you will have some problems so
this is more like say I want to go from

414
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:12,520
this is more like say I want to go from
 

415
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,020
this is more like say I want to go from
our creeper face to the cow farm you

416
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,030
our creeper face to the cow farm you
 

417
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,410
our creeper face to the cow farm you
know it's maybe a hundred blocks set

418
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:19,420
know it's maybe a hundred blocks set
 

419
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,890
know it's maybe a hundred blocks set
something like this up pretty easy this

420
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:22,900
something like this up pretty easy this
 

421
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,050
something like this up pretty easy this
does take a little bit of space you'll

422
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,060
does take a little bit of space you'll
 

423
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,370
does take a little bit of space you'll
have to have one of these on each end

424
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:26,380
have to have one of these on each end
 

425
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,960
have to have one of these on each end
but it's not terrible and a lot of a lot

426
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:30,970
but it's not terrible and a lot of a lot
 

427
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,550
but it's not terrible and a lot of a lot
of this stuff can be hidden nicely like

428
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
of this stuff can be hidden nicely like
 

429
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,140
of this stuff can be hidden nicely like
these levers I just have on the surface

430
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,150
these levers I just have on the surface
 

431
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,620
these levers I just have on the surface
but

432
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:34,630
but
 

433
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,139
but
you could put torches under these power

434
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:37,149
you could put torches under these power
 

435
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,259
you could put torches under these power
rails to power them it's wired to be

436
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:40,269
rails to power them it's wired to be
 

437
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:44,850
rails to power them it's wired to be
hidden I did make a little bit of a

438
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:44,860
hidden I did make a little bit of a
 

439
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,999
hidden I did make a little bit of a
mistake here though by the way I did not

440
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:48,009
mistake here though by the way I did not
 

441
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:49,860
mistake here though by the way I did not
come up with this pressure plate idea I

442
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:49,870
come up with this pressure plate idea I
 

443
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,389
come up with this pressure plate idea I
saw a video a long time ago I can't

444
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:51,399
saw a video a long time ago I can't
 

445
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,780
saw a video a long time ago I can't
remember who came up with it first but

446
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:54,790
remember who came up with it first but
 

447
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,439
remember who came up with it first but
it wasn't me

448
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:55,449
it wasn't me
 

449
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:58,439
it wasn't me
so let's just say that right now but

450
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:58,449
so let's just say that right now but
 

451
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,199
so let's just say that right now but
basically the idea is the cart comes up

452
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:01,209
basically the idea is the cart comes up
 

453
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,559
basically the idea is the cart comes up
and goes into it aligns itself to one of

454
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:04,569
and goes into it aligns itself to one of
 

455
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:10,920
and goes into it aligns itself to one of
these iron iron fences or glass panes I

456
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:10,930
these iron iron fences or glass panes I
 

457
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,780
these iron iron fences or glass panes I
think you could use regular fences to

458
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:12,790
think you could use regular fences to
 

459
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,740
think you could use regular fences to
I'm not sure maybe not and the cart

460
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:16,750
I'm not sure maybe not and the cart
 

461
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,889
I'm not sure maybe not and the cart
drops down so it's on the pressure plate

462
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:19,899
drops down so it's on the pressure plate
 

463
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,860
drops down so it's on the pressure plate
and also on the rail and when when you

464
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:22,870
and also on the rail and when when you
 

465
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,069
and also on the rail and when when you
hop in the cart you activate the button

466
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
hop in the cart you activate the button
 

467
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,319
hop in the cart you activate the button
which powers a rail and you get sent off

468
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:28,329
which powers a rail and you get sent off
 

469
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:33,449
which powers a rail and you get sent off
and now it's my thing here there's two

470
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:33,459
and now it's my thing here there's two
 

471
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,680
and now it's my thing here there's two
junctions one takes you this or one goes

472
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:37,690
junctions one takes you this or one goes
 

473
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,350
junctions one takes you this or one goes
like this for coming back

474
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:40,360
like this for coming back
 

475
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,600
like this for coming back
this detector here switches this so that

476
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:44,610
this detector here switches this so that
 

477
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,429
this detector here switches this so that
you go straight if you're coming from

478
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:47,439
you go straight if you're coming from
 

479
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,730
you go straight if you're coming from
this direction

480
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,740
this direction
 

481
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,939
this direction
maybe we'll we'll check it out here see

482
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:53,949
maybe we'll we'll check it out here see
 

483
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:55,920
maybe we'll we'll check it out here see
it switches straight so Mayan carts go

484
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:55,930
it switches straight so Mayan carts go
 

485
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,059
it switches straight so Mayan carts go
straight and then it goes up here it's

486
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,069
straight and then it goes up here it's
 

487
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,999
straight and then it goes up here it's
this detector and then activates a

488
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:03,009
this detector and then activates a
 

489
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,710
this detector and then activates a
piston to get the card out of the way so

490
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
piston to get the card out of the way so
 

491
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,860
piston to get the card out of the way so
that it can fall down safely and then

492
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:07,870
that it can fall down safely and then
 

493
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,559
that it can fall down safely and then
the cart that gets pushed out of the way

494
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:09,569
the cart that gets pushed out of the way
 

495
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:16,379
the cart that gets pushed out of the way
comes back here and gets sent through so

496
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:16,389
comes back here and gets sent through so
 

497
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,999
comes back here and gets sent through so
some of my longtime viewers probably

498
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:18,009
some of my longtime viewers probably
 

499
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,040
some of my longtime viewers probably
know this already but I don't do a whole

500
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,050
know this already but I don't do a whole
 

501
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,110
know this already but I don't do a whole
lot of stuff with mine carts usually

502
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,120
lot of stuff with mine carts usually
 

503
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,429
lot of stuff with mine carts usually
especially my LPS and that's basically

504
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:26,439
especially my LPS and that's basically
 

505
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,860
especially my LPS and that's basically
because I'm not very good at it to be

506
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:28,870
because I'm not very good at it to be
 

507
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,199
because I'm not very good at it to be
honest it's not really my specialty

508
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:31,209
honest it's not really my specialty
 

509
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:36,829
honest it's not really my specialty
um but today we're doing it just for fun

510
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:36,839
um but today we're doing it just for fun
 

511
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,350
um but today we're doing it just for fun
yeah I usually make mistakes in that too

512
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:40,360
yeah I usually make mistakes in that too
 

513
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,660
yeah I usually make mistakes in that too
when people have to correct me and

514
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:42,670
when people have to correct me and
 

515
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,230
when people have to correct me and
today's no exception I realized a few

516
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
today's no exception I realized a few
 

517
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,960
today's no exception I realized a few
mistakes I've made here

518
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:48,970
mistakes I've made here
 

519
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,069
mistakes I've made here
so one of these I'm sure there's plenty

520
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:53,079
so one of these I'm sure there's plenty
 

521
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,960
so one of these I'm sure there's plenty
of mistakes I made but one of these

522
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:54,970
of mistakes I made but one of these
 

523
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,430
of mistakes I made but one of these
I need a docking station I forgot to put

524
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
I need a docking station I forgot to put
 

525
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,379
I need a docking station I forgot to put
a docking station in here because

526
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:01,389
a docking station in here because
 

527
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,660
a docking station in here because
otherwise it's just going to send me

528
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:03,670
otherwise it's just going to send me
 

529
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,860
otherwise it's just going to send me
right back because I'm in the minecarts

530
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:06,870
right back because I'm in the minecarts
 

531
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:12,510
right back because I'm in the minecarts
when it lands on the pressure plate so

532
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:12,520
when it lands on the pressure plate so
 

533
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,100
when it lands on the pressure plate so
yeah that's one change that needs to be

534
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,110
yeah that's one change that needs to be
 

535
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,970
yeah that's one change that needs to be
made so I'll probably have it go up here

536
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:17,980
made so I'll probably have it go up here
 

537
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,850
made so I'll probably have it go up here
the detector rail which will send power

538
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:20,860
the detector rail which will send power
 

539
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,059
the detector rail which will send power
to this rail here which will send a

540
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:24,069
to this rail here which will send a
 

541
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,929
to this rail here which will send a
minecart back and then there'll be a

542
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:27,939
minecart back and then there'll be a
 

543
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,799
minecart back and then there'll be a
stop here or something for me to get out

544
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:31,809
stop here or something for me to get out
 

545
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:33,600
stop here or something for me to get out
of the Maya cart and I'll probably use

546
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:33,610
of the Maya cart and I'll probably use
 

547
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,580
of the Maya cart and I'll probably use
AM 77s nice switch idea for exiting the

548
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:38,590
AM 77s nice switch idea for exiting the
 

549
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,100
AM 77s nice switch idea for exiting the
minecart and when I hit the me switch

550
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,110
minecart and when I hit the me switch
 

551
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,200
minecart and when I hit the me switch
this my cart that's stationary here will

552
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,210
this my cart that's stationary here will
 

553
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,080
this my cart that's stationary here will
get pushed forward and get set on the

554
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,090
get pushed forward and get set on the
 

555
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,799
get pushed forward and get set on the
pressure plate like it needs to be so

556
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:52,809
pressure plate like it needs to be so
 

557
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,299
pressure plate like it needs to be so
the other thing I've realized is I don't

558
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:54,309
the other thing I've realized is I don't
 

559
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:57,600
the other thing I've realized is I don't
need this separate track here and I

560
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:57,610
need this separate track here and I
 

561
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,950
need this separate track here and I
don't need this piston it's all overkill

562
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
don't need this piston it's all overkill
 

563
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,169
don't need this piston it's all overkill
since we need a docking station the cart

564
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:04,179
since we need a docking station the cart
 

565
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,940
since we need a docking station the cart
will be out of the way so the other cart

566
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:05,950
will be out of the way so the other cart
 

567
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,610
will be out of the way so the other cart
that's here can get sent back no problem

568
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:08,620
that's here can get sent back no problem
 

569
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,770
that's here can get sent back no problem
doesn't need to go off to the side here

570
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:10,780
doesn't need to go off to the side here
 

571
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,440
doesn't need to go off to the side here
and even with my other setup there I

572
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,450
and even with my other setup there I
 

573
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,690
and even with my other setup there I
didn't need it either now that I think

574
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:15,700
didn't need it either now that I think
 

575
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:23,640
didn't need it either now that I think
about it yeah very very good so maybe

576
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:23,650
about it yeah very very good so maybe
 

577
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,820
about it yeah very very good so maybe
I'll set up a new prototype to show the

578
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:26,830
I'll set up a new prototype to show the
 

579
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,029
I'll set up a new prototype to show the
changes that I need to make to this I

580
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:32,039

 

581
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,470

messed around with it a bit I think I

582
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
messed around with it a bit I think I
 

583
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,310
messed around with it a bit I think I
think I got it now the way I want it

584
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
think I got it now the way I want it
 

585
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,200
think I got it now the way I want it
this is what it does you would go from

586
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,210
this is what it does you would go from
 

587
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,350
this is what it does you would go from
one end then this is like where you

588
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
one end then this is like where you
 

589
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
one end then this is like where you
would get off and then it goes back up

590
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:47,770
would get off and then it goes back up
 

591
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,049
would get off and then it goes back up
and gets into position like that

592
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:53,059

 

593
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,600

okay and you can have a nice clean

594
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,610
okay and you can have a nice clean
 

595
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,029
okay and you can have a nice clean
licking end over here for getting on it

596
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
licking end over here for getting on it
 

597
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,129
licking end over here for getting on it
you don't hit your head or anything

598
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:01,139
you don't hit your head or anything
 

599
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:09,289
you don't hit your head or anything
which is nice oops yeah so we'll send

600
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:09,299
which is nice oops yeah so we'll send
 

601
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,239
which is nice oops yeah so we'll send
this back and then I'll demonstrate with

602
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:11,249
this back and then I'll demonstrate with
 

603
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:14,210
this back and then I'll demonstrate with
two cards on the track so we need that

604
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,220
two cards on the track so we need that
 

605
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,909
two cards on the track so we need that
to get out of the way so that the this

606
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:16,919
to get out of the way so that the this
 

607
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,419
to get out of the way so that the this
cart can take its place and that cart

608
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:20,429
cart can take its place and that cart
 

609
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,909
cart can take its place and that cart
would get sent back to this end and this

610
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:22,919
would get sent back to this end and this
 

611
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,799
would get sent back to this end and this
end would have a copy of one of these

612
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:26,809
end would have a copy of one of these
 

613
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:32,509
end would have a copy of one of these
added as well go like this you would get

614
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:32,519
added as well go like this you would get
 

615
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,700
added as well go like this you would get
off you could either use a me switch

616
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:34,710
off you could either use a me switch
 

617
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,999
off you could either use a me switch
here or just put a pressure plate

618
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:38,009
here or just put a pressure plate
 

619
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,470
here or just put a pressure plate
somewhere that you'll walk on it or

620
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,480
somewhere that you'll walk on it or
 

621
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,330
somewhere that you'll walk on it or
something

622
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:43,340

 

623
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,070

oops should've been standing on it try

624
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,080
oops should've been standing on it try
 

625
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,720
oops should've been standing on it try
it again it's not really clean setup at

626
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:53,730
it again it's not really clean setup at
 

627
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:00,560
it again it's not really clean setup at
the moment but yeah the wire would go to

628
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:00,570
the moment but yeah the wire would go to
 

629
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,899
the moment but yeah the wire would go to
this which would make the cart move and

630
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:02,909
this which would make the cart move and
 

631
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,060
this which would make the cart move and
it also goes to this one which would get

632
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,070
it also goes to this one which would get
 

633
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,119
it also goes to this one which would get
the other card out of the way and that's
