00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
i've never seen that happen over here
 

21
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,830
i've never seen that happen over here
before so i thought that was kind of

22
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
before so i thought that was kind of
 

23
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,230

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
he's gonna find a way to suffocate
 

35
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,270
he's gonna find a way to suffocate
though i'm sure

36
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
though i'm sure
 

37
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,790
though i'm sure
but we'll deepen as long as we can here

38
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
but we'll deepen as long as we can here
 

39

but we'll deepen as long as we can here
so guys uh today to begin with i

40
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
so guys uh today to begin with i

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,709
so guys uh today to begin with i
have a brand new redstone concept to

42
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
have a brand new redstone concept to
 

43
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,310
have a brand new redstone concept to
show you we're gonna

44
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
show you we're gonna
 

45
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,270
show you we're gonna
look into how we can store memory in

46
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
look into how we can store memory in
 

47
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,389
look into how we can store memory in
minecraft so

48
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
minecraft so
 

49
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,110
minecraft so
currently in the game there's probably

50
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
currently in the game there's probably
 

51
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,349
currently in the game there's probably
we're going the wrong way

52
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
we're going the wrong way
 

53
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,070
we're going the wrong way
there's probably two main methods of

54
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
there's probably two main methods of
 

55
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,710
there's probably two main methods of
doing it

56
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
doing it
 

57
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,469
doing it
uh you got piston tapes i'm sure a lot

58
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
uh you got piston tapes i'm sure a lot
 

59
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,789
uh you got piston tapes i'm sure a lot
of you know what piston tapes are

60
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
of you know what piston tapes are
 

61
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,070
of you know what piston tapes are
it's readable memory it's it's

62
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
it's readable memory it's it's
 

63
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,670
it's readable memory it's it's
kind of big it's bulky you can't really

64
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
kind of big it's bulky you can't really
 

65
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,190
kind of big it's bulky you can't really
change the length of it it's kind of a

66
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
change the length of it it's kind of a
 

67
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,950
change the length of it it's kind of a
fixed state memory

68
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
fixed state memory
 

69
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,510
fixed state memory
and you can't really write to it then we

70
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
and you can't really write to it then we
 

71
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,230
and you can't really write to it then we
have

72
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
have
 

73
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,390
have
like t flip flops and we can use

74
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
like t flip flops and we can use
 

75
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,230
like t flip flops and we can use
redstone to store memory but

76
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
redstone to store memory but
 

77
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,270
redstone to store memory but
that becomes very big very bulky and

78
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
that becomes very big very bulky and
 

79
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,670
that becomes very big very bulky and
very slow

80
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
very slow
 

81
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,390
very slow
so today i was trying to think of how

82
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
so today i was trying to think of how
 

83
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,870
so today i was trying to think of how
can we

84
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
can we
 

85
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,270
can we
finish up this simon game because i ran

86
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
finish up this simon game because i ran
 

87
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,310
finish up this simon game because i ran
into a problem

88
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
into a problem
 

89
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,830
into a problem
where it's uh it's gonna be too slow

90
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
where it's uh it's gonna be too slow
 

91
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,510
where it's uh it's gonna be too slow
um the the idea i had

92
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
um the the idea i had
 

93
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,950
um the the idea i had
became very big and bulky and uh

94
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
became very big and bulky and uh
 

95
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,630
became very big and bulky and uh
there was no way to do a turn in less

96
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
there was no way to do a turn in less
 

97
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,710
there was no way to do a turn in less
than like 20 seconds so that was a

98
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
than like 20 seconds so that was a
 

99
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,670
than like 20 seconds so that was a
pretty big snag to the project here so i

100
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
pretty big snag to the project here so i
 

101
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,429
pretty big snag to the project here so i
was thinking about ideas of how to store

102
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
was thinking about ideas of how to store
 

103
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:57,990
was thinking about ideas of how to store
memory

104
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
memory
 

105
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,069
memory
uh first let's look into maybe some of

106
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
uh first let's look into maybe some of
 

107
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,069
uh first let's look into maybe some of
the issues

108
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
the issues
 

109
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,910
the issues
of storing memory so let's say for

110
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
of storing memory so let's say for
 

111
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,670
of storing memory so let's say for
example

112
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
example
 

113
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,029
example
an arrow is a zero stone block is a one

114
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
an arrow is a zero stone block is a one
 

115
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,150
an arrow is a zero stone block is a one
in in memory here right so we can we can

116
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
in in memory here right so we can we can
 

117
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,990
in in memory here right so we can we can
send it through a hopper and detect

118
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
send it through a hopper and detect
 

119
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,070
send it through a hopper and detect
you know if it's an arrow or a stone

120
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
you know if it's an arrow or a stone
 

121
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,589
you know if it's an arrow or a stone
block and then cause different things to

122
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
block and then cause different things to
 

123
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,710
block and then cause different things to
happen

124
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
happen
 

125
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,750
happen
but then when we want to recollect all

126
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
but then when we want to recollect all
 

127
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,589
but then when we want to recollect all
this stuff together here what happens is

128
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
this stuff together here what happens is
 

129
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,150
this stuff together here what happens is
it stacks in the chest right

130
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
it stacks in the chest right
 

131
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,869
it stacks in the chest right
so we lose all that positional

132
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
so we lose all that positional
 

133
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,390
so we lose all that positional
importance

134
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
importance
 

135
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,150
importance
information of like where all the blocks

136
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
information of like where all the blocks
 

137
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,229
information of like where all the blocks
were and now next time we

138
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
were and now next time we
 

139
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,750
were and now next time we
we read through this it's gonna be eight

140
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
we read through this it's gonna be eight
 

141
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,430
we read through this it's gonna be eight
arrows and ten stone blocks not

142
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
arrows and ten stone blocks not
 

143
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,910
arrows and ten stone blocks not
not the order we had before so that kind

144
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
not the order we had before so that kind
 

145
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,430
not the order we had before so that kind
of sucks

146
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
of sucks
 

147
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,509
of sucks
so another idea here is to maybe use

148
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
so another idea here is to maybe use
 

149
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,470
so another idea here is to maybe use
items that don't stack such as swords

150
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
items that don't stack such as swords
 

151
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,070
items that don't stack such as swords
so we put a sword in here and makes a

152
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
so we put a sword in here and makes a
 

153
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,509
so we put a sword in here and makes a
signal length of three

154
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
signal length of three
 

155
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,589
signal length of three
we can detect the difference between an

156
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
we can detect the difference between an
 

157
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,949
we can detect the difference between an
item that doesn't stack

158
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
item that doesn't stack
 

159
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,910
item that doesn't stack
and one that does very easily so that

160
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
and one that does very easily so that
 

161
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,350
and one that does very easily so that
only goes the distance of one it doesn't

162
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
only goes the distance of one it doesn't
 

163
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,550
only goes the distance of one it doesn't
turn the light on

164
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
turn the light on
 

165
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,190
turn the light on
while the sword does so we can detect

166
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
while the sword does so we can detect
 

167
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,710
while the sword does so we can detect
the difference between the two without

168
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
the difference between the two without
 

169
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,270
the difference between the two without
using item filters that's kind of cool

170
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
using item filters that's kind of cool
 

171
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,509
using item filters that's kind of cool
but likewise same problem happens here

172
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
but likewise same problem happens here
 

173
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,270
but likewise same problem happens here
because we're using an item that stacks

174
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
because we're using an item that stacks
 

175
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,190
because we're using an item that stacks
the stone blocks

176
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
the stone blocks
 

177
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,949
the stone blocks
check out what happens

178
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959

 

179
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,900

now it works the first time

180
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:17,910
now it works the first time
 

181
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,589
now it works the first time
[Music]

182
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
[Music]
 

183
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,750
[Music]
but because item stacks it messes up all

184
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
but because item stacks it messes up all
 

185
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,430
but because item stacks it messes up all
the positional information which is

186
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
the positional information which is
 

187
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,350
the positional information which is
what's really key here

188
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
what's really key here
 

189
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,270
what's really key here
and next time we want to read through

190
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
and next time we want to read through
 

191
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,789
and next time we want to read through
this it's going to be all messed up so

192
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
this it's going to be all messed up so
 

193
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,149
this it's going to be all messed up so
that's no good

194
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
that's no good
 

195
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,910
that's no good
the other problem is we can't really

196
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
the other problem is we can't really
 

197
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,710
the other problem is we can't really
detect a difference between

198
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
detect a difference between
 

199
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,309
detect a difference between
items that don't stack we can't run

200
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
items that don't stack we can't run
 

201
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,990
items that don't stack we can't run
these through an item and filter and

202
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
these through an item and filter and
 

203
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,990
these through an item and filter and
figure out oh that's a diamond sword

204
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
figure out oh that's a diamond sword
 

205
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,830
figure out oh that's a diamond sword
and this is a diamond axe there's no

206
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
and this is a diamond axe there's no
 

207
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,190
and this is a diamond axe there's no
difference

208
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
difference
 

209
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,949
difference
we can detect between these two they

210
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
we can detect between these two they
 

211
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,309
we can detect between these two they
both emit a signal of three

212
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
both emit a signal of three
 

213
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,070
both emit a signal of three
and we can't check what the item

214
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
and we can't check what the item
 

215
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,070
and we can't check what the item
actually is so that's that's a big issue

216
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
actually is so that's that's a big issue
 

217
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,670
actually is so that's that's a big issue
as well

218
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
as well
 

219
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,030
as well
yeah so i was trying to solve this

220
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
yeah so i was trying to solve this
 

221
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,550
yeah so i was trying to solve this
problem today guys because if we could

222
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
problem today guys because if we could
 

223
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,229
problem today guys because if we could
get this sort of memory to work

224
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
get this sort of memory to work
 

225
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,429
get this sort of memory to work
it's going to be a pretty big deal it'll

226
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
it's going to be a pretty big deal it'll
 

227
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,309
it's going to be a pretty big deal it'll
be a huge improvement to like redstoning

228
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
be a huge improvement to like redstoning
 

229
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,470
be a huge improvement to like redstoning
uh in minecraft we'll we'll be able to

230
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
uh in minecraft we'll we'll be able to
 

231
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,550
uh in minecraft we'll we'll be able to
do more complicated stuff

232
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
do more complicated stuff
 

233
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,509
do more complicated stuff
um and it turns out it actually is

234
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
um and it turns out it actually is
 

235
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,309
um and it turns out it actually is
possible so there's one item in the game

236
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
possible so there's one item in the game
 

237
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,189
possible so there's one item in the game
in minecraft that doesn't stack it's one

238
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
in minecraft that doesn't stack it's one
 

239
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,550
in minecraft that doesn't stack it's one
item per stack

240
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
item per stack
 

241
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,469
item per stack
that we can manipulate to figure out

242
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
that we can manipulate to figure out
 

243
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,670
that we can manipulate to figure out
what it is if it's a one or a zero

244
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
what it is if it's a one or a zero
 

245
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,469
what it is if it's a one or a zero
and that is the water bucket or or live

246
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
and that is the water bucket or or live
 

247
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,990
and that is the water bucket or or live
about it could work as well but i think

248
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
about it could work as well but i think
 

249
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,590
about it could work as well but i think
water budgets a little easier to pull

250
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
water budgets a little easier to pull
 

251
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,390
water budgets a little easier to pull
off in

252
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
off in
 

253
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,510
off in
in survival here so what we want to try

254
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
in survival here so what we want to try
 

255
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,870
in survival here so what we want to try
to do here is make a

256
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880

 

257
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,070

a water bucket reader machine

258
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
a water bucket reader machine
 

259
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,070
a water bucket reader machine
i guess is what what it would be called

260
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
i guess is what what it would be called
 

261
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,150
i guess is what what it would be called
i have an idea of how to do it

262
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
i have an idea of how to do it
 

263
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,790
i have an idea of how to do it
uh might take a little bit of a figuring

264
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
uh might take a little bit of a figuring
 

265
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,390
uh might take a little bit of a figuring
out i want to see how fast we can get it

266
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
out i want to see how fast we can get it
 

267
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,469
out i want to see how fast we can get it
to work as well if possible

268
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
to work as well if possible
 

269
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,830
to work as well if possible
so in minecraft you can place

270
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
so in minecraft you can place
 

271
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,749
so in minecraft you can place
water buckets using dispensers that's

272
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
water buckets using dispensers that's
 

273
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,270
water buckets using dispensers that's
pretty key

274
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
pretty key
 

275
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,150
pretty key
to this so if we put that in here and we

276
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
to this so if we put that in here and we
 

277
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,749
to this so if we put that in here and we
power it

278
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759

 

279
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,270

we got water and then we can pick it up

280
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
we got water and then we can pick it up
 

281
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,270
we got water and then we can pick it up
again afterwards too which is nice

282
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
again afterwards too which is nice
 

283
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,029
again afterwards too which is nice
uh if that wasn't um

284
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
uh if that wasn't um
 

285
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,790
uh if that wasn't um
a water bucket let's say it was a sword

286
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
a water bucket let's say it was a sword
 

287
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,469
a water bucket let's say it was a sword
another item that doesn't stack instead

288
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
another item that doesn't stack instead
 

289
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,070
another item that doesn't stack instead
of like placing the water

290
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
of like placing the water
 

291
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,710
of like placing the water
it'll shoot the item out so we can we

292
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
it'll shoot the item out so we can we
 

293
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,189
it'll shoot the item out so we can we
can

294
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
can
 

295
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,950
can
use those two differences to figure out

296
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
use those two differences to figure out
 

297
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,350
use those two differences to figure out
what item is actually in there fairly

298
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
what item is actually in there fairly
 

299
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,469
what item is actually in there fairly
easily

300
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
easily
 

301
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,110
easily
so what i'm thinking we do we set up an

302
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
so what i'm thinking we do we set up an
 

303
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,990
so what i'm thinking we do we set up an
observer block

304
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
observer block
 

305
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,670
observer block
um like over here

306
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
um like over here
 

307
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,670
um like over here
wait which way do we face it that way

308
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
wait which way do we face it that way
 

309
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,070
wait which way do we face it that way
yeah so if it places water it'll trick

310
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
yeah so if it places water it'll trick
 

311
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,469
yeah so if it places water it'll trick
the

312
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
the
 

313
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,790
the
it'll uh trigger the observer block if

314
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
it'll uh trigger the observer block if
 

315
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,310
it'll uh trigger the observer block if
it's a sword that shoots out it's not

316
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
it's a sword that shoots out it's not
 

317
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,189
it's a sword that shoots out it's not
going to do anything

318
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
going to do anything
 

319
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,469
going to do anything
right and then below here

320
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
right and then below here
 

321
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,150
right and then below here
we can have a hopper if it's a sword

322
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
we can have a hopper if it's a sword
 

323
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,870
we can have a hopper if it's a sword
it'll go into the hopper and then we can

324
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
it'll go into the hopper and then we can
 

325
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,670
it'll go into the hopper and then we can
detect that

326
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
detect that
 

327
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,270
detect that
if it's a water bucket it's not going to

328
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
if it's a water bucket it's not going to
 

329
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,469
if it's a water bucket it's not going to
go into the hopper it's going to trigger

330
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
go into the hopper it's going to trigger
 

331
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,830
go into the hopper it's going to trigger
the observer so those are the two

332
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
the observer so those are the two
 

333
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,990
the observer so those are the two
differences

334
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
differences
 

335
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,390
differences
all right so it's uh not done here just

336
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
all right so it's uh not done here just
 

337
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,070
all right so it's uh not done here just
yet but this will show you the key

338
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
yet but this will show you the key
 

339
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,469
yet but this will show you the key
concept and also the key difficulties or

340
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
concept and also the key difficulties or
 

341
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,189

342
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
challenges
 

343
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,150
challenges
with doing this so this is our data

344
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
with doing this so this is our data
 

345
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,189
with doing this so this is our data
reader

346
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
reader
 

347
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,590
reader
what we'll have is a data stream the

348
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
what we'll have is a data stream the
 

349
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,469
what we'll have is a data stream the
water buckets

350
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
water buckets
 

351
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,950
water buckets
and some other non-stackable item like

352
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
and some other non-stackable item like
 

353
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,710
and some other non-stackable item like
like a shovel for example

354
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
like a shovel for example
 

355
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,790
like a shovel for example
they'll be arranged here we want it to

356
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
they'll be arranged here we want it to
 

357
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,029
they'll be arranged here we want it to
run through our data reader

358
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
run through our data reader
 

359
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,270
run through our data reader
and trigger the redstone either this

360
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
and trigger the redstone either this
 

361
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,029
and trigger the redstone either this
light will turn on or this one

362
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
light will turn on or this one
 

363
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,590
light will turn on or this one
and then it'll end up in this chest down

364
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
and then it'll end up in this chest down
 

365
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,990
and then it'll end up in this chest down
here in the exact same order it went in

366
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
here in the exact same order it went in
 

367
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,749
here in the exact same order it went in
originally that's that's the goal of all

368
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
originally that's that's the goal of all
 

369
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,189
originally that's that's the goal of all
this right

370
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
this right
 

371
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,309
this right
so here's here's the first challenge

372
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
so here's here's the first challenge
 

373
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,870
so here's here's the first challenge
so if we just let this go it's gonna

374
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
so if we just let this go it's gonna
 

375
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,309
so if we just let this go it's gonna
fill up the dispenser and then this is

376
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
fill up the dispenser and then this is
 

377
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,230
fill up the dispenser and then this is
gonna shoot it out in a random order and

378
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
gonna shoot it out in a random order and
 

379
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,909
gonna shoot it out in a random order and
then it's gonna not end up in the same

380
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
then it's gonna not end up in the same
 

381
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,189
then it's gonna not end up in the same
order down here so that's a

382
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
order down here so that's a
 

383
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,430
order down here so that's a
that's a big no-no we need to handle

384
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
that's a big no-no we need to handle
 

385
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,670
that's a big no-no we need to handle
this one item at a time

386
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
this one item at a time
 

387
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,790
this one item at a time
uh if it's a water buckets we it'll do

388
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
uh if it's a water buckets we it'll do
 

389
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,189
uh if it's a water buckets we it'll do
something like this

390
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
something like this
 

391
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,110
something like this
so we're gonna eject it and pick it up

392
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
so we're gonna eject it and pick it up
 

393
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,189
so we're gonna eject it and pick it up
right away so that's still

394
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
right away so that's still
 

395
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,070
right away so that's still
still a water bucket in the system and

396
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
still a water bucket in the system and
 

397
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,350
still a water bucket in the system and
you see it triggered this

398
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
you see it triggered this
 

399
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,870
you see it triggered this
observer over here that light turned on

400
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
observer over here that light turned on
 

401
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,029
observer over here that light turned on
if it's a shovel in there

402
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039

 

403
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,950

it's going to go into this hopper into

404
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
it's going to go into this hopper into
 

405
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,230
it's going to go into this hopper into
the chest down there

406
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
the chest down there
 

407
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,070
the chest down there
and a comparator can detect that very

408
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
and a comparator can detect that very
 

409
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,710
and a comparator can detect that very
easily you notice though we have no way

410
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
easily you notice though we have no way
 

411
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,390
easily you notice though we have no way
of sending the water button into this

412
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
of sending the water button into this
 

413
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,390
of sending the water button into this
chest that's that's our first real big

414
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
chest that's that's our first real big
 

415
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,749
chest that's that's our first real big
challenge here if we put a

416
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
challenge here if we put a
 

417
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,629
challenge here if we put a
hopper underneath that'll kind of work

418
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
hopper underneath that'll kind of work
 

419
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,589
hopper underneath that'll kind of work
but

420
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
but
 

421
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,029
but
as soon as that goes in there it's going

422
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
as soon as that goes in there it's going
 

423
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,990
as soon as that goes in there it's going
down we don't have time to

424
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
down we don't have time to
 

425
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,550
down we don't have time to
activate it for the observer to detect

426
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
activate it for the observer to detect
 

427
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,469
activate it for the observer to detect
it right so we need to somehow

428
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
it right so we need to somehow
 

429
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,270
it right so we need to somehow
lock this hopper as that happens and

430
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
lock this hopper as that happens and
 

431
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,950
lock this hopper as that happens and
then as soon as it picks up the water

432
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
then as soon as it picks up the water
 

433
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,670
then as soon as it picks up the water
again

434
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
again
 

435
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,510
again
then this unlocks and puts into the

436
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
then this unlocks and puts into the
 

437
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,510
then this unlocks and puts into the
chest

438
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
chest
 

439
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,790
chest
ah yeah so this is a little bit later

440
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
ah yeah so this is a little bit later
 

441
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,550
ah yeah so this is a little bit later
guys i've been fine-tuning this

442
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
guys i've been fine-tuning this
 

443
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,390
guys i've been fine-tuning this
trying to get it perfect working on the

444
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
trying to get it perfect working on the
 

445
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,390
trying to get it perfect working on the
timings of everything and i think it's

446
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
timings of everything and i think it's
 

447
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,510
timings of everything and i think it's
about

448
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
about
 

449
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,390
about
about good now uh this is basically a

450
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
about good now uh this is basically a
 

451
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,830
about good now uh this is basically a
hard drive in minecraft

452
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
hard drive in minecraft
 

453
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,589
hard drive in minecraft
if you guys aren't understanding exactly

454
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
if you guys aren't understanding exactly
 

455
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,029
if you guys aren't understanding exactly
what i'm doing here

456
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
what i'm doing here
 

457
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,070
what i'm doing here
so up here we have

458
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
so up here we have
 

459
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,629
so up here we have
eight bits of information or a byte a

460
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
eight bits of information or a byte a
 

461
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,550
eight bits of information or a byte a
one one zero one zero one

462
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
one one zero one zero one
 

463
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,950
one one zero one zero one
zero one what does that mean that means

464
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
zero one what does that mean that means
 

465
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,629
zero one what does that mean that means
nothing until we actually make it do

466
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
nothing until we actually make it do
 

467
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,350
nothing until we actually make it do
something

468
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
something
 

469
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,909
something
uh basically but our reader device is

470
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
uh basically but our reader device is
 

471
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,589
uh basically but our reader device is
able to read it

472
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
able to read it
 

473
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,270
able to read it
pretty much as fast as possible the

474
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
pretty much as fast as possible the
 

475
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,029
pretty much as fast as possible the
speed of hoppers

476
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
speed of hoppers
 

477
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,830
speed of hoppers
2.5 items can flow through a hopper per

478
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
2.5 items can flow through a hopper per
 

479
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,670
2.5 items can flow through a hopper per
second in minecraft

480
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
second in minecraft
 

481
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,430
second in minecraft
and that's how fast this can read it so

482
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
and that's how fast this can read it so
 

483
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,790
and that's how fast this can read it so
check this out we're going to unlock

484
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
check this out we're going to unlock
 

485
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,750
check this out we're going to unlock
this

486
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
this
 

487
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,589
this
also pay attention to the ordering

488
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
also pay attention to the ordering
 

489
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,190
also pay attention to the ordering
because we want to preserve that

490
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
because we want to preserve that
 

491
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:47,430
because we want to preserve that
as it goes through the reader

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440

 

493
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,790

so there we go and down here exact same

494
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
so there we go and down here exact same
 

495
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,710
so there we go and down here exact same
order as before all the waters back in

496
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
order as before all the waters back in
 

497
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,670

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,949
the buckets
which is also important now just because

500
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
which is also important now just because
 

501
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,790
which is also important now just because
we can read the information that quickly

502
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
we can read the information that quickly
 

503
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,389
we can read the information that quickly
with this doesn't mean we would always

504
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
with this doesn't mean we would always
 

505
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,910
with this doesn't mean we would always
want to a lot of times we probably just

506
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
want to a lot of times we probably just
 

507
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,030
want to a lot of times we probably just
want to let one bit

508
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
want to let one bit
 

509
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,509
want to let one bit
of information through at a time and

510
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
of information through at a time and
 

511
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,949
of information through at a time and
that's easy to do as well just do

512
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
that's easy to do as well just do
 

513
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,590
that's easy to do as well just do
something like this

514
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
something like this
 

515
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,350
something like this
you heard the water bucket go through

516
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
you heard the water bucket go through
 

517
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,430
you heard the water bucket go through
and that's where it is over there

518
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
and that's where it is over there
 

519
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,509
and that's where it is over there
so for my simon memory game for example

520
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
so for my simon memory game for example
 

521
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,110
so for my simon memory game for example
this is this is how i'm going to do it

522
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
this is this is how i'm going to do it
 

523
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,550
this is this is how i'm going to do it
i'm going to let one of the answers

524
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
i'm going to let one of the answers
 

525
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,790
i'm going to let one of the answers
through

526
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
through
 

527
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,230
through
and that's either going to display it on

528
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
and that's either going to display it on
 

529
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,230
and that's either going to display it on
the screen or it's going to check if my

530
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
the screen or it's going to check if my
 

531
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,630
the screen or it's going to check if my
input

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
input
 

533
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,990
input
matches red green blue or yellow we need

534
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
matches red green blue or yellow we need
 

535
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,710
matches red green blue or yellow we need
two bits of information to represent

536
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
two bits of information to represent
 

537
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,070
two bits of information to represent
uh one of the four choices

538
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
uh one of the four choices
 

539
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,070
uh one of the four choices
and this is also the key behind

540
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
and this is also the key behind
 

541
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,990
and this is also the key behind
computing if you didn't know that

542
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
computing if you didn't know that
 

543
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,630
computing if you didn't know that
so let's say we wanted to do math you

544
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
so let's say we wanted to do math you
 

545
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,150
so let's say we wanted to do math you
can add numbers together

546
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
can add numbers together
 

547
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,350
can add numbers together
binary um you can

548
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
binary um you can
 

549
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,430
binary um you can
we can use this for making musical

550
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440

readers might represent a single pixel

560
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
readers might represent a single pixel
 

561
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,310
readers might represent a single pixel
on that screen

562
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
on that screen
 

563
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,590
on that screen
and if we had 64 of the readers

564
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
and if we had 64 of the readers
 

565
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,550
and if we had 64 of the readers
we could update the display 2.5 frames

566
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
we could update the display 2.5 frames
 

567
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,190
we could update the display 2.5 frames
per second

568
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
per second
 

569
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,590

there like spruce wood sure
that's fine but if you have too much of

662
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
that's fine but if you have too much of
 

663
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,230
that's fine but if you have too much of
it like we have on that side of the

664
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
it like we have on that side of the
 

665
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,470
it like we have on that side of the
pyramid i think it looks really ugly

666
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
pyramid i think it looks really ugly
 

667
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,910
pyramid i think it looks really ugly
and i've seen other people's desert

668
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
and i've seen other people's desert
 

669
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,509
and i've seen other people's desert
builds and i honestly haven't really

670
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
builds and i honestly haven't really
 

671
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,069
builds and i honestly haven't really
liked

672
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
liked
 

673
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,350
liked
anything i've seen like no desert builds

674
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
anything i've seen like no desert builds
 

675
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,949
anything i've seen like no desert builds
it's just one of those themes i don't

676
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
it's just one of those themes i don't
 

677
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,509
it's just one of those themes i don't
think looks very good

678
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
think looks very good
 

679
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,509
think looks very good
but we'll try it out here so anything is

680
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
but we'll try it out here so anything is
 

681
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,790
but we'll try it out here so anything is
better than what we have here this is

682
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
better than what we have here this is
 

683
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,710
better than what we have here this is
just a big flat wall

684
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
just a big flat wall
 

685
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,750
just a big flat wall
we got to give it some personality so i

686
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
we got to give it some personality so i
 

687
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,949
we got to give it some personality so i
was figuring

688
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
was figuring
 

689
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,310
was figuring
i do kind of like the shape of those

690
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
i do kind of like the shape of those
 

691
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,990
i do kind of like the shape of those
gates and what we did there so maybe

692
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
gates and what we did there so maybe
 

693
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,069
gates and what we did there so maybe
we can try to mimic that style we're not

694
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
we can try to mimic that style we're not
 

695
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,030
we can try to mimic that style we're not
going to mix

696
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
going to mix
 

697
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,030
going to mix
really any wood in with this i don't

698
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
really any wood in with this i don't
 

699
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,870
really any wood in with this i don't
think we're going to try to give it

700
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
think we're going to try to give it
 

701
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,990
think we're going to try to give it
contrast using

702
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
contrast using
 

703
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,269
contrast using
shadows instead of different textures

704
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
shadows instead of different textures
 

705
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,269
shadows instead of different textures
like spruce wood

706
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
like spruce wood
 

707
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,190
like spruce wood
all right so maybe we bring the corner

708
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
all right so maybe we bring the corner
 

709
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,509
all right so maybe we bring the corner
out and we're going to do this castle

710
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
out and we're going to do this castle
 

711
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,310
out and we're going to do this castle
wall store

712
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
wall store
 

713
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,310
wall store
sort of style because that creates a lot

714
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
sort of style because that creates a lot
 

715
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,030
sort of style because that creates a lot
of shadows i think it looks cool

716
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
of shadows i think it looks cool
 

717
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,110
of shadows i think it looks cool
and maybe we will do a bit of arches

718
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
and maybe we will do a bit of arches
 

719
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,710
and maybe we will do a bit of arches
as well

720
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720

 

721
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,470

um actually let's let's bring this up

722
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
um actually let's let's bring this up
 

723
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,670
um actually let's let's bring this up
one more block

724
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
one more block
 

725
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,509
one more block
i want this corner to kind of stand out

726
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
i want this corner to kind of stand out
 

727
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,350
i want this corner to kind of stand out
a bit more

728
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
a bit more
 

729
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,550
a bit more
bring this up one more block like

730
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
bring this up one more block like
 

731
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,389
bring this up one more block like
so all right

732
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
so all right
 

733
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,269
so all right
and then let's try do an arch here

734
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279

 

735
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,190

okay yeah let's check this out so let's

736
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
okay yeah let's check this out so let's
 

737
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,350
okay yeah let's check this out so let's
take a step back

738
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
take a step back
 

739
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,590
take a step back
looks pretty plain ah man

740
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
looks pretty plain ah man
 

741
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,350
looks pretty plain ah man
okay how about how about we do a little

742
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
okay how about how about we do a little
 

743
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,790
okay how about how about we do a little
bit more with this corner let's bring it

744
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
bit more with this corner let's bring it
 

745
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,710
bit more with this corner let's bring it
out one more block

746
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
out one more block
 

747
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,230
out one more block
and maybe make it a bit wider like uh

748
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
and maybe make it a bit wider like uh
 

749
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,750
and maybe make it a bit wider like uh
five blocks five blocks one block out

750
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
five blocks five blocks one block out
 

751
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,590
five blocks five blocks one block out
try that out aha yes yes yes

752
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
try that out aha yes yes yes
 

753
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,590
try that out aha yes yes yes
so that's better right i think that's

754
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
so that's better right i think that's
 

755
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,790
so that's better right i think that's
better uh kind of a key concept of why

756
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
better uh kind of a key concept of why
 

757
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,350
better uh kind of a key concept of why
shaders look so good is it creates a lot

758
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
shaders look so good is it creates a lot
 

759
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,990
shaders look so good is it creates a lot
of different

760
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
of different
 

761
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,629
of different
shades shaders shades on a block right

762
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
shades shaders shades on a block right
 

763
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,269
shades shaders shades on a block right
and shadows likewise by building out

764
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
and shadows likewise by building out
 

765
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,030
and shadows likewise by building out
like this by bringing this forward one

766
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
like this by bringing this forward one
 

767
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,509
like this by bringing this forward one
block it creates a shadow over there

768
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
block it creates a shadow over there
 

769
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,910
block it creates a shadow over there
which adds contrast to the build and

770
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
which adds contrast to the build and
 

771
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,590
which adds contrast to the build and
same with the arch over top there now we

772
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
same with the arch over top there now we
 

773
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,910
same with the arch over top there now we
have

774
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
have
 

775
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,030
have
shadows on the wall there and it just by

776
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
shadows on the wall there and it just by
 

777
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,870
shadows on the wall there and it just by
having those variations it makes build

778
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
having those variations it makes build
 

779
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,949
having those variations it makes build
a lot better than a flat wall like we

780
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
a lot better than a flat wall like we
 

781
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,870
a lot better than a flat wall like we
had here originally

782
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
had here originally
 

783
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,990
had here originally
is is my concept anyway so i

784
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
is is my concept anyway so i
 

785
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,750
is is my concept anyway so i
realize this is about the same shape as

786
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
realize this is about the same shape as
 

787
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,350
realize this is about the same shape as
one of those corner things

788
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
one of those corner things
 

789
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,310
one of those corner things
over there actually so let's duplicate

790
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
over there actually so let's duplicate
 

791
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,069
over there actually so let's duplicate
oh we fall down again

792
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
oh we fall down again
 

793
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,310
oh we fall down again
let's duplicate what we did there so i

794
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
let's duplicate what we did there so i
 

795
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,750
let's duplicate what we did there so i
think it's these two blocks

796
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
think it's these two blocks
 

797
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,790
think it's these two blocks
are stairs i'm gonna fall again i can

798
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
are stairs i'm gonna fall again i can
 

799
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,910
are stairs i'm gonna fall again i can
feel it

800
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
feel it
 

801
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,949
feel it
turn these into stairs

802
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
turn these into stairs
 

803
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,189
turn these into stairs
nope not that way and that way we have

804
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
nope not that way and that way we have
 

805
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,389
nope not that way and that way we have
uh sort of

806
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
uh sort of
 

807
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,069
uh sort of
a running theme throughout this build as

808
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
a running theme throughout this build as
 

809
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,750
a running theme throughout this build as
well because it's kind of copying what

810
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
well because it's kind of copying what
 

811
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,430
well because it's kind of copying what
we did there

812
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
we did there
 

813
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,110
we did there
okay and then i think it's at this level

814
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
okay and then i think it's at this level
 

815
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,189
okay and then i think it's at this level
we had a stair that going this way

816
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
we had a stair that going this way
 

817
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,069
we had a stair that going this way
and we'll break this off this gives it

818
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
and we'll break this off this gives it
 

819
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,750
and we'll break this off this gives it
way more personality that way

820
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
way more personality that way
 

821
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,910
way more personality that way
and there so i think that'll look pretty

822
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
and there so i think that'll look pretty
 

823
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,790
and there so i think that'll look pretty
good

824
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
good
 

825
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,750
good
um we might remove blocks here as well

826
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
um we might remove blocks here as well
 

827
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,790
um we might remove blocks here as well
kind of like we have

828
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
kind of like we have
 

829
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,829
kind of like we have
over there okay

830
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
over there okay
 

831
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,870
over there okay
and then let's maybe try

832
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
and then let's maybe try
 

833
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,629
and then let's maybe try
just so it's not like an arch and then

834
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
just so it's not like an arch and then
 

835
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,069
just so it's not like an arch and then
an arch and an arch let's

836
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
an arch and an arch let's
 

837
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,829
an arch and an arch let's
let's break it up we'll do something

838
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
let's break it up we'll do something
 

839
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,350
let's break it up we'll do something
like this

840
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
like this
 

841
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,750
like this
a little short little piece and then

842
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
a little short little piece and then
 

843
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,310
a little short little piece and then
another arch over here

844
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
another arch over here
 

845
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,910
another arch over here
and in between here we might put some

846
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
and in between here we might put some
 

847
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,949
and in between here we might put some
birchwood

848
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959

 

849
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,069

right over here right nope wrong way

850
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
right over here right nope wrong way
 

851
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,670
right over here right nope wrong way
okay okay you gotta be careful when

852
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
okay okay you gotta be careful when
 

853
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,870
okay okay you gotta be careful when
you're building not to have

854
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
you're building not to have
 

855
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,710
you're building not to have
too much of a repeating pattern you want

856
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
too much of a repeating pattern you want
 

857
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,629
too much of a repeating pattern you want
to break it up a little bit

858
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
to break it up a little bit
 

859
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,230
to break it up a little bit
that way it stays interesting and

860
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
that way it stays interesting and
 

861
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,910
that way it stays interesting and
finish up the top here and then we'll

862
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
finish up the top here and then we'll
 

863
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,829
finish up the top here and then we'll
check it out

864
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
check it out
 

865
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,870
check it out
okay and there we go let's go take a

866
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
okay and there we go let's go take a
 

867
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,790
okay and there we go let's go take a
look

868
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
look
 

869
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,150
look
and we're going to try to do this on

870
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
and we're going to try to do this on
 

871
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,110
and we're going to try to do this on
each of the layers

872
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120

 

873
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,310

okay that's kind of cool we got to get

874
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
okay that's kind of cool we got to get
 

875
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,910
okay that's kind of cool we got to get
rid of the blocks over there though i

876
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
rid of the blocks over there though i
 

877
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,030
rid of the blocks over there though i
think that's messing up the look a

878
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
think that's messing up the look a
 

879
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,150
think that's messing up the look a
little bit

880
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
little bit
 

881
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,470
little bit
also i feel like we need something up at

882
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
also i feel like we need something up at
 

883
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,110
also i feel like we need something up at
the top there it's pretty plain still

884
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
the top there it's pretty plain still
 

885
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,749
the top there it's pretty plain still
how about if we replace these with

886
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
how about if we replace these with
 

887
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,350
how about if we replace these with
stairs

888
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360

 

889
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,749

do something like that maybe that'll be

890
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
do something like that maybe that'll be
 

891
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,509
do something like that maybe that'll be
cool

892
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
cool
 

893
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,350
cool
or maybe we need to bring a line forward

894
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
or maybe we need to bring a line forward
 

895
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,790
or maybe we need to bring a line forward
like you know what i mean like run some

896
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
like you know what i mean like run some
 

897
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,870
like you know what i mean like run some
blocks like over top

898
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
blocks like over top
 

899
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,990
blocks like over top
here and run a line

900
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000

 

901
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,749

we'll try this first okay

902
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
we'll try this first okay
 

903
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,949
we'll try this first okay
oh i'm seeing a lot of faces now looks

904
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
oh i'm seeing a lot of faces now looks
 

905
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,269
oh i'm seeing a lot of faces now looks
like they're angry

906
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
like they're angry
 

907
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,350
like they're angry
all right so check it out guys i did uh

908
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
all right so check it out guys i did uh
 

909
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,350
all right so check it out guys i did uh
one layer here one side of the pyramid

910
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
one layer here one side of the pyramid
 

911
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,790
one layer here one side of the pyramid
one layer

912
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
one layer
 

913
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,670
one layer
it's got a lot left to do but i think

914
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
it's got a lot left to do but i think
 

915
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,949
it's got a lot left to do but i think
that's probably what we'll run with i

916
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
that's probably what we'll run with i
 

917
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,189
that's probably what we'll run with i
think that's fine i'm okay with that

918
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
think that's fine i'm okay with that
 

919
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,430
think that's fine i'm okay with that
uh it's still pretty much just sandstone

920
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
uh it's still pretty much just sandstone
 

921
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,629
uh it's still pretty much just sandstone
up there right i got a little bit of

922
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
up there right i got a little bit of
 

923
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,509
up there right i got a little bit of
birchwood

924
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
birchwood
 

925
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,990
birchwood
fences mixed in too but it's pretty much

926
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
fences mixed in too but it's pretty much
 

927
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,749
fences mixed in too but it's pretty much
the sandstone but

928
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
the sandstone but
 

929
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,150
the sandstone but
by bringing it forward and creating

930
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
by bringing it forward and creating
 

931
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,829
by bringing it forward and creating
arches and stuff it creates all kinds of

932
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
arches and stuff it creates all kinds of
 

933
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,509
arches and stuff it creates all kinds of
contrast

934
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
contrast
 

935
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,189
contrast
and the wall looks pretty crazy now

936
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
and the wall looks pretty crazy now
 

937
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,069
and the wall looks pretty crazy now
maybe a bit too crazy even

938
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
maybe a bit too crazy even
 

939
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,470
maybe a bit too crazy even
but i think i'm okay with that so i did

940
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
but i think i'm okay with that so i did
 

941
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,230
but i think i'm okay with that so i did
not like the eyes that were being made

942
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
not like the eyes that were being made
 

943
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,629
not like the eyes that were being made
so i

944
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
so i
 

945
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,470
so i
i moved those little little pivots a bit

946
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
i moved those little little pivots a bit
 

947
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,150
i moved those little little pivots a bit
and i actually tried to make a pattern

948
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
and i actually tried to make a pattern
 

949
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,110
and i actually tried to make a pattern
with them so it goes up like a wave

950
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
with them so it goes up like a wave
 

951
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,870
with them so it goes up like a wave
uh sort of thing i did the same thing on

952
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
uh sort of thing i did the same thing on
 

953
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,549
uh sort of thing i did the same thing on
these uh gates

954
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
these uh gates
 

955
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,390
these uh gates
uh i think that's a key concept don't

956
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
uh i think that's a key concept don't
 

957
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,069
uh i think that's a key concept don't
just do random try to create

958
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
just do random try to create
 

959
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,549
just do random try to create
patterns for the eyes to pick up on like

960
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
patterns for the eyes to pick up on like
 

961
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,829
patterns for the eyes to pick up on like
you see up there i got like an

962
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
you see up there i got like an
 

963
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,949
you see up there i got like an
arching pattern goes up and around same

964
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
arching pattern goes up and around same
 

965
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,069
arching pattern goes up and around same
with over there go

966
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
with over there go
 

967
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,870
with over there go
it goes up and around it's not just like

968
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
it goes up and around it's not just like
 

969
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,549
it goes up and around it's not just like
random chiseled blocks all over the

970
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
random chiseled blocks all over the
 

971
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,430
random chiseled blocks all over the
place

972
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
place
 

973
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,390
place
so now we oh i'm stuck in the reeds so

974
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
so now we oh i'm stuck in the reeds so
 

975
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,150
so now we oh i'm stuck in the reeds so
now we have a bit of a pattern on

976
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
now we have a bit of a pattern on
 

977
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,510
now we have a bit of a pattern on
on the wall there too which i think is a

978
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
on the wall there too which i think is a
 

979
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,390
on the wall there too which i think is a
good idea

980
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
good idea
 

981
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,669
good idea
a lot of times when people do uh

982
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
a lot of times when people do uh
 

983
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,110
a lot of times when people do uh
these uh sand builds sandstone builds

984
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
these uh sand builds sandstone builds
 

985
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,870
these uh sand builds sandstone builds
they mix in buttons maybe we'll try that

986
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
they mix in buttons maybe we'll try that
 

987
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,990
they mix in buttons maybe we'll try that
too i don't know if

988
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
too i don't know if
 

989
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,350
too i don't know if
we'll roll with that but just to try it

990
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
we'll roll with that but just to try it
 

991
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,870
we'll roll with that but just to try it
but usually they put them at the top

992
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
but usually they put them at the top
 

993
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,270
but usually they put them at the top
there

994
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280

1001
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,909

might be better like oh over here

1002
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919

 

1003
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,990

1007
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,830
now
okay at the very least here we should

1008
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
okay at the very least here we should
 

1009
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,070
okay at the very least here we should

1010
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
also mix in some smooth stone and some
 

1011
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,710

block so we haven't done that yet so

1014
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
block so we haven't done that yet so
 

1015
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,070

probably

1016
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
probably
 

1017
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,070

at the bottom here we i want some

1018
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
at the bottom here we i want some
 

1019
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,630
at the bottom here we i want some
chiseleds and then smooth and chiseled

1020
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
chiseleds and then smooth and chiseled
 

1021
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,230
chiseleds and then smooth and chiseled
we'll do that pattern i think that'll

1022
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
we'll do that pattern i think that'll
 

1023
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,950
we'll do that pattern i think that'll
make it look quite a bit better

1024
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
make it look quite a bit better
 

1025
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,029

before i do the other three sides here

1056
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
before i do the other three sides here
 

1057
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,470
before i do the other three sides here
um overall i'm pretty happy with this

1058
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
um overall i'm pretty happy with this
 

1059
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,070
um overall i'm pretty happy with this
but i feel like it does need some

1060
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
but i feel like it does need some
 

1061
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,190
but i feel like it does need some
changes still right

1062
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
changes still right
 

1063
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,070
changes still right
there's a i know there's something not

1064
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
there's a i know there's something not
 

1065
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,470
there's a i know there's something not
quite right about it still

1066
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
quite right about it still
 

1067
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,390
quite right about it still
for one thing i think it needs a top

1068
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
for one thing i think it needs a top
 

1069
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,390
for one thing i think it needs a top
right something that stands out that's

1070
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
right something that stands out that's
 

1071
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,070
right something that stands out that's
not the same repeating pattern something

1072
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
not the same repeating pattern something
 

1073
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,510
not the same repeating pattern something
that's different

1074
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
that's different
 

1075
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,830
that's different
kind of like a highlight i also feel

1076
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
kind of like a highlight i also feel
 

1077
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,510
kind of like a highlight i also feel
like maybe we have too many of these

1078
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
like maybe we have too many of these
 

1079
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,830
like maybe we have too many of these
indents when you see them all

1080
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
indents when you see them all
 

1081
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,310
indents when you see them all
like all the all the sides done here all

1082
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
like all the all the sides done here all
 

1083
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,909
like all the all the sides done here all
the layers

1084
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
the layers
 

1085
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,990
the layers
there's a lot of them it looks like

1086
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
there's a lot of them it looks like
 

1087
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,270
there's a lot of them it looks like
there's at least 30

1088
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
there's at least 30
 

1089
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,510
there's at least 30
or so of them and it's kind of chaotic

1090
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
or so of them and it's kind of chaotic
 

1091
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,110
or so of them and it's kind of chaotic
maybe a bit too much

1092
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
maybe a bit too much
 

1093
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,310
maybe a bit too much
but i'll see what you guys say about

1094
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
but i'll see what you guys say about
 

1095
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,990
but i'll see what you guys say about
that as well maybe we need to remove a

1096
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
that as well maybe we need to remove a
 

1097
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,669
that as well maybe we need to remove a
few of them though

1098
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
few of them though
 

1099
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,390
few of them though
or or change it uh possibly we need to

1100
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
or or change it uh possibly we need to
 

1101
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,149
or or change it uh possibly we need to
break up the pattern a bit more too

1102
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
break up the pattern a bit more too
 

1103
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,990
break up the pattern a bit more too
like have a line that runs down the

1104
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
like have a line that runs down the
 

1105
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,270
like have a line that runs down the
middle perhaps that

1106
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
middle perhaps that
 

1107
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,669
middle perhaps that
kind of sticks out or put more of these

1108
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
kind of sticks out or put more of these
 

1109
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,830
kind of sticks out or put more of these
towers

1110
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:13,840
towers
 

1111
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,710
towers
in it or maybe windows of some sort i'm

1112
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
in it or maybe windows of some sort i'm
 

1113
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,990
in it or maybe windows of some sort i'm
not sure exactly

1114
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
not sure exactly
 

1115
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,149
not sure exactly
i want to see what you guys thoughts are

1116
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
i want to see what you guys thoughts are
 

1117
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,350
i want to see what you guys thoughts are
on that

1118
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
on that
 

1119
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,870
on that
um something i'm going to do here though

1120
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
um something i'm going to do here though
 

1121
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,310
um something i'm going to do here though
i want to make it look like sand is

1122
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
i want to make it look like sand is
 

1123
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,149
i want to make it look like sand is
blown up alongside the building here and

1124
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
blown up alongside the building here and
 

1125
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,590
blown up alongside the building here and
settled

1126
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
settled
 

1127
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,430
settled
so it's kind of uh

1128
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440

 

1129
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,750

kind of going up on the side here right

1130
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
kind of going up on the side here right
 

1131
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,350
kind of going up on the side here right
um we'll do that

1132
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
um we'll do that
 

1133
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,630
um we'll do that
also we should get rid of all

1134
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
also we should get rid of all
 

1135
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,149
also we should get rid of all
all the grass around the building here

1136
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
all the grass around the building here
 

1137
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,549
all the grass around the building here
it's kind of taking away from it

1138
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
it's kind of taking away from it
 

1139
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,669
it's kind of taking away from it
and something we're not really gonna see

1140
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
and something we're not really gonna see
 

1141
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,669
and something we're not really gonna see
too often but if we're ever flying we

1142
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
too often but if we're ever flying we
 

1143
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,510
too often but if we're ever flying we
might catch a glimpse of it

1144
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
might catch a glimpse of it
 

1145
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,750
might catch a glimpse of it
uh like all the building we did over

1146
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
uh like all the building we did over
 

1147
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,270
uh like all the building we did over
there you see how there's birch

1148
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
there you see how there's birch
 

1149
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,750
there you see how there's birch
wood at the top of the the wall there

1150
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
wood at the top of the the wall there
 

1151
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,190
wood at the top of the the wall there
and on top of those gates there's

1152
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
and on top of those gates there's
 

1153
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,909
and on top of those gates there's
birchwood

1154
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
birchwood
 

1155
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,909
birchwood
we should replace the sandstone here

1156
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
we should replace the sandstone here
 

1157
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,270
we should replace the sandstone here
with birchwood as well

1158
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
with birchwood as well
 

1159
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,350
with birchwood as well
i think that'll help give it a bit more

1160
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
i think that'll help give it a bit more
 

1161
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,310
i think that'll help give it a bit more
color

1162
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
color
 

1163
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,270
color
a bit more texture and also this is

1164
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
a bit more texture and also this is
 

1165
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,789
a bit more texture and also this is
where we're going to hide the lighting i

1166
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
where we're going to hide the lighting i
 

1167
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,789
where we're going to hide the lighting i
think so if we want to light up the

1168
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
think so if we want to light up the
 

1169
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,430
think so if we want to light up the
the pyramid here put it in the floor and

1170
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
the pyramid here put it in the floor and
 

1171
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,710
the pyramid here put it in the floor and
you won't be able to see it from down

1172
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
you won't be able to see it from down
 

1173
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,669
you won't be able to see it from down
below

1174
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
below
 

1175
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,950
below
so i think that's a good spot for it one

1176
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
so i think that's a good spot for it one
 

1177
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,470
so i think that's a good spot for it one
other idea

1178
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
other idea
 

1179
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,710
other idea
possibly mix in some birch leaves

1180
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
possibly mix in some birch leaves
 

1181
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,590
possibly mix in some birch leaves
i don't know like if we have a vines of

1182
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
i don't know like if we have a vines of
 

1183
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,110
i don't know like if we have a vines of
this running down it'll help break up

1184
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
this running down it'll help break up
 

1185
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,190
this running down it'll help break up
the look of the whole thing

1186
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
the look of the whole thing
 

1187
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,950
the look of the whole thing
is there any other block we can do that

1188
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
is there any other block we can do that
 

1189
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,549
is there any other block we can do that
with

1190
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
with
 

1191
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,830
with
like leaves are kind of the the one and

1192
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
like leaves are kind of the the one and
 

1193
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,870
like leaves are kind of the the one and
only block i know

1194
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
only block i know
 

1195
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,909
only block i know
that does this right

1196
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
that does this right
 

1197
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,549
that does this right
kind of like that vines

1198
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559

 

1199
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,190

oh that's very straight there but you

1200
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
oh that's very straight there but you
 

1201
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,270
oh that's very straight there but you
get the idea

1202
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
get the idea
 

1203
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,870
get the idea
it looks pretty bad i think

1204
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
it looks pretty bad i think
 

1205
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,990
it looks pretty bad i think
maybe we won't do that but uh

1206
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
maybe we won't do that but uh
 

1207
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,630
maybe we won't do that but uh
yeah i thought i'd tried it anyways oh i

1208
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
yeah i thought i'd tried it anyways oh i
 

1209
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,630
yeah i thought i'd tried it anyways oh i
have an idea

1210
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
have an idea
 

1211
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,950
have an idea
let's try something here i just realized

1212
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
let's try something here i just realized
 

1213
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,630
let's try something here i just realized
melon blocks kind of look like

1214
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
melon blocks kind of look like
 

1215
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,310
melon blocks kind of look like
they could be cactuses right cacti

1216
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
they could be cactuses right cacti
 

1217
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,789
they could be cactuses right cacti
we need we need some more decorations in

1218
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
we need we need some more decorations in
 

1219
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,110
we need we need some more decorations in
our sandy city here so maybe cacti are

1220
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
our sandy city here so maybe cacti are
 

1221
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,470
our sandy city here so maybe cacti are
the way to go

1222
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
the way to go
 

1223
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,270
the way to go
but just normal cactus plants don't look

1224
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
but just normal cactus plants don't look
 

1225
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,710
but just normal cactus plants don't look
very good i find

1226
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
very good i find
 

1227
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,310
very good i find
because uh they can't branch out like

1228
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
because uh they can't branch out like
 

1229
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,909
because uh they can't branch out like
this right that's that's the main issue

1230
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
this right that's that's the main issue
 

1231
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,630
this right that's that's the main issue
with them

1232
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
with them
 

1233
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,710
with them
let's go ahead and try uh make a

1234
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
let's go ahead and try uh make a
 

1235
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,950
let's go ahead and try uh make a
standard cactus so maybe it goes up like

1236
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
standard cactus so maybe it goes up like
 

1237
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,590
standard cactus so maybe it goes up like
that

1238
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,600
that
 

1239
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,270
that
actually we should make this bigger

1240
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
actually we should make this bigger
 

1241
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,710
actually we should make this bigger
right

1242
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
right
 

1243
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,549
right
let's make it go up one more block

1244
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559

 

1245
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,310

like so and then

1246
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320

 

1247
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,950

where should we do it let's do it here

1248
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
where should we do it let's do it here
 

1249
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,310
where should we do it let's do it here
that'll come out there and then you want

1250
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
that'll come out there and then you want
 

1251
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,110
that'll come out there and then you want
to go one block

1252
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
to go one block
 

1253
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,950
to go one block
lower and then this goes up

1254
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
lower and then this goes up
 

1255
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,430
lower and then this goes up
and then we will put maybe a flower pot

1256
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
and then we will put maybe a flower pot
 

1257
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,510
and then we will put maybe a flower pot
on top to look like a flower

1258
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
on top to look like a flower
 

1259
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,710
on top to look like a flower
you know how they get the pink flowers

1260
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
you know how they get the pink flowers
 

1261
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,789
you know how they get the pink flowers
it needs a sombrero too on top of here

1262
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
it needs a sombrero too on top of here
 

1263
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,029
it needs a sombrero too on top of here
maybe

1264
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
maybe
 

1265
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,789
maybe
okay well let's let's try this out for

1266
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
okay well let's let's try this out for
 

1267
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,390
okay well let's let's try this out for
right now

1268
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
right now
 

1269
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,470
right now
does that look like a cactus question

1270
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480

 

1271
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,310

i think you could pull it off it kind of

1272
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
i think you could pull it off it kind of
 

1273
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,830
i think you could pull it off it kind of
looks a little bit goofy with too

1274
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
looks a little bit goofy with too
 

1275
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,350
looks a little bit goofy with too
too long arms like that though maybe

1276
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
too long arms like that though maybe
 

1277
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,669
too long arms like that though maybe
this should be smaller no that looks bad

1278
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
this should be smaller no that looks bad
 

1279
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:31,029
this should be smaller no that looks bad
that looks bad hmm

1280
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,039

 

1281
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,110

nope yeah maybe it was right the first

1282
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
nope yeah maybe it was right the first
 

1283
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,029
nope yeah maybe it was right the first
time i'm not sure

1284
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039
time i'm not sure
 

1285
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,350
time i'm not sure
now it still doesn't look quite right

1286
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
now it still doesn't look quite right
 

1287
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,230
now it still doesn't look quite right
anyways

1288
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
anyways
 

1289
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,070
anyways
there's an idea i think that'll work

1290
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
there's an idea i think that'll work
 

1291
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,669
there's an idea i think that'll work
actually it's a pretty good texture for

1292
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
actually it's a pretty good texture for
 

1293
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,149
actually it's a pretty good texture for
cactus i think

1294
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
cactus i think
 

1295
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,390
cactus i think
all right another thing i was thinking

1296
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
all right another thing i was thinking
 

1297
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,710
all right another thing i was thinking
of maybe we can try

1298
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
of maybe we can try
 

1299
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,190
of maybe we can try
put some flower pots on the on the walls

1300
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
put some flower pots on the on the walls
 

1301
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,549
put some flower pots on the on the walls
here to decorate i don't know if you'd

1302
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
here to decorate i don't know if you'd
 

1303
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,310
here to decorate i don't know if you'd
be able to see it from down below

1304
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
be able to see it from down below
 

1305
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,230
be able to see it from down below
but we have like these archways right i

1306
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,240
but we have like these archways right i
 

1307
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,590
but we have like these archways right i
feel like we should put something

1308
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
feel like we should put something
 

1309
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,669
feel like we should put something
in them or possibly we do like a

1310
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
in them or possibly we do like a
 

1311
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,789
in them or possibly we do like a
cauldron

1312
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
cauldron
 

1313
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,830
cauldron
plant so like you do that and then you

1314
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
plant so like you do that and then you
 

1315
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,590
plant so like you do that and then you
put uh

1316
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
put uh
 

1317
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,669
put uh
maybe spruce wood would be better oh it

1318
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
maybe spruce wood would be better oh it
 

1319
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,029
maybe spruce wood would be better oh it
kind of connects to the walls of that

1320
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
kind of connects to the walls of that
 

1321
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,149
kind of connects to the walls of that
sucks

1322
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
sucks
 

1323
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,390
sucks
could put a stair there though

1324
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
could put a stair there though
 

1325
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,710
could put a stair there though
no that's not gonna work not enough

1326
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
no that's not gonna work not enough
 

1327
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,230
no that's not gonna work not enough
space there it would have to be brought

1328
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
space there it would have to be brought
 

1329
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,630
space there it would have to be brought
out

1330
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:22,640
out
 

1331
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,630
out
one like over here

1332
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
one like over here
 

1333
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,269
one like over here
do that and then you probably want at

1334
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
do that and then you probably want at
 

1335
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,390
do that and then you probably want at
least two leaves

1336
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
least two leaves
 

1337
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,830
least two leaves
that's not gonna look very good i don't

1338
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
that's not gonna look very good i don't
 

1339
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,590
that's not gonna look very good i don't
think probably can't see this stuff from

1340
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
think probably can't see this stuff from
 

1341
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:35,990
think probably can't see this stuff from
that

1342
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
that
 

1343
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,830
that
down below yeah it just looks like two

1344
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
down below yeah it just looks like two
 

1345
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,470
down below yeah it just looks like two
leaf blocks

1346
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
leaf blocks
 

1347
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,470
leaf blocks
can't see the flower pots at all down

1348
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
can't see the flower pots at all down
 

1349

okay so we're over here at the
 

1385
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,470
okay so we're over here at the
stronghold base now i don't go here too

1386
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
stronghold base now i don't go here too
 

1387
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,830
stronghold base now i don't go here too
often so some of you might

1388
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
often so some of you might
 

1389
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,950
often so some of you might
have never seen this even this is a very

1390
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
have never seen this even this is a very
 

1391
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,190
have never seen this even this is a very
old part of our world

1392
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
old part of our world
 

1393
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,190
old part of our world
which was going to be like my main base

1394
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
which was going to be like my main base
 

1395
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,710
which was going to be like my main base
that was the plan for a long time but

1396
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
that was the plan for a long time but
 

1397
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,430
that was the plan for a long time but
then it just never really worked out

1398
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
then it just never really worked out
 

1399
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,190
then it just never really worked out
and i think i got distracted with stuff

1400
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
and i think i got distracted with stuff
 

1401
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,430
and i think i got distracted with stuff
i'm not sure there's not a lot here

1402
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440
i'm not sure there's not a lot here
 

1403
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,750
i'm not sure there's not a lot here
like we started building a storage room

1404
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
like we started building a storage room
 

1405
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,950
like we started building a storage room
system here

1406
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
system here
 

1407
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,909
system here
obviously this is way outdated i would

1408
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
obviously this is way outdated i would
 

1409
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,430
obviously this is way outdated i would
never finish that

1410
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
never finish that
 

1411
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,029
never finish that
so probably most of stuff on the sides

1412
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039
so probably most of stuff on the sides
 

1413
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,430
so probably most of stuff on the sides
would get torn out and redone

1414
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
would get torn out and redone
 

1415
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,870
would get torn out and redone
um there's a silverfish farm here which

1416
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
um there's a silverfish farm here which
 

1417
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,750
um there's a silverfish farm here which
is actually a pretty cool thing i think

1418
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
is actually a pretty cool thing i think
 

1419
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,710
is actually a pretty cool thing i think
and

1420
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
and
 

1421
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,710
and
what else this is where our portal to

1422
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
what else this is where our portal to
 

1423
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,470
what else this is where our portal to
the end is

1424
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
the end is
 

1425
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,549
the end is
um believe it or not i actually thought

1426
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
um believe it or not i actually thought
 

1427
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,510
um believe it or not i actually thought
this looked good

1428
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520
this looked good
 

1429
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,870
this looked good
back in the day i thought this was a

1430
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
back in the day i thought this was a
 

1431
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,510
back in the day i thought this was a
very good build now when i see it it

1432
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
very good build now when i see it it
 

1433
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,029
very good build now when i see it it
makes my eyes bleed the only thing

1434
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
makes my eyes bleed the only thing
 

1435
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,510
makes my eyes bleed the only thing
the only real good quality of this is uh

1436
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
the only real good quality of this is uh
 

1437
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,350
the only real good quality of this is uh
these tiles on the walls

1438
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
these tiles on the walls
 

1439
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,830
these tiles on the walls
i think that's a cool cool little trick

1440

i think that's a cool cool little trick
 

1441
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,470
i think that's a cool cool little trick
i noticed a lot of people use this too

1442
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
i noticed a lot of people use this too
 

1443
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,590
i noticed a lot of people use this too
in their builds um

1444
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
in their builds um
 

1445
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,909
in their builds um
but beyond that most of the space is

1446
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
but beyond that most of the space is
 

1447
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,950
but beyond that most of the space is
pretty bad

1448
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
pretty bad
 

1449
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,710
pretty bad
up above though there's something

1450
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
up above though there's something
 

1451
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,110
up above though there's something
important there's the mob system

1452
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
important there's the mob system
 

1453
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,830
important there's the mob system
uh the plan was to make a bomb factory

1454
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
uh the plan was to make a bomb factory
 

1455
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,110
uh the plan was to make a bomb factory
where you make a skeleton

1456
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
where you make a skeleton
 

1457
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,029
where you make a skeleton
shoot a creeper and then when you

1458
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
shoot a creeper and then when you
 

1459
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,549
shoot a creeper and then when you
combine the skeleton with the creeper

1460
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
combine the skeleton with the creeper
 

1461
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,909

they blow up

1462
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
they blow up
 

1463
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,590
they blow up

still
 

1469
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,909
still
possibly might do that i would like to

1470
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
possibly might do that i would like to
 

1471
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,870
possibly might do that i would like to
the big problem i had a lot with this

1472
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
the big problem i had a lot with this
 

1473
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,070
the big problem i had a lot with this
build

1474

was uh controlling the mob ai

1476
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
was uh controlling the mob ai
 

1477
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,350
was uh controlling the mob ai
it was very difficult to make a creeper

1478
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
it was very difficult to make a creeper
 

1479
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,789
it was very difficult to make a creeper
sorter using

1480

the kitty cats it wasn't very reliable i

1482
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
the kitty cats it wasn't very reliable i
 

1483
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,430
the kitty cats it wasn't very reliable i
would build it it would work in creative

1484
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
would build it it would work in creative
 

1485
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,630
would build it it would work in creative
and then when i tried out here it

1486
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
and then when i tried out here it
 

1487
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,950
and then when i tried out here it
