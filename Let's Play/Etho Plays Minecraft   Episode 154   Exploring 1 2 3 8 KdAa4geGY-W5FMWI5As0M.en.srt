i'm not going to go over all the details

20
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
i'm not going to go over all the details
 

21
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,790
i'm not going to go over all the details
of the patch maybe just a few

22
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
of the patch maybe just a few
 

23
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,790
of the patch maybe just a few
mostly the ones i'm interested in and

24
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
mostly the ones i'm interested in and
 

25
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,190
mostly the ones i'm interested in and
also how they affect my world

26
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
also how they affect my world

here so one thing i was very curious

28
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
here so one thing i was very curious
 

29
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,549
here so one thing i was very curious
about is the enderman farm

30
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559

 

31
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,310

still very loud i was worried the rates

32
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
still very loud i was worried the rates
 

33
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,750
still very loud i was worried the rates
were going to get cut in half

34
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
were going to get cut in half
 

35
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,389
were going to get cut in half
from the new patch because the height

36
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
from the new patch because the height
 

37
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:56,950
from the new patch because the height
increased

38
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
increased
 

39
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,310
increased
to twice as much um

40
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
to twice as much um
 

41
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,910
to twice as much um
so that means the game would have to

42
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
so that means the game would have to
 

43
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,229
so that means the game would have to
check

44
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239

 

45
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,230

or have twice as many chances of

46
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
or have twice as many chances of
 

47
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,230
or have twice as many chances of
cancelling out when placing a mob

48
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240

 

49
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,990

which should cut the rates in half but

50
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
which should cut the rates in half but
 

51
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,750
which should cut the rates in half but
they seem to have changed the mob

52
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
they seem to have changed the mob
 

53
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,749
they seem to have changed the mob
spawning so this is still working

54
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
spawning so this is still working
 

55
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,590
spawning so this is still working
very quickly which is good for me

56
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
very quickly which is good for me
 

57
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,950
very quickly which is good for me
still getting good rates

58
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960

 

59
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,550

um i don't know exactly how the new

60
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
um i don't know exactly how the new
 

61
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,950
um i don't know exactly how the new
mob spawning works we'll have to figure

62
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
mob spawning works we'll have to figure
 

63
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,270
mob spawning works we'll have to figure
that out

64
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
that out
 

65
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,270
that out
but uh seems to be pretty good still

66
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280

 

67
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,789

it's definitely changed though that's

68
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
it's definitely changed though that's
 

69
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,630
it's definitely changed though that's
for sure

70
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
for sure
 

71
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,749
for sure
um i think what we're gonna do now we're

72
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
um i think what we're gonna do now we're
 

73
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,429
um i think what we're gonna do now we're
gonna head

74
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
gonna head
 

75
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,550
gonna head
back to the main world and we will maybe

76
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
back to the main world and we will maybe
 

77
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,469
back to the main world and we will maybe
play around with a few different things

78
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479

 

79
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,630

they want it even the little ones want
it and you can't give it to them

94
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
it and you can't give it to them
 

95
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,030
it and you can't give it to them
or or you click them a bunch of times

96
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
or or you click them a bunch of times
 

97
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,229
or or you click them a bunch of times
and it won't work and then

break down the whole thing for materials

366
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
break down the whole thing for materials
 

367
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,909
break down the whole thing for materials
because

368
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
because
 

369
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,750
because
i don't know it's it's a mess that one

370
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
i don't know it's it's a mess that one
 

371
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,430
i don't know it's it's a mess that one
it really is

372
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
it really is
 

373
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,110
it really is
i was thinking about maybe trying to

374
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
i was thinking about maybe trying to
 

375
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,509
i was thinking about maybe trying to
restore it and getting villagers down

376
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
restore it and getting villagers down
 

377
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,630
restore it and getting villagers down
there or something

378
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
there or something
 

379
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,030
there or something
to live but it's not a nice stronghold

380
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
to live but it's not a nice stronghold
 

381
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,829
to live but it's not a nice stronghold
really

382
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839

383
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,509
really
so maybe if we find another one we'll do

384
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
so maybe if we find another one we'll do
 

385
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,070
so maybe if we find another one we'll do
that oh i'm still on short

and every time i've well i found one

560
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
and every time i've well i found one
 

561
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,069
and every time i've well i found one
other set

562
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
other set
 

563
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,790
other set
but i didn't have any bones so i guess

564
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
but i didn't have any bones so i guess
 

565
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,870
but i didn't have any bones so i guess
that's the second pack i found

566
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
that's the second pack i found
 

567
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,629
that's the second pack i found
and again i don't have any bones so

568
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
and again i don't have any bones so
 

569
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,269
and again i don't have any bones so
they're probably going to disappear

570
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279

 

571
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,629

now to get a better view and it's just

634
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
now to get a better view and it's just
 

635
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,110

everywhere huge snow biome
 

639
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,910
everywhere huge snow biome
and it's getting pretty hilly up ahead

640
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
and it's getting pretty hilly up ahead
 

641
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,710
and it's getting pretty hilly up ahead
there but

i still see snow a little bit of forest
 

645
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,949
i still see snow a little bit of forest
that way so maybe we'll

646
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
that way so maybe we'll
 

647
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,350
that way so maybe we'll
head that way and hope for some smaller

648
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
head that way and hope for some smaller
 

649
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,550
head that way and hope for some smaller
my homes or something

650
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
my homes or something
 

651
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,430

653
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,430

this is where we are that's pointing

654
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
this is where we are that's pointing
 

655
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,470
this is where we are that's pointing
back home

656
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
back home
 

657
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,990
back home
so maybe we won't go to that not

658
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
so maybe we won't go to that not
 

659
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,829
so maybe we won't go to that not

over there
 

677
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,949
over there

678
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
still generating you can see lab over
 

679
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,269
still generating you can see lab over
there

680
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279

 

681
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,310

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
and that is still pointing back home
 

693
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,110
and that is still pointing back home

that's pretty cool

700
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399

 

701
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,949

right next to the creeper that's great

702
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959

 

703
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,230

very nice this is a cool area i love how

704
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
very nice this is a cool area i love how
 

705
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,110
very nice this is a cool area i love how
the mountains are on both sides

706
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
the mountains are on both sides
 

707
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,829
the mountains are on both sides
oh that was close

708
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839

 

709
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,710

oh okay enough cooking around let's get

710
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
oh okay enough cooking around let's get
 

711
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,590
oh okay enough cooking around let's get
out of here

712
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600

 

713
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,430

okay so that's the big snow biome over

714
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
okay so that's the big snow biome over
 

715
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,710
okay so that's the big snow biome over
there that goes into the

716
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
there that goes into the
 

717
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,990
there that goes into the
giant forest biome a little desert there

718
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
giant forest biome a little desert there
 

719
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,590
giant forest biome a little desert there
but i think the desert's

720
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
but i think the desert's
 

721
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,310
but i think the desert's
really big over there then we have a

722
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
really big over there then we have a
 

723
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,710
really big over there then we have a
little swamp

724
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
little swamp
 

725
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,870
little swamp
um i can't quite tell if that's desert

726
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880
um i can't quite tell if that's desert
 

727
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,550
um i can't quite tell if that's desert
up ahead there

728
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
up ahead there
 

729
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,829
up ahead there
no that's still the snow one i think so

730
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
no that's still the snow one i think so
 

731
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,269
no that's still the snow one i think so
we might have to try go

732
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
we might have to try go
 

733
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,550
we might have to try go
that way and

734
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
that way and
 

735
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,150
that way and
we'll see

736
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160

 

737
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:09,270

i hope it doesn't go into an ocean

738
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280

 

739
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,270

740
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280

 

741
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,150

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,789

yeah i better make a boat

752
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
yeah i better make a boat
 

753
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,470
yeah i better make a boat
we found it's awesome i can see it just

754
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
we found it's awesome i can see it just
 

755
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,350
we found it's awesome i can see it just
starting to generate uh that was

756
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
starting to generate uh that was
 

757
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,750
starting to generate uh that was
actually

758
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
actually
 

759
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,750

761
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,830
just a swamp i went a little further and
there was swamp on the other side of the

762
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
there was swamp on the other side of the
 

763
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,710
there was swamp on the other side of the
water

764
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
water
 

765
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,990
water
and then there was some forest and then

and it's just getting light out so we're

776
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
and it's just getting light out so we're
 

777
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,830
and it's just getting light out so we're
actually going to be able to see it

778
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
actually going to be able to see it
 

779

um wow
this is such an awesome biome

800
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679

 

801
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,590

oh yes look at it

802
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600

 

803
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,350

so green i don't see any grass

804
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
so green i don't see any grass
 

805
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,029
so green i don't see any grass
oh there's a dress it's not really that

806
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
oh there's a dress it's not really that
 

807
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,950
oh there's a dress it's not really that
green is it

808
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
green is it
 

809
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,510
green is it
i thought it was supposed to be greener

810
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
i thought it was supposed to be greener
 

811
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,950
i thought it was supposed to be greener
let's go look

812
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960

 

813
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,750

yeah it's nice don't get me wrong i

814
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760

815
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,789
yeah it's nice don't get me wrong i
thought it was going to be

816
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
thought it was going to be
 

817
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,350
thought it was going to be
really bright green like the old

818
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
really bright green like the old
 

819
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,190
really bright green like the old
rainforest

820
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
rainforest
 

821
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,710
rainforest
before they did the huge biome change

822
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720

 

823
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,870

oh saplings and these trees are

824
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
oh saplings and these trees are
 

825
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,950
oh saplings and these trees are
like the best for collecting uh wood

826
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
like the best for collecting uh wood
 

827
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,909
like the best for collecting uh wood
so definitely want some saplings

828
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919

 

829
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,270

i wonder how big this whoa i don't know

830
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
i wonder how big this whoa i don't know
 

831
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,070
i wonder how big this whoa i don't know
how big this

832
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
how big this
 

833
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,549
how big this
uh biome is

834
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559

 

835
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,590

looks fairly big oh

836
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
looks fairly big oh
 

837
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,510
looks fairly big oh
missed the tree i wonder if you get like

838
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
missed the tree i wonder if you get like
 

839
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,270
missed the tree i wonder if you get like
ravines and jungle biomes i don't know

840
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
ravines and jungle biomes i don't know
 

841
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,070
ravines and jungle biomes i don't know
if i've ever seen

842
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
if i've ever seen
 

843
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:15,590
if i've ever seen
anyone with ravine yet

844
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600

 

845
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,750

go over here

846
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760

 

847
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,070

so we are fairly far away from home

848
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
so we are fairly far away from home
 

849
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,350
so we are fairly far away from home
though

850
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360

 

851
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,750

oh i thought it just fell off there

852
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760

 

853
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,549

and we are still getting pointed back

854
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
and we are still getting pointed back
 

855
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,549
and we are still getting pointed back
home so there can't be a whole lot of

856
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
home so there can't be a whole lot of
 

857
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,669
home so there can't be a whole lot of
strongholds around

858
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679

 

859
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,950

people are telling me there's more than

860
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
people are telling me there's more than
 

861
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,510
people are telling me there's more than
three per world but i don't know

862
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
three per world but i don't know
 

863
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,430
three per world but i don't know
how to get it to track another one

864
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
how to get it to track another one
 

865
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:55,510
how to get it to track another one
unless they're really far apart

866
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520

 

867
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,590

awesome okay now we're back to forest

868
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
awesome okay now we're back to forest
 

869
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,909
awesome okay now we're back to forest
haven't seen a cat yet

870
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919

 

871
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,430

cool well i'm gonna look around here a

872
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,440
cool well i'm gonna look around here a
 

873
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,070
cool well i'm gonna look around here a
little bit on my own and then we'll be

874
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
little bit on my own and then we'll be
 

875
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,029
little bit on my own and then we'll be
back at

876
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
back at
 

877
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,310
back at
the home base

878
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320

 

879
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,470

so i cut down about two or three of

880
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
so i cut down about two or three of
 

881
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,549
so i cut down about two or three of
those big trees

882
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
those big trees
 

883
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,390
those big trees
got four stacks of lumber from it that's

884
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
got four stacks of lumber from it that's
 

885
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,590
got four stacks of lumber from it that's
incredible

886
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
incredible
 

887
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,549
incredible
and i got 20 saplings now i wanted to

888
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
and i got 20 saplings now i wanted to
 

889
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,669
and i got 20 saplings now i wanted to
see what they look like

890
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
see what they look like
 

891
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,230
see what they look like
in different biomes the big trees so i'm

892
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
in different biomes the big trees so i'm
 

893
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,270
in different biomes the big trees so i'm
gonna

894
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
gonna
 

895
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,510
gonna
try plant one in a snow biome here

896
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520

 

897
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,950

and let's just see what this looks like

898
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960

 

899
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,430

i hope oh they might not grow

900
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440

 

901
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,870

didn't think of that no they grow

902
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880

 

903
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,830

hmm

904
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840

 

905
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,310

i guess we need more space probably

906
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
i guess we need more space probably
 

907
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,830
i guess we need more space probably
i'm gonna go over there

908
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840

 

909
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,870

okay let's try this again

910
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
okay let's try this again
 

911
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,230
okay let's try this again
no

912
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240

 

913
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,310

ah maybe you can't grow the big ones and

914
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
ah maybe you can't grow the big ones and
 

915
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,310
ah maybe you can't grow the big ones and
grow the small ones

916
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320

 

917
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,789

that's too bad

918
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799

 

919
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,149

you know what it was i think it was the

920
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
you know what it was i think it was the
 

921
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,310
you know what it was i think it was the
snow blocking the tree growth

922
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
snow blocking the tree growth
 

923
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,590
snow blocking the tree growth
i i put it up one block here and i grew

924
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
i i put it up one block here and i grew
 

925
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:25,990
i i put it up one block here and i grew
first

926
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
first
 

927
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,110
first
try it looks a little

928
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
try it looks a little
 

929
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,350
try it looks a little
weird not the best looking tree

930
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360

 

931
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,390

you can tell it doesn't fit anyway i'm

932
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
you can tell it doesn't fit anyway i'm
 

933
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,870
you can tell it doesn't fit anyway i'm
going to try

934
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
going to try
 

935
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,710
going to try
a few other biomes so i'm curious i want

936
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
a few other biomes so i'm curious i want
 

937
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,870
a few other biomes so i'm curious i want
to try it in a desert and i want to try

938
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
to try it in a desert and i want to try
 

939
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,510
to try it in a desert and i want to try
growing in the nether

940
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
growing in the nether
 

941
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,870
growing in the nether
fail

942
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880

 

943
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,390

okay i'm going to cut this down

944
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400

 

945
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,669

yeah the easiest way of cutting these

946
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
yeah the easiest way of cutting these
 

947
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,270
yeah the easiest way of cutting these
down i think is just to go to the very

948
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
down i think is just to go to the very
 

949
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,029
down i think is just to go to the very
top and work your way down

950
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:57,039
top and work your way down
 

951
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,549
top and work your way down
if you got a quick axe it's amazing

952
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
if you got a quick axe it's amazing
 

953
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,390
if you got a quick axe it's amazing
this is my efficiency four one

954
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400

 

955
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,870

just work your way down

956
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
just work your way down
 

957
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,310
just work your way down
there's really not that much for

958
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
there's really not that much for
 

959
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,630
there's really not that much for
branches on them too which is nice

960
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
branches on them too which is nice
 

961
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,149
branches on them too which is nice
it's a little bit

962
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159

 

963
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,830

it's real pain if you don't get them all

964
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
it's real pain if you don't get them all
 

965
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,350
it's real pain if you don't get them all
though because they're way up in the air

966
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
though because they're way up in the air
 

967
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,870
though because they're way up in the air
then

968
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
then
 

969
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,070
then
there's another one

970
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080

 

971
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,590

so as far as farming wood goes

972
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
so as far as farming wood goes
 

973
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,510
so as far as farming wood goes
if you're just looking for planks this

974
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
if you're just looking for planks this
 

975
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,430
if you're just looking for planks this
is the way to do it for sure

976
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
is the way to do it for sure
 

977
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,029
is the way to do it for sure
but i still really like the look of dark

978
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039
but i still really like the look of dark
 

979
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,789
but i still really like the look of dark
wood and light wood

980
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
wood and light wood
 

981
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,950
wood and light wood
compared i don't like i don't know if i

982
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
compared i don't like i don't know if i
 

983
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,149
compared i don't like i don't know if i
really like the way this

984
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
really like the way this
 

985
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,510
really like the way this
wood texture looks it's kind of

986
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
wood texture looks it's kind of
 

987
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,870
wood texture looks it's kind of
i don't know if i'd ever build anything

988
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
i don't know if i'd ever build anything
 

989
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,029
i don't know if i'd ever build anything
with it

990
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039

 

991
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,549

it's uh i don't know maybe you have to

992
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:56,559
it's uh i don't know maybe you have to
 

993
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,549
it's uh i don't know maybe you have to
get used to it

994
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559

 

995
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,070

let's look at it all incredible

996
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080

 

997
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,070

okay uh let's go to a desert and try to

998
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
okay uh let's go to a desert and try to
 

999
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,350
okay uh let's go to a desert and try to
grow another one

1000
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360

 

1001
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,350

all right i made it back i'm gonna try

1002
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
all right i made it back i'm gonna try
 

1003
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,549
all right i made it back i'm gonna try
it in the desert here

1004
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
it in the desert here
 

1005
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:23,029
it in the desert here
just to see what it looks like

1006
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039

 

1007
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,269

made an s

1008
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279

 

1009
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,230

that's uh that's interesting i'm

1010
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
that's uh that's interesting i'm
 

1011
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,510
that's uh that's interesting i'm
guessing that's what it'll look like in

1012
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
guessing that's what it'll look like in
 

1013
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,990
guessing that's what it'll look like in
the nether

1014
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
the nether
 

1015
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,909
the nether
two but i'm gonna try it there just to

1016
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
two but i'm gonna try it there just to
 

1017
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,110
two but i'm gonna try it there just to
make sure

1018
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
make sure
 

1019
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,669
make sure
i'm just thinking of how you could maybe

1020
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
i'm just thinking of how you could maybe
 

1021
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,990
i'm just thinking of how you could maybe
add a lot of

1022
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
add a lot of
 

1023
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,590
add a lot of
life to a desert quickly but

1024
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
life to a desert quickly but
 

1025
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,590
life to a desert quickly but
it doesn't look like it's really alive

1026
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
it doesn't look like it's really alive
 

1027
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,029
it doesn't look like it's really alive
when it's yellow like that

1028
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039

 

1029
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:58,630

okay and i want to try the mountain

1030
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640

 

1031
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,070

that doesn't look bad i like it in the

1032
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
that doesn't look bad i like it in the
 

1033
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,149
that doesn't look bad i like it in the
mountain that's pretty good

1034
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
mountain that's pretty good
 

1035
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,070
mountain that's pretty good
good color uh because like i said before

1036
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
good color uh because like i said before
 

1037
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,750
good color uh because like i said before
the mountains would look a lot cooler if

1038
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
the mountains would look a lot cooler if
 

1039

they were full of trees i
i would imagine so that might be

1042
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,400
i would imagine so that might be
 

1043
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,870
i would imagine so that might be
an idea

1044
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880

 

1045
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,549

00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
and finally i want to try it in the
 

1047

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,630
didn't find any more villages in all
that

1094
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640

1095
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,830
that
uh distance i traveled but i guess

1096
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
uh distance i traveled but i guess

uh distance i traveled but i guess
i really didn't go or i didn't really

1098
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
i really didn't go or i didn't really
 

1099
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,510
i really didn't go or i didn't really
find any new deserts

1100
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
find any new deserts
 

1101
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,710
find any new deserts
or uh plain areas i think that's the

1102
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
or uh plain areas i think that's the
 

1103
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,070
or uh plain areas i think that's the
only place where you find villages

1104
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
only place where you find villages
 

1105
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,950
only place where you find villages
or i'm assuming anyway we'll check on

1106
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
or i'm assuming anyway we'll check on
 

1107
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,230

for them and that's probably what i'll

1116
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
for them and that's probably what i'll
 

1117
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,110
for them and that's probably what i'll
end up doing and i'll maybe keep this

1118
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
end up doing and i'll maybe keep this
 

1119
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,549

as like a little lobby room
 

1121
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,750

and maybe man they're so much faster now
 

1129
