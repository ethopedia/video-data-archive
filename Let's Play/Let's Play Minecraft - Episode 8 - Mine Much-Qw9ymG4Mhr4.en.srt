so we're going to head down through a
 

49
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,750
so we're going to head down through a
new mob trap area I'll start to eating

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:08,760
new mob trap area I'll start to eating
 

51
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:18,700
new mob trap area I'll start to eating
that out

52

57
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,370
off alright so here we are down at the
bottom of that shaft at the lab level

58
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:28,380
bottom of that shaft at the lab level
 

59
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,430
bottom of that shaft at the lab level
and we're just going to work on setting

60
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
and we're just going to work on setting
 

61

stuff down here and put some wood here
and I'm going to make a water break here

70
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,200
and I'm going to make a water break here
 

71
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,720
and I'm going to make a water break here
so that if I fall so I can just fall

72

so that if I fall so I can just fall
down the shaft real quick so I'll need

74
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:16,620
down the shaft real quick so I'll need
 

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:27,040
down the shaft real quick so I'll need
three signs

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,050

 

77
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:46,380

81
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,790
okay one two three and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to place it around this

82
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:57,800
do is I'm going to place it around this
 

83
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:06,730
do is I'm going to place it around this
2x2 area here is probably good actually

84
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:06,740
2x2 area here is probably good actually
 

85
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:15,550
2x2 area here is probably good actually
no um yeah that's fine actually place

86
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,560
no um yeah that's fine actually place
 

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:26,590
no um yeah that's fine actually place
one there and another two here and that

88
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:26,600
one there and another two here and that
 

89
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,980
one there and another two here and that
blocks the four squares and then oh yeah

90
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:29,990
blocks the four squares and then oh yeah
 

91
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:40,110
blocks the four squares and then oh yeah
I need infinite water pool down here

92
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,120

 

93
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:54,490

always useful to have around and then I

94
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:54,500
always useful to have around and then I
 

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:06,710
always useful to have around and then I
just need to place one here here

96
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720

 

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,330

all four blocks and I think oh I need

98
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:12,340
all four blocks and I think oh I need
 

99
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,570
all four blocks and I think oh I need
some ladders to finish where I didn't

100
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:15,580
some ladders to finish where I didn't
 

101
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:24,020
some ladders to finish where I didn't
put them there

102
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,030

 

103
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:36,050

and use the bulk of it already

104
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,060

 

105
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,250

good enough okay so I'm going to try

106
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,260
good enough okay so I'm going to try
 

107
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,870
good enough okay so I'm going to try
fall down here and see if it works I

108
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:41,880
fall down here and see if it works I
 

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,520
fall down here and see if it works I
think it does eventually I'll have some

110
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,530
think it does eventually I'll have some
 

111
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,380
think it does eventually I'll have some
way to get up here faster but this is

112
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,390
way to get up here faster but this is
 

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:07:09,760
way to get up here faster but this is
good enough for now hope I don't die

114
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:09,770

 

115
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:16,910

perfect I think in on multiplayer that

116
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:16,920
perfect I think in on multiplayer that
 

117
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,240
perfect I think in on multiplayer that
doesn't always work so be careful if you

118
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,250
doesn't always work so be careful if you
 

119
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:30,200
doesn't always work so be careful if you
do that there okay so I need to dig this

120
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,210
do that there okay so I need to dig this
 

121
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:40,760
do that there okay so I need to dig this
way and I'm going to I think I'm going

122
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:40,770
way and I'm going to I think I'm going
 

123
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,310
way and I'm going to I think I'm going
to start us three blocks above the lava

124
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,320
to start us three blocks above the lava
 

125
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,030
to start us three blocks above the lava
level because I might need to take two

126
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,040
level because I might need to take two
 

127
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,540
level because I might need to take two
blocks down four canals for the mobs to

128
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,550
blocks down four canals for the mobs to
 

129
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,970
blocks down four canals for the mobs to
fall into this is by the way my first

130
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:58,980
fall into this is by the way my first
 

131
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,700
fall into this is by the way my first
mob trap I've ever made so it might not

132
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:01,710
mob trap I've ever made so it might not
 

133
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,420
mob trap I've ever made so it might not
turn out perfectly

134
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,430
turn out perfectly
 

135
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:11,810
turn out perfectly
it probably won't actually and so if you

136
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:11,820
it probably won't actually and so if you
 

137
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,640
it probably won't actually and so if you
have any ideas on how to make it better

138
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:13,650
have any ideas on how to make it better
 

139
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:23,010
have any ideas on how to make it better
let me know

140
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,020

 

141
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,080

and all I'm going to be doing is I'm

142
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,090
and all I'm going to be doing is I'm
 

143
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,370
and all I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to be clearing out that I think a

144
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:29,380
going to be clearing out that I think a
 

145
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,450
going to be clearing out that I think a
too high space all under the ocean here

146
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:33,460
too high space all under the ocean here
 

147
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,310
too high space all under the ocean here
and collecting resources while I do it

148
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:37,320
and collecting resources while I do it
 

149
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,750
and collecting resources while I do it
I'm not sure if you're supposed to I

150
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
I'm not sure if you're supposed to I
 

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,580
I'm not sure if you're supposed to I
don't think it needs to be three high

152
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:41,590
don't think it needs to be three high
 

153
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,410
don't think it needs to be three high
but if it does please let me know but

154
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:46,420
but if it does please let me know but
 

155
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,730

I'm just going to make it two for now

156
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm just going to make it two for now
 

157
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm just going to make it two for now
because adding one more block is going

158
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,410
because adding one more block is going
 

159
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,530
because adding one more block is going
to make it take a time and a half longer

160
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:54,540

 

161
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,200

so I'm going to be mining and I'll see

162
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,210
so I'm going to be mining and I'll see
 

163
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,070

this should give you a better idea of

168
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
this should give you a better idea of
 

169
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
this should give you a better idea of
what we're going to be doing down here

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,010
what we're going to be doing down here
 

171
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,780
what we're going to be doing down here
I'm just going to be editing out this

172
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:12,790
I'm just going to be editing out this
 

173
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:20,690
I'm just going to be editing out this
area or under the ocean right now and

174
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:20,700

 

175
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,100

once it's all set up and may get rid of

176
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,110
once it's all set up and may get rid of
 

177
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,630
once it's all set up and may get rid of
all the torches and it'll be completely

178
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
all the torches and it'll be completely
 

179
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,380
all the torches and it'll be completely
dark down here and mobs will spawn in a

180
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,390
dark down here and mobs will spawn in a
 

181
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,650
dark down here and mobs will spawn in a
very large area and we're going to set

182
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:31,660
very large area and we're going to set
 

183
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,650
very large area and we're going to set
up water canals that push the mobs this

184
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:34,660
up water canals that push the mobs this
 

185
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,090
up water canals that push the mobs this
way and collect them all to one one area

186
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,100
way and collect them all to one one area
 

187
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,090
way and collect them all to one one area
and then there's going to be a mob

188
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,100
and then there's going to be a mob
 

189
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
and then there's going to be a mob
elevator that brings them up to the

190
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,110
elevator that brings them up to the
 

191
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,390
elevator that brings them up to the
surface or something and then I'll set

192
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,400
surface or something and then I'll set
 

193
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,580
surface or something and then I'll set
up a grinder to kill them or do other

194
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:53,590
up a grinder to kill them or do other
 

195
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,430
up a grinder to kill them or do other
things with them I'm not sure yet and
