00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,509
and our cart gets sent there and the
idea was we were trying to

510
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519

 

511
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,630

trying to send information

512
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
trying to send information
 

513
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,710
trying to send information
over a long distance without using

514
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
over a long distance without using
 

515
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,230
over a long distance without using
redstone wiring

516
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
redstone wiring
 

517
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,790
redstone wiring
or anything like that the plan was to

518
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
or anything like that the plan was to
 

519
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,030
or anything like that the plan was to
use the spacing

520
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
use the spacing
 

521
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,030
use the spacing
between two minecarts to tell

522
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
between two minecarts to tell
 

523
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,990
between two minecarts to tell
our rail line system where we want to

524
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
our rail line system where we want to
 

525
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,630
our rail line system where we want to
stop

526
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
stop
 

527
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,990
stop
at um because it's it's a way

528
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
at um because it's it's a way
 

529
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,910
at um because it's it's a way
of sending information over a long

530
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
of sending information over a long
 

531
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,990
of sending information over a long
distance the space between two mine

532
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
distance the space between two mine
 

533
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,949
distance the space between two mine
carts

534
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
carts
 

535
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,350
carts
now in order for it to work we need to

536
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
now in order for it to work we need to
 

537
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,430
now in order for it to work we need to
keep the minecarts relatively close

538
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
keep the minecarts relatively close
 

539
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,710
keep the minecarts relatively close
together

540
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
together
 

541
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,150
together
like we don't want one of them falling

542
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
like we don't want one of them falling
 

543
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,230
like we don't want one of them falling
hundreds of blocks behind the other one

544
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
hundreds of blocks behind the other one
 

545
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,630
hundreds of blocks behind the other one
want them on each other's tail

546
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
want them on each other's tail
 

547
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,350
want them on each other's tail
so to do that we either have well we we

548
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
so to do that we either have well we we
 

549
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,550
so to do that we either have well we we
have two options

550
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
have two options
 

551
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,190
have two options
on how to do that we can either use

552
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
on how to do that we can either use
 

553
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,670
on how to do that we can either use
power rails all the way

554
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
power rails all the way
 

555
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,470
power rails all the way
which would be expensive we'd better

556
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
which would be expensive we'd better
 

557
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,110
which would be expensive we'd better
we'd be

558
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
we'd be
 

559
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,030
we'd be
better just to use redstone signals

560
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
better just to use redstone signals
 

561
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,110
better just to use redstone signals
probably if we if we went for that

562
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
probably if we if we went for that
 

563
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,509
probably if we if we went for that
option

564
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
option
 

565
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,430
option
although i'm not sure how far redstone

566
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
although i'm not sure how far redstone
 

567
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,030
although i'm not sure how far redstone
would actually work

568
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
would actually work
 

569
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,150
would actually work
if it's going to unloaded chunks uh

570
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160

 

571
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,910

what we want to do though is try to get

572
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
what we want to do though is try to get
 

573
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,910
what we want to do though is try to get
a mob in the cart so that the cart moves

574
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
a mob in the cart so that the cart moves
 

575
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,350
a mob in the cart so that the cart moves
the same speed as when we're in the

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
the same speed as when we're in the
 

577
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,110
the same speed as when we're in the

578
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
carts
 

579
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,790
carts
and uh we need to choose a mob that

580
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
and uh we need to choose a mob that
 

581
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,190
and uh we need to choose a mob that
doesn't despawn ideally so

582
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
doesn't despawn ideally so
 

583
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,790
doesn't despawn ideally so
a passive mob would be good or a

584
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
a passive mob would be good or a
 

585
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,030
a passive mob would be good or a
villager but chickens are what we're

586
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
villager but chickens are what we're
 

587
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,949
villager but chickens are what we're
going to go with because

00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
going to go with because
 

589
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,550
going to go with because
if something ever happens then we can

590
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
if something ever happens then we can
 

591
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,350
if something ever happens then we can
easily spawn another one with an egg

592
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
easily spawn another one with an egg
 

593
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,430
easily spawn another one with an egg
this was the track design we were going

594
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
this was the track design we were going
 

595
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,350
this was the track design we were going
with something like this

596
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
with something like this
 

597
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,269
with something like this
i never did finish my thought with it

uh rail system i found a style i really
 

605
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,509
uh rail system i found a style i really
like so i think we'll do that here too

606
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
like so i think we'll do that here too
 

607
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,870
like so i think we'll do that here too

621
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,750

those are a few blocks we're never

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
those are a few blocks we're never
 

623
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,430
those are a few blocks we're never
getting back

633
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,509
oh i carry a bow with me i just don't
carry arrows with me

634
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
carry arrows with me

uh yeah we had a three wide fence

636
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
uh yeah we had a three wide fence
 

637
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,990
uh yeah we had a three wide fence
two too high and then this border around

638
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
two too high and then this border around
 

639
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,790
two too high and then this border around
it

640
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
it
 

641
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,990
it
on my drag server and then this was

642
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
on my drag server and then this was
 

643
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,590
on my drag server and then this was
half a block down and that was a half a

644
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
half a block down and that was a half a
 

645
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,590
half a block down and that was a half a
block up

646
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
block up
 

647
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,269
block up
so it's pretty much the same look i

648
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
so it's pretty much the same look i
 

649
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,790
so it's pretty much the same look i
think that's what we're going to go with

650
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800

 

651
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,829

for our track but i think we got to go

652
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
for our track but i think we got to go
 

653
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,350
for our track but i think we got to go
to a creative world

654
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
to a creative world
 

655
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,629
to a creative world
we don't have to but it would be a lot

656
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
we don't have to but it would be a lot
 

657
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,310
we don't have to but it would be a lot
easier if we went to creative world to

658
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
easier if we went to creative world to
 

659
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,310
easier if we went to creative world to
figure out a few things with

660
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
figure out a few things with
 

661
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,389
figure out a few things with
the the mobs so let's do that

662
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
the the mobs so let's do that
 

663
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,069
the the mobs so let's do that
uh the issue that we gotta

664
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
uh the issue that we gotta
 

665
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,430
uh the issue that we gotta
work out is if uh

666
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440

 

667
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,110

we gotta manage the mine carts like if

668
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
we gotta manage the mine carts like if
 

669
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,870
we gotta manage the mine carts like if
i'm if i take a

670
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
i'm if i take a
 

671
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,710
i'm if i take a
my mine cart and a chicken to another

672
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
my mine cart and a chicken to another
 

673
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,949
my mine cart and a chicken to another
destination

674
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
destination
 

675
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,030
destination
and then we don't come back through that

676
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
and then we don't come back through that
 

677
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,790
and then we don't come back through that
destination how do we get the chicken

678
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800

uh there are a few exceptions of course
but the one that i

716
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
but the one that i
 

717
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,030
but the one that i
pretty much always make the exception

718
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
pretty much always make the exception
 

719
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,710

really
 

727
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,949
really
frustrating to figure out

728
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
frustrating to figure out
 

729
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,910
frustrating to figure out
mechanics and that without spawn egg so

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
mechanics and that without spawn egg so
 

731
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,590

that's why we're here

732
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
that's why we're here
 

733

that's why we're here
uh with the our track it's going to be

734
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
uh with the our track it's going to be
 

735
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:18,949
uh with the our track it's going to be
really hard to

736
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
really hard to
 

737
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,990
really hard to
get working the way i want it to but

738
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
get working the way i want it to but
 

739
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,750
get working the way i want it to but
i think we got to build a couple things

740
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
i think we got to build a couple things
 

741
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,829

00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
here at i don't know if we have time to
 

743
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,870
here at i don't know if we have time to
do it all today but

744
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
do it all today but
 

745
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,710
do it all today but
i think we need a chicken

746
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
i think we need a chicken
 

747
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,150
i think we need a chicken
buffer we need a chicken loader we need

a chicken recycler

750
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
a chicken recycler
 

751
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,509
a chicken recycler
and possibly if we want to get real

752
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
and possibly if we want to get real
 

753
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,069
and possibly if we want to get real
fancy

754
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
fancy
 

755
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,269

a minecart buffer and an egg buffer

756
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
a minecart buffer and an egg buffer
 

757
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,269
a minecart buffer and an egg buffer
so those those five things are on my

758
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
so those those five things are on my
 

759
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,550
so those those five things are on my
mind what do i mean when i say that i'll

760
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
mind what do i mean when i say that i'll
 

761
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,430
mind what do i mean when i say that i'll
i'll break it down uh the chicken

762
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
i'll break it down uh the chicken
 

763
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,269
i'll break it down uh the chicken
recycler

764
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
recycler
 

765
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,069
recycler
is when a a chicken arrives at a stop

766
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
is when a a chicken arrives at a stop
 

767
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,749
is when a a chicken arrives at a stop
we probably just want to put him off in

768
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
we probably just want to put him off in
 

769
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,509
we probably just want to put him off in
an area so that

770
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
an area so that
 

771
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,670
an area so that
when we need him again he's ready and

772
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
when we need him again he's ready and
 

773
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,870
when we need him again he's ready and
available

774
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
available
 

775
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,389
available
a chicken loader and buffer thing

776
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
a chicken loader and buffer thing
 

777
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,949
a chicken loader and buffer thing
is if there is no chicken at the stop

778
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
is if there is no chicken at the stop
 

779
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,629
is if there is no chicken at the stop
for some reason then we need to create

780
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
for some reason then we need to create
 

781
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,350
for some reason then we need to create
one and put in a mine cart so

782
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
one and put in a mine cart so
 

783
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,310
one and put in a mine cart so
let's work on that first of all here how

784
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
let's work on that first of all here how
 

785
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,470
let's work on that first of all here how
are we going to do it

786
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
are we going to do it
 

787
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,550
are we going to do it
uh chicken buffer chicken buffer let's

788
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
uh chicken buffer chicken buffer let's
 

789
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,550
uh chicken buffer chicken buffer let's
get some glass

790
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
get some glass
 

791
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,150
get some glass
and i'll probably be fumbling around

792
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
and i'll probably be fumbling around
 

793
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,470
and i'll probably be fumbling around
here so just bear with me

794
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
here so just bear with me
 

795
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,590
here so just bear with me
uh we probably could do

796
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600

 

797
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,509

this still i think if we

798
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
this still i think if we
 

799
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,990
this still i think if we
i think we need to pick whoa that was a

800
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
i think we need to pick whoa that was a
 

801
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,030
i think we need to pick whoa that was a
weird word stutter

802
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
weird word stutter
 

803
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,350
weird word stutter
i think we can pick up chickens through

804
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
i think we can pick up chickens through
 

805
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,870
i think we can pick up chickens through
corners still

806
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
corners still
 

807
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,790
corners still
but we'll just actually

808
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
but we'll just actually
 

809
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,629
but we'll just actually
instead of using chicken spawn eggs i'm

810
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
instead of using chicken spawn eggs i'm
 

811
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,030
instead of using chicken spawn eggs i'm
going to try randomly throw in eggs

812
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
going to try randomly throw in eggs
 

813
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,870
going to try randomly throw in eggs
just so this is more realistic

814
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880

 

815
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,990

we do get yeah there we go okay so this

816
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
we do get yeah there we go okay so this
 

817
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,350
we do get yeah there we go okay so this
is our chicken buffer just a little

818
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
is our chicken buffer just a little
 

819
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,990
is our chicken buffer just a little
holding area

820
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
holding area
 

821
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,110
holding area
for chickens can we pick up through

822
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
for chickens can we pick up through
 

823
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,470
for chickens can we pick up through
corners still

824
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
corners still
 

825
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,470
corners still
yes we can okay

826
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480

 

827
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,750

now i think there's a good chance if

828
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
now i think there's a good chance if
 

829
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,470
now i think there's a good chance if
they're not right in the corner

830
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
they're not right in the corner
 

831
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,069
they're not right in the corner
yeah it won't pick it up so we might

832
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
yeah it won't pick it up so we might
 

833
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,549
yeah it won't pick it up so we might
need for our buffer

834
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
need for our buffer
 

835
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,110
need for our buffer
some pistons to get them into position

836
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120

 

837
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,630

that's our first step get out of here

838
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
that's our first step get out of here
 

839
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,909
that's our first step get out of here
sorry chicken it's not your place

840
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
sorry chicken it's not your place
 

841
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,990
sorry chicken it's not your place
uh this will have to be a solid block

842
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
uh this will have to be a solid block
 

843
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,549
uh this will have to be a solid block
because we'll need yeah we'll need

844
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
because we'll need yeah we'll need
 

845
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,669
because we'll need yeah we'll need
a power rail here

846
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679

 

847
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,669

to get the guy out of the way sorry

848
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
to get the guy out of the way sorry
 

849
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,110
to get the guy out of the way sorry
fireworks i'll miss you right in my face

850
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
fireworks i'll miss you right in my face
 

851
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,630
fireworks i'll miss you right in my face
it's exactly where i need to place the

852
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
it's exactly where i need to place the
 

853
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,909
it's exactly where i need to place the
block he's just sitting there waiting

854
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
block he's just sitting there waiting
 

855
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,510
block he's just sitting there waiting
okay i'm gonna time i'm gonna set up a

856
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
okay i'm gonna time i'm gonna set up a
 

857
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,029
okay i'm gonna time i'm gonna set up a
little redstone off camera here i think

858
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
little redstone off camera here i think
 

859
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,230
little redstone off camera here i think
i gotta

860
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
i gotta
 

861
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,270
i gotta
do a monostable circuit that will pulse

862
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
do a monostable circuit that will pulse
 

863
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,710
do a monostable circuit that will pulse
one of these and then have another one

864
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
one of these and then have another one
 

865
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,990
one of these and then have another one
go and kind of stay out so

866
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
go and kind of stay out so
 

867
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,350
go and kind of stay out so
here i go with that

868
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360

 

869
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,190

okay well we hit a big problem already

870
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
okay well we hit a big problem already
 

871
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,029
okay well we hit a big problem already
it's trying to set this up so that if

872
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
it's trying to set this up so that if
 

873
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,789
it's trying to set this up so that if
there is at least

874
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
there is at least
 

875
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,350
there is at least
one chicken in there it will definitely

876
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
one chicken in there it will definitely
 

877
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,029
one chicken in there it will definitely
get picked up in our mine cart that that

878
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
get picked up in our mine cart that that
 

879
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,590
get picked up in our mine cart that that
was the goal here

880
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
was the goal here
 

881
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,830
was the goal here
where'd he go

882
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840

 

883
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,029

what the heck oh he is there

884
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
what the heck oh he is there
 

885
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,350
what the heck oh he is there
the problem is it doesn't seem to push

886
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
the problem is it doesn't seem to push
 

887
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,710
the problem is it doesn't seem to push
the chicken

888
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
the chicken
 

889
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,029
the chicken
properly sometimes the first time i did

890
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
properly sometimes the first time i did
 

891
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,390
properly sometimes the first time i did
it didn't push a chicken at

892
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
it didn't push a chicken at
 

893
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,510
it didn't push a chicken at
all that time it worked

894
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
all that time it worked
 

895
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,870
all that time it worked
interesting very weird

896
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
interesting very weird
 

897
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,390
interesting very weird
very weird guys

898
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400

 

899
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,230

pistons don't work like they used to

900
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
pistons don't work like they used to
 

901
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,630
pistons don't work like they used to
that's for sure

902
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
that's for sure
 

903
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:08,470
that's for sure
chicken let's try this one more time

904
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480

 

905
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,190

you got moved a little bit but not

906
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200

 

907
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,310

it's not us it's not doing what it's

908
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
it's not us it's not doing what it's
 

909
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,590
it's not us it's not doing what it's
supposed to do though

910
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
supposed to do though
 

911
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,029
supposed to do though
we'll leave it that so that's not a

912
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
we'll leave it that so that's not a
 

913
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,350
we'll leave it that so that's not a
reliable way of doing it for sure

914
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360

 

915
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,909

problem solved i switched to sticky

916
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
problem solved i switched to sticky
 

917
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,270
problem solved i switched to sticky
pistons and they

918
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
pistons and they
 

919
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,190
pistons and they
they're a lot more sticky they work uh

920
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
they're a lot more sticky they work uh
 

921
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,870
they're a lot more sticky they work uh
they move the chicken actually which is

922
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
they move the chicken actually which is
 

923
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,310
they move the chicken actually which is
what we want

924
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
what we want
 

925
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,470
what we want
uh even with the chicken moving though

926
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
uh even with the chicken moving though
 

927
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,830
uh even with the chicken moving though
if the chicken's in the corner it

928
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
if the chicken's in the corner it
 

929
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,190
if the chicken's in the corner it
doesn't always get picked up there's

930
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
doesn't always get picked up there's
 

931
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,710
doesn't always get picked up there's
also a requirement of

932
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
also a requirement of
 

933
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,310
also a requirement of
motion needed and the minecart will just

934
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
motion needed and the minecart will just
 

935
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,350
motion needed and the minecart will just
bump the chicken

936
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
bump the chicken
 

937
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,070
bump the chicken
when it's moving a lot of times so i i

938
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
when it's moving a lot of times so i i
 

939
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,669
when it's moving a lot of times so i i
need to try make the chicken move at

940
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
need to try make the chicken move at
 

941
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,789
need to try make the chicken move at
this

942
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
this
 

943
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,190
this
precise time the minecart pulls up here

944
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
precise time the minecart pulls up here
 

945
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,789
precise time the minecart pulls up here
which is

946
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
which is
 

947
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,830
which is
kind of weird uh

948
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
kind of weird uh
 

949
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,750
kind of weird uh
so yeah the chicken's in the middle

950
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760

 

951
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,750

well actually i just said my cart wasn't

952
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
well actually i just said my cart wasn't
 

953
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,549
well actually i just said my cart wasn't
even moving was it

954
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
even moving was it
 

955
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,230
even moving was it
anyway timing is important is what i'm

956
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
anyway timing is important is what i'm
 

957
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,510
anyway timing is important is what i'm
trying to say so i have to make sure i

958
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
trying to say so i have to make sure i
 

959
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,669
trying to say so i have to make sure i
time everything correctly

960
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679

 

961
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,310

also uh i'm using a detector rail here

962
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
also uh i'm using a detector rail here
 

963
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,669
also uh i'm using a detector rail here
i'll probably switch this

964
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
i'll probably switch this
 

965
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,190
i'll probably switch this
to a that uh directional trick i showed

966
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
to a that uh directional trick i showed
 

967
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,470
to a that uh directional trick i showed
you on the minecraft

968
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
you on the minecraft
 

969
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,350
you on the minecraft
episode where i built the rail line that

970
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
episode where i built the rail line that
 

971
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,390
episode where i built the rail line that
this is another

972
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
this is another
 

973
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,950
this is another
practical practical use for it right

974
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
practical practical use for it right
 

975
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,990
practical practical use for it right
here because it goes over it twice

976
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
here because it goes over it twice
 

977
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,270
here because it goes over it twice
and uh

978
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280

 

979
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,710

oh what's that

980
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720

 

981
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,230

i see what's happening i was wondering

982
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
i see what's happening i was wondering
 

983
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,710
i see what's happening i was wondering
what happened to my glass block

984
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
what happened to my glass block
 

985
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,430
what happened to my glass block
it's pushing out and that one's pushing

986
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
it's pushing out and that one's pushing
 

987
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,310
it's pushing out and that one's pushing
i see

988
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
i see
 

989
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:01,029
i see
so i'll have to time that correctly too

990
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039

 

991
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,909

let's try it again

992
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919

 

993
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,950

nope see what i mean it doesn't always

994
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
nope see what i mean it doesn't always
 

995
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,510
nope see what i mean it doesn't always
work

996
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
work
 

997
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,789
work
now the timing is different so it

998
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799
now the timing is different so it
 

999
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,789
now the timing is different so it
doesn't work

1000
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799

 

1001
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,310

but anyway i can make it worth doing it

1002
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
but anyway i can make it worth doing it
 

1003
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,590
but anyway i can make it worth doing it
that way i just have to make sure i time

1004
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
that way i just have to make sure i time
 

1005
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,590
that way i just have to make sure i time
it correctly and i'll try to condense it

1006
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
it correctly and i'll try to condense it
 

1007
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,590
it correctly and i'll try to condense it
as close as possible this detector rail

1008
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
as close as possible this detector rail
 

1009
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,310
as close as possible this detector rail
so this track doesn't have to be as long

1010
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
so this track doesn't have to be as long
 

1011
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,909
so this track doesn't have to be as long
so that will work as our chicken loader

1012
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
so that will work as our chicken loader
 

1013
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,549
so that will work as our chicken loader
i have not figured out how to tell if

1014
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
i have not figured out how to tell if
 

1015
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,590
i have not figured out how to tell if
there's a chicken

1016
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
there's a chicken
 

1017
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,630
there's a chicken
in there at the moment because if

1018
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640
in there at the moment because if
 

1019
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,350
in there at the moment because if
there's no chicken we need dispensers to

1020
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
there's no chicken we need dispensers to
 

1021
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,029
there's no chicken we need dispensers to
shoot eggs and then we'll create new

1022
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
shoot eggs and then we'll create new
 

1023
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,669
shoot eggs and then we'll create new
chickens that way

1024
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
chickens that way
 

1025
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,110
chickens that way
but if i put a pressure plate there

1026
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
but if i put a pressure plate there
 

1027
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,630
but if i put a pressure plate there
these pistons are going to destroy it

1028
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
these pistons are going to destroy it
 

1029
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,549
these pistons are going to destroy it
when they move

1030
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
when they move
 

1031
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,750
when they move
uh chickens are too small to use trip

1032
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
uh chickens are too small to use trip
 

1033
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,789
uh chickens are too small to use trip
wires

1034
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799

 

1035
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,070

so it's kind of a problem isn't it yes

1036
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
so it's kind of a problem isn't it yes
 

1037
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,630
so it's kind of a problem isn't it yes
indeed

1038
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,640

 

1039
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,950

okay even if we push a chicken right to

1040
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
okay even if we push a chicken right to
 

1041
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,549
okay even if we push a chicken right to
the very corner

1042
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
the very corner
 

1043
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,149
the very corner
it won't step on the pressure plate on

1044
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
it won't step on the pressure plate on
 

1045
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,310
it won't step on the pressure plate on
the other side

1046
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
the other side
 

1047
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,950
the other side
so we can't use a trick like that

1048
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960

 

1049
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,390

another idea had is to have a clock

1050
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
another idea had is to have a clock
 

1051
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,110
another idea had is to have a clock
start going

1052
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
start going
 

1053
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,669
start going
once the cart goes over this detector

1054
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
once the cart goes over this detector
 

1055
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,029
once the cart goes over this detector
rail

1056
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
rail
 

1057
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,990
rail
and the cart will just stop there and

1058
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
and the cart will just stop there and
 

1059
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,149
and the cart will just stop there and
the clock will keep going shooting eggs

1060
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
the clock will keep going shooting eggs
 

1061
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,430
the clock will keep going shooting eggs
until a chicken goes into the cart and

1062
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
until a chicken goes into the cart and
 

1063
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,909
until a chicken goes into the cart and
these pistons will keep firing as well

1064
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
these pistons will keep firing as well
 

1065
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,510
these pistons will keep firing as well
so

1066
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
so
 

1067
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,029
so
thought of that doesn't seem like it's

1068
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
thought of that doesn't seem like it's
 

1069
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,470
thought of that doesn't seem like it's
gonna work though because the chicken

1070
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
gonna work though because the chicken
 

1071
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,310
gonna work though because the chicken
pushes the mine carts

1072
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320

 

1073
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,310

instead of going in it you stupid

1074
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
instead of going in it you stupid
 

1075
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,750
instead of going in it you stupid
chicken

1076
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
chicken
 

1077
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,230
chicken
um

1078
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240

 

1079
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,830

what else could we do we could prob

1080
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
what else could we do we could prob
 

1081
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,149
what else could we do we could prob
well another thing we could do is make

1082
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
well another thing we could do is make
 

1083
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,110
well another thing we could do is make
it

1084
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
it
 

1085
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,710
it
do that clock thing like i said where it

1086
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
do that clock thing like i said where it
 

1087
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,270
do that clock thing like i said where it
will keep dispensing eggs

1088
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
will keep dispensing eggs
 

1089
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,430
will keep dispensing eggs
then the chickens when it does create a

1090
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
then the chickens when it does create a
 

1091
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,350
then the chickens when it does create a
chicken it will float down into a trip

1092
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
chicken it will float down into a trip
 

1093
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,430
chicken it will float down into a trip
wire

1094
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
wire
 

1095
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,270
wire
and that will tell it to stop dispensing

1096
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
and that will tell it to stop dispensing
 

1097
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,950
and that will tell it to stop dispensing
eggs but we might get more than one

1098
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
eggs but we might get more than one
 

1099
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,510
eggs but we might get more than one
chicken

1100
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
chicken
 

1101
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,190
chicken
in that time and

1102
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
in that time and
 

1103
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,029
in that time and
the second time we try to get a chicken

1104
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
the second time we try to get a chicken
 

1105
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,230
the second time we try to get a chicken
it's still going to do the same thing

1106
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
it's still going to do the same thing
 

1107
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,750
it's still going to do the same thing
even though there's a chicken there

1108
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
even though there's a chicken there
 

1109
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,470
even though there's a chicken there
ready to go

1110
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480

 

1111
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,750

unless we i don't know because if we do

1112
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
unless we i don't know because if we do
 

1113
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,590
unless we i don't know because if we do
this

1114
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
this
 

1115
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,510
this
the chicken will go in right away and

1116
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
the chicken will go in right away and
 

1117
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,029
the chicken will go in right away and
the clock won't go for very long the

1118
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
the clock won't go for very long the
 

1119
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,710
the clock won't go for very long the
second time right

1120
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720

 

1121
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,070

well no because it's going to keep going

1122
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
well no because it's going to keep going
 

1123
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,070
well no because it's going to keep going
until it goes through the tripwire

1124
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080

 

1125
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,149

or until we send the cart back

1126
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
or until we send the cart back
 

1127
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,590
or until we send the cart back
i don't know i'll have to think about

1128
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
i don't know i'll have to think about
 

1129
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,590
i don't know i'll have to think about
this for a bit uh maybe one more thing

1130
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
this for a bit uh maybe one more thing
 

1131
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,310
this for a bit uh maybe one more thing
we could do

1132
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
we could do
 

1133
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,430
we could do
today quickly is i had this idea for

1134
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
today quickly is i had this idea for
 

1135
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,549
today quickly is i had this idea for
a minecart buffer because normally

1136
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
a minecart buffer because normally
 

1137
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,909
a minecart buffer because normally
with dispensers this is an idea that's

1138
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:03,919
with dispensers this is an idea that's
 

1139
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,110
with dispensers this is an idea that's
going to take me a while to figure out

1140
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
going to take me a while to figure out
 

1141
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,190
going to take me a while to figure out
by the way there's a lot to it

1142
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
by the way there's a lot to it
 

1143
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,750
by the way there's a lot to it
um i'm just doing it for the challenge

1144
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
um i'm just doing it for the challenge
 

1145
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,470
um i'm just doing it for the challenge
mostly not

1146
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
mostly not
 

1147
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,070
mostly not
because it's a practical system uh

1148
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
because it's a practical system uh
 

1149
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,590
because it's a practical system uh
although it might be who knows maybe if

1150
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
although it might be who knows maybe if
 

1151
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,350
although it might be who knows maybe if
i can perfect it enough it could

1152
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
i can perfect it enough it could
 

1153
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,310
i can perfect it enough it could
actually be good look at all those

1154
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
actually be good look at all those
 

1155
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,310
actually be good look at all those
failed experiments

1156
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
failed experiments
 

1157
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,470
failed experiments
normally you only have room for nine

1158
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
normally you only have room for nine
 

1159
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,430
normally you only have room for nine
mine carts

1160
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
mine carts
 

1161
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,830
mine carts
right uh it would be cool if i could

1162
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
right uh it would be cool if i could
 

1163
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,789
right uh it would be cool if i could
stock it

1164
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
stock it
 

1165
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,710
stock it
like four or five dispensers full so i'm

1166
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
like four or five dispensers full so i'm
 

1167
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,789
like four or five dispensers full so i'm
gonna try set something up for that

1168
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
gonna try set something up for that
 

1169
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,950
gonna try set something up for that
okay we're getting somewhere here this

1170
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
okay we're getting somewhere here this
 

1171
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,190
okay we're getting somewhere here this
is a rough

1172
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,200
is a rough
 

1173
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,669
is a rough
demonstration and example of my

1174
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
demonstration and example of my
 

1175
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,990
demonstration and example of my
idea so instead of having

1176
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
idea so instead of having
 

1177
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,669
idea so instead of having
room for just nine mine carts we now

1178
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
room for just nine mine carts we now
 

1179
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,149
room for just nine mine carts we now
have room for 18

1180
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
have room for 18
 

1181
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,110
have room for 18
and this is modular too so we could have

1182
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
and this is modular too so we could have
 

1183
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,510
and this is modular too so we could have
as many as we want

1184
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
as many as we want
 

1185
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,669
as many as we want
so here's the demonstration we've got

1186
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679
so here's the demonstration we've got
 

1187
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,710
so here's the demonstration we've got
detector rail

1188
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
detector rail
 

1189
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,230
detector rail
so if there's a mine cart in this

1190
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,240
so if there's a mine cart in this
 

1191
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,990
so if there's a mine cart in this
dispenser it'll go over that detector

1192
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
dispenser it'll go over that detector
 

1193
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,029
dispenser it'll go over that detector
rail

1194
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
rail
 

1195
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,070
rail
and then it does some sort of and gate

1196
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
and then it does some sort of and gate
 

1197
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,110
and then it does some sort of and gate
trickery here

1198
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120

 

1199
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,789

if there is a minecart you'll notice

1200
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
if there is a minecart you'll notice
 

1201
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,149
if there is a minecart you'll notice
this torch does not

1202
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
this torch does not
 

1203
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,190
this torch does not
come on

1204
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200

 

1205
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,950

that is important we're down to two

1206
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960

 

1207
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,190

last one and now

1208
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
last one and now
 

1209
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,669
last one and now
the other one comes on so that's

1210
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
the other one comes on so that's
 

1211
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,350
the other one comes on so that's
that's the basic idea and we could do

1212
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
that's the basic idea and we could do
 

1213
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,990
that's the basic idea and we could do
that for as many dispensers as we want

1214
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
that for as many dispensers as we want
 

1215
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,590
that for as many dispensers as we want
but now i want to compact it into a more

1216
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
but now i want to compact it into a more
 

1217
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,149
but now i want to compact it into a more
you know practical way because with this

1218
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
you know practical way because with this
 

1219
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,909
you know practical way because with this
this is kind of messy

1220
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
this is kind of messy
 

1221
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,590
this is kind of messy
so hopefully i can get some kind of

1222
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,600
so hopefully i can get some kind of
 

1223
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,750
so hopefully i can get some kind of
circular dispenser setup thing

1224
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
circular dispenser setup thing
 

1225
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,710
circular dispenser setup thing
instead of a linear style and that

1226
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
instead of a linear style and that
 

1227
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,830
instead of a linear style and that
should make it smaller

1228
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:54,840

 

1229
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,590

ta-da here it is uh i ran out of

1230
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
ta-da here it is uh i ran out of
 

1231
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,590
ta-da here it is uh i ran out of
recording time for today so this is as

1232
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,600
recording time for today so this is as
 

1233
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,110
recording time for today so this is as
far as i got

1234
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
far as i got
 

1235
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,710
far as i got
might be able to make it smaller if i

1236
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
might be able to make it smaller if i
 

1237
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,390
might be able to make it smaller if i
spent more time but

1238
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
spent more time but
 

1239
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,430
spent more time but
yeah it seems to work pretty good i got

1240
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
yeah it seems to work pretty good i got
 

1241
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,310
yeah it seems to work pretty good i got
two mine carts in each of these so let's

1242
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
two mine carts in each of these so let's
 

1243
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,590
two mine carts in each of these so let's
see it's that's a total of 27. it's a

1244
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
see it's that's a total of 27. it's a
 

1245
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,789
see it's that's a total of 27. it's a
triple buffer

1246
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
triple buffer
 

1247
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,230
triple buffer
or triple minecart dispenser so it goes

1248
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
or triple minecart dispenser so it goes
 

1249
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,510
or triple minecart dispenser so it goes
through that one

1250
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
through that one
 

1251
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,870
through that one
that one's empty now goes through that

1252
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
that one's empty now goes through that
 

1253
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,310
that one's empty now goes through that
one

1254
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,320

 

1255
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,149

oops careful

1256
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
oops careful
 

1257
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,510
oops careful
careful okay so that second one is empty

1258
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
careful okay so that second one is empty
 

1259
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,510
careful okay so that second one is empty
now goes to the third one

1260
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520

 

1261
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,669

and that's that's what we got so i might

1262
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
and that's that's what we got so i might
 

1263
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,110
and that's that's what we got so i might
use that

1264
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
use that
 

1265
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,710
use that
with our chicken set up if i want a

1266
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
with our chicken set up if i want a
 

1267
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,830
with our chicken set up if i want a
bigger minecart buffer because when

1268
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
bigger minecart buffer because when
 

1269
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,390
bigger minecart buffer because when
if if there's no mine cart in the

1270
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,400
if if there's no mine cart in the
 

1271
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,070
if if there's no mine cart in the
chicken recycler like if there's no

1272
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
chicken recycler like if there's no
 

1273
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,070
chicken recycler like if there's no
chicken and mine cart combo

1274
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
chicken and mine cart combo
 

1275
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,789
chicken and mine cart combo
i'll have to like we were messing around

1276
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:54,799
i'll have to like we were messing around
 

1277
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,630
i'll have to like we were messing around
with there create the chicken from an

1278
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
with there create the chicken from an
 

1279
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,190
with there create the chicken from an
egg

1280
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
egg
 

1281
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,750
egg
from a dispenser but we also need to

1282
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
from a dispenser but we also need to
 

1283
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,430
from a dispenser but we also need to
create a minecart from somewhere so that

1284
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
create a minecart from somewhere so that
 

1285
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,230
create a minecart from somewhere so that
will come from

1286
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
will come from
 

1287
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,430
will come from
a dispenser set up probably

1288
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
a dispenser set up probably
 

1289
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,430
a dispenser set up probably
unless i find some way to distribute

1290
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
unless i find some way to distribute
 

1291
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,789
unless i find some way to distribute
minecarts evenly

1292
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
minecarts evenly
 

1293
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,350
minecarts evenly
across my whole system but i'm not sure

1294
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,360
across my whole system but i'm not sure
 

1295
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,590
across my whole system but i'm not sure
how to do that

1296
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
how to do that
 

1297
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,549
how to do that
uh and this is the wiring so it goes

1298
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:18,559
uh and this is the wiring so it goes
 

1299
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,950
uh and this is the wiring so it goes
into this block the pulse

1300
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
into this block the pulse
 

1301
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,029
into this block the pulse
uh i had to be really careful with this

1302
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
uh i had to be really careful with this
 

1303
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,630
uh i had to be really careful with this
because there is that glitch with

1304
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:24,640
because there is that glitch with
 

1305
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,149
because there is that glitch with
dispensers where they can get

1306
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
dispensers where they can get
 

1307
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,470
dispensers where they can get
triggered if up if redstone updates

1308
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
triggered if up if redstone updates
 

1309
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,430
triggered if up if redstone updates
while it's powered

1310
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
while it's powered
 

1311
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,549
while it's powered
in in the area so

1312
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:32,559
in in the area so
 

1313
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,110
in in the area so
there's each of these has two wire

1314
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
there's each of these has two wire
 

1315
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,909
there's each of these has two wire
things

1316
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
things
 

1317
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,070
things
the one from the detector goes to this

1318
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
the one from the detector goes to this
 

1319
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,990
the one from the detector goes to this
block

1320
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
block
 

1321
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,830
block
and that block there prevents

1322
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
and that block there prevents
 

1323
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,350
and that block there prevents
or keeps these wires from connecting

1324
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
or keeps these wires from connecting
 

1325
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,269
or keeps these wires from connecting
but it goes to this block then

1326
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
but it goes to this block then
 

1327
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,710
but it goes to this block then
the wire here and to the left

1328
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
the wire here and to the left
 

1329
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,510
the wire here and to the left
powers this redstone torch and then

1330
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
powers this redstone torch and then
 

1331
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,389
powers this redstone torch and then
there's also an

1332
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
there's also an
 

1333
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,830
there's also an
inverted signal here on a two-tick delay

1334
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
inverted signal here on a two-tick delay
 

1335
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,669
inverted signal here on a two-tick delay
that goes to the same one

1336
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:03,679
that goes to the same one
 

1337
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,029
that goes to the same one
and then from that it goes to

1338
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
and then from that it goes to
 

1339
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,630
and then from that it goes to
this and then the cycle continues again

1340
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
this and then the cycle continues again
 

1341
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,110
this and then the cycle continues again
uh i think this is directional though

1342
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
uh i think this is directional though
 

1343
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,909
uh i think this is directional though
this setup

1344
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
this setup
 

1345
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,990
this setup
so if you want to make sure it works

1346
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
so if you want to make sure it works
 

1347
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,590
so if you want to make sure it works
every direction just make

1348
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
every direction just make
 

1349
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:25,029
every direction just make
this power rail there slope downwards

1350
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039

 

1351
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,630

and it can be a little tricky to set the

1352
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
and it can be a little tricky to set the
 

1353
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,950
and it can be a little tricky to set the
rails like this

1354
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
rails like this
 

1355
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,789
rails like this
so do something like that and you might

1356
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:30,799
so do something like that and you might
 

1357
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,950
so do something like that and you might
even be able to squeeze in a fourth one

1358
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:32,960
even be able to squeeze in a fourth one
 

1359
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,750
even be able to squeeze in a fourth one
somehow

1360
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
somehow
 

1361
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,269
somehow
if you do that

1362
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:37,279

 

1363
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,269

all right well that was fun we are back

1364
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
all right well that was fun we are back
 

1365
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,710
all right well that was fun we are back
home here in our lp

1366
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
home here in our lp
 

1367
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,590
home here in our lp
world i did start our tunnel a little

1368
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
world i did start our tunnel a little
 

1369
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,149
world i did start our tunnel a little
bit

1370
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:44,159
bit
 

1371
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,149
bit
didn't get too far ran out of blocks but

1372
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
didn't get too far ran out of blocks but
 

1373
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,269
didn't get too far ran out of blocks but
something like this i think is what

1374
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
something like this i think is what
 

1375
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,669
something like this i think is what
we're gonna go for

1376
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:51,679
we're gonna go for
 

1377
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,909
we're gonna go for
iron bars uh lighting in the ceiling

1378
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
iron bars uh lighting in the ceiling
 

1379
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:56,950
iron bars uh lighting in the ceiling
possibly or

1380
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
possibly or
 

1381
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,630
possibly or
behind iron bars we could also put

1382
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
behind iron bars we could also put
 

1383
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,149
behind iron bars we could also put
lighting although

1384
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
lighting although
 

1385
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,630
lighting although
in the open areas where there's no

1386
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
in the open areas where there's no
 

1387
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,590
in the open areas where there's no
netherrack walls

1388
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:05,600
netherrack walls
 

1389
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,669
netherrack walls
we won't be able to put lighting behind

1390
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
we won't be able to put lighting behind
 

1391
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,950
we won't be able to put lighting behind
the iron bars so it would make more

1392
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
the iron bars so it would make more
 

1393
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,110
the iron bars so it would make more
sense to put it in the ceiling

1394
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
sense to put it in the ceiling
 

1395
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,630
sense to put it in the ceiling
or even in the floor we could hide it

1396
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
or even in the floor we could hide it
 

1397
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,070
or even in the floor we could hide it
but this design is gas proof

1398
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080

 

1399
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,830

yeah yeah it is it's gas proof

1400
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:24,840
yeah yeah it is it's gas proof
 

1401
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,430
yeah yeah it is it's gas proof
and what was it going to say

1402
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
and what was it going to say
 

1403
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,029
and what was it going to say
should prevent zombie pigmen from

1404
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
should prevent zombie pigmen from
 

1405
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,510
should prevent zombie pigmen from
spawning fairly well

1406
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:31,520
spawning fairly well
 

1407
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,149
spawning fairly well
if we put if we do it like we have here

1408
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
if we put if we do it like we have here
 

1409
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,909
if we put if we do it like we have here
where we have a s

1410
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
where we have a s
 

1411
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,830
where we have a s
there there oh i use the stair

1412
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:38,840
there there oh i use the stair
 

1413
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,990
there there oh i use the stair
interesting

1414
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
interesting
 

1415
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,750
interesting
it's not a full block because that's

1416
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
it's not a full block because that's
 

1417
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,750
it's not a full block because that's
two blocks on each side of the rail at

1418
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
two blocks on each side of the rail at
 

1419
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,269
two blocks on each side of the rail at
least which is

1420
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
least which is
 

1421
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,070
least which is
decent zombie pigmen spawn on the track

1422
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,080
decent zombie pigmen spawn on the track
 

1423
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:58,310
decent zombie pigmen spawn on the track
though it's gonna cause a lot of trouble

1424
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320

 

1425
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,230

cool well let's go read the comments

1426
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
cool well let's go read the comments
 

1427
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,990

looks exactly the same

1442
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159

 

1443
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,590

let's check on them make sure they're

1444
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
let's check on them make sure they're
 

1445
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,669
let's check on them make sure they're
still here

1446
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:29,679
still here
 

1447
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,230
still here
yeah there's one there's the other guy

1448
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
yeah there's one there's the other guy
 

1449
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,909
yeah there's one there's the other guy
okay so we still got our two villagers

1450
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:33,919
okay so we still got our two villagers
 

1451
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,350
okay so we still got our two villagers
here

1452
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,360
here
 

1453
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,269
here
uh still thinking of plans for this

1454
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
uh still thinking of plans for this
 

1455
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,950
uh still thinking of plans for this
place what i want to do

1456
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
place what i want to do
 

1457
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,549
place what i want to do
i think the mistake i made with this

1458
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,559
i think the mistake i made with this
 

1459
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,870
i think the mistake i made with this
place is trying to make a big open area

1460
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
place is trying to make a big open area
 

1461
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,310
place is trying to make a big open area
underground and

1462
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,320
underground and
 

1463
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,310
underground and
and to make it worse i made these very

1464
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
and to make it worse i made these very
 

1465
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,149
and to make it worse i made these very
large buildings

1466
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
large buildings
 

1467
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,389
large buildings
for the villagers so it's a double

1468
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:52,399
for the villagers so it's a double
 

1469
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,430
for the villagers so it's a double
whammy what i need to do

1470
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
whammy what i need to do
 

1471
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,230
whammy what i need to do
i'm gonna make a big open area here and

1472
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
i'm gonna make a big open area here and
 

1473
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,430
i'm gonna make a big open area here and
then start making narrow

1474
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
then start making narrow
 

1475
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,389
then start making narrow
like tunnels or caves with smaller

1476
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
like tunnels or caves with smaller
 

1477
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,789
like tunnels or caves with smaller
houses and i think that branch off from

1478
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
houses and i think that branch off from
 

1479
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,830
houses and i think that branch off from
this

1480
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
this
 

1481
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,590
this
i think that's what i need to do to fix

1482
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,600
i think that's what i need to do to fix
 

1483
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,750
i think that's what i need to do to fix
this project

1484
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
this project
 

1485
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,830
this project
but yeah once i start it i can't stop

1486
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
but yeah once i start it i can't stop
 

1487
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,310
but yeah once i start it i can't stop
because i'm going to open up all these

1488
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
because i'm going to open up all these
 

1489
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,029
because i'm going to open up all these
mine shafts and that and zombies will

1490
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
mine shafts and that and zombies will
 

1491
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,630
mine shafts and that and zombies will
come flooding in here

1492
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
come flooding in here
 

1493
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,789
come flooding in here
so i have to be careful when i start it

1494
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
so i have to be careful when i start it
 

1495
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,389
so i have to be careful when i start it
but yeah let's move on to

1496
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
but yeah let's move on to
 

1497
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,909
but yeah let's move on to
today's question

1498
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
today's question
 

1499
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,310
today's question

ah this is this is a good question i
 

1509
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,830
ah this is this is a good question i
could talk about this for a long time

1510
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840

about being on the server if i was asked

1682
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
about being on the server if i was asked
 

1683
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,069
about being on the server if i was asked
