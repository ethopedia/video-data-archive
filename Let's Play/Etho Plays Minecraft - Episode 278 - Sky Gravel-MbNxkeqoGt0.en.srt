to replace all the gravel with saplings
 

109
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,929
to replace all the gravel with saplings
so we have saplings all over the surface

110
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:10,939
so we have saplings all over the surface
 

111
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,750
so we have saplings all over the surface
of the world here I thought it might

112
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
of the world here I thought it might
 

113
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,309
of the world here I thought it might
like the game but it's actually not bad

114
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:15,319
like the game but it's actually not bad
 

115
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,699
like the game but it's actually not bad
like that's a lot of stuff to to render

116
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:18,709
like that's a lot of stuff to to render
 

117
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,219
like that's a lot of stuff to to render
as it's not solid blocks anymore we're

118
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:21,229
as it's not solid blocks anymore we're
 

119
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,589
as it's not solid blocks anymore we're
dealing with saplings

120
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
dealing with saplings
 

121
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,199
dealing with saplings
there's a lot more a lot more rendering

122
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,209
there's a lot more a lot more rendering
 

123
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,170
there's a lot more a lot more rendering
to them I think but yeah we're okay here

124
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,180
to them I think but yeah we're okay here
 

125
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,899
to them I think but yeah we're okay here
so now once I turn it today the saplings

126
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:34,909
so now once I turn it today the saplings
 

127
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:37,659
so now once I turn it today the saplings
should start to do something pretty cool

128
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:37,669
should start to do something pretty cool
 

129
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,339
should start to do something pretty cool
I think time sit no no no I always do

130
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:42,349
I think time sit no no no I always do
 

131
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,800
I think time sit no no no I always do
that set time zero oh I did have it

132
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:47,810
that set time zero oh I did have it
 

133
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,189
that set time zero oh I did have it
right it's good it confuses me I don't

134
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:51,199
right it's good it confuses me I don't
 

135
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,250
right it's good it confuses me I don't
know why I always mix them up time set

136
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,260
know why I always mix them up time set
 

137
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,170
know why I always mix them up time set
zero okay now this might get kind of

138
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,180
zero okay now this might get kind of
 

139
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,129
zero okay now this might get kind of
crazy we'll see because they can grow

140
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:03,139
crazy we'll see because they can grow
 

141
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,330
crazy we'll see because they can grow
now yeah I think they're starting to

142
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:04,340
now yeah I think they're starting to
 

143
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,679
now yeah I think they're starting to
grow actually and some of them are going

144
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:08,689
grow actually and some of them are going
 

145
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:14,409
grow actually and some of them are going
to become big trees which will prevent

146
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:14,419
to become big trees which will prevent
 

147
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,120
to become big trees which will prevent
some saplings from growing so it might

148
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,130
some saplings from growing so it might
 

149
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,490
some saplings from growing so it might
create kind of interesting patterns too

150
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:20,500

 

151
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,920

I almost I think I maybe should do a

152
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:22,930
I almost I think I maybe should do a
 

153
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,090
I almost I think I maybe should do a
time-lapse of this it's cool though you

154
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,100
time-lapse of this it's cool though you
 

155
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,220
time-lapse of this it's cool though you
seem popping up all over the place it's

156
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,230
seem popping up all over the place it's
 

157
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,750
seem popping up all over the place it's
not happening as quick as I thought it

158
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:30,760
not happening as quick as I thought it
 

159
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,100
not happening as quick as I thought it
would but it's still pretty quick all

160
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,110
would but it's still pretty quick all
 

161
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,500
would but it's still pretty quick all
right I tell you what I'm going to maybe

162
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,510
right I tell you what I'm going to maybe
 

163
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,560

get down a little lower over here I'm

164
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,570
get down a little lower over here I'm
 

165
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,790
get down a little lower over here I'm
going to do a time-lapse of this and

166
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:43,800
going to do a time-lapse of this and
 

167
00:04:43,800 --> 00:06:11,300
going to do a time-lapse of this and
here we go

168
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,310

 

169
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,580

and this is what it looks like after

170
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:14,590
and this is what it looks like after
 

171
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,520
and this is what it looks like after
about 30 minutes that time-lapse was I

172
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,530
about 30 minutes that time-lapse was I
 

173
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,980
about 30 minutes that time-lapse was I
think 11 minutes spit up eight times the

174
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:19,990
think 11 minutes spit up eight times the
 

175
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,219
think 11 minutes spit up eight times the
speed and that is a forest man I really

176
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:26,229
speed and that is a forest man I really
 

177
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:27,719
speed and that is a forest man I really
want to burn this down but I don't think

178
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:27,729
want to burn this down but I don't think
 

179
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,360
want to burn this down but I don't think
I can handle it

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,370
I can handle it
 

181
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,879
I can handle it

271
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,410
fact they're in the way so I would have
to lower this all and make a bunch of

272
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:46,420
to lower this all and make a bunch of
 

273
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,060

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,829
into the walls like yes so I brought a
whole ton of stuff over here we're going

350
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:46,839
whole ton of stuff over here we're going
 

351
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,210
whole ton of stuff over here we're going
to get to it where would there be a

352
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,220

479
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,350
yeah I like that let's add some
trapdoors and stuff to it to put those

480
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:04,360
trapdoors and stuff to it to put those
 

481
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,740
trapdoors and stuff to it to put those
back alright guys so there we go that is

482
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:10,750
back alright guys so there we go that is
 

483
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,680
back alright guys so there we go that is
our first house done pretty much more or

484
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,690
our first house done pretty much more or
 

485
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,810
our first house done pretty much more or
less I would probably do the interiors

486
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:15,820
less I would probably do the interiors
 

487
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,810
less I would probably do the interiors
as I had time but the main focus is just

488
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:18,820
as I had time but the main focus is just
 

489
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,370
as I had time but the main focus is just
to make it look nice on the outside here

490
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:20,380
to make it look nice on the outside here
 

491
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,440
to make it look nice on the outside here
what do you guys think about doing a

492
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,450
what do you guys think about doing a
 

493
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,090
what do you guys think about doing a
village this way

494
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,100
village this way
 

495
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,250
village this way
I would be able to build it pretty quick

496
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,260
I would be able to build it pretty quick
 

497
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,000
I would be able to build it pretty quick
I would think and we're going to make it

498
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,010
I would think and we're going to make it
 

499
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,190
I would think and we're going to make it
a functioning village to like the idea

500
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,200
a functioning village to like the idea
 

501
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:39,840
a functioning village to like the idea
is we will need to how probably put a

502
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:39,850
is we will need to how probably put a
 

503
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,550
is we will need to how probably put a
skylight in right here so the door

504
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,560
skylight in right here so the door
 

505
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,370
skylight in right here so the door
counts as an actual working door and we

506
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:44,380
counts as an actual working door and we
 

507
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,460
counts as an actual working door and we
might want to add another two or three

508
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,470
might want to add another two or three
 

509
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,400
might want to add another two or three
or four or five doors on the inside of

510
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,410
or four or five doors on the inside of
 

511
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,090
or four or five doors on the inside of
here like on another wall like this that

512
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,100
here like on another wall like this that
 

513
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,990
here like on another wall like this that
then go outside here and have another

514
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
then go outside here and have another
 

515
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,530
then go outside here and have another
skylight up above here so there would be

516
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:00,540
skylight up above here so there would be
 

517
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,199
skylight up above here so there would be
per house maybe six doors or

518
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:04,209
per house maybe six doors or
 

519
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,119
per house maybe six doors or
that are working and that way it'll

520
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:06,129
that are working and that way it'll
 

521
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,939
that are working and that way it'll
function like a real village I'm pretty

522
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:08,949
function like a real village I'm pretty
 

523
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:13,410
function like a real village I'm pretty
sure and the idea is the same as like

524
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:13,420
sure and the idea is the same as like
 

525
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,910
sure and the idea is the same as like
what we had at Emerald village I don't

526
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:14,920
what we had at Emerald village I don't
 

527
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,919
what we had at Emerald village I don't
want to just build houses I want to make

528
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:16,929
want to just build houses I want to make
 

529
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,840
want to just build houses I want to make
it I want to be able to control the

530
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:18,850
it I want to be able to control the
 

531
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,720
it I want to be able to control the
villagers like set up farms that they

532
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:21,730
villagers like set up farms that they
 

533
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,999
villagers like set up farms that they
harvest whenever they feel like it and

534
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,009
harvest whenever they feel like it and
 

535
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:26,730
harvest whenever they feel like it and
have that's not really me controlling

536
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:26,740
have that's not really me controlling
 

537
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,040
have that's not really me controlling
them I want them to interact with

538
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,050
them I want them to interact with
 

539
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,639
them I want them to interact with
redstone stuff is what I'm saying and

540
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:32,649
redstone stuff is what I'm saying and
 

541
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,069
redstone stuff is what I'm saying and
have them do stuff on their own like for

542
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:35,079
have them do stuff on their own like for
 

543
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,809
have them do stuff on their own like for
example one of the main things I want to

544
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:36,819
example one of the main things I want to
 

545
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:40,980
example one of the main things I want to
try to do is set up a rail cart system

546
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:40,990
try to do is set up a rail cart system
 

547
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,840
try to do is set up a rail cart system
where they're able to enter the mine

548
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:42,850
where they're able to enter the mine
 

549
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,809
where they're able to enter the mine
carts on their own have them deep parts

550
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:45,819
carts on their own have them deep parts
 

551
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:49,259
carts on their own have them deep parts
on their own and then have them like get

552
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:49,269
on their own and then have them like get
 

553
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:52,319
on their own and then have them like get
off at a stop on their own like it's all

554
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:52,329
off at a stop on their own like it's all
 

555
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,530
off at a stop on their own like it's all
possible with redstone now and hoppers

556
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:55,540
possible with redstone now and hoppers
 

557
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,929
possible with redstone now and hoppers
and stuff for them to do that no problem

558
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:57,939
and stuff for them to do that no problem
 

559
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,290
and stuff for them to do that no problem
and this is within range so I think I

560
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,300
and this is within range so I think I
 

561
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,489
and this is within range so I think I
could set up where they even come visit

562
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:02,499
could set up where they even come visit
 

563
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:05,210
could set up where they even come visit
me at my man cave over there it's only

564
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:05,220
me at my man cave over there it's only
 

565
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,500
me at my man cave over there it's only
less than a hundred blocks away I think

566
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,510
less than a hundred blocks away I think
 

567
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,949
less than a hundred blocks away I think
so

568
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:07,959
so
 

569
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,919
so
they could like let's pop in for a visit

570
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:10,929
they could like let's pop in for a visit
 

571
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,720
they could like let's pop in for a visit
and then go back to their village I

572
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:12,730
and then go back to their village I
 

573
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,579
and then go back to their village I
think be pretty cool but that's the idea

574
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:17,589
think be pretty cool but that's the idea
 

575
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,919
think be pretty cool but that's the idea
I might try set up some more houses here

576
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:19,929
I might try set up some more houses here
 

577
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:22,139
I might try set up some more houses here
before we move on to something else just

578
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:22,149
before we move on to something else just
 

579
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:29,000
before we move on to something else just
on my own too dark must be too dark I

580
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,010
on my own too dark must be too dark I
 

581
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,769
on my own too dark must be too dark I
think yellow flowers are taller aren't

582
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:31,779
think yellow flowers are taller aren't
 

583
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:39,480
think yellow flowers are taller aren't
they huh and it won't be just houses

584
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,490
they huh and it won't be just houses
 

585
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,710
they huh and it won't be just houses
like I said it'll be farms and other

586
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
like I said it'll be farms and other
 

587
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,549
like I said it'll be farms and other
stuff houses will be spaced out every so

588
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
stuff houses will be spaced out every so
 

589
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,460
stuff houses will be spaced out every so
often where it looks like they they

590
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:47,470
often where it looks like they they
 

591
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,500
often where it looks like they they
would fit in like any flat wall I see

592
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,510
would fit in like any flat wall I see
 

593
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,260
would fit in like any flat wall I see
I'll probably add a house and try change

594
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,270
I'll probably add a house and try change
 

595
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,970
I'll probably add a house and try change

00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,399
of different colors here for four
different colors of houses but yeah

600
00:17:59,399 --> 00:17:59,409
different colors of houses but yeah
 

601
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:00,210
different colors of houses but yeah
that's the idea

602
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,220
that's the idea
 

603
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,399
that's the idea
I will work on this a little bit more

so wonderful I do not know if I don't
really like the dirt under here I don't

630
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:36,279
really like the dirt under here I don't
 

631
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,000
really like the dirt under here I don't
know what else to use though I could put

632
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,010
know what else to use though I could put
 

633
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,060
know what else to use though I could put

and right arrows anymore you have to
 

785
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,850
and right arrows anymore you have to
just hold it forward and steer with your

786
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:39,860
just hold it forward and steer with your
 

787

maneuvering with it all right so this is
 

793
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,240
maneuvering with it all right so this is
the river I made basically and then it

794
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,250
the river I made basically and then it
 

795
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,760
the river I made basically and then it
goes out to here this is the you got a

796
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:53,770
goes out to here this is the you got a
 

797
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,670
goes out to here this is the you got a
third place this is also where the

798
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:56,680
third place this is also where the
 

799
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,590
third place this is also where the
fireworks get launched outside of this

800
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:58,600
fireworks get launched outside of this
 

801
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,330
fireworks get launched outside of this
lake and eventually I'm going to hook up

802
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,340
lake and eventually I'm going to hook up
 

803
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,730
lake and eventually I'm going to hook up
this waterway to go behind these

804
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:05,740
this waterway to go behind these
 

805
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,880
this waterway to go behind these
mountains and and out into that area

806
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:08,890
mountains and and out into that area
 

807
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,900
mountains and and out into that area
where I found the horses if I can oh

808
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:11,910
where I found the horses if I can oh
 

809
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,800
where I found the horses if I can oh
this is not gonna end well

810
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:13,810
this is not gonna end well
 

811
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:23,250
this is not gonna end well
oh man oh let's get out of here

812
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,260
oh man oh let's get out of here
 

813
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,220
oh man oh let's get out of here
I'm not well-equipped that's not gonna

814
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,230
I'm not well-equipped that's not gonna
 

815
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm not well-equipped that's not gonna
work

816
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,770

 

817
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:35,760

let's just uh let's take a boost all

818
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:35,770
let's just uh let's take a boost all
 

819
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,510
let's just uh let's take a boost all
right so the goal this is what we're

820
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
right so the goal this is what we're
 

821
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,190
right so the goal this is what we're
going to do today or start to do today

822
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
going to do today or start to do today
 

823
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:51,630
going to do today or start to do today
let's go back out to here

824
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:51,640

 

825
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,060

all right so we have the bridge it goes

826
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,070
all right so we have the bridge it goes
 

827
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:59,490
all right so we have the bridge it goes
across the river over there ideally what

828
00:23:59,490 --> 00:23:59,500
across the river over there ideally what
 

829
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,440
across the river over there ideally what
I would like to be able to do is ride my

830
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,450
I would like to be able to do is ride my
 

831
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,010
I would like to be able to do is ride my
boat into the man cave so the bridge is

832
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,020
boat into the man cave so the bridge is
 

833
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:11,190
boat into the man cave so the bridge is
here we go down the stairs oh I went too

834
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
here we go down the stairs oh I went too
 

835
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,720
here we go down the stairs oh I went too
far this is how we get in and out of the

836
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:15,730
far this is how we get in and out of the
 

837
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,400
far this is how we get in and out of the
cave we should make it so there's like a

838
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,410
cave we should make it so there's like a
 

839
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,860
cave we should make it so there's like a
departure and a rival thing for the

840
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:22,870
departure and a rival thing for the
 

841
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,810
departure and a rival thing for the
water weight on the left and right of

842
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:24,820
water weight on the left and right of
 

843
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,100
water weight on the left and right of
these stairs I think that would be

844
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,110
these stairs I think that would be
 

845
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,040
these stairs I think that would be
pretty cool so if we want to use the

846
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,050
pretty cool so if we want to use the
 

847
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,750
pretty cool so if we want to use the
river as our transport we just hop in a

848
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:30,760
river as our transport we just hop in a
 

849
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,040
river as our transport we just hop in a
boat to the right here and they'll take

850
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,050
boat to the right here and they'll take
 

851
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:38,190
boat to the right here and they'll take
us up and out to our river out here

852
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,200
us up and out to our river out here
 

853
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,060
us up and out to our river out here
somewhere so to enter the cave and the

854
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,070
somewhere so to enter the cave and the
 

855
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,450
somewhere so to enter the cave and the
mobs man the mobs to enter the cave

856
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:48,460
mobs man the mobs to enter the cave
 

857
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,950
mobs man the mobs to enter the cave
let's try to make some kind of a rival

858
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
let's try to make some kind of a rival
 

859
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,100
let's try to make some kind of a rival
station here if we can it doesn't have

860
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,110
station here if we can it doesn't have
 

861
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,600
station here if we can it doesn't have
to be anything fancy it could just be a

862
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:00,610
to be anything fancy it could just be a
 

863
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,970
to be anything fancy it could just be a
water drop that then takes us in okay so

864
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:05,980
water drop that then takes us in okay so
 

865
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,050
water drop that then takes us in okay so
I was wondering if you would hit

866
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,060
I was wondering if you would hit
 

867
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,330
I was wondering if you would hit
anything that's the the Cal UFO thing we

868
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:12,340
anything that's the the Cal UFO thing we
 

869
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,720
anything that's the the Cal UFO thing we
go straight the swing now where's that

870
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:15,730
go straight the swing now where's that
 

871
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,910
go straight the swing now where's that
going to take us are we high enough up

872
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:17,920
going to take us are we high enough up
 

873
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,170
going to take us are we high enough up
or low enough down I mean doesn't look

874
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,180
or low enough down I mean doesn't look
 

875
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:31,539
or low enough down I mean doesn't look
like it's where is this

876
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:31,549

 

877
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,779

mm should've checked okay so these are

878
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:35,789
mm should've checked okay so these are
 

879
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:38,510
mm should've checked okay so these are
the stairs here got to keep going a

880
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:38,520
the stairs here got to keep going a
 

881
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,730
the stairs here got to keep going a
little further it looks like oh so we're

882
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:40,740
little further it looks like oh so we're
 

883
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,270
little further it looks like oh so we're
still a little bit too high up that's

884
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:44,280
still a little bit too high up that's
 

885
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,180
still a little bit too high up that's
fine we can work with that

886
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,190

 

887
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,400

all right so we'll arrive here depart

888
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,410
all right so we'll arrive here depart
 

889
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,980
all right so we'll arrive here depart
here and dig another tunnel out and see

890
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:54,990
here and dig another tunnel out and see
 

891
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,659
here and dig another tunnel out and see
how that's next hopefully we don't hit

892
00:25:59,659 --> 00:25:59,669
how that's next hopefully we don't hit
 

893
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,909
how that's next hopefully we don't hit
anything here we might hit aah that is

894
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
anything here we might hit aah that is
 

895
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,899
anything here we might hit aah that is
there darn it that is the stair tasting

896
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:05,909
there darn it that is the stair tasting
 

897
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:16,399
there darn it that is the stair tasting
for the spider elevator I don't know how

898
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:16,409
for the spider elevator I don't know how
 

899
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,350
for the spider elevator I don't know how
to get around that we might just have to

900
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:18,360
to get around that we might just have to
 

901
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,539
to get around that we might just have to
do it all on the left side then okay

902
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:23,549
do it all on the left side then okay
 

903
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:26,149
do it all on the left side then okay
it's not super fancy but it'll do for

904
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
it's not super fancy but it'll do for
 

905
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,149
it's not super fancy but it'll do for
now anyway I got the return line just

906
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:29,159
now anyway I got the return line just
 

907
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,100
now anyway I got the return line just
about done here I have no way of sending

908
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,110
about done here I have no way of sending
 

909
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:39,500
about done here I have no way of sending
boats out though not yet but would a lot

910
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:39,510
boats out though not yet but would a lot
 

911
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,899
boats out though not yet but would a lot
of these melted we'll try to get it to

912
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:41,909
of these melted we'll try to get it to
 

913
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:44,659
of these melted we'll try to get it to
work

914
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:44,669

 

915
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,220

probably won't make the water come

916
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,230
probably won't make the water come
 

917
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,169
probably won't make the water come
although all this way out here we'll

918
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:48,179
although all this way out here we'll
 

919
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,700
although all this way out here we'll
probably have a walkway of some sorts

920
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:49,710
probably have a walkway of some sorts
 

921
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,600
probably have a walkway of some sorts
and then have a departure and arrival on

922
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:53,610
and then have a departure and arrival on
 

923
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,419
and then have a departure and arrival on
that side but let's try out the book

924
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:56,429
that side but let's try out the book
 

925
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:58,039
that side but let's try out the book
drop make sure we don't take damage or

926
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:58,049
drop make sure we don't take damage or
 

927
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,470
drop make sure we don't take damage or
anything

928
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,480
anything
 

929
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,810
anything
see how fluently we can get into it from

930
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:02,820
see how fluently we can get into it from
 

931
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,950
see how fluently we can get into it from
the river to let's pretend this is like

932
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
the river to let's pretend this is like
 

933
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,560
the river to let's pretend this is like
an actual boat ride with a long rope

934
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:12,570
an actual boat ride with a long rope
 

935
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:19,970
an actual boat ride with a long rope
with a long build up speed yeah okay

936
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:19,980
with a long build up speed yeah okay
 

937
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,320
with a long build up speed yeah okay
here we go it's getting light here I'm

938
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,330
here we go it's getting light here I'm
 

939
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,149
here we go it's getting light here I'm
losing my mind

940
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:22,159
losing my mind
 

941
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,950
losing my mind
um to do try to make this a little more

942
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:27,960
um to do try to make this a little more
 

943
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,880
um to do try to make this a little more
fancy - oh it exploded

944
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:33,890
fancy - oh it exploded
 

945
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:42,039
fancy - oh it exploded
that's not good hmm I gotta admit I

946
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:42,049
that's not good hmm I gotta admit I
 

947
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,430
that's not good hmm I gotta admit I
don't know much about boats anymore

948
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:44,440
don't know much about boats anymore
 

949
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,139
don't know much about boats anymore
they've changed so much um I it did look

950
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:50,149
they've changed so much um I it did look
 

951
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:53,529
they've changed so much um I it did look
like I hit the wall on an angle and like

952
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:53,539
