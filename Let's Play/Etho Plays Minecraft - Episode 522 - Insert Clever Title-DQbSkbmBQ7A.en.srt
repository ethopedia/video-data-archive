check over here I think they're gonna
 

25
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,049
check over here I think they're gonna
spawn above ground how did you get on

26
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,059
spawn above ground how did you get on
 

27
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,160
spawn above ground how did you get on
the other side did you climb up here and

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
platform here to spawn mobs in and over
 

59
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:45,230

time I just filled up haha

60
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,240
time I just filled up haha
 

61
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,270
time I just filled up haha
all right we found them guys it took

62
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
all right we found them guys it took
 

63
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,980
all right we found them guys it took
quite a while I like I looked through

64
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:48,990
quite a while I like I looked through
 

65
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,870
quite a while I like I looked through
the caves for so long and it's like you

66
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
the caves for so long and it's like you
 

67
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,570
the caves for so long and it's like you
know they must spot on the surface right

68
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:52,580
know they must spot on the surface right
 

69
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,620
know they must spot on the surface right
even though it's an underground village

70
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,630
even though it's an underground village
 

71
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,390
even though it's an underground village
I think they still spot on the surface

72
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:56,400
I think they still spot on the surface
 

73
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,609
I think they still spot on the surface
so I checked the surface again and they

74
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:58,619
so I checked the surface again and they
 

75
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,070
so I checked the surface again and they
were like hiding in the corner here most

76
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,080
were like hiding in the corner here most
 

77
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,440
were like hiding in the corner here most
of them so they can't get to the village

78
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,450
of them so they can't get to the village
 

79
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,620
of them so they can't get to the village
which is like over here ish yeah right

80
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:09,630
which is like over here ish yeah right
 

81
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,910
which is like over here ish yeah right
over here is the village like underneath

82
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
over here is the village like underneath
 

83
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,020
over here is the village like underneath
and like they have no interest in me

84
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,030
and like they have no interest in me
 

85
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,340
and like they have no interest in me
which is also pretty interesting maybe

86
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,350
which is also pretty interesting maybe
 

87
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,530
which is also pretty interesting maybe
until I hit them then they might change

88
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:18,540
until I hit them then they might change
 

89
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,020
until I hit them then they might change
your mind

90
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,030
your mind
 

91
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,430
your mind
now it looks like they they're just so

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:23,880
focused on trying to get to the village
 

95
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,900

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,200
favorite thing about updates though is
 

99
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,509
favorite thing about updates though is
just trying to figure out the new game

100
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:29,519
just trying to figure out the new game
 

101
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,750
just trying to figure out the new game
mechanics so we have the next wave of

102
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:32,760
mechanics so we have the next wave of
 

103
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
mechanics so we have the next wave of
guys here they're kind of hanging around

104
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,170
guys here they're kind of hanging around
 

105
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,110
guys here they're kind of hanging around
up right above the village the center of

106
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,120
up right above the village the center of
 

107
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,440
up right above the village the center of
the village I'm kind of curious if we

108
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,450
the village I'm kind of curious if we
 

109
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,940
the village I'm kind of curious if we
send them through another portal does

110
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:40,950
send them through another portal does
 

111
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,550
send them through another portal does
that count is like removing them from

112
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,560
that count is like removing them from
 

113
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,740
that count is like removing them from
the wave like will the next place start

114
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:45,750
the wave like will the next place start
 

115
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,620
the wave like will the next place start
then or do we actually have to kill them

116
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:47,630
then or do we actually have to kill them
 

117
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,030
then or do we actually have to kill them
so we're gonna let them just like wander

118
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,040
so we're gonna let them just like wander
 

119
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,090
so we're gonna let them just like wander
through on their own that caused a lot

120
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,100
through on their own that caused a lot
 

121
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,460
through on their own that caused a lot
of leg do you see that oh just the first

122
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:55,470
of leg do you see that oh just the first
 

123
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,840
of leg do you see that oh just the first
one okay so there's looking for a place

124
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:56,850
one okay so there's looking for a place
 

125
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,750
one okay so there's looking for a place
to place the portal I guess but then

126
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
to place the portal I guess but then
 

127
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
to place the portal I guess but then
after that they should kind of just like

128
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:01,850
after that they should kind of just like
 

129
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,890
after that they should kind of just like
figure out how to get to the nether on

130
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:03,900
figure out how to get to the nether on
 

131
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,099
figure out how to get to the nether on
their own there it looks like the Raider

132
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:07,109
their own there it looks like the Raider
 

133
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:09,900
their own there it looks like the Raider
count is dropping it's only one left

134
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:09,910
count is dropping it's only one left
 

135
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:16,280
count is dropping it's only one left
I think we started a new raid wave here

136
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,290

 

137
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,660

yeah so that seems to work actually once

138
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:18,670
yeah so that seems to work actually once
 

139
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,100
yeah so that seems to work actually once
all the leaders went through the nether

140
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,110
all the leaders went through the nether
 

141
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,230
all the leaders went through the nether
portal the next wave started and in that

142
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,240
portal the next wave started and in that
 

143
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,500
portal the next wave started and in that
next wave we got a Ravager who is a

144
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,510
next wave we got a Ravager who is a
 

145
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,300
next wave we got a Ravager who is a
friendly because he can't find the

146
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,310
friendly because he can't find the
 

147
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,430
friendly because he can't find the
village so he's not trying to attack us

148
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
village so he's not trying to attack us
 

149
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,280
village so he's not trying to attack us
oh he's not friendly he's neutral right

150
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,290
oh he's not friendly he's neutral right

I don't think you can attach leads to
them because they are actually hostile

least like eight down here but it was a
pretty hard blow

322
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,350
pretty hard blow
 

323
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,980
pretty hard blow
oh yeah and just to clarify the illah

324
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:23,990
oh yeah and just to clarify the illah
 

325
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,840
oh yeah and just to clarify the illah
Jers didn't actually spawn underground

326
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,850
Jers didn't actually spawn underground
 

327
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,090
Jers didn't actually spawn underground
they fell down those holes and survived

328
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,100
they fell down those holes and survived
 

329
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,310
they fell down those holes and survived
the fall and then they proceeded to kill

330
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,320
the fall and then they proceeded to kill
 

331
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,969
the fall and then they proceeded to kill
like most of the villagers haha anyways

332
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:33,979
like most of the villagers haha anyways
 

333
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,469
like most of the villagers haha anyways
this is what I was working on before I

334
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:35,479
this is what I was working on before I
 

335
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,710
this is what I was working on before I
got distracted it's like an endless wave

336
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:38,720
got distracted it's like an endless wave
 

337
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,510
got distracted it's like an endless wave
of ill udders by the way like it's still

338
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:40,520
of ill udders by the way like it's still
 

339
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,690
of ill udders by the way like it's still
going on I just left like every time I

340
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:43,700
going on I just left like every time I
 

341
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,370
going on I just left like every time I
go check out the village another wave

342
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:45,380
go check out the village another wave
 

343
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,570
go check out the village another wave
starts it's like okay what do I do I

344
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:49,580
starts it's like okay what do I do I
 

345
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,780
starts it's like okay what do I do I
kill off the wave I get the bad omen

346
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:52,790
kill off the wave I get the bad omen
 

347
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,920
kill off the wave I get the bad omen
effect then I check out the village

348
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:53,930
effect then I check out the village
 

349
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,160
effect then I check out the village
again and it starts a new wave and I

350
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,170
again and it starts a new wave and I
 

351
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,090
again and it starts a new wave and I
don't know it's just like an endless

352
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,100
don't know it's just like an endless
 

353
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,770
don't know it's just like an endless
loop so yeah anyway so we're still in

354
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:02,780
loop so yeah anyway so we're still in
 

355
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,250
loop so yeah anyway so we're still in
the testing and setup setup stage for

356
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,260
the testing and setup setup stage for
 

357
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,500
the testing and setup setup stage for
this tree farm we're about to possibly

358
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:11,510
this tree farm we're about to possibly
 

359
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,390
this tree farm we're about to possibly
blow it up if I did something wrong here

360
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:13,400
blow it up if I did something wrong here
 

361
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,150
blow it up if I did something wrong here
we'll find out so I figured we would we

362
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
we'll find out so I figured we would we
 

363
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,010
we'll find out so I figured we would we
should start recording this oh I missed

364
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,020
should start recording this oh I missed
 

365
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,960
should start recording this oh I missed
one repeater here too okay let's go back

366
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:22,970
one repeater here too okay let's go back
 

367
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,220
one repeater here too okay let's go back
up I guess we'll just fly up but yeah

368
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,230
up I guess we'll just fly up but yeah
 

369
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,650
up I guess we'll just fly up but yeah
this this tree farm is going to be

370
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:29,660
this this tree farm is going to be
 

371
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,450
this this tree farm is going to be
pretty nice for us I think I'm gonna be

372
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:31,460
pretty nice for us I think I'm gonna be
 

373
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,600
pretty nice for us I think I'm gonna be
using it a lot because you can get

374
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:34,610
using it a lot because you can get
 

375
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,550
using it a lot because you can get
stacks and stacks of wood in seconds

376
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
stacks and stacks of wood in seconds
 

377
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,410
stacks and stacks of wood in seconds
with it which is really cool so what

378
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:38,420
with it which is really cool so what
 

379
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,210
with it which is really cool so what
we're doing we're gonna run redstone all

380
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,220
we're doing we're gonna run redstone all
 

381
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,340
we're doing we're gonna run redstone all
the way up from down below here you see

382
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,350
the way up from down below here you see
 

383
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,730
the way up from down below here you see
we got it

384
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:43,740
we got it
 

385
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,139
we got it
and the porches running up from

386
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:45,149
and the porches running up from
 

387
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,620
and the porches running up from
underground the way this works after we

388
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:48,630
underground the way this works after we
 

389
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,389
underground the way this works after we
row the trees go back up we have to

390
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:53,399
row the trees go back up we have to
 

391
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,510
row the trees go back up we have to
shear out the core of the leaves here so

392
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:56,520
shear out the core of the leaves here so
 

393
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,699
shear out the core of the leaves here so
we drop down here these out and as we

394
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:01,709
we drop down here these out and as we
 

395
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,320
we drop down here these out and as we
get down here once we fall through the

396
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,330
get down here once we fall through the
 

397
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,850
get down here once we fall through the
water we're gonna hit up pressure plates

398
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:04,860
water we're gonna hit up pressure plates
 

399
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,510
water we're gonna hit up pressure plates
which will automatically push us so that

400
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:08,520
which will automatically push us so that
 

401
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,090
which will automatically push us so that
we return to the surface but we also go

402
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,100
we return to the surface but we also go
 

403
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,500
we return to the surface but we also go
over another pressure plate which is

404
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:12,510
over another pressure plate which is
 

405
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,570
over another pressure plate which is
gonna activate the TNT to fall down here

406
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:16,580
gonna activate the TNT to fall down here
 

407
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,829
gonna activate the TNT to fall down here
there's a second part you play we just

408
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:18,839
there's a second part you play we just
 

409
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,620
there's a second part you play we just
hit so now it's sending a redstone

410
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,630
hit so now it's sending a redstone
 

411
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:30,699
hit so now it's sending a redstone
signal up there automatically triggers

412
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:30,709

 

413
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,750

yeah that's what I was afraid of I think

414
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
yeah that's what I was afraid of I think
 

415
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,860
yeah that's what I was afraid of I think
we just blew of our cheap herb

416
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:36,870
we just blew of our cheap herb
 

417
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,750
we just blew of our cheap herb
oh my goodness so the timing is wrong on

418
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
oh my goodness so the timing is wrong on
 

419
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,480
oh my goodness so the timing is wrong on
some of that I guess yeah okay oh not

420
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,490
some of that I guess yeah okay oh not
 

421
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,340
some of that I guess yeah okay oh not
just some a tree farm a lot of the tree

422
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,350
just some a tree farm a lot of the tree
 

423
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,790
just some a tree farm a lot of the tree
farm got blown up there uh-huh fun fun

424
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
farm got blown up there uh-huh fun fun
 

425
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,500
farm got blown up there uh-huh fun fun
well we got it all fixed up here again

426
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:54,510
well we got it all fixed up here again
 

427
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,820
well we got it all fixed up here again
it actually only took like five minutes

428
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,830
it actually only took like five minutes
 

429
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,250
it actually only took like five minutes
so it wasn't too bad so what happened

430
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,260
so it wasn't too bad so what happened
 

431
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,050
so it wasn't too bad so what happened
there is we're using these piston arms

432
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,060
there is we're using these piston arms
 

433
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,880
there is we're using these piston arms
to hold the TNT and then they retract

434
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:01,890
to hold the TNT and then they retract
 

435
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,130
to hold the TNT and then they retract
and let the TNT fall down after a

436
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,140
and let the TNT fall down after a
 

437
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,510
and let the TNT fall down after a
certain amount of time the perfect

438
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,520
certain amount of time the perfect
 

439
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,390
certain amount of time the perfect
amount of time right and what happened

440
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,400
amount of time right and what happened
 

441
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,340
amount of time right and what happened
is because we only sent the piston arms

442
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,350
is because we only sent the piston arms
 

443
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,620
is because we only sent the piston arms
here like a quick pulse it extended

444
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:12,630
here like a quick pulse it extended
 

445
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,890
here like a quick pulse it extended
again while the ones above we're still

446
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:15,900
again while the ones above we're still
 

447
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,810
again while the ones above we're still
retracting and they the TNT landed on

448
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:17,820
retracting and they the TNT landed on
 

449
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,720
retracting and they the TNT landed on
this lower one and like blew up to the

450
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:20,730
this lower one and like blew up to the
 

451
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,269
this lower one and like blew up to the
tree farm basically so what we did to

452
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
tree farm basically so what we did to
 

453
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,890
tree farm basically so what we did to
fix that is down below here I added in

454
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:27,900
fix that is down below here I added in
 

455
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,430
fix that is down below here I added in
just the hopper clock here so that the

456
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
just the hopper clock here so that the
 

457
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,290
just the hopper clock here so that the
Pistons will stay retracted until the

458
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,300
Pistons will stay retracted until the
 

459
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,390
Pistons will stay retracted until the
whole cycle finishes basically so it's

460
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:35,400
whole cycle finishes basically so it's
 

461
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,900
whole cycle finishes basically so it's
got a long delay on it yeah so we fall

462
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:38,910
got a long delay on it yeah so we fall
 

463
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,430
got a long delay on it yeah so we fall
down here we land on this pressure plate

464
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,440
down here we land on this pressure plate
 

465
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,840
down here we land on this pressure plate
which activates the piston pusher there

466
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:43,850
which activates the piston pusher there
 

467
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,040
which activates the piston pusher there
but it is this one here activates all

468
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,050
but it is this one here activates all
 

469
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,620
but it is this one here activates all
the Redstone so this is a signal that

470
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:51,630
the Redstone so this is a signal that
 

471
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,449
the Redstone so this is a signal that
goes up that big torch tower like the

472
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:53,459
goes up that big torch tower like the
 

473
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,340
goes up that big torch tower like the
torches are right above this block here

474
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:55,350
torches are right above this block here
 

475
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,200
torches are right above this block here
okay

476
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,210
okay
 

477
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,670
okay
on the other side here we also have

478
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:58,680
on the other side here we also have
 

479
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,980
on the other side here we also have
another branch off which were using for

480
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:00,990
another branch off which were using for
 

481
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,240
another branch off which were using for
something else basically after we hit

482
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,250
something else basically after we hit
 

483
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,920
something else basically after we hit
that pressure plates that other branch

484
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:06,930
that pressure plates that other branch
 

485
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,260
that pressure plates that other branch
off causes these to push up after a

486
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,270
off causes these to push up after a
 

487
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,770
off causes these to push up after a
certain amount I'm completely there they

488
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:12,780
certain amount I'm completely there they
 

489
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,130
certain amount I'm completely there they
go

490
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,140
go
 

491
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,780
go
so that I'll push this up here and

492
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:14,790
so that I'll push this up here and
 

493
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,540
so that I'll push this up here and
they'll give us a free space to plant

494
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:17,550
they'll give us a free space to plant
 

495
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,390
they'll give us a free space to plant
the next thing of trees all right so

496
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:20,400
the next thing of trees all right so
 

497
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,860
the next thing of trees all right so
we're gonna try to get in here everybody

498
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:21,870
we're gonna try to get in here everybody
 

499
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,870
we're gonna try to get in here everybody
it might blow up one more time we'll see

500
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:23,880
it might blow up one more time we'll see
 

501
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,650
it might blow up one more time we'll see
we'll see we got it now so again we fall

502
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:27,660
we'll see we got it now so again we fall
 

503
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,100
we'll see we got it now so again we fall
down here the leaves will land on that

504
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,110
down here the leaves will land on that
 

505
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,570
down here the leaves will land on that
pressure plate which will activate the

506
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:32,580
pressure plate which will activate the
 

507
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,900
pressure plate which will activate the
whole thing alright so this redstone

508
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:35,910
whole thing alright so this redstone
 

509
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,930
whole thing alright so this redstone
just all switched went up to the top and

510
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:38,940
just all switched went up to the top and
 

511
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,620
just all switched went up to the top and
now the TNT should be falling down

512
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:41,630
now the TNT should be falling down
 

513
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,380
now the TNT should be falling down
looking good looking good

514
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,390

 

515
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,400

did it blow up the clay up there now I

516
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,410
did it blow up the clay up there now I
 

517
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,690
did it blow up the clay up there now I
think we're good actually so that's all

518
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:53,700
think we're good actually so that's all
 

519
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,300
think we're good actually so that's all
fine and then we have all these hoppers

520
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,310
fine and then we have all these hoppers
 

521
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,130
fine and then we have all these hoppers
down here as our collection system so

522
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,140
down here as our collection system so
 

523
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,930
down here as our collection system so
they all kind of branch off to this

524
00:12:59,930 --> 00:12:59,940
they all kind of branch off to this
 

525
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,210
they all kind of branch off to this
chest here and you see it's tilling up

526
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:02,220
chest here and you see it's tilling up
 

527
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,860
chest here and you see it's tilling up
with the spruce wood that fell down a

528
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:03,870
with the spruce wood that fell down a
 

529
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,230
with the spruce wood that fell down a
lot of the spruce woods gonna land up in

530
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
lot of the spruce woods gonna land up in
 

531
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,960
lot of the spruce woods gonna land up in
the middle here which is fine if we're

532
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,970
the middle here which is fine if we're
 

533
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,120
the middle here which is fine if we're
doing like multiple harvests cuz when we

534
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,130
doing like multiple harvests cuz when we
 

535
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,640
doing like multiple harvests cuz when we
plant the next set of trees and they

536
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:13,650
plant the next set of trees and they
 

537
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,830
plant the next set of trees and they
grow it's gonna push that those items

538
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:15,840
grow it's gonna push that those items
 

539
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,840
grow it's gonna push that those items
off into the hoppers I think we'll see

540
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:20,850
off into the hoppers I think we'll see
 

541
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,980
off into the hoppers I think we'll see
here ok we'll go for the next girl yeah

542
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:27,990
here ok we'll go for the next girl yeah
 

543
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,720
here ok we'll go for the next girl yeah
that's right it was like did it branch

544
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:29,730
that's right it was like did it branch
 

545
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,580
that's right it was like did it branch
off here no that wood that was there

546
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:31,590
off here no that wood that was there
 

547
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,620
off here no that wood that was there
already I got confused for a second so

548
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:33,630
already I got confused for a second so
 

549
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,940
already I got confused for a second so
you see they're like saplings and stuff

550
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:34,950
you see they're like saplings and stuff
 

551
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,400
you see they're like saplings and stuff
got pushed it off and then we go up for

552
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,410
got pushed it off and then we go up for
 

553
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,090
got pushed it off and then we go up for
the next round and we should be able to

554
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,100
the next round and we should be able to
 

555
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,440
the next round and we should be able to
grow like all the different types of

556
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,450
grow like all the different types of
 

557
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,490
grow like all the different types of
trees this way too like we if we put the

558
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:46,500
trees this way too like we if we put the
 

559
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,880
trees this way too like we if we put the
saplings in all the spaces I see we've

560
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:49,890
saplings in all the spaces I see we've
 

561
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,890
saplings in all the spaces I see we've
got some of the wood there I didn't

562
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:54,900
got some of the wood there I didn't
 

563
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,720
got some of the wood there I didn't
notice actually did this push at the

564
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:56,730
notice actually did this push at the
 

565
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,990
notice actually did this push at the
right time

566
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
right time
 

567
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,490
right time
let's look down here okay so we can even

568
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:00,500
let's look down here okay so we can even
 

569
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,770
let's look down here okay so we can even
shorten the Glee on that if you want

570
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:04,780

 

571
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,060

awesome alright so I'm pretty happy with
 

573
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,010
awesome alright so I'm pretty happy with
this tree farm as it is actually but

574
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,020
this tree farm as it is actually but
 

575
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
this tree farm as it is actually but
there is room for improvement obviously

576
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,030
there is room for improvement obviously
 

577
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,890

more would be nice I'm gonna put some
carpet over these hoppers probably to

584
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:19,610
carpet over these hoppers probably to
 

585
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,370
carpet over these hoppers probably to
hide them I just want you guys to be

586
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:21,380
hide them I just want you guys to be
 

587
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,600
hide them I just want you guys to be
able to see like what's going on you

588
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:22,610
able to see like what's going on you
 

589

able to see like what's going on you
know another idea that was suggested is

590
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:25,520
know another idea that was suggested is
 

591
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,300
know another idea that was suggested is
to set up a mattock bonemeal dispenser

592
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,310
to set up a mattock bonemeal dispenser
 

593
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,190
to set up a mattock bonemeal dispenser
for the growing the trees which is

594
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,200
for the growing the trees which is
 

595
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,680
for the growing the trees which is
something I did play around with a

596
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:32,690
something I did play around with a
 

597
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,510
something I did play around with a
little bit but decide not to do it for

598
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:34,520
little bit but decide not to do it for
 

599
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,330
little bit but decide not to do it for
two main reasons number one if we set up

600
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:37,340
two main reasons number one if we set up
 

601
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,610
two main reasons number one if we set up
like dispensers pointing towards these

602
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:39,620
like dispensers pointing towards these
 

603
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,260
like dispensers pointing towards these
trees it's gonna block some of the

604
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,270
trees it's gonna block some of the
 

605
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,530
trees it's gonna block some of the
collection hoppers like they'll take up

606
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:44,540
collection hoppers like they'll take up
 

607
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,050
collection hoppers like they'll take up
their space right so more and more stuff

608
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,060
their space right so more and more stuff
 

609
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,090
their space right so more and more stuff
will lands where we don't want it to oh

610
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,100
will lands where we don't want it to oh
 

611

00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
there is a thing called the Northwest
 

617
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
there is a thing called the Northwest
rule though with trees so if we're

618
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,450
rule though with trees so if we're
 

619
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,110
rule though with trees so if we're
facing north this way or west this way

620
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,120
facing north this way or west this way
 

621
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,730
facing north this way or west this way
and there is a block next to the tree on

622
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:06,740
and there is a block next to the tree on
 

623
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,060

let scrubs smooth stone maybe so if we

626
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:15,890
let scrubs smooth stone maybe so if we
 

627
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,740
let scrubs smooth stone maybe so if we
have a block north or west of the tree

628
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:17,750
have a block north or west of the tree
 

629
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,230
have a block north or west of the tree
this tree will never be able to grow no

630
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
this tree will never be able to grow no
 

631
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,660
this tree will never be able to grow no
matter how much bonemeal you give it it

just won't grow get rid of this one

634
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,390
just won't grow get rid of this one
 

635
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,520
just won't grow get rid of this one
still won't grow because we got a block

636
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:27,530
still won't grow because we got a block
 

637
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,050
still won't grow because we got a block
on the north side but if we get rid of

638
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,060
on the north side but if we get rid of
 

639
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,640
on the north side but if we get rid of
this one then it'll grow like within

640
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:30,650
this one then it'll grow like within
 

641
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,270
this one then it'll grow like within
five full meals probably yeah so just

642
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:34,280
five full meals probably yeah so just
 

643
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,860
five full meals probably yeah so just
the way this configuration is with our

644
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:35,870
the way this configuration is with our
 

645
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,360
the way this configuration is with our
trees it would have been impossible to

646
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,370
trees it would have been impossible to
 

647
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,310
trees it would have been impossible to
set up the dispensers where they

648
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,320
set up the dispensers where they
 

649
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,520
set up the dispensers where they
wouldn't be in the northwest region for

650
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:42,530
wouldn't be in the northwest region for
 

651
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,530
wouldn't be in the northwest region for
at least a few of the trees right so

652
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:44,540
at least a few of the trees right so
 

653
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,490
at least a few of the trees right so
that was another issue so I decided just

654
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:48,500
that was another issue so I decided just
 

655
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,710
that was another issue so I decided just
to skip it another thing we'll probably

656
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
to skip it another thing we'll probably
 

657
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,120
to skip it another thing we'll probably
want to do with this though is add a

658
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,130
want to do with this though is add a
 

659
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,280
want to do with this though is add a
filtering and storage system to it so

660
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,290
filtering and storage system to it so
 

661
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,020
filtering and storage system to it so
like instead of putting everything in

662
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,030
like instead of putting everything in
 

663
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,910
like instead of putting everything in
one chest we'll will separate the sticks

664
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
one chest we'll will separate the sticks
 

665
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,180
one chest we'll will separate the sticks
into their own logs saplings leaves all

666
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,190
into their own logs saplings leaves all
 

667
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,210
into their own logs saplings leaves all
into their own spot right so it'll be

668
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,220
into their own spot right so it'll be
 

669
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,910
into their own spot right so it'll be
nice and organized that way and we'll

670
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:06,920
nice and organized that way and we'll
 

671
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,320
nice and organized that way and we'll
probably want to do that for all six

672
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,330
probably want to do that for all six
 

673
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,790
probably want to do that for all six
types of trees because I think we can

674
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:09,800
types of trees because I think we can
 

675
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,620
types of trees because I think we can
grow all six here but I'm gonna spear

676
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:11,630
grow all six here but I'm gonna spear
 

677
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,040
grow all six here but I'm gonna spear
with that now so we'll do jungle bleep

678
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,050
with that now so we'll do jungle bleep
 

679
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,439
with that now so we'll do jungle bleep
trees next year I think if we do other

680
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:17,449
trees next year I think if we do other
 

681
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,090
trees next year I think if we do other
trees so we might not get enough

682
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,100
trees so we might not get enough
 

683
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,930
trees so we might not get enough
saplings back so it might not be

684
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:22,940
saplings back so it might not be
 

685
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,939
saplings back so it might not be
sustainable but if we have like extras

686
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:24,949
sustainable but if we have like extras
 

687
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:27,249
sustainable but if we have like extras
at any point we could do this to quickly

688
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:27,259
at any point we could do this to quickly
 

689
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,829
at any point we could do this to quickly
grow them maybe but we'll see we'll see

690
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
grow them maybe but we'll see we'll see
 

691
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,740
grow them maybe but we'll see we'll see
how this goes so those should grow fine

692
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:32,750
how this goes so those should grow fine
 

693
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,559
how this goes so those should grow fine
yeah so one thing to keep in mind when

694
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:35,569
yeah so one thing to keep in mind when
 

695
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:37,300
yeah so one thing to keep in mind when
we're removing this core out of its

696
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,310
we're removing this core out of its
 

697
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,189
we're removing this core out of its
jungle trees you might get some branches

698
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
jungle trees you might get some branches
 

699
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,680
jungle trees you might get some branches
that that shoot off here but also looks

700
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:41,690
that that shoot off here but also looks
 

701
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,389
that that shoot off here but also looks
like we're gonna have some vines right I

702
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:43,399
like we're gonna have some vines right I
 

703
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,680
like we're gonna have some vines right I
don't think those will mess up the tea

704
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:44,690
don't think those will mess up the tea
 

705
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:51,910
don't think those will mess up the tea
and tea though right all right let's

706
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920
and tea though right all right let's
 

707
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,740
and tea though right all right let's
check it out here wonderful people in

708
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:55,750
check it out here wonderful people in
 

709
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:05,829
check it out here wonderful people in
vines and we got to be able to get like

710
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
vines and we got to be able to get like
 

711
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,649
vines and we got to be able to get like
16 jungle saplings back otherwise it's

712
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:08,659
16 jungle saplings back otherwise it's
 

713
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:12,490
16 jungle saplings back otherwise it's
not sustainable so we got 14 jungle

714
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:12,500
not sustainable so we got 14 jungle
 

715
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,740
not sustainable so we got 14 jungle
saplings back we needed 16 so it's not

716
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:14,750
saplings back we needed 16 so it's not
 

717
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,419
saplings back we needed 16 so it's not
too bad it was pretty close and

718
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:16,429
too bad it was pretty close and
 

719
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,189
too bad it was pretty close and
obviously there's more leaves more

720
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:18,199
obviously there's more leaves more
 

721
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,689
obviously there's more leaves more
jungle leaves there we could get more

722
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:19,699
jungle leaves there we could get more
 

723
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,000
jungle leaves there we could get more
from but we'd have to climb up and

724
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,010
from but we'd have to climb up and
 

725
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,549
from but we'd have to climb up and
manually harvest them or wait for more

726
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
manually harvest them or wait for more
 

727
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,010
manually harvest them or wait for more
to de-spawn you know which we probably

728
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,020
to de-spawn you know which we probably
 

729
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,409
to de-spawn you know which we probably
won't do in regular use so we're gonna

730
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:29,419
won't do in regular use so we're gonna
 

731
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:31,570
won't do in regular use so we're gonna
come up deficits I think a lot of the

732
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:31,580
come up deficits I think a lot of the
 

733
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,600
come up deficits I think a lot of the
times also interesting about the jungle

734
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:34,610
times also interesting about the jungle
 

735
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,760
times also interesting about the jungle
trees we we have three logs here that's

736
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:36,770
trees we we have three logs here that's
 

737
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,750
trees we we have three logs here that's
normally never get left behind I think

738
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
normally never get left behind I think
 

739
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,669
normally never get left behind I think
the vines actually did interfere a

740
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:42,679
the vines actually did interfere a
 

741
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,310
the vines actually did interfere a
little bit I have the TNT exploded where

742
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,320
little bit I have the TNT exploded where
 

743
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,289
little bit I have the TNT exploded where
a vine was it's gonna dampen the

744
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:47,299
a vine was it's gonna dampen the
 

745
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,640
a vine was it's gonna dampen the
explosion a little bit and it didn't

746
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:48,650
explosion a little bit and it didn't
 

747
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,590
explosion a little bit and it didn't
have enough power to take out those

748
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,600
have enough power to take out those
 

749
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,980
have enough power to take out those
three logs I think is what happened so

750
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:53,990
three logs I think is what happened so
 

751
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,640
three logs I think is what happened so
that's kind of interesting as well

752
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:56,650
that's kind of interesting as well
 

753
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,710
that's kind of interesting as well
another tricky one will be the dark oak

754
00:17:59,710 --> 00:17:59,720
another tricky one will be the dark oak
 

755
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,180
another tricky one will be the dark oak
I think these are destructive sometimes

756
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,190
I think these are destructive sometimes
 

757
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,760
I think these are destructive sometimes
unless they change that we'll see how

758
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:06,770
unless they change that we'll see how
 

759
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,970
unless they change that we'll see how
this goes though oh that's weird like

760
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:09,980
this goes though oh that's weird like
 

761
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,460
this goes though oh that's weird like
the jungle trees overwrote the spruce

762
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:12,470
the jungle trees overwrote the spruce
 

763
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,279
the jungle trees overwrote the spruce
wood but the dark oak didn't replace the

764
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:15,289
wood but the dark oak didn't replace the
 

765
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:19,659
wood but the dark oak didn't replace the
jungle wood well that time it did wonder

766
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:19,669
jungle wood well that time it did wonder
 

767
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,370
jungle wood well that time it did wonder
why I didn't with those and there's like

768
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:21,380
why I didn't with those and there's like
 

769
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,490
why I didn't with those and there's like
a hollow spot here

770
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:24,500
a hollow spot here
 

771
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:38,010
a hollow spot here

773
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,710

okay one final thing we'll do here you

774
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
okay one final thing we'll do here you
 

775
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,760
okay one final thing we'll do here you
guys are probably getting a little bit

776
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,770
guys are probably getting a little bit
 

777
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,380
guys are probably getting a little bit
bored of this remark by now because

778
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,390
bored of this remark by now because
 

779
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,120
bored of this remark by now because
we've been here for so long I'm having

780
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,130
we've been here for so long I'm having
 

781
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,320
we've been here for so long I'm having
the time of my life with it though I

782
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,330
the time of my life with it though I
 

783
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,950
the time of my life with it though I
think this is awesome but yeah one idea

784
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:49,960
think this is awesome but yeah one idea
 

785
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,840
think this is awesome but yeah one idea
here why don't we just put a water

786
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:51,850
here why don't we just put a water
 

787
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,180
here why don't we just put a water
column in the middle right I believe

788
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,190
column in the middle right I believe
 

789
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,610
column in the middle right I believe
this is water counts as one of the

790
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:56,620
this is water counts as one of the
 

791
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,980
this is water counts as one of the
blocks that prevents trees from growing

792
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:58,990
blocks that prevents trees from growing
 

793
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,030
blocks that prevents trees from growing
so again that Northwest rule if we have

794
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,040
so again that Northwest rule if we have
 

795
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,299
so again that Northwest rule if we have
a spruce tree here for example this is

796
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:06,309
a spruce tree here for example this is
 

797
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,610
a spruce tree here for example this is
gonna be north of it that's water so it

798
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:08,620
gonna be north of it that's water so it
 

799
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,320
gonna be north of it that's water so it
won't be able to grow and likewise the

800
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,330
won't be able to grow and likewise the
 

801

won't be able to grow and likewise the
tree over here it'll be west of it so

802
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:13,690
tree over here it'll be west of it so
 

803
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,630
tree over here it'll be west of it so
that's that's a no-go either these two
