we play this game guys it's huge because
 

43
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,229
we play this game guys it's huge because
it redoes the way the surface terrain

44
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
it redoes the way the surface terrain
 

45
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,270

generates

46
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
generates
 

47
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,910

it redoes the way the caves generate
 

49
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,150
it redoes the way the caves generate
plus the world height has changed so we

50
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
plus the world height has changed so we
 

51
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,510
plus the world height has changed so we
have an extra

52
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
have an extra
 

53
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,990
have an extra
64 blocks lower down we can go with

54
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
64 blocks lower down we can go with
 

55
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,950
64 blocks lower down we can go with
caves plus another 64 blocks we can go

56
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
caves plus another 64 blocks we can go
 

57
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,429
caves plus another 64 blocks we can go
up in the world for building

58
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
up in the world for building
 

59
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,230
up in the world for building
and the other major thing is ore

60

and squids don't spawn here so now we
 

131
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,470
and squids don't spawn here so now we
have glowing squid at least it'll

132
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
have glowing squid at least it'll
 

133
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,470
have glowing squid at least it'll
it'll create a little bit of activity in

134
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
it'll create a little bit of activity in
 

135
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,790
it'll create a little bit of activity in
the water there which is cool

136
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
the water there which is cool
 

137
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,550
the water there which is cool
yeah this part of the man cave isn't

138
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
yeah this part of the man cave isn't
 

139
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,509
yeah this part of the man cave isn't
really uh um finished or anything like

140
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
really uh um finished or anything like
 

141
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,509
really uh um finished or anything like
that but maybe maybe we do something

142
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
that but maybe maybe we do something
 

143
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,070
that but maybe maybe we do something
with it now maybe we do

144
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
with it now maybe we do
 

145
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,869
with it now maybe we do
uh

146
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
uh
 

147
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,030
uh
if we head down let's just dig

148
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
if we head down let's just dig
 

149
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,110
if we head down let's just dig
right over here and see what happens why

150
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
right over here and see what happens why
 

151
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,190
right over here and see what happens why
don't we so

152
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
don't we so
 

153
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,070
don't we so
how are we going to get through the

154
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
how are we going to get through the
 

155
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,110
how are we going to get through the
bedrock is the big question

156
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
bedrock is the big question
 

157
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,309
bedrock is the big question
any ideas any plans well

158
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
any ideas any plans well
 

159
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,190
any ideas any plans well
turns out there is no bedrock

160
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
turns out there is no bedrock
 

161
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,509
turns out there is no bedrock
which i'm actually kind of happy about

162
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
which i'm actually kind of happy about
 

163
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,430
which i'm actually kind of happy about
oh

164
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
oh
 

165
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,430
oh
dude where'd that come from oh the

166
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
dude where'd that come from oh the
 

167
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,869
dude where'd that come from oh the
gravel fell and there was live on top

168
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
gravel fell and there was live on top
 

169
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,149
gravel fell and there was live on top
actually i think i do want to go to new

170
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
actually i think i do want to go to new
 

171
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,910
actually i think i do want to go to new
terrain later just to check out a couple

172
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
terrain later just to check out a couple
 

173
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,470
terrain later just to check out a couple
things because i'm curious now as a

174
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
things because i'm curious now as a
 

175
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,630
things because i'm curious now as a
secret like why 11 is lava level right

176
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
secret like why 11 is lava level right
 

177
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,949
secret like why 11 is lava level right
but it probably isn't anymore

178
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
but it probably isn't anymore
 

179
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,710
but it probably isn't anymore
is there a new lava level or is there no

180
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
is there a new lava level or is there no
 

181
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,470
is there a new lava level or is there no
level level i don't know i gotta i gotta

182
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
level level i don't know i gotta i gotta
 

183
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,830
level level i don't know i gotta i gotta
look around the new terrain to figure

184
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
look around the new terrain to figure
 

185
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,589
look around the new terrain to figure
that out but uh

186
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
that out but uh
 

187
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,030
that out but uh
my world's gonna be a little bit wonky

188
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
my world's gonna be a little bit wonky
 

189
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,030
my world's gonna be a little bit wonky
now because we have the old generation

190
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
now because we have the old generation
 

191
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,030
now because we have the old generation
with the new generation

192
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
with the new generation
 

193
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,030
with the new generation
and in some ways i got the best of both

194
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
and in some ways i got the best of both
 

195
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,630
and in some ways i got the best of both
worlds and in some ways it's just going

196
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
worlds and in some ways it's just going
 

197
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,270
worlds and in some ways it's just going
to be kind of odd

198
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
to be kind of odd
 

199
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,149
to be kind of odd
but yeah let's let's check this out so

200
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
but yeah let's let's check this out so
 

201
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,550
but yeah let's let's check this out so
the final four blocks

202
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
the final four blocks
 

203
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,309
the final four blocks
that used to be here that used to be

204
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
that used to be here that used to be
 

205
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,710
that used to be here that used to be
like stone and bedrock mixed have been

206
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
like stone and bedrock mixed have been
 

207
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,830
like stone and bedrock mixed have been
replaced now we now have deep slates

208
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
replaced now we now have deep slates
 

209
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,670
replaced now we now have deep slates
under the man cave

210
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
under the man cave
 

211
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,670
under the man cave
they removed the bedrock layer and it

212
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
they removed the bedrock layer and it
 

213
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,229
they removed the bedrock layer and it
just kind of keeps going now

214
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
just kind of keeps going now
 

215
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,990
just kind of keeps going now
and now there's going to be caves and

216
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
and now there's going to be caves and
 

217
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,149
and now there's going to be caves and
stuff down here as well so this is kind

218
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
stuff down here as well so this is kind
 

219
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,589
stuff down here as well so this is kind
of cool like i can actually get deep

220
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
of cool like i can actually get deep
 

221
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,149
of cool like i can actually get deep
slates all over my world

222
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
slates all over my world
 

223
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,509
slates all over my world
which was something i was a little

224
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
which was something i was a little
 

225
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,869
which was something i was a little
worried about like normally i'd have to

226
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
worried about like normally i'd have to
 

227
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,630
worried about like normally i'd have to
go very far like thousands of blocks

228
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
go very far like thousands of blocks
 

229
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,350
go very far like thousands of blocks
away to get this stuff and uh nope it's

230
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
away to get this stuff and uh nope it's
 

231
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,990
away to get this stuff and uh nope it's
it's available everywhere so that's cool

232
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
it's available everywhere so that's cool
 

233
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,270
it's available everywhere so that's cool
oh here we go we got iron

234
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280

 

235
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,230

snappers
 

239
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,590
snappers
we got some redstone guys

240
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
we got some redstone guys
 

241
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,270
we got some redstone guys
oh yeah

242
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280

 

243

snap so this is below
 

253
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,790
snap so this is below
the man cave

254
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800

 

255
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,469

many bats
what's going on down here

260
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
what's going on down here
 

261
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,270
what's going on down here
dude look at this guys

262

this is pretty awesome
 

269
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,310
this is pretty awesome
oh we got glowing squids oh this is one

270
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
oh we got glowing squids oh this is one
 

271
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,469
oh we got glowing squids oh this is one
of those pools with like uh

272
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
of those pools with like uh
 

273
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,830
of those pools with like uh
the clay

274
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
the clay
 

275
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,110
the clay
the different layers

276
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120

 

277
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,990

oh man

278
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000

 

279
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,270

so yeah we're gonna be doing some stuff

280
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
so yeah we're gonna be doing some stuff
 

281
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,110
so yeah we're gonna be doing some stuff
with this

282
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
with this
 

283
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,870
with this
we'll get to that later though yeah so

284
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
we'll get to that later though yeah so
 

285
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,950
we'll get to that later though yeah so
ore distribution this kind of shows it

286
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
ore distribution this kind of shows it
 

287
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,390
ore distribution this kind of shows it
pretty well so if we look ahead there we

288
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
pretty well so if we look ahead there we
 

289
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,870
pretty well so if we look ahead there we
got some iron we got some redstone way

290
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
got some iron we got some redstone way
 

291
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,870
got some iron we got some redstone way
up there even higher up i see some

292
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
up there even higher up i see some
 

293
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,950
up there even higher up i see some
redstone way up there

294
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
redstone way up there
 

295
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,710
redstone way up there
there's some lower down stuff there

296
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
there's some lower down stuff there
 

297
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,430
there's some lower down stuff there
there's some diamonds way up there iron

298
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
there's some diamonds way up there iron
 

299
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,230
there's some diamonds way up there iron
there

300
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
there
 

301
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,510
there
so ores tend to generate at pretty wide

302
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
so ores tend to generate at pretty wide
 

303
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,830
so ores tend to generate at pretty wide
varieties of heights right

304
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
varieties of heights right
 

305
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,590
varieties of heights right
um but they do have preferences to

306
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
um but they do have preferences to
 

307
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,230
um but they do have preferences to
certain y levels where you'll find more

308
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
certain y levels where you'll find more
 

309
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,310
certain y levels where you'll find more
of them so for copper it's like at y48

310
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
of them so for copper it's like at y48
 

311
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,270
of them so for copper it's like at y48
iron

312
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
iron
 

313
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,029
iron
y16 lapis is zero i think gold is minus

314
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
y16 lapis is zero i think gold is minus
 

315
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,469
y16 lapis is zero i think gold is minus
32

316
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
32
 

317
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,749
32
or it might be minus 16. i can't

318
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
or it might be minus 16. i can't
 

319
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,189
or it might be minus 16. i can't
remember that one

320
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
remember that one
 

321
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,270
remember that one
and then diamonds and redstone the

322
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
and then diamonds and redstone the
 

323
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,350
and then diamonds and redstone the
further down you go the better

324
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
further down you go the better
 

325
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,469
further down you go the better
you'll find more um now there's a bunch

326
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
you'll find more um now there's a bunch
 

327
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,830
you'll find more um now there's a bunch
of nuances with that like i think

328
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
of nuances with that like i think
 

329
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,830
of nuances with that like i think
diamonds have a less likely chance of

330
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
diamonds have a less likely chance of
 

331
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,950
diamonds have a less likely chance of
being shown on surfaces now you mostly

332
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
being shown on surfaces now you mostly
 

333
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,189
being shown on surfaces now you mostly
have to dig to find them uh sometimes

334
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
have to dig to find them uh sometimes
 

335
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,950
have to dig to find them uh sometimes
though like that that's an exposed one

336
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
though like that that's an exposed one
 

337
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,790
though like that that's an exposed one
there so it does happen and yeah check

338
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
there so it does happen and yeah check
 

339
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,390
there so it does happen and yeah check
this out we do have mine shafts and

340
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
this out we do have mine shafts and
 

341
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,230
this out we do have mine shafts and
other structures generate in this lower

342
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
other structures generate in this lower
 

343
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,629
other structures generate in this lower
part of the world as well i've seen in

344
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
part of the world as well i've seen in
 

345
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,629
part of the world as well i've seen in
my testing mob spawners forming down

346
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
my testing mob spawners forming down
 

347
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,629
my testing mob spawners forming down
here i've seen amethyst geodes so

348
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
here i've seen amethyst geodes so
 

349
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,110
here i've seen amethyst geodes so
basically everything spawns underground

350
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
basically everything spawns underground
 

351
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,029
basically everything spawns underground
which is cool i double checked on the

352
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
which is cool i double checked on the
 

353
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,590
which is cool i double checked on the
the gold thing it is at -16

354
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
the gold thing it is at -16
 

355
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,390
the gold thing it is at -16
is the prime layer and

356
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
is the prime layer and
 

357
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,070
is the prime layer and
you get more in bases and there's also a

358
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
you get more in bases and there's also a
 

359
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,790
you get more in bases and there's also a
second layer and it's complicated

360
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
second layer and it's complicated
 

361
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,950
second layer and it's complicated
but uh yeah you look around minus 16 for

362
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
but uh yeah you look around minus 16 for
 

363
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,830
but uh yeah you look around minus 16 for
it um and then also diamonds they first

364
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
it um and then also diamonds they first
 

365
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,150
it um and then also diamonds they first
start showing up at 16 and then go all

366
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
start showing up at 16 and then go all
 

367
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,230
start showing up at 16 and then go all
the way down to minus 64. so that's a

368
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
the way down to minus 64. so that's a
 

369
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,909
the way down to minus 64. so that's a
huge range

370
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
huge range
 

371
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,430
huge range
but they're more common the lower you go

372
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
but they're more common the lower you go
 

373
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,950
but they're more common the lower you go
down and

374
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
down and
 

375
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,550
down and
this is big guys did you notice like

376
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
this is big guys did you notice like
 

377
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,790
this is big guys did you notice like
what has happened here

378
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
what has happened here
 

379
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,710
what has happened here
this is all deep slate right at the

380
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
this is all deep slate right at the
 

381
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,110
this is all deep slate right at the
lower ground areas

382
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
lower ground areas
 

383
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,790
lower ground areas
so

384
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
so
 

385
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,309
so
diamonds show up in the lower ground

386
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
diamonds show up in the lower ground
 

387
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,990
diamonds show up in the lower ground
areas and it's deep slate in the lower

388
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
areas and it's deep slate in the lower
 

389
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,670
areas and it's deep slate in the lower
ground areas

390
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
ground areas
 

391
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,469
ground areas
that means you can no longer speed mine

392
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
that means you can no longer speed mine
 

393
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,189
that means you can no longer speed mine
diamonds in this this update

394
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
diamonds in this this update
 

395
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,230
diamonds in this this update
because

396
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
because
 

397
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,230
because
they're gonna be forming in deep slate

398
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
they're gonna be forming in deep slate
 

399
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,390
they're gonna be forming in deep slate
the diamonds and you can't insta mine

400
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
the diamonds and you can't insta mine
 

401
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,870
the diamonds and you can't insta mine
this stuff even with ace too so that

402
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
this stuff even with ace too so that
 

403
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,270
this stuff even with ace too so that
means diamonds just got way more

404
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
means diamonds just got way more
 

405
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,589
means diamonds just got way more
valuable way more rare

406
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
valuable way more rare
 

407
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,589
valuable way more rare

bunch more right but no now you got to
 

441
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,510
bunch more right but no now you got to
think ahead and actually bring enough

no no no systems guys systems there we
 

465
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,389
no no no systems guys systems there we
go

466
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399

what does it mean when there's moss in

468
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
what does it mean when there's moss in
 

469
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,110
what does it mean when there's moss in
the ceiling does that mean there's going

470
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
the ceiling does that mean there's going
 

471
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,829
the ceiling does that mean there's going
to be a cave

472
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
to be a cave
 

473
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,310
to be a cave
not necessarily interesting

474
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320

 

475
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,190

huh

476
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
huh
 

477
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,030
huh
i thought if i dug there a tape would

478
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
i thought if i dug there a tape would
 

479
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,430
i thought if i dug there a tape would
open up but uh no

480
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
open up but uh no
 

481
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,870
open up but uh no

one
 

501
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,829
one
um no i wanted to check out that one

502
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
um no i wanted to check out that one
 

503
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,310
um no i wanted to check out that one
chasm we just saw where was that

504
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
chasm we just saw where was that
 

505
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,550
chasm we just saw where was that
oh there's a mine shaft or uh minecart

506
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
oh there's a mine shaft or uh minecart
 

507
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,870
oh there's a mine shaft or uh minecart
the tape has been relatively dangerous

508
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
the tape has been relatively dangerous
 

509
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,670
the tape has been relatively dangerous
with like the mobs and stuff

510
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
with like the mobs and stuff
 

511
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,750
with like the mobs and stuff
oh yeah you can get coal from the chests

oh yeah you can get coal from the chests
 

513
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,509
oh yeah you can get coal from the chests
oh yeah that kind of makes sense i don't

514
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
oh yeah that kind of makes sense i don't

oh yeah that kind of makes sense i don't
think you'd get enough from that though

516
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
think you'd get enough from that though
 

517
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,949
think you'd get enough from that though
um

518
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959

 

519
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,389

let's go down here let's see what

520
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
let's go down here let's see what
 

521

happens
 

523
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,870
happens
oh yeah there's lava level okay so it's

524
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
oh yeah there's lava level okay so it's
 

525
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,590
oh yeah there's lava level okay so it's
at minus 54. uh

526
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
at minus 54. uh
 

527
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,670
at minus 54. uh
that's basalt

528
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
that's basalt
 

529
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,990
that's basalt
oh it's an amethyst

530
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
oh it's an amethyst
 

531
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,389
oh it's an amethyst
geode

532

geode
 

533
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,750
geode
oh i gotta mark this

534
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760

 

535
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,230

yeah yeah it's a full geode awesome okay

536
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
yeah yeah it's a full geode awesome okay
 

537
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,350
yeah yeah it's a full geode awesome okay
that's a that's a big find

538
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
that's a that's a big find
 

539
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,710
that's a that's a big find
um

540
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720

anyways we could probably spend the

546
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
anyways we could probably spend the
 

547
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,949
anyways we could probably spend the
whole episode exploring the new cave

548
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
whole episode exploring the new cave
 

549
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,550
whole episode exploring the new cave
system but i kind of want to keep things

550
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
system but i kind of want to keep things
 

551
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,630
system but i kind of want to keep things
moving here so let's let's continue on

552
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
moving here so let's let's continue on
 

553
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,389
moving here so let's let's continue on
i'll do a bunch of caving off camera

554
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
i'll do a bunch of caving off camera
 

555
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,389
i'll do a bunch of caving off camera
just so i can get a feel for it and have

556
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
just so i can get a feel for it and have
 

557
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,310
just so i can get a feel for it and have
some fun with it you know

558
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
some fun with it you know
 

559
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,110
some fun with it you know
uh but yeah we have a decision to make

560
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
uh but yeah we have a decision to make
 

561
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,829
uh but yeah we have a decision to make
remember i said there is an important

remember i said there is an important
 

563
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,910
remember i said there is an important
decision so i have loaded up a brand new

564
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
decision so i have loaded up a brand new
 

565
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,670
decision so i have loaded up a brand new
creative world here just so we can get

566
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
creative world here just so we can get
 

567
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,470
creative world here just so we can get
an idea of how things look how things

568
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
an idea of how things look how things
 

569
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,590
an idea of how things look how things
feel

570
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
feel
 

571
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,829
feel
um

572
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
um
 

573
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,829
um
because

574
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
because
 

575
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,630
because
new world guys no no

576
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
new world guys no no
 

577
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,230
new world guys no no
i know that's what you're all thinking i

578
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
i know that's what you're all thinking i
 

579
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,430
i know that's what you're all thinking i
think we're going to keep the old world

580
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
think we're going to keep the old world
 

581
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,150
think we're going to keep the old world
still i love that world um and it's kind

582
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
still i love that world um and it's kind
 

583
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,310
still i love that world um and it's kind
of at the point now like 10 years more

584
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
of at the point now like 10 years more
 

585
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,389
of at the point now like 10 years more
that we've been going it feels bad to

586
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
that we've been going it feels bad to
 

587
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,949
that we've been going it feels bad to
abandon that world

588
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
abandon that world
 

589
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,550
abandon that world
it's kind of like a historical thing at

590
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
it's kind of like a historical thing at
 

591
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,670
it's kind of like a historical thing at
this point

592
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
this point
 

593
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,470
this point
um so what we have to decide though is

594
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
um so what we have to decide though is
 

595
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,310
um so what we have to decide though is
do we change it to use the new terrain

596
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
do we change it to use the new terrain
 

597
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,550
do we change it to use the new terrain
on the surface so

598
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
on the surface so
 

599
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,389
on the surface so
let's just fly around here a bit get a

600
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
let's just fly around here a bit get a
 

601
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,470
let's just fly around here a bit get a
feel for it get an idea for it

602
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
feel for it get an idea for it
 

603
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,430
feel for it get an idea for it
um

604
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
um
 

605
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,430
um
as it turns out i thought amplified

606
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
as it turns out i thought amplified
 

607
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,350
as it turns out i thought amplified
terrain was going away and like we were

608
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
terrain was going away and like we were
 

609
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,949
terrain was going away and like we were
forced to use this new

610
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
forced to use this new
 

611
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,509
forced to use this new
uh surface level terrain system

612
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
uh surface level terrain system
 

613
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,590
uh surface level terrain system
no it turns out amplified is still in

614
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
no it turns out amplified is still in
 

615
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,190
no it turns out amplified is still in
the game my world is still set to

616
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
the game my world is still set to
 

617
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,509
the game my world is still set to
amplify and it totally overwrites all

618
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
amplify and it totally overwrites all
 

619
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,150
amplify and it totally overwrites all
this new stuff that has been added so we

620
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
this new stuff that has been added so we
 

621
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,230
this new stuff that has been added so we
need to decide

622
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
need to decide
 

623
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,470
need to decide
do we get rid of amplified and go with

624
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
do we get rid of amplified and go with
 

625
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,630
do we get rid of amplified and go with
the new system or do we keep amplified

626
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
the new system or do we keep amplified
 

627
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,030
the new system or do we keep amplified
and just forget about this surface level

628
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
and just forget about this surface level
 

629
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,550
and just forget about this surface level
stuff so

630
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
stuff so
 

631
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,990
stuff so
just flying around here a bit i've

632
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
just flying around here a bit i've
 

633
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,470
just flying around here a bit i've
noticed like it's definitely a lot nicer

634
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
noticed like it's definitely a lot nicer
 

635
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,230
noticed like it's definitely a lot nicer
than it used to be

636
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
than it used to be
 

637
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,069
than it used to be
um

638
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
um
 

639
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,910
um
it's way more interesting than than the

640
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
it's way more interesting than than the
 

641
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,110
it's way more interesting than than the
old terrain

642
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
old terrain
 

643
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,949
old terrain
but it's still very

644
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
but it's still very
 

645
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,030
but it's still very
vanilla

646
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
vanilla
 

647
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,710
vanilla
is what i'm noticing like there's still

648
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
is what i'm noticing like there's still
 

649
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,069
is what i'm noticing like there's still
huge flat areas um there are definitely

650
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
huge flat areas um there are definitely
 

651
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,509
huge flat areas um there are definitely
more hills now but they're always

652
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
more hills now but they're always
 

653
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,269
more hills now but they're always
rolling hills they're not like jagged

654
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
rolling hills they're not like jagged
 

655
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,030
rolling hills they're not like jagged
hills

656
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
hills
 

657
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,629
hills
and

658
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
and
 

659
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,550
and
these features though i think still

660
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
these features though i think still
 

661
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,389
these features though i think still
apply to our amplified terrain if we

662
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
apply to our amplified terrain if we
 

663
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,069
apply to our amplified terrain if we
generate new stuff

664
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
generate new stuff
 

665
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,150
generate new stuff
like where it has these big holes hold

666
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
like where it has these big holes hold
 

667
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,829
like where it has these big holes hold
out holes and stuff

668
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
out holes and stuff
 

669
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,629
out holes and stuff
uh that we will still get an amplified i

670
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
uh that we will still get an amplified i
 

671
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,750
uh that we will still get an amplified i
think from what i've seen

672
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
think from what i've seen
 

673
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,590
think from what i've seen
we use this new stuff though i'm kind of

674
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
we use this new stuff though i'm kind of
 

675
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,710
we use this new stuff though i'm kind of
leaning towards no

676
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
leaning towards no
 

677
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,470
leaning towards no
i think i want to stick to amplified so

678
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
i think i want to stick to amplified so
 

679
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,710
i think i want to stick to amplified so
here's my here's my reasoning on that by

680
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
here's my here's my reasoning on that by
 

681
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,990
here's my here's my reasoning on that by
the way

682
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
the way
 

683
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,910
the way
and i'm i'm willing to be persuaded if

684
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
and i'm i'm willing to be persuaded if
 

685
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,310
and i'm i'm willing to be persuaded if
you guys have an argument to persuade me

686
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
you guys have an argument to persuade me
 

687
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,990
you guys have an argument to persuade me
i'm all ears

688
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
i'm all ears
 

689
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,910
i'm all ears
but like none of this terrain is like

690
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
but like none of this terrain is like
 

691
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,910
but like none of this terrain is like
wow i gotta build something there right

692
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
wow i gotta build something there right
 

693
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,230
wow i gotta build something there right
it's all pretty

694
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
it's all pretty
 

695
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,190
it's all pretty
pretty standard pretty tame

696
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
pretty standard pretty tame
 

697
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,710
pretty standard pretty tame
for the most part i think it is an

698
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
for the most part i think it is an
 

699
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,629
for the most part i think it is an
improvement though over the original

700
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
improvement though over the original
 

701
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,710
improvement though over the original
but amplified like when i see that stuff

702
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
but amplified like when i see that stuff
 

703
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,710
but amplified like when i see that stuff
it's like wow i really want to build

704
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
it's like wow i really want to build
 

705
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,629
it's like wow i really want to build
something here

706
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
something here
 

707
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,310
something here
you know and i don't really get that as

708
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
you know and i don't really get that as
 

709
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,069
you know and i don't really get that as
much with this this new stuff even

710
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
much with this this new stuff even
 

711
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,670
much with this this new stuff even
though it's cool yeah so with the new

712
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
though it's cool yeah so with the new
 

713
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,509
though it's cool yeah so with the new
terrain system there's definitely some

714
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
terrain system there's definitely some
 

715
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,350
terrain system there's definitely some
dead spots like we pretty much flew over

716
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
dead spots like we pretty much flew over
 

717
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,430
dead spots like we pretty much flew over
entirely flat land there which is not

718
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
entirely flat land there which is not
 

719
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,030
entirely flat land there which is not
ideal

720
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
ideal
 

721
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,550
ideal
but then there are some cool things like

722
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
but then there are some cool things like
 

723
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,230
but then there are some cool things like
this is a plains biome with a giant

724
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
this is a plains biome with a giant
 

725
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,910
this is a plains biome with a giant
mountain in like that's cool right you

726
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
mountain in like that's cool right you
 

727
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,230
mountain in like that's cool right you
got the nice flat areas to build and

728
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
got the nice flat areas to build and
 

729
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,269
got the nice flat areas to build and
then you got the mountain in the

730
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
then you got the mountain in the
 

731
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,790
then you got the mountain in the
background which is kind of the dream

732
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
background which is kind of the dream
 

733
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,550
background which is kind of the dream
you got a river cutting through here

734
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
you got a river cutting through here
 

735
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,829
you got a river cutting through here
like i could see you doing something

736
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
like i could see you doing something
 

737
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,670
like i could see you doing something
with this area okay we're definitely in

738
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
with this area okay we're definitely in
 

739
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,350
with this area okay we're definitely in
a more interesting area now so let's

740
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
a more interesting area now so let's
 

741
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,190
a more interesting area now so let's
just fly around here a bit more it seems

742
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
just fly around here a bit more it seems
 

743
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,629
just fly around here a bit more it seems
like it's going to be very seed

744
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
like it's going to be very seed
 

745
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,230
like it's going to be very seed
dependent like you might get lucky or

746
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
dependent like you might get lucky or
 

747
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,430
dependent like you might get lucky or
you might not

748
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
you might not
 

749
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,310
you might not
this terrain is way more interesting uh

750
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
this terrain is way more interesting uh
 

751
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,910
this terrain is way more interesting uh
with the new system

752
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
with the new system
 

753
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,470
with the new system
it's a bit more hilly around here uh we

754
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
it's a bit more hilly around here uh we
 

755
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,389
it's a bit more hilly around here uh we
got the jungle it's my favorite biome in

756
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
got the jungle it's my favorite biome in
 

757
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,670
got the jungle it's my favorite biome in
the game i think

758
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
the game i think
 

759
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,829
the game i think
and then you got like big height

760
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
and then you got like big height
 

761
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,030
and then you got like big height
variations happening over here big flat

762
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
variations happening over here big flat
 

763
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,110
variations happening over here big flat
spots still for building but you got the

764
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
spots still for building but you got the
 

765
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,350
spots still for building but you got the
cool terrain around you which is the

766
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
cool terrain around you which is the
 

767
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,550
cool terrain around you which is the
dream

768
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
dream
 

769
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,949
dream
and then we got a mesa i want to check

770
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
and then we got a mesa i want to check
 

771
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,790
and then we got a mesa i want to check
out this

772
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
out this
 

773
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,269
out this
so there are definitely some cool areas

774
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
so there are definitely some cool areas
 

775
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,509
so there are definitely some cool areas
yeah this is cool i like this

776
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
yeah this is cool i like this
 

777
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,829
yeah this is cool i like this
okay so what we just saw was 1.18

778
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
okay so what we just saw was 1.18
 

779
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,189
okay so what we just saw was 1.18
terrain in a random normal seed now this

780
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
terrain in a random normal seed now this
 

781
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,389
terrain in a random normal seed now this
is 1.18 terrain in an amplified seed so

782
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
is 1.18 terrain in an amplified seed so
 

783
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,550
is 1.18 terrain in an amplified seed so
this is what we're competing against

784
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
this is what we're competing against
 

785
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,670
this is what we're competing against
which do we prefer

786
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
which do we prefer
 

787
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,470
which do we prefer
i think i prefer amplified uh but i'm

788
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
i think i prefer amplified uh but i'm
 

789
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,710
i think i prefer amplified uh but i'm
not gonna make the decision today i'm

790
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
not gonna make the decision today i'm
 

791
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,629
not gonna make the decision today i'm
kind of leaning on you guys a bit for

792
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
kind of leaning on you guys a bit for
 

793
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,189
kind of leaning on you guys a bit for
your feedback what do you think as well

794
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
your feedback what do you think as well
 

795
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,389
your feedback what do you think as well
uh can you make an argument against this

796
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
uh can you make an argument against this
 

797
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,110
uh can you make an argument against this
i don't know i am getting stutters i

798
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
i don't know i am getting stutters i
 

799
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,550
i don't know i am getting stutters i
don't know if it's because i just loaded

800
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
don't know if it's because i just loaded
 

801
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,790
don't know if it's because i just loaded
this terrain and it's still settling but

802
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
this terrain and it's still settling but
 

803
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,629
this terrain and it's still settling but
that is a concern for sure

804
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639

 

805
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,670

stutters are not good but uh this look

806
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
stutters are not good but uh this look
 

807
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,150
stutters are not good but uh this look
looking pretty cool

808
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
looking pretty cool
 

809
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,350
looking pretty cool
uh-huh

810
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
uh-huh
 

811
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,430
uh-huh
so this is the new biome as well this is

812
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
so this is the new biome as well this is
 

813
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,870
so this is the new biome as well this is
the uh

814
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
the uh
 

815
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,310
the uh
drip stone case i don't know if it's

816
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
drip stone case i don't know if it's
 

817
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,910
drip stone case i don't know if it's
supposed to spawn on the surface like

818
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
supposed to spawn on the surface like
 

819
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,030
supposed to spawn on the surface like
this

820
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
this
 

821
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,790
this
not too familiar with it but it's doing

822
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
not too familiar with it but it's doing
 

823
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,949
not too familiar with it but it's doing
it in amplified so there we go

824
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
it in amplified so there we go
 

825
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,430
it in amplified so there we go
uh and then this is the new

826
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
uh and then this is the new
 

827
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,590
uh and then this is the new
ice peaks i think

828
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
ice peaks i think
 

829
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,670
ice peaks i think
what's it called

830
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
what's it called
 

831
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,310
what's it called
frozen peaks yeah so this goes right up

832
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
frozen peaks yeah so this goes right up
 

833
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,750
frozen peaks yeah so this goes right up
to the very

834
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
to the very
 

835
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,189
to the very
tippity top of the world 320.

836
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
tippity top of the world 320.
 

837
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,269
tippity top of the world 320.
yeah terrain will go all the way up an

838
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
yeah terrain will go all the way up an
 

839
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,550
yeah terrain will go all the way up an
amplified

840
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
amplified
 

841
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,829
amplified
which means there's gonna be tons of

842
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
which means there's gonna be tons of
 

843
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,750
which means there's gonna be tons of
iron up here because it spawns

844
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
iron up here because it spawns
 

845
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,350
iron up here because it spawns
super frequently at the very top of the

846
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
super frequently at the very top of the
 

847
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,230
super frequently at the very top of the
world

848
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
world
 

849
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,069
world
if there's terrain there

850
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
if there's terrain there
 

851
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,590
if there's terrain there
um

852
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
um
 

853
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,350
um
yeah i don't know

854
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
yeah i don't know
 

855
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,750
yeah i don't know
so for my play style i'm thinking

856
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
so for my play style i'm thinking
 

857
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,829
so for my play style i'm thinking
amplified is better because i generally

858
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
amplified is better because i generally
 

859
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,829
amplified is better because i generally
don't build like nice cities and

860
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
don't build like nice cities and
 

861
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,230
don't build like nice cities and
villages and houses and stuff i'm more

862
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
villages and houses and stuff i'm more
 

863
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,150
villages and houses and stuff i'm more
of a wacky builder

864
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
of a wacky builder
 

865
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,550
of a wacky builder
and wacky terrain is maybe better suited

866
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
and wacky terrain is maybe better suited
 

867
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,069
and wacky terrain is maybe better suited
to that

868
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
to that
 

869
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,990
to that
oh this is also the new terrain or a new

870
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
oh this is also the new terrain or a new
 

871
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,269
oh this is also the new terrain or a new
biome

872
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
biome
 

873
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,350
biome
sparse jungle oh man we got lucky that's

874
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
sparse jungle oh man we got lucky that's
 

875
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,269
sparse jungle oh man we got lucky that's
like all together here

876
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
like all together here
 

877
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,870
like all together here
anyways you know it's something for us

878
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
anyways you know it's something for us
 

879
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,389
anyways you know it's something for us
to think about we don't need to decide

880
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
to think about we don't need to decide
 

881
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,069
to think about we don't need to decide
right away but like if we want to build

882
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
right away but like if we want to build
 

883
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,310
right away but like if we want to build
a base somewhere new like then we need

884
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
a base somewhere new like then we need
 

885
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,829
a base somewhere new like then we need
to decide

886
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
to decide
 

887
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,269
to decide
which we might be doing i don't know but

888
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
which we might be doing i don't know but
 

889
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,550
which we might be doing i don't know but
i kind of want to play around with the

890
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
i kind of want to play around with the
 

891
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,310
i kind of want to play around with the
underground area to begin with with this

892
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
underground area to begin with with this
 

893
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,829
underground area to begin with with this
update so that's what we're going to be

894
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
update so that's what we're going to be
 

895
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,310
update so that's what we're going to be
doing here today i am gathering some

896
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
doing here today i am gathering some
 

897
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,269
doing here today i am gathering some
materials in our let's play here for

898
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
materials in our let's play here for
 

899
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,310
materials in our let's play here for
project underground okay so the three

900
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
project underground okay so the three
 

901
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,310
project underground okay so the three
main ingredients to project underground

902
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
main ingredients to project underground
 

903
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,990
main ingredients to project underground
are gonna be soul soil

904
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
are gonna be soul soil
 

905
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,230
are gonna be soul soil
we're gonna need a ton of bricks

906
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
we're gonna need a ton of bricks
 

907
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,550
we're gonna need a ton of bricks
and we also need a bunch of tnt

908
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
and we also need a bunch of tnt
 

909
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,189
and we also need a bunch of tnt
okay so here we go everybody we are back

910
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
okay so here we go everybody we are back
 

911
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,189
okay so here we go everybody we are back
down under the man cave in this cavern

912
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
down under the man cave in this cavern
 

913
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,430
down under the man cave in this cavern
we found ready to begin

914
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
we found ready to begin
 

915
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,150
we found ready to begin
project underground so

916
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
project underground so
 

917
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,110
project underground so
this is a bit of an odd idea

918
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
this is a bit of an odd idea
 

919
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,790
this is a bit of an odd idea
i came up with it like the day before

920
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
i came up with it like the day before
 

921
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,069
i came up with it like the day before
the update came out i was like i was

922
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
the update came out i was like i was
 

923
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,590
the update came out i was like i was
trying to think what should i do what do

924
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
trying to think what should i do what do
 

925
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,949
trying to think what should i do what do
i want to do

926
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
i want to do
 

927
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,629
i want to do
and i had this this idea come to me okay

928
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
and i had this this idea come to me okay
 

929
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,110
and i had this this idea come to me okay
now i've i planned this out a bit

930
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
now i've i planned this out a bit
 

931
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,949
now i've i planned this out a bit
there's a couple different stages this

932
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
there's a couple different stages this
 

933
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,550
there's a couple different stages this
can be a little hard to explain all at

934
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
can be a little hard to explain all at
 

935
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,310
can be a little hard to explain all at
once so we'll just take it one step at a

936
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
once so we'll just take it one step at a
 

937
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,990
once so we'll just take it one step at a
time

938
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
time
 

939
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,069
time
and first i'm just going to show you

940
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
and first i'm just going to show you
 

941
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,670
and first i'm just going to show you
what i'm actually going to be doing here

942
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
what i'm actually going to be doing here
 

943
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,590
what i'm actually going to be doing here
so it's very simple we're going to put

944
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
so it's very simple we're going to put
 

945
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,389
so it's very simple we're going to put
down soul sand i think i wanted minus

946
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
down soul sand i think i wanted minus
 

947
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,470
down soul sand i think i wanted minus
415 as our center point

948
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
415 as our center point
 

949
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,910
415 as our center point
so and i think we're going to make this

950
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
so and i think we're going to make this
 

951
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,150
so and i think we're going to make this
five blocks wide

952
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
five blocks wide
 

953
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,110
five blocks wide
and what's our y coordinate 39 is

954
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
and what's our y coordinate 39 is
 

955
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,670
and what's our y coordinate 39 is
probably good

956
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
probably good
 

957
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,590
probably good
okay so all we got to do is put down a

958
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
okay so all we got to do is put down a
 

959
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,870
okay so all we got to do is put down a
layer of soul sand five blocks wide

960
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
layer of soul sand five blocks wide
 

961
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,789
layer of soul sand five blocks wide
right and we're gonna run this all the

962
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
right and we're gonna run this all the
 

963
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,829
right and we're gonna run this all the
way to the wall there

964
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839

 

965
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,990

very simple very simple

966
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
very simple very simple
 

967
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,470
very simple very simple
and then

968
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
and then
 

969
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,390
and then
it's this stuff with the mobs

970
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
it's this stuff with the mobs
 

971
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,309
it's this stuff with the mobs
we're gonna put down some brick stairs

972
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
we're gonna put down some brick stairs
 

973
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,909
we're gonna put down some brick stairs
hello creeper

974
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
hello creeper
 

975
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,429
hello creeper
came to check out project underground as

976
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
came to check out project underground as
 

977
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,789
came to check out project underground as
well i see

978
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
well i see
 

979
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,949
well i see
uh-huh almost missed them there okay

980
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
uh-huh almost missed them there okay
 

981
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,029
uh-huh almost missed them there okay
then we got stairs on this side

982
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
then we got stairs on this side
 

983
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,630
then we got stairs on this side
and

984
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
and
 

985
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,830
and
ignore the zombie and then

986
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
ignore the zombie and then
 

987
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,270
ignore the zombie and then
slaps

988
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
slaps
 

989
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,110
slaps
like this so this is all we got to build

990
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
like this so this is all we got to build
 

991
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,669
like this so this is all we got to build
it's very simple there's not a lot to it

992
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
it's very simple there's not a lot to it
 

993
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,430
it's very simple there's not a lot to it
souls soil

994
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
souls soil
 

995
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,350
souls soil
and slabs uh-huh so as you've probably

996
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
and slabs uh-huh so as you've probably
 

997
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,870
and slabs uh-huh so as you've probably
already guessed here what we're doing is

998
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
already guessed here what we're doing is
 

999
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,190
already guessed here what we're doing is
we're building a path this is our basic

1000
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
we're building a path this is our basic
 

1001
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,950
we're building a path this is our basic
design for the path

1002
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
design for the path
 

1003
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,470
design for the path
and it's gonna run through the

1004
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
and it's gonna run through the
 

1005
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,470
and it's gonna run through the
underground cavern here have you ever

1006
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
underground cavern here have you ever
 

1007
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,070
underground cavern here have you ever
seen one of those minecraft videos where

1008
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
seen one of those minecraft videos where
 

1009
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,470
seen one of those minecraft videos where
somebody like cuts uh

1010
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
somebody like cuts uh
 

1011
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,549
somebody like cuts uh
a long minecart track through a bunch of

1012
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
a long minecart track through a bunch of
 

1013
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,470
a long minecart track through a bunch of
terrain and then they ride through the

1014
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
terrain and then they ride through the
 

1015
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,310
terrain and then they ride through the
terrain to show it off in the video you

1016
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
terrain to show it off in the video you
 

1017
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,150
terrain to show it off in the video you
know what i'm talking about

1018
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
know what i'm talking about
 

1019
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,230
know what i'm talking about
we're doing something similar here but

1020
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
we're doing something similar here but
 

1021
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,070
we're doing something similar here but
instead of like showing off

1022
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
instead of like showing off
 

1023
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,669
instead of like showing off
the above ground terrain we're gonna

1024
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
the above ground terrain we're gonna
 

1025
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,549
the above ground terrain we're gonna
show off the underground terrain

1026
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
show off the underground terrain
 

1027
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,390
show off the underground terrain
and we're gonna make it run through the

1028
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
and we're gonna make it run through the
 

1029
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,590
and we're gonna make it run through the
caverns

1030
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
caverns
 

1031
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,430
caverns
okay so check it out everybody we got

1032
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
okay so check it out everybody we got
 

1033
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,230
okay so check it out everybody we got
our basic path in here and so far it's

1034
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
our basic path in here and so far it's
 

1035
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,830
our basic path in here and so far it's
pretty cool right like this did not take

1036
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
pretty cool right like this did not take
 

1037
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,070
pretty cool right like this did not take
much effort this is very simple

1038
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
much effort this is very simple
 

1039
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,990
much effort this is very simple
and we can kind of check out a nice

1040
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
and we can kind of check out a nice
 

1041
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,230
and we can kind of check out a nice
peripheral view of the the cave as we

1042
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
peripheral view of the the cave as we
 

1043
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,230
peripheral view of the the cave as we
walk through here i think it's pretty

1044
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
walk through here i think it's pretty
 

1045
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,510
walk through here i think it's pretty
neat

1046
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
neat
 

1047
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,510
neat
and we put the sole soil under the slabs

1048
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
and we put the sole soil under the slabs
 

1049
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,430
and we put the sole soil under the slabs
here so we get the sole speed effect

1050
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
here so we get the sole speed effect
 

1051
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,430
here so we get the sole speed effect
from our boots we can run along here

1052
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
from our boots we can run along here
 

1053
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,510
from our boots we can run along here
much faster with that

1054
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
much faster with that
 

1055
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,870
much faster with that
um

1056
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
um
 

1057
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,710
um
and yeah so we want to keep this design

1058
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
and yeah so we want to keep this design
 

1059
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,710
and yeah so we want to keep this design
fairly simple like just the basic design

1060
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
fairly simple like just the basic design
 

1061
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,710
fairly simple like just the basic design
so that we can get a lot of it done

1062
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
so that we can get a lot of it done
 

1063
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,470
so that we can get a lot of it done
because we want to branch not just in

1064
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
because we want to branch not just in
 

1065
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,669
because we want to branch not just in
this cavern but to go to other caverns

1066
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
this cavern but to go to other caverns
 

1067
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,390
this cavern but to go to other caverns
and kind of connect this highway

1068
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
and kind of connect this highway
 

1069
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,070
and kind of connect this highway
to our entire underground we're kind of

1070
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
to our entire underground we're kind of
 

1071
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,150
to our entire underground we're kind of
using the the

1072
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
using the the
 

1073
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,110
using the the
man cave as our hub for the underground

1074
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
man cave as our hub for the underground
 

1075
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,870
man cave as our hub for the underground
and it's going to branch off from there

1076
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
and it's going to branch off from there
 

1077
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,710
and it's going to branch off from there
to other parts of our world

1078
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
to other parts of our world
 

1079
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,789
to other parts of our world
this is the underground highway

1080
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
this is the underground highway
 

1081
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,270
this is the underground highway
um okay but now we've hit our first snag

1082
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
um okay but now we've hit our first snag
 

1083
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,710
um okay but now we've hit our first snag
right we ran out of space to work with

1084
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
right we ran out of space to work with
 

1085
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,190
right we ran out of space to work with
and this is a much bigger snag than you

1086
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
and this is a much bigger snag than you
 

1087
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,190
and this is a much bigger snag than you
might expect because as we've already

1088
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,200
might expect because as we've already
 

1089
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,870
might expect because as we've already
looked

1090
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
looked
 

1091
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,230
looked
or figured out we can't instant mine

1092
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
or figured out we can't instant mine
 

1093
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,549
or figured out we can't instant mine
the deep slate right

1094
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
the deep slate right
 

1095
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,549
the deep slate right
so when it comes to expanding we're

1096
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
so when it comes to expanding we're
 

1097
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,630
so when it comes to expanding we're
looking at a big problem here because

1098
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
looking at a big problem here because
 

1099
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,710
looking at a big problem here because
this stuff is very time consuming to

1100
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
this stuff is very time consuming to
 

1101
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,710
this stuff is very time consuming to
break and if we were to

1102
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
break and if we were to
 

1103
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,350
break and if we were to
dig out space for the highway there oh

1104
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
dig out space for the highway there oh
 

1105
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,669
dig out space for the highway there oh
my goodness we are in trouble yeah so

1106
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
my goodness we are in trouble yeah so
 

1107
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,830
my goodness we are in trouble yeah so
it's very important we come up with some

1108
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
it's very important we come up with some
 

1109
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,909
it's very important we come up with some
good tunnel bore strategy here for

1110
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
good tunnel bore strategy here for
 

1111
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,230
good tunnel bore strategy here for
getting through the land and this is

1112
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
getting through the land and this is
 

1113
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,750
getting through the land and this is
what i'm planning so we're gonna go i

1114
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
what i'm planning so we're gonna go i
 

1115
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,830
what i'm planning so we're gonna go i
think two blocks up is what we're gonna

1116
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
think two blocks up is what we're gonna
 

1117
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,390
think two blocks up is what we're gonna
try and then i'll have to dig these

1118
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
try and then i'll have to dig these
 

1119
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,950
try and then i'll have to dig these
tunnels these two by one man tunnels

1120
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
tunnels these two by one man tunnels
 

1121
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,630
tunnels these two by one man tunnels
there's no way around this i just have

1122
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
there's no way around this i just have
 

1123
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,430
there's no way around this i just have
to

1124
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
to
 

1125
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,750
to
suck it up and do it basically

1126
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
suck it up and do it basically
 

1127
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,270
suck it up and do it basically
you can see throughout here we do have

1128
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
you can see throughout here we do have
 

1129
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,310
you can see throughout here we do have
like some

1130
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
like some
 

1131
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,909
like some
soft areas

1132
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
soft areas
 

1133
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,510
soft areas
so the tunnel

1134
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
so the tunnel
 

1135
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,909
so the tunnel
is gonna end up looking pretty varied i

1136
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
is gonna end up looking pretty varied i
 

1137
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,710
is gonna end up looking pretty varied i
think

1138
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
think
 

1139
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,789
think
but i just have to like dig this out and

1140
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
but i just have to like dig this out and
 

1141
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,470
but i just have to like dig this out and
the goal is to connect this up to

1142
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
the goal is to connect this up to
 

1143
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,390
the goal is to connect this up to
another one of these caverns now i

1144
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
another one of these caverns now i
 

1145
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,549
another one of these caverns now i
happen to know i checked the head

1146
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
happen to know i checked the head
 

1147
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,549
happen to know i checked the head
there is a cavern directly in front of

1148
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
there is a cavern directly in front of
 

1149
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,190
there is a cavern directly in front of
us here about a 100 or 200 blocks ahead

1150
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
us here about a 100 or 200 blocks ahead
 

1151
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,350
us here about a 100 or 200 blocks ahead
i think yep yep check it out another

1152
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
i think yep yep check it out another
 

1153
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,149
i think yep yep check it out another
cavern guys another giant massive hole

1154
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
cavern guys another giant massive hole
 

1155
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,830
cavern guys another giant massive hole
underground

1156
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:25,840
underground
 

1157
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,110
underground
that we can take advantage of here uh so

1158
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
that we can take advantage of here uh so
 

1159
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,950
that we can take advantage of here uh so
the idea is we're gonna try to connect

1160
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
the idea is we're gonna try to connect
 

1161
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,789
the idea is we're gonna try to connect
these all together and there's lots of

1162
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
these all together and there's lots of
 

1163
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,470
these all together and there's lots of
them like there's tons of these things

1164
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
them like there's tons of these things
 

1165
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,870
them like there's tons of these things
scattered underground uh most of them

1166
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,880
scattered underground uh most of them
 

1167
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,110
scattered underground uh most of them
are quite like densely packed close

1168
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
are quite like densely packed close
 

1169
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,950
are quite like densely packed close
together as well this is a bit of a

1170
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
together as well this is a bit of a
 

1171
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,590
together as well this is a bit of a
stretch compared to usual

1172
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
stretch compared to usual
 

1173
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,630
stretch compared to usual
um

1174
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
um
 

1175
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,430
um
but now what we're gonna do

1176
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
but now what we're gonna do
 

1177
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,510
but now what we're gonna do
is one of the fun things

1178
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
is one of the fun things
 

1179
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,110
is one of the fun things
this is where the the project gets

1180
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
this is where the the project gets
 

1181
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,310
this is where the the project gets
expensive

1182
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
expensive
 

1183
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,470
expensive
uh i am not digging this out there's no

1184
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
uh i am not digging this out there's no
 

1185
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,350
uh i am not digging this out there's no
way i have found in my testing that

1186
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
way i have found in my testing that
 

1187
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,510
way i have found in my testing that
a double layer of tnt actually does a

1188
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
a double layer of tnt actually does a
 

1189
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,470
a double layer of tnt actually does a
pretty good job on deep slate but yeah

1190
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
pretty good job on deep slate but yeah
 

1191
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,310
pretty good job on deep slate but yeah
it is pricey

1192
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
it is pricey
 

1193
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,510
it is pricey
and we're just gonna run this through

1194
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
and we're just gonna run this through
 

1195
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,390
and we're just gonna run this through
the whole tunnel

1196
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400

 

1197
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,549

okay so it's just about six stacks of

1198
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
okay so it's just about six stacks of
 

1199
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,870
okay so it's just about six stacks of
tnt for this first little stretch

1200
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
tnt for this first little stretch
 

1201
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,669
tnt for this first little stretch
i think we are good to go here no mobs

1202
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
i think we are good to go here no mobs
 

1203
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,950
i think we are good to go here no mobs
yeah okay let's do it let's do it

1204
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
yeah okay let's do it let's do it
 

1205
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,870
yeah okay let's do it let's do it
and

1206
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
and
 

1207
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,909
and
whoa

1208
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
whoa
 

1209
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,750
whoa
oh it followed the whole okay

1210
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
oh it followed the whole okay
 

1211
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,100
oh it followed the whole okay
back up back up

1212
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,110
back up back up
 

1213
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,950

[Music]

1214
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960

 

1215
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,710

sorry that was a little loud

1216
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720

 

1217
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,190

but yeah it does a pretty decent job on

1218
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
but yeah it does a pretty decent job on
 

1219
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,190
but yeah it does a pretty decent job on
the tunnel right

1220
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
the tunnel right
 

1221
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,029
the tunnel right
oh it's still going and i'm not

1222
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
oh it's still going and i'm not
 

1223
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,549
oh it's still going and i'm not
i gotta keep up with it otherwise it'll

1224
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
i gotta keep up with it otherwise it'll
 

1225
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,430
i gotta keep up with it otherwise it'll
stop

1226
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
stop
 

1227
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,590
stop
i think

1228
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,600

 

1229
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,350

all right

1230
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
all right
 

1231
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,350
all right
very good so that's a a good amount of

1232
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
very good so that's a a good amount of
 

1233
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,710
very good so that's a a good amount of
space i don't know if i got the height

1234
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
space i don't know if i got the height
 

1235
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,390
space i don't know if i got the height
right let's find that out in just a

1236
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
right let's find that out in just a
 

1237
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,310
right let's find that out in just a
second i just want to light it up so i

1238
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
second i just want to light it up so i
 

1239
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,310
second i just want to light it up so i
don't get mobbed when i'm building the

1240
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
don't get mobbed when i'm building the
 

1241
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,630
don't get mobbed when i'm building the
tunnel

1242
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
tunnel
 

1243
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,110
tunnel
oh it's getting bad on this end

1244
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120

 

1245
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,710

we're good we're fine everything's good

1246
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
we're good we're fine everything's good
 

1247
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,750
we're good we're fine everything's good
i got my tanky armor on i'm i'm not

1248
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
i got my tanky armor on i'm i'm not
 

1249
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,830
i got my tanky armor on i'm i'm not
taking any chances here okay how are we

1250
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
taking any chances here okay how are we
 

1251
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,029
taking any chances here okay how are we
lining up here uh yeah it looks like

1252
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
lining up here uh yeah it looks like
 

1253
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,630
lining up here uh yeah it looks like
two blocks up was probably the right

1254
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
two blocks up was probably the right
 

1255
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,430
two blocks up was probably the right
call maybe we could have went for three

1256
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
call maybe we could have went for three
 

1257
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,789
call maybe we could have went for three
i'm willing to do a little bit more

1258
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
i'm willing to do a little bit more
 

1259
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,149
i'm willing to do a little bit more
digging

1260
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
digging
 

1261
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,390
digging
uh the idea is we want to have as much

1262
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
uh the idea is we want to have as much
 

1263
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,390
uh the idea is we want to have as much
head space as possible

1264
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
head space as possible
 

1265
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,470
head space as possible
like as much up here

1266
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
like as much up here
 

1267
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,590
like as much up here
open up so it doesn't feel

1268
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
open up so it doesn't feel
 

1269
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,669
open up so it doesn't feel
claustrophobic as we we run through here

1270
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679

 

1271
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,430

so we are probably about two to three

1272
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
so we are probably about two to three
 

1273
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,430
so we are probably about two to three
hours into building like non-stop

1274
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
hours into building like non-stop
 

1275
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,590
hours into building like non-stop
building uh at this point it's not the

1276
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600
building uh at this point it's not the
 

1277
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,070
building uh at this point it's not the
most exciting building i gotta say

1278
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
most exciting building i gotta say
 

1279
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,830
most exciting building i gotta say
it's very repetitive

1280
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
it's very repetitive
 

1281
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,149
it's very repetitive
uh but at least we got great views right

1282
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
uh but at least we got great views right
 

1283
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,149
uh but at least we got great views right
i'm loving the second cavern the second

1284
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
i'm loving the second cavern the second
 

1285
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,390
i'm loving the second cavern the second
one is so cool there's like multiple

1286
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
one is so cool there's like multiple
 

1287
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,350
one is so cool there's like multiple
layers to it like up there we got layers

1288
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
layers to it like up there we got layers
 

1289
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,390
layers to it like up there we got layers
we got

1290
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
we got
 

1291
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,549
we got
like a cool cascading

1292
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
like a cool cascading
 

1293
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,270
like a cool cascading
water structure there it goes way

1294
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
water structure there it goes way
 

1295
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,630
water structure there it goes way
far back

1296
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
far back
 

1297
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,070
far back
over there

1298
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
over there
 

1299
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,270
over there
and like another layer up over there i

1300
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
and like another layer up over there i
 

1301
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,630
and like another layer up over there i
don't know how good it's gonna pick up

1302
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
don't know how good it's gonna pick up
 

1303
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,710
don't know how good it's gonna pick up
on youtube i know youtube likes to

1304
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
on youtube i know youtube likes to
 

1305
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,390
on youtube i know youtube likes to
artifact everything

1306
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
artifact everything
 

1307
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,710
artifact everything
there's a lot of clutter

1308
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
there's a lot of clutter
 

1309
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,549
there's a lot of clutter
in these cave systems so

1310
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
in these cave systems so
 

1311
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,350
in these cave systems so
i think like if i was to clean this up

1312
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
i think like if i was to clean this up
 

1313
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,950
i think like if i was to clean this up
oh yeah a lot of fish are spawning here

1314
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
oh yeah a lot of fish are spawning here
 

1315
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,110
oh yeah a lot of fish are spawning here
apparently uh if i was to clean this up

1316
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
apparently uh if i was to clean this up
 

1317
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,149
apparently uh if i was to clean this up
i want to get rid of some of these

1318
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
i want to get rid of some of these
 

1319
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,710
i want to get rid of some of these
glowberry bush or vine things there's

1320
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
glowberry bush or vine things there's
 

1321
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,470
glowberry bush or vine things there's
like way too many i think uh we also

1322
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
like way too many i think uh we also
 

1323
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,630
like way too many i think uh we also
uh probably want to hang some drip stone

1324
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
uh probably want to hang some drip stone
 

1325
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,710
uh probably want to hang some drip stone
and stuff in here but yeah this is where

1326
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
and stuff in here but yeah this is where
 

1327
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,110
and stuff in here but yeah this is where
it connects to our tunnel

1328
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
it connects to our tunnel
 

1329
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,750
it connects to our tunnel
and this this is like no polish i

1330
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
and this this is like no polish i
 

1331
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,470
and this this is like no polish i
haven't polished it up at all and it's

1332
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
haven't polished it up at all and it's
 

1333
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,230
haven't polished it up at all and it's
pretty good right it's not too bad just

1334
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
pretty good right it's not too bad just
 

1335
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,110
pretty good right it's not too bad just
raw

1336
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
raw
 

1337
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,390
raw
the way it is

1338
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
the way it is
 

1339
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,590
the way it is
uh it is a fairly long tunnel

1340
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
uh it is a fairly long tunnel
 

1341
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,710
uh it is a fairly long tunnel
very long path too

1342
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
very long path too
 

1343
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,789
very long path too
so that's where we're gonna get into our

1344
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
so that's where we're gonna get into our
 

1345
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,710
so that's where we're gonna get into our
next stage here okay

1346
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,720
next stage here okay
 

1347
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,710
next stage here okay
so yeah we got a long

1348
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
so yeah we got a long
 

1349
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,750
so yeah we got a long
long straight path and as you run down

1350
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
long straight path and as you run down
 

1351
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,590
long straight path and as you run down
here even though we're moving very

1352
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
here even though we're moving very
 

1353
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,750
here even though we're moving very
quickly it kind of doesn't really feel

1354
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
quickly it kind of doesn't really feel
 

1355
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,269
quickly it kind of doesn't really feel
like we're moving all that much right

1356
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
like we're moving all that much right
 

1357
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,950
like we're moving all that much right
and that's by design this is very

1358
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
and that's by design this is very
 

1359
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,549
and that's by design this is very
important that the camera is not like

1360
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
important that the camera is not like
 

1361
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,549
important that the camera is not like
going all over the place as we run

1362
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
going all over the place as we run
 

1363
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,630
going all over the place as we run
through here that there's not too much

1364
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
through here that there's not too much
 

1365
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,669
through here that there's not too much
happening

1366
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
happening
 

1367
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,230
happening
for stage two yeah so there's actually

1368
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
for stage two yeah so there's actually
 

1369
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,750
for stage two yeah so there's actually
like a bunch of different reasons i

1370
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
like a bunch of different reasons i
 

1371
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,510
like a bunch of different reasons i
wanted to build this path thing today

1372
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,520
wanted to build this path thing today
 

1373
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,269
wanted to build this path thing today
and one of them was just i thought it'd

1374
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
and one of them was just i thought it'd
 

1375
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,029
and one of them was just i thought it'd
be a great way to check out the caverns

1376
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
be a great way to check out the caverns
 

1377
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,110
be a great way to check out the caverns
like from a safe

1378
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
like from a safe
 

1379
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,510
like from a safe
observation deck kind of thing

1380
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
observation deck kind of thing
 

1381
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,789
observation deck kind of thing
we can look down we don't have to worry

1382
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
we can look down we don't have to worry
 

1383
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,710
we can look down we don't have to worry
about getting mobbed when we're up here

1384
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
about getting mobbed when we're up here
 

1385
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,350
about getting mobbed when we're up here
you know it's it's kind of nice right

1386
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
you know it's it's kind of nice right
 

1387
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,390
you know it's it's kind of nice right
um the other thing though another main

1388
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
um the other thing though another main
 

1389
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,990
um the other thing though another main
reason for this path is it's going to

1390
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
reason for this path is it's going to
 

1391
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,390
reason for this path is it's going to
function as a transportation system in

1392
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
function as a transportation system in
 

1393
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,510
function as a transportation system in
our world

1394
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
our world
 

1395
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,430
our world
and i

1396
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
and i
 

1397
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,149
and i
was messing around in creative the other

1398
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
was messing around in creative the other
 

1399
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,750
was messing around in creative the other
day

1400
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
day
 

1401
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,590
day
and i figured something out okay

1402
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
and i figured something out okay
 

1403
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,630
and i figured something out okay
something i thought was pretty

1404
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
something i thought was pretty
 

1405
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,549
something i thought was pretty
interesting i haven't seen before maybe

1406
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
interesting i haven't seen before maybe
 

1407
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,750
interesting i haven't seen before maybe
somebody's done it before and i just

1408
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
somebody's done it before and i just
 

1409
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,390
somebody's done it before and i just
haven't seen it but

1410
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
haven't seen it but
 

1411
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,350
haven't seen it but
uh

1412
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
uh
 

1413
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,269
uh
it's pretty cool

1414
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
it's pretty cool
 

1415
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,789
it's pretty cool
so this is gonna be a way for us to play

1416
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:08,799
so this is gonna be a way for us to play
 

1417
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,710
so this is gonna be a way for us to play
around with it and uh just show it off

1418
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
around with it and uh just show it off
 

1419
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,990
around with it and uh just show it off
to you guys as well

1420
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
to you guys as well
 

1421
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,990
to you guys as well
so what we gotta do for stage two here

1422
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
so what we gotta do for stage two here
 

1423
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,230
so what we gotta do for stage two here
is flood

1424
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
is flood
 

1425
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,149
is flood
this uh whole middle thing now it's not

1426
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
this uh whole middle thing now it's not
 

1427
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,510
this uh whole middle thing now it's not
gonna flow off the edge or anything nope

1428
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
gonna flow off the edge or anything nope
 

1429
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,789
gonna flow off the edge or anything nope
we're good

1430
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
we're good
 

1431
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,590
we're good
so

1432
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
so
 

1433
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,830
so
i'm i got a ways to go here we're about

1434
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
i'm i got a ways to go here we're about
 

1435
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,750
i'm i got a ways to go here we're about
400 blocks long with this path at the

1436
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
400 blocks long with this path at the
 

1437
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,630
400 blocks long with this path at the
moment

1438
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
moment
 

1439
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,149
moment
we will try to expand it more in the

1440
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
we will try to expand it more in the
 

1441
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,750
we will try to expand it more in the
future but i'm out of bricks for right

1442
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
future but i'm out of bricks for right
 

1443
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,230
future but i'm out of bricks for right
now cool all right so we got it flooded

1444
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
now cool all right so we got it flooded
 

1445
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,070
now cool all right so we got it flooded
all the way down there we are ready to

1446
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
all the way down there we are ready to
 

1447
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,310
all the way down there we are ready to
move on to the next thing you can see

1448
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
move on to the next thing you can see
 

1449
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,750
move on to the next thing you can see
we're still moving quickly through the

1450
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
we're still moving quickly through the
 

1451
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,470
we're still moving quickly through the
water as long as we got depth strider 3

1452
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
water as long as we got depth strider 3

1658
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,600
i had a creeper blow up on one of them
 

1659
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,510
i had a creeper blow up on one of them
and uh yeah you know it's it's been

1660
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
and uh yeah you know it's it's been
 

1661
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,510
and uh yeah you know it's it's been
tricky now it's very important if you

1662
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
tricky now it's very important if you
 

1663
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,510
tricky now it's very important if you
ever want to store a dolphin you gotta

1664
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
ever want to store a dolphin you gotta
 

1665
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,110
ever want to store a dolphin you gotta
keep them in a bubble column like this i

1666
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
keep them in a bubble column like this i
 

1667
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,110
keep them in a bubble column like this i
got soul sand with water above

1668
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
got soul sand with water above
 

1669
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,110
got soul sand with water above
he's forced in that he can't get out of

1670
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
he's forced in that he can't get out of
 

1671
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,350
he's forced in that he can't get out of
it uh if you just give them water with

1672
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
it uh if you just give them water with
 

1673
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,830
it uh if you just give them water with
air above they will eventually die

1674
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
air above they will eventually die
 

1675
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,990
air above they will eventually die
so yeah this is a safe way of doing it

1676
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
so yeah this is a safe way of doing it
 

1677
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,909
so yeah this is a safe way of doing it
though and you have to name take them so

1678
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
though and you have to name take them so
 

1679
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,669
though and you have to name take them so
they don't despawn when you leave the

1680
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
they don't despawn when you leave the
 

1681
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,789
they don't despawn when you leave the
area

1682
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
area
 

1683
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,669
area
okay

1684
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
okay
 

1685
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,549
okay
so let's get to the trick now

1686
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
so let's get to the trick now
 

1687
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,470
so let's get to the trick now
so i was messing around with it i found

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
so i was messing around with it i found
 

1689
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,470
so i was messing around with it i found
a way to get the dolphins grace to work

1690
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
a way to get the dolphins grace to work
 

1691
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,389
a way to get the dolphins grace to work
outside of water like you have to be

1692

outside of water like you have to be
 

1693
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,990
outside of water like you have to be
touching water but you can have your

touching water but you can have your
head out of water

1696
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
head out of water
 

1697
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,430
head out of water
which is kind of cool that's what we're

1698
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
which is kind of cool that's what we're
 

1699
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,269
which is kind of cool that's what we're
trying to do here so

1700
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
trying to do here so
 

1701
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,950

we're going to mine up
 

1703
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,789
we're going to mine up
five block patch here

1704
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
five block patch here
 

1705
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,350
five block patch here
then we will have stairs over on this

1706
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
then we will have stairs over on this
 

1707
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,310
then we will have stairs over on this
end

1708

behaved differently so you got to be

1734
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
behaved differently so you got to be
 

1735
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,549
behaved differently so you got to be
pretty picky on how you set this up uh

pretty picky on how you set this up uh
 

1737
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,549
pretty picky on how you set this up uh
and then fence gates opened on this side

1738
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
and then fence gates opened on this side
 

1739
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,430
and then fence gates opened on this side
break the dirt blocks and now

1740
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
break the dirt blocks and now
 

1741

1773
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,830

we got dolphins grace for a few seconds

1774
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
we got dolphins grace for a few seconds
 

1775
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,110
we got dolphins grace for a few seconds
right but we go uh pretty fast with it

1776
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
right but we go uh pretty fast with it
 

1777
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,830
right but we go uh pretty fast with it
uh and this is also a two-way booster so

1778
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
uh and this is also a two-way booster so
 

1779
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,430
uh and this is also a two-way booster so
we can use it going the other way as

1780
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
we can use it going the other way as
 

1781
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,509
we can use it going the other way as
well

1782
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
well
 

1783
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,830
well
so check this out

1784
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
so check this out
 

1785
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,630
so check this out
hold forward and control

1786
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
hold forward and control
 

1787
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,230
hold forward and control
boom

1788
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,240
boom
 

1789
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,149
boom
uh-huh you can go out of the water for a

1790
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:56,159
uh-huh you can go out of the water for a
 

1791
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,590
uh-huh you can go out of the water for a
bit and then go back in and you will

1792
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
bit and then go back in and you will
 

1793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,830
bit and then go back in and you will
still have the speed boost as well

1794
00:31:59,830 --> 00:31:59,840
still have the speed boost as well
 

1795
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,269
still have the speed boost as well
it's kind of a fun thing to play around

1796
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:01,279
it's kind of a fun thing to play around
 

1797
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,389
it's kind of a fun thing to play around
with

1798
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:02,399
with
 

1799
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,310
with
oh out of the water in the water out of

1800
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
oh out of the water in the water out of
 

1801
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,430
oh out of the water in the water out of
the water

1802
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
the water
 

1803
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,750
the water
reboost

1804
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760

 

1805
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,350

aha so the idea is we're gonna have

1806
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
aha so the idea is we're gonna have
 

1807
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,029
aha so the idea is we're gonna have
these booster stations set up every few

1808
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
these booster stations set up every few
 

1809
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,269
these booster stations set up every few
hundred blocks in here and we'll be able

1810
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:15,279
hundred blocks in here and we'll be able
 

1811
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,470
hundred blocks in here and we'll be able
to zip through the tunnels very quickly

1812
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
to zip through the tunnels very quickly
 

1813
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,950
to zip through the tunnels very quickly
i don't know if i can like look around

1814
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
i don't know if i can like look around
 

1815
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,149
i don't know if i can like look around
as we're going oh not safely

1816
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:24,159
as we're going oh not safely
 

1817
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,750
as we're going oh not safely
and the really crazy thing about that

1818
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
and the really crazy thing about that
 

1819
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,430
and the really crazy thing about that
that wasn't even the max speed we

1820
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
that wasn't even the max speed we
 

1821
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,750
that wasn't even the max speed we
weren't under the effects of speed 2

1822
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
weren't under the effects of speed 2
 

1823
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,230
weren't under the effects of speed 2
which gives you 40 more speed so

1824
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
which gives you 40 more speed so
 

1825
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,990
which gives you 40 more speed so
if we set up beacons and stuff with that

1826
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
if we set up beacons and stuff with that
 

1827
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,149
if we set up beacons and stuff with that
uh yeah we'll go even faster let's try

1828
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
uh yeah we'll go even faster let's try
 

1829
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,789
uh yeah we'll go even faster let's try
it out with speed 2

1830
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
it out with speed 2
 

1831
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,710
it out with speed 2
and i was worried this might get a

1832
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
and i was worried this might get a
 

1833
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,430
and i was worried this might get a
little too fast though honestly

1834
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,440
little too fast though honestly
 

1835
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,590
little too fast though honestly
uh so we we might need to do some

1836
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
uh so we we might need to do some
 

1837
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,590
uh so we we might need to do some
adjusting yeah we made it way past the

1838
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
adjusting yeah we made it way past the
 

1839
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,029
adjusting yeah we made it way past the
water

1840
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
water
 

1841
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,230
water
so we

1842
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
so we
 

1843
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,990
so we
last time without the speed 2 we only

1844
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
last time without the speed 2 we only
 

1845
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,389
last time without the speed 2 we only
made it to about here before it stopped

1846
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
made it to about here before it stopped
 

1847
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,669
made it to about here before it stopped
this time we made it all the way to the

1848
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
this time we made it all the way to the
 

1849
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,710
this time we made it all the way to the
end

1850
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
end
 

1851
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,110
end
so it's definitely faster

1852
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120

 

1853
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,509

so if it's too fast if we want to slow

1854
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
so if it's too fast if we want to slow
 

1855
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,870
so if it's too fast if we want to slow
it down there's a couple things we could

1856
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
it down there's a couple things we could
 

1857
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,549
it down there's a couple things we could
do we can get rid of the sole speed on

1858
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559
do we can get rid of the sole speed on
 

1859
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,350
do we can get rid of the sole speed on
our boots we can get rid of uh speed 2

1860
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
our boots we can get rid of uh speed 2
 

1861
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,509
our boots we can get rid of uh speed 2
from a beacon like if we want to control

1862
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
from a beacon like if we want to control
 

1863
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,509
from a beacon like if we want to control
the speed and like take a more scenic

1864
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519
the speed and like take a more scenic
 

1865
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,350
the speed and like take a more scenic
tour

1866
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,360
tour
 

1867
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,669
tour
uh but if we want to go really fast we

1868
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
uh but if we want to go really fast we
 

1869
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,669
uh but if we want to go really fast we
have that option as well

1870
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:21,679
have that option as well
 

1871
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,350
have that option as well
oh man

1872
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
oh man
 

1873
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,789
oh man
i also wanted to check out

1874
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:26,799
i also wanted to check out
 

1875
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,750
i also wanted to check out
really

1876
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:27,760
really
 

1877
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,549
really
uh if we can uh

1878
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
uh if we can uh
 

1879
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,350
uh if we can uh
get this to activate with our elytra

1880
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
get this to activate with our elytra
 

1881
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,269
get this to activate with our elytra
what happens oh yeah we oh yeah yeah

1882
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
what happens oh yeah we oh yeah yeah
 

1883
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,669
what happens oh yeah we oh yeah yeah
yeah okay yeah so that's that's going to

1884
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:37,679
yeah okay yeah so that's that's going to
 

1885
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,269
yeah okay yeah so that's that's going to
be something too

1886
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:39,279
be something too
 

1887
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,350
be something too
so if we want to take off in the middle

1888
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
so if we want to take off in the middle
 

1889
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,230
so if we want to take off in the middle
of our run and like go somewhere in the

1890
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,240
of our run and like go somewhere in the
 

1891
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,870
of our run and like go somewhere in the
cavern here we can

1892
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:46,880
cavern here we can
 

1893
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,669
cavern here we can
let's try that again

1894
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
let's try that again
 

1895
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,950
let's try that again
this is still like i haven't played

1896
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
this is still like i haven't played
 

1897
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,230
this is still like i haven't played
around with this fully there's still

1898
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
around with this fully there's still
 

1899
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,070
around with this fully there's still
some things i'm figuring out with it uh

1900
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
some things i'm figuring out with it uh
 

1901
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,389
some things i'm figuring out with it uh
yeah okay so with elytra you can take

1902
00:33:58,389 --> 00:33:58,399
yeah okay so with elytra you can take
 

1903
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,269
yeah okay so with elytra you can take
off just from the ground

1904
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
off just from the ground
 

1905
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,990
off just from the ground
which is pretty awesome i like that

1906
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
which is pretty awesome i like that
 

1907
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,830
which is pretty awesome i like that
not very quickly though there might be a

1908
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:05,840
not very quickly though there might be a
 

1909
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,589
not very quickly though there might be a
way to do it better

1910
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:09,599

 

1911
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,790

let's try again

1912
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:12,800

 

1913
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,389

oh yeah you gotta you gotta double tap

1914
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,399
oh yeah you gotta you gotta double tap
 

1915
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,230
oh yeah you gotta you gotta double tap
space very quickly the faster you do it

1916
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
space very quickly the faster you do it
 

1917
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,550
space very quickly the faster you do it
i think the faster you will take off ah

1918
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:18,560
i think the faster you will take off ah
 

1919
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,629
i think the faster you will take off ah
it's so much fun

1920
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
it's so much fun
 

1921
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,710
it's so much fun
but anyways i do have a stage three in

1922
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
but anyways i do have a stage three in
 

1923
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,990
but anyways i do have a stage three in
mind with this plan if we want to

1924
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000
mind with this plan if we want to
 

1925
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,589
mind with this plan if we want to
develop it further we won't have time

1926
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
develop it further we won't have time
 

1927
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,550
develop it further we won't have time
today

1928
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
today
 

1929
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,710
today
but the idea for stage three is we

1930
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:28,720
but the idea for stage three is we
 

1931
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,950
but the idea for stage three is we
actually start building in these caverns

1932
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
actually start building in these caverns
 

1933
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,310
actually start building in these caverns
like some of them will probably keep

1934
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,320
like some of them will probably keep
 

1935
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,109
like some of them will probably keep
organic like this but how cool would it

1936
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:35,119
organic like this but how cool would it
 

1937
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,190
organic like this but how cool would it
be if we actually like start setting up

1938
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,200
be if we actually like start setting up
 

1939
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,470
be if we actually like start setting up
farms down here maybe building

1940
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480
farms down here maybe building
 

1941
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,030
farms down here maybe building
custom biomes or building trees like if

1942
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040
custom biomes or building trees like if
 

1943
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,389
custom biomes or building trees like if
you think about it each one of these

1944
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:44,399
you think about it each one of these
 

1945
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,589
you think about it each one of these
caverns

1946
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
caverns
 

1947
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,470
caverns
could function as its own uh pocket

1948
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
could function as its own uh pocket
 

1949
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,909
could function as its own uh pocket
basically like it could have its own

1950
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
basically like it could have its own
 

1951
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,990
basically like it could have its own
biome its own purpose

1952
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
biome its own purpose
 

1953
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,389
biome its own purpose
and it's got all this space already

1954
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:54,399
and it's got all this space already
 

1955
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,230
and it's got all this space already
hollowed out for us

1956
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
hollowed out for us
 

1957
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,150
hollowed out for us
there's a lot we could do right imagine

1958
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
there's a lot we could do right imagine
 

1959
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,270
there's a lot we could do right imagine
like

1960
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280
like
 

1961
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,670
like
the highway here if we

1962
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
the highway here if we
 

1963
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,829
the highway here if we
turn it into like uh

1964
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
turn it into like uh
 

1965
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,670
turn it into like uh
almost like a bridge running across here

1966
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,680
almost like a bridge running across here
 

1967
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,910
almost like a bridge running across here
i think that would look cool

1968
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
i think that would look cool
 

1969
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,950
i think that would look cool

trust me
uh but the other idea with stage three

1982
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
uh but the other idea with stage three
 

1983
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,670
uh but the other idea with stage three
if we actually like start building stuff

1984
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680
if we actually like start building stuff
 

1985
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,349
if we actually like start building stuff
on the layers like there's layers up

1986
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
on the layers like there's layers up
 

1987
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,750
on the layers like there's layers up
here uh this will also function with

1988
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:25,760
here uh this will also function with
 

1989
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,270
here uh this will also function with
riptide

1990
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,280
riptide
 

1991
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,349
riptide
and we can like hop between the layers

1992
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
and we can like hop between the layers
 

1993
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,790
and we can like hop between the layers
there's another layer over there we

1994
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
there's another layer over there we
 

1995
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,030
there's another layer over there we
could hop to that we could hop back

1996
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,040
could hop to that we could hop back
 

1997
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,349
could hop to that we could hop back
to our highway you know

1998
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
to our highway you know
 

1999
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,190

2065
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,790
but uh the other thing is i thought i
was legally allowed to do it

2066

was legally allowed to do it
 

2067
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,190
was legally allowed to do it
because i'm actually generating the

00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200
because i'm actually generating the
 

2069
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,430
because i'm actually generating the
music on my own computer right it's a
