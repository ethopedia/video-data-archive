hello minecrafters this is etho again

00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:05,299
hello minecrafters this is etho again
 

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,870
hello minecrafters this is etho again
and we got another good episode here for

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
and we got another good episode here for
 

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,509
and we got another good episode here for
you as you can see I've redone the

6
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
you as you can see I've redone the
 

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,640
you as you can see I've redone the
passive mob spawning pads don't really

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:19,650
passive mob spawning pads don't really
 

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,890
passive mob spawning pads don't really
know how well they work yet because I

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:21,900
know how well they work yet because I
 

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,960
know how well they work yet because I
just recently did it and I don't know

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:26,970
just recently did it and I don't know
 

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,960
just recently did it and I don't know
how well you can see it but a little bit

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:29,970
how well you can see it but a little bit
 

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,319
how well you can see it but a little bit
complicated kind of similar to the

16
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:33,329
complicated kind of similar to the
 

17
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,500
complicated kind of similar to the
hostile spawning pads and then in the

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:39,510
hostile spawning pads and then in the
 

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,869
hostile spawning pads and then in the
center I just got a whole load of signs

20
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:41,879
center I just got a whole load of signs
 

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,650
center I just got a whole load of signs
to prevent the water from spilling over

22
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:47,660

 

23
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,470

but I think it works good I'll probably

24
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,480
but I think it works good I'll probably
 

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,110
but I think it works good I'll probably
release a new download to my world then

26
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,120
release a new download to my world then
 

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,299
release a new download to my world then
if you guys want a closer look check it

28
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:56,309
if you guys want a closer look check it
 

29
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:09,170
if you guys want a closer look check it
out by downloading my world and I think

30
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,180
out by downloading my world and I think
 

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,670
out by downloading my world and I think
the chicken separator works perfect I

32
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:12,680
the chicken separator works perfect I
 

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,090
the chicken separator works perfect I
haven't seen any mobs it's stuck in the

34
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,100
haven't seen any mobs it's stuck in the
 

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,510
haven't seen any mobs it's stuck in the
water kind of think that cow got stuck

36
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,520
water kind of think that cow got stuck
 

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,340
water kind of think that cow got stuck
because it landed on that chicken last

38
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:22,350
because it landed on that chicken last
 

39
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,950
because it landed on that chicken last
night because I haven't seen that happen

40
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
night because I haven't seen that happen
 

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,280
night because I haven't seen that happen
again

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,290
again
 

43
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,030
again
since look at that brief cow what are

44
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,040
since look at that brief cow what are
 

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,600
since look at that brief cow what are
you doing over here

46
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:34,610
you doing over here
 

47
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:41,180
you doing over here
of course I leg every time I come here

48
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,190

 

49
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:48,000

chickens are up there but so the first

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,010
chickens are up there but so the first
 

51
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,230
chickens are up there but so the first
thing we're going to do is we're going

52
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,240
thing we're going to do is we're going
 

53
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,290
thing we're going to do is we're going
to try get a pick separator going here

54
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:54,300
to try get a pick separator going here
 

55
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,790
to try get a pick separator going here
and we've got to route all the items to

56
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:56,800
and we've got to route all the items to
 

57
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,320
and we've got to route all the items to
this point here this is a collection

58
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,330
this point here this is a collection
 

59
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,270
this point here this is a collection
tube we're not going to build a minecart

60
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
tube we're not going to build a minecart
 

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,620
tube we're not going to build a minecart
gate up here we're going to build it

62
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:04,630
gate up here we're going to build it
 

63
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,400
gate up here we're going to build it
down lower to save space because it's a

64
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,410
down lower to save space because it's a
 

65
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:15,510
down lower to save space because it's a
little bit cramped on this level so

66
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
little bit cramped on this level so
 

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,040
little bit cramped on this level so
let's get going here

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,050

 

69
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,910

so information on the Wikipedia isn't

70
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
so information on the Wikipedia isn't
 

71
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,270
so information on the Wikipedia isn't
quite accurate for the sizes of the

72
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
quite accurate for the sizes of the
 

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,530
quite accurate for the sizes of the
animals but basically they get pigs

74
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:31,540
animals but basically they get pigs
 

75
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,140
animals but basically they get pigs
separated they are one block tall well

76
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,150
separated they are one block tall well
 

77
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:44,580
separated they are one block tall well
sheep and cows are larger than that so

78
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,590
sheep and cows are larger than that so
 

79
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,820
sheep and cows are larger than that so
you basically just need to force them

80
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:47,830
you basically just need to force them
 

81
00:02:47,830 --> 00:03:04,750
you basically just need to force them
through one buckle one block high hole

82
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:04,760

 

83
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,949

and the best way of doing that I think

84
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
and the best way of doing that I think
 

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:15,050
and the best way of doing that I think
is to use a diagnosed stream of water so

86
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,060
is to use a diagnosed stream of water so
 

87
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:28,729
is to use a diagnosed stream of water so
now and I haven't practiced building

88
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:28,739
now and I haven't practiced building
 

89
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,770
now and I haven't practiced building
this or anything so it's I'm just trying

90
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:30,780
this or anything so it's I'm just trying
 

91
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:56,220
this or anything so it's I'm just trying
to make it up on the fly here

92
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,230

 

93
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:03,910

let's see here

94
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920

 

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,430

actually let's move this block in one

96
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:08,440
actually let's move this block in one
 

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:23,440
actually let's move this block in one
we gotta want a sharp angle okay we're

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,450
we gotta want a sharp angle okay we're
 

99
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:36,670
we gotta want a sharp angle okay we're
going to have that part covered and so

100
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,680
going to have that part covered and so
 

101
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,840
going to have that part covered and so
it's going to be one block high here and

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:40,850
it's going to be one block high here and
 

103
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,030
it's going to be one block high here and
that's where the pigs should get pushed

104
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
that's where the pigs should get pushed
 

105
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:55,000
that's where the pigs should get pushed
through hopefully and the rest of the

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,010
through hopefully and the rest of the
 

107
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,710
through hopefully and the rest of the
mobs are going to just continue down the

108
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
mobs are going to just continue down the
 

109
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,970
mobs are going to just continue down the
line you got to be careful not to cover

110
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:00,980
line you got to be careful not to cover
 

111
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:19,119
line you got to be careful not to cover
this up

112
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:19,129

 

113
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:23,199

so I think I'm going to try it like this

114
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,209
so I think I'm going to try it like this
 

115
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,249
so I think I'm going to try it like this
I'm gonna have to test this off-camera

116
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:25,259
I'm gonna have to test this off-camera
 

117
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,570
I'm gonna have to test this off-camera
though because it's going to take a

118
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,580
though because it's going to take a
 

119
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,759
though because it's going to take a
while for the pigs to spawn so I'll see

120
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:31,769
while for the pigs to spawn so I'll see
 

121
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,509
while for the pigs to spawn so I'll see
you guys in a bit

122
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:32,519
you guys in a bit
 

123
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,259
you guys in a bit
I'm going to watch it for a while and

124
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:35,269
I'm going to watch it for a while and
 

125
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:41,989
I'm going to watch it for a while and
then we might make some changes okay

126
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:41,999
then we might make some changes okay
 

127
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:49,159
then we might make some changes okay
this is a pretty promising you'll notice

128
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,169
this is a pretty promising you'll notice
 

129
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:56,269
this is a pretty promising you'll notice
there's only pigs outside here and

130
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:56,279
there's only pigs outside here and
 

131
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:05,499
there's only pigs outside here and
there's cows and sheep Center perky I

132
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:05,509

 

133
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,790

don't know exactly what happened I went

134
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
don't know exactly what happened I went
 

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,089
don't know exactly what happened I went
away for a while and when I came back

136
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:13,099
away for a while and when I came back
 

137
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,759
away for a while and when I came back
this is how it how it was pigs

138
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:16,769
this is how it how it was pigs
 

139
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,399
this is how it how it was pigs
everywhere so I think it's working

140
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:19,409
everywhere so I think it's working
 

141
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:20,329
everywhere so I think it's working
already

142
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:20,339
already
 

143
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:30,409
already
I made a couple slight changes so these

144
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:30,419
I made a couple slight changes so these
 

145
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,179
I made a couple slight changes so these
guys were made so they can't get up

146
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:32,189
guys were made so they can't get up
 

147
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:38,480
guys were made so they can't get up
while the pigs could get out alright

148
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,490
while the pigs could get out alright
 

149
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:56,600
while the pigs could get out alright
clear their best part of my job okay so

150
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:56,610
clear their best part of my job okay so
 

151
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,980
clear their best part of my job okay so
I made a couple slight changes I should

152
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:00,990
I made a couple slight changes I should
 

153
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,309
I made a couple slight changes I should
pretty much only one

154
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:03,319
pretty much only one
 

155
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:14,619
pretty much only one
why Kenneth escrito yes I looks like

156
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:14,629
why Kenneth escrito yes I looks like
 

157
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,350
why Kenneth escrito yes I looks like
it's working pretty good

158
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,360
it's working pretty good
 

159
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,790
it's working pretty good
basically I got rid of that second water

160
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
basically I got rid of that second water
 

161
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,790
basically I got rid of that second water
source because I guess the water

162
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:21,800
source because I guess the water
 

163
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,769
source because I guess the water
transfer clashing with each other so I

164
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:26,779
transfer clashing with each other so I
 

165
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,749
transfer clashing with each other so I
just have the one right in the corner

166
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:28,759
just have the one right in the corner
 

167
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,450
just have the one right in the corner
here and starting from this point that

168
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:34,460
here and starting from this point that
 

169
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,879
here and starting from this point that
way starting from here the pixels

170
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:39,889
way starting from here the pixels
 

171
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:42,369
way starting from here the pixels
started going under and it's diagonal

172
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:42,379
started going under and it's diagonal
 

173
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:49,949
started going under and it's diagonal
stream all the way up to here

174
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:49,959

 

175
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,600

so once the pigs get in this area here

176
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,610
so once the pigs get in this area here
 

177
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,549
so once the pigs get in this area here
then we collect them together to another

178
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:56,559
then we collect them together to another
 

179
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,820
then we collect them together to another
one white tube and they will be separate

180
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:00,830
one white tube and they will be separate
 

181
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,769
one white tube and they will be separate
from the system okay I'm going to go

182
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:05,779
from the system okay I'm going to go
 

183
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,509
from the system okay I'm going to go
ahead and build this out of glass now

184
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:07,519
ahead and build this out of glass now
 

185
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:14,769
ahead and build this out of glass now
because I'm pretty happy with it I think

186
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:14,779
because I'm pretty happy with it I think
 

187
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,269
because I'm pretty happy with it I think
there's something wrong with my mouse or

188
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:16,279
there's something wrong with my mouse or
 

189
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,100
there's something wrong with my mouse or
else it's a glitch in the game every

190
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,110
else it's a glitch in the game every
 

191
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,389
else it's a glitch in the game every
time like I try to pick up stuff and

192
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:22,399
time like I try to pick up stuff and
 

193
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:35,940
time like I try to pick up stuff and
still gets placed down on you

194
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:35,950

 

195
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,820

okay that didn't take long

196
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:39,830
okay that didn't take long
 

197
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,580
okay that didn't take long
oh yeah and I don't claim credit for any

198
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:45,590
oh yeah and I don't claim credit for any
 

199
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,900
oh yeah and I don't claim credit for any
of the stuff like it's not really my

200
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,910
of the stuff like it's not really my
 

201
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,760
of the stuff like it's not really my
invention or anything like that

202
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:51,770
invention or anything like that
 

203
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,660
invention or anything like that
a lot of people have given me tips about

204
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:55,670
a lot of people have given me tips about
 

205
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,910
a lot of people have given me tips about
how I could do this one guy in

206
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
how I could do this one guy in
 

207
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,520
how I could do this one guy in
particular made a video of how to

208
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:03,530
particular made a video of how to
 

209
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,540
particular made a video of how to
separate the mobs and it was very nicely

210
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:07,550
separate the mobs and it was very nicely
 

211
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,960
separate the mobs and it was very nicely
done

212
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:07,970
done
 

213
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,240
done
unfortunately I don't I can't find the

214
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,250
unfortunately I don't I can't find the
 

215
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,250
unfortunately I don't I can't find the
video otherwise I would post it I think

216
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,260
video otherwise I would post it I think
 

217
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,460
video otherwise I would post it I think
the guy's name started and if I remember

218
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:18,470
the guy's name started and if I remember
 

219
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,320
the guy's name started and if I remember
right and people have been making

220
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,330
right and people have been making
 

221
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,820
right and people have been making
passive mob separators for a long time

222
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:27,830
passive mob separators for a long time
 

223
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,940
passive mob separators for a long time
now but at the same time I'm not

224
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:32,950
now but at the same time I'm not
 

225
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,490
now but at the same time I'm not
directly copying anything just going off

226
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:36,500
directly copying anything just going off
 

227
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,910
directly copying anything just going off
the concepts that can separate chickens

228
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
the concepts that can separate chickens
 

229
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,000
the concepts that can separate chickens
using gravity and water and separate

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,010
using gravity and water and separate
 

231
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,320
using gravity and water and separate
pigs using a one block high opening with

232
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,330
pigs using a one block high opening with
 

233
00:09:47,330 --> 00:10:04,760
pigs using a one block high opening with
a diagnose cream okay

234
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:04,770

 

235
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,660

yeah there's something wrong with my

236
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:06,670
yeah there's something wrong with my
 

237
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:19,020
yeah there's something wrong with my
mouth hmm

238
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,030
mouth hmm
 

239
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:40,770
mouth hmm
how should do this okay give me a sec

240
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:40,780
how should do this okay give me a sec
 

241
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,880
how should do this okay give me a sec
yeah I'm gonna think about this little

242
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:41,890
yeah I'm gonna think about this little
 

243
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:48,620
yeah I'm gonna think about this little
bit okay so what I was thinking about is

244
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:48,630
bit okay so what I was thinking about is
 

245
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,330
bit okay so what I was thinking about is
you know normally and my systems I don't

246
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:51,340
you know normally and my systems I don't
 

247
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,110
you know normally and my systems I don't
like to have any dead zones but I don't

248
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
like to have any dead zones but I don't
 

249
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,920
like to have any dead zones but I don't
think it's really avoidable with the

250
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:58,930
think it's really avoidable with the
 

251
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:05,760
think it's really avoidable with the
pigs because like hostile mobs tall mobs

252
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:05,770
pigs because like hostile mobs tall mobs
 

253
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:11,310
pigs because like hostile mobs tall mobs
or two blocks high spiders therefore

254
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,320
or two blocks high spiders therefore
 

255
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,350
or two blocks high spiders therefore
blocks two by two you know but pigs they

256
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,360
blocks two by two you know but pigs they
 

257
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,260
blocks two by two you know but pigs they
are one by one

258
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,270
are one by one
 

259
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:25,410
are one by one
basically so to have no dead zones you I

260
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:25,420
basically so to have no dead zones you I
 

261
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,240
basically so to have no dead zones you I
think you pretty much need to have a mob

262
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,250
think you pretty much need to have a mob
 

263
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,350
think you pretty much need to have a mob
that is at least two blocks in size

264
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360

 

265
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,600

unless like right where this cobblestone

266
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:36,610
unless like right where this cobblestone
 

267
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,850
unless like right where this cobblestone
is here if I was to drop it down one

268
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:38,860
is here if I was to drop it down one
 

269
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,240
is here if I was to drop it down one
layer and then place water there would

270
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,250
layer and then place water there would
 

271
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,090
layer and then place water there would
be no dead zones because the water is

272
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,100
be no dead zones because the water is
 

273
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,750
be no dead zones because the water is
running the full length but I don't

274
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:48,760
running the full length but I don't
 

275
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,950
running the full length but I don't
really want to do that just because

276
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:49,960
really want to do that just because
 

277
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,879
really want to do that just because
it'll make things

278
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:51,889
it'll make things
 

279
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:58,410
it'll make things
hmm have like a lessons on that stuff

280
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:58,420

 

281
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,970

it'll make things a little bit more

282
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:00,980
it'll make things a little bit more
 

283
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:09,460
it'll make things a little bit more
difficult I kind of want it all level so

284
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:09,470
difficult I kind of want it all level so
 

285
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,720
difficult I kind of want it all level so
I'm just going to place a pressure plate

286
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm just going to place a pressure plate
 

287
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm just going to place a pressure plate
here that's the dead zone and hopefully

288
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,290
here that's the dead zone and hopefully
 

289
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:23,769
here that's the dead zone and hopefully
everything will be okay still so this is

290
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:23,779
everything will be okay still so this is
 

291
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:36,159
everything will be okay still so this is
where the two rips off and we're just

292
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,169
where the two rips off and we're just
 

293
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,530
where the two rips off and we're just
going to make it small just to make sure

294
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:38,540
going to make it small just to make sure
 

295
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,199
going to make it small just to make sure
it works first I'm pretty sure the pigs

296
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:41,209
it works first I'm pretty sure the pigs
 

297
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,849
it works first I'm pretty sure the pigs
will have no problem walking that one

298
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:42,859
will have no problem walking that one
 

299
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:46,030
will have no problem walking that one
block space and then there'll be another

300
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,040
block space and then there'll be another
 

301
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:56,669
block space and then there'll be another
water screen you know right next to it

302
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:56,679

 

303
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,199

all right so only pigs should be able to

304
00:12:59,199 --> 00:12:59,209
all right so only pigs should be able to
 

305
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,710
all right so only pigs should be able to
make it to this point and it'll be easy

306
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
make it to this point and it'll be easy
 

307
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,659
make it to this point and it'll be easy
to deal with them from here on because

308
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:04,669
to deal with them from here on because
 

309
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:23,039
to deal with them from here on because
it's a 1:1 wide by one high next thing

310
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,049

 

311
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,819

we should probably figure out we're

312
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:24,829
we should probably figure out we're
 

313
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:31,340
we should probably figure out we're
gonna do with the chickens here

314
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,350

 

315
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,200

I think just for now I'm going to remove

316
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,210
I think just for now I'm going to remove
 

317
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:53,900
I think just for now I'm going to remove
this water oh maybe I can't so running

318
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:53,910
this water oh maybe I can't so running
 

319
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,530
this water oh maybe I can't so running
at this the water the full length helps

320
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:57,540
at this the water the full length helps
 

321
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,600
at this the water the full length helps
to make sure that the pigs actually go

322
00:13:59,600 --> 00:13:59,610
to make sure that the pigs actually go
 

323
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:07,520
to make sure that the pigs actually go
through this gap because in the one

324
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:07,530
through this gap because in the one
 

325
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,260
through this gap because in the one
video I saw that was a problem he was

326
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,270
video I saw that was a problem he was
 

327
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,090
video I saw that was a problem he was

oh they're stuck on the pressure plates

376
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:09,680
oh they're stuck on the pressure plates
 

377
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:17,020
oh they're stuck on the pressure plates
that's not good

378
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,030

 

379
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:24,130

dead zones because they're only one by

384
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
dead zones because they're only one by
 

385
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:41,440
dead zones because they're only one by
one as well the thing is though with

mobs once they do this like where they

388
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:44,300
mobs once they do this like where they
 

389
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,260
mobs once they do this like where they
get stuck on a pressure plate I don't

390
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,270
get stuck on a pressure plate I don't
 

391
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,730
get stuck on a pressure plate I don't
think they'll ever move they'll just

keep jumping up and down forever so
 

395
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,030
keep jumping up and down forever so
that's kind of a big issue I don't know

396
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,040
that's kind of a big issue I don't know
 

397

398
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:04,550

 

399
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:13,330

oh man oh man see again that's why I

oh man oh man see again that's why I
 

401
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,650
oh man oh man see again that's why I
don't like dead zones because it gets

402
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:14,660
don't like dead zones because it gets
 

403
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,430
don't like dead zones because it gets
stuck and it's not just cuz it's a

404
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:18,440
stuck and it's not just cuz it's a
 

405
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,990
stuck and it's not just cuz it's a
pressure plate they do that if it's a

406
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
pressure plate they do that if it's a
 

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,330
pressure plate they do that if it's a
sign and other things do because they

408
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,340
sign and other things do because they
 

409
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:34,570
sign and other things do because they
can't see through the block okay I'm

410
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:34,580
can't see through the block okay I'm
 

411
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,550
can't see through the block okay I'm
going to do some more thinking I guess

412
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:36,560
going to do some more thinking I guess
 

413
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,750
going to do some more thinking I guess
okay okay so not a whole lot of progress

414
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
okay okay so not a whole lot of progress
 

415
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,630
okay okay so not a whole lot of progress
the whole thinking thing but I do think

416
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:49,640
the whole thinking thing but I do think
 

417
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,920
the whole thinking thing but I do think
that know how I'm going to do the

418
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:50,930
that know how I'm going to do the
 

419
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:57,580
that know how I'm going to do the
chicken set up so you can see in there

420
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:57,590
chicken set up so you can see in there
 

421
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,790
chicken set up so you can see in there
I removed the two water source blocks

422
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:00,800
I removed the two water source blocks
 

423
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,520
I removed the two water source blocks
there's only one in there now in that

424
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:03,530
there's only one in there now in that
 

425
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,590
there's only one in there now in that
corner she's in diagonally towards this

426
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:08,600
corner she's in diagonally towards this
 

427
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,460
corner she's in diagonally towards this
one why - and the water is going to flow

428
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:15,470
one why - and the water is going to flow
 

429
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,130
one why - and the water is going to flow
all the way up to this door here and

430
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,140
all the way up to this door here and
 

431
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:26,510
all the way up to this door here and
he's just suspended by a sign okay

432
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,520

 

433
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:36,430

this is all going to be covered and

434
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:36,440

 

435
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,220

let's see if this works

436
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,230
let's see if this works
 

437
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,750
let's see if this works
lay there move this quickly in place of

438
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
lay there move this quickly in place of
 

439
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:49,900
lay there move this quickly in place of
blocks and loser that's terrible

440
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:49,910

 

441
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,790

okay so this is like our chicken storage

442
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:52,800
okay so this is like our chicken storage
 

443
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,320
okay so this is like our chicken storage
so they're going to lay eggs when

444
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,330
so they're going to lay eggs when
 

445
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,530
so they're going to lay eggs when
they're like that then the eggs are

446
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:57,540
they're like that then the eggs are
 

447
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:05,870
they're like that then the eggs are
going to drop through this water into a

448
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:05,880
going to drop through this water into a
 

449
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:14,930
going to drop through this water into a
screen below and then that stream is

450
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:14,940
screen below and then that stream is
 

451
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,560
screen below and then that stream is
going to run towards this point here and

452
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:17,570
going to run towards this point here and
 

453
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,450
going to run towards this point here and
drop eggs down and then the option is

454
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:23,460
drop eggs down and then the option is
 

455
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,980
drop eggs down and then the option is
going to be controlled by this door if

456
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:24,990
going to be controlled by this door if
 

457
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,380
going to be controlled by this door if
this door is open the chickens are going

458
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:27,390
this door is open the chickens are going
 

459
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,620
this door is open the chickens are going
to go to a killing chamber which will

460
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:30,630
to go to a killing chamber which will
 

461
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,370
to go to a killing chamber which will
harvest their feathers and then the

462
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:34,380
harvest their feathers and then the
 

463
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,230
harvest their feathers and then the
feathers will get routed to the

464
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
feathers will get routed to the
 

465
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,310
feathers will get routed to the
collection point and it's kind of going

466
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
collection point and it's kind of going
 

467
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,400
collection point and it's kind of going
off to the left here so it's out of the

468
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,410
off to the left here so it's out of the
 

469
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,460
off to the left here so it's out of the
way I got the pigs going to the right

470
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:46,470
way I got the pigs going to the right
 

471
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,110
way I got the pigs going to the right
and then the other guys are probably

472
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,120
and then the other guys are probably
 

473
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,630
and then the other guys are probably
going to go over here someplace

474
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
going to go over here someplace
 

475
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,690
going to go over here someplace
not we got our four steak

476
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:56,700

 

477
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:06,560

I just probably make the screen also go

478
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:06,570
I just probably make the screen also go
 

479
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:27,769
I just probably make the screen also go
down at least one yeah just gonna place

480
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:27,779
down at least one yeah just gonna place
 

481
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:36,799
down at least one yeah just gonna place
the sign here to prove and please water

482
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:36,809

 

483
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,289

that should move the eggs to wherever we

484
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:40,299
that should move the eggs to wherever we
 

485
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:47,279
that should move the eggs to wherever we
want them to go so we're going to try

486
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:47,289
want them to go so we're going to try
 

487
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:48,659
want them to go so we're going to try
open the door here to make sure the

488
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:48,669
open the door here to make sure the
 

489
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:51,000
open the door here to make sure the
