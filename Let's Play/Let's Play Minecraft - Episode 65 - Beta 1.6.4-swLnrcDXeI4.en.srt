00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,679
block another water source in the sensor
so I'm gonna do the same thing for this

166
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:47,689
so I'm gonna do the same thing for this
 

167
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:54,279
so I'm gonna do the same thing for this
one it's kind of hard to do so

168
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,289
one it's kind of hard to do so
 

169
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,029
one it's kind of hard to do so
diagonally of where the water stream

170
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,039
diagonally of where the water stream
 

171
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,300
diagonally of where the water stream
goes down normally I'm gonna put another

172
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,310
goes down normally I'm gonna put another
 

173
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,019
goes down normally I'm gonna put another
water source here and I have to be very

174
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:05,029
water source here and I have to be very
 

175
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:09,219
water source here and I have to be very
careful not to leak water and destroy

176
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:09,229
careful not to leak water and destroy
 

177
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:12,459
careful not to leak water and destroy
all my redstone wiring and destroy the

178
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:12,469
all my redstone wiring and destroy the
 

179
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:23,070
all my redstone wiring and destroy the
boats which is a bit of a challenge

180
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,080
boats which is a bit of a challenge
 

181
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:31,089
boats which is a bit of a challenge
especially in this tight area so when

182
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:31,099
especially in this tight area so when
 

183
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,040
especially in this tight area so when
I'm placing this water block I have to

184
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,050
I'm placing this water block I have to
 

185
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,839
I'm placing this water block I have to
be very careful not to click this boat

186
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:34,849
be very careful not to click this boat
 

187
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:41,200
be very careful not to click this boat
so I aim for the very corner and I'm

188
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,210
so I aim for the very corner and I'm
 

189
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:47,529
so I aim for the very corner and I'm
gonna place the glass and it's fixed

190
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:47,539
gonna place the glass and it's fixed
 

191
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:51,249
gonna place the glass and it's fixed
that's all I had to do so the way the

192
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:51,259
that's all I had to do so the way the
 

193
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,760
that's all I had to do so the way the
new water works if a boat touches a

194
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:54,770
new water works if a boat touches a
 

195
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,519
new water works if a boat touches a
water source block it will float up very

196
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:57,529
water source block it will float up very
 

197
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:04,600
water source block it will float up very
slowly if it touches like

198
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:04,610
slowly if it touches like
 

199
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,820
slowly if it touches like
a water stream that's flowing downward

200
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:06,830
a water stream that's flowing downward
 

201
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,219
a water stream that's flowing downward
like you see in front of you here the

202
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:09,229
like you see in front of you here the
 

203
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,339
like you see in front of you here the
boat will sink if the boat is in the

204
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:12,349
boat will sink if the boat is in the
 

205
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,420
boat will sink if the boat is in the
water source block and a stream that's

206
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,430
water source block and a stream that's
 

207
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,260
water source block and a stream that's
flowing downward like the boat is here

208
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,270
flowing downward like the boat is here
 

209
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,050
flowing downward like the boat is here
the stream that is flowing downward

210
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,060
the stream that is flowing downward
 

211
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,510
the stream that is flowing downward
overpowers the buoyancy from the water

212
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
overpowers the buoyancy from the water
 

213
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,409
overpowers the buoyancy from the water
source block so even though this block

214
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:29,419
source block so even though this block
 

215
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,300
source block so even though this block
here is pushing it up and this one is

216
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,310
here is pushing it up and this one is
 

217
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,899
here is pushing it up and this one is
pushing it down the block that's pushing

218
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:34,909
pushing it down the block that's pushing
 

219
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,969
pushing it down the block that's pushing
it down is more powerful so it stays

220
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:36,979
it down is more powerful so it stays
 

221
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:44,619
it down is more powerful so it stays
down is what I have found so far so with

222
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:44,629
down is what I have found so far so with
 

223
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:47,610
down is what I have found so far so with
this in mind if I remove the water above

224
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:47,620
this in mind if I remove the water above
 

225
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,619
this in mind if I remove the water above
this water source back here will cause

226
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:50,629
this water source back here will cause
 

227
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,589
this water source back here will cause
the boat to float and go off the

228
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
the boat to float and go off the
 

229
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,200
the boat to float and go off the
pressure plate so it's reversed from

230
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,210
pressure plate so it's reversed from
 

231
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,230
pressure plate so it's reversed from
what it was before which is kind of

232
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,240
what it was before which is kind of
 

233
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,969
what it was before which is kind of
weird

234
00:07:59,969 --> 00:07:59,979
weird
 

235
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,959
weird
I'm going to connect those two again and

236
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:03,969
I'm going to connect those two again and
 

237
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:18,719
I'm going to connect those two again and
let's test it out doors are still closed

238
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:18,729

 

239
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:27,909

there we go takes a little bit longer

240
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
there we go takes a little bit longer
 

241
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,149
there we go takes a little bit longer
for it to activate as well because the

242
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:31,159
for it to activate as well because the
 

243
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:40,860
for it to activate as well because the
boat Rises slower or could deactivate

244
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:40,870

 

245
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,160

uh-huh so before when I had to water

246
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,170
uh-huh so before when I had to water
 

247
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,079
uh-huh so before when I had to water
these two water sources here the door

248
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:50,089
these two water sources here the door
 

249
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,689
these two water sources here the door
was opened but now it's closed so it's

250
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:52,699
was opened but now it's closed so it's
 

251
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,780
was opened but now it's closed so it's
reversed not a big deal

252
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,790
reversed not a big deal
 

253
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,350
reversed not a big deal
and I can fix that by inverting the

254
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
and I can fix that by inverting the
 

255
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,220
and I can fix that by inverting the
redstone signal if I want let's get rid

256
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,230
redstone signal if I want let's get rid
 

257
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,140
redstone signal if I want let's get rid
of that

258
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,150
of that
 

259
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:16,390
of that
please sir trapdoor back there that's

260
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:16,400
please sir trapdoor back there that's
 

261
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,040
please sir trapdoor back there that's
one thing fixed let's see what else

262
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,050
one thing fixed let's see what else
 

263
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:31,780
one thing fixed let's see what else
let's take a stroll many many bugs were

264
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:31,790
let's take a stroll many many bugs were
 

265
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,570
let's take a stroll many many bugs were
fixed in this patch which is good glad

266
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:37,580
fixed in this patch which is good glad
 

267
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,090
fixed in this patch which is good glad
to see that because there's a lot of

268
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,100
to see that because there's a lot of
 

269
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,090
to see that because there's a lot of
annoying bugs in this team unfortunately

270
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,100
annoying bugs in this team unfortunately
 

271
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,280
annoying bugs in this team unfortunately
some of those bugs were actually what I

272
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,290
some of those bugs were actually what I
 

273
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,850
some of those bugs were actually what I
consider features which are now gone oh

274
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:50,860

 

275
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,560

yeah that's what I was going to point

276
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:53,570
yeah that's what I was going to point
 

277
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,860
yeah that's what I was going to point
out I almost think the game is a little

278
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:56,870
out I almost think the game is a little
 

279
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,300
out I almost think the game is a little
bit lay here now I'm not sure though or

280
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,310
bit lay here now I'm not sure though or
 

281
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,180
bit lay here now I'm not sure though or
here is the spider separator I had and

282
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,190
here is the spider separator I had and
 

283
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,310
here is the spider separator I had and
they were being killed by lava using the

284
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
they were being killed by lava using the
 

285
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,580
they were being killed by lava using the
southwest corner glitch that no longer

286
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:15,590
southwest corner glitch that no longer
 

287
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,730
southwest corner glitch that no longer
works so this will still drown the

288
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:21,740
works so this will still drown the
 

289
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,250
works so this will still drown the
spiders what I have here but the lava

290
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,260
spiders what I have here but the lava
 

291
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,530
spiders what I have here but the lava
won't do anything because it won't hurt

292
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:26,540
won't do anything because it won't hurt
 

293
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,480
won't do anything because it won't hurt
them through the way through the corners

294
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,490
them through the way through the corners
 

295
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,550
them through the way through the corners
anymore so that kind of sucks but at the

296
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:33,560
anymore so that kind of sucks but at the
 

297
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,830
anymore so that kind of sucks but at the
moment I don't even have spiders coming

298
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:35,840
moment I don't even have spiders coming
 

299
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,800
moment I don't even have spiders coming
up

300
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:37,810
up
 

301
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:44,970
up
so it's not not a huge issue pretty sure

302
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:44,980
so it's not not a huge issue pretty sure
 

303
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:52,579
so it's not not a huge issue pretty sure
all this stuff works the same although

304
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:52,589
all this stuff works the same although
 

305
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,150
all this stuff works the same although
that wasn't supposed to happen oh you

306
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,160
that wasn't supposed to happen oh you
 

307
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:04,010
that wasn't supposed to happen oh you
know why I'd have this opened

308
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,020

 

309
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,050

I think I'm not sure how that should go

310
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,060
I think I'm not sure how that should go
 

311
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,460
I think I'm not sure how that should go
down there I'll have to watch this video

312
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:10,470
down there I'll have to watch this video
 

313
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,430
down there I'll have to watch this video
again after

314
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:14,440

 

315
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,910

oh yeah let's go down to the mine hurts

316
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
oh yeah let's go down to the mine hurts
 

317
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,590
oh yeah let's go down to the mine hurts
I heard when I heard that the old

318
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
I heard when I heard that the old
 

319
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,509
I heard when I heard that the old
booster glitch with my carts was gonna

320
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
booster glitch with my carts was gonna
 

321
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,710
booster glitch with my carts was gonna
be fixed I really didn't care because I

322
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:31,720
be fixed I really didn't care because I
 

323
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,780
be fixed I really didn't care because I
didn't think it was gonna affect me but

324
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:35,790

 

325
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,179

then I was like oh yeah I'm actually

326

then I was like oh yeah I'm actually
 

327
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:42,449
then I was like oh yeah I'm actually
using that with this thing I completely

328
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:42,459
using that with this thing I completely
 

329
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:43,259
using that with this thing I completely
forgot

330
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:43,269

so uh my whole minecart system is busted

332
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,180
so uh my whole minecart system is busted
 

333
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,910
so uh my whole minecart system is busted
control room is pointless because it was

334
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:50,920
control room is pointless because it was
 

335
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,619
control room is pointless because it was
supposed to control this minecart system

336
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:54,629

 

337
00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:01,079

so yeah I'll probably fix this by using

338
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:01,089
so yeah I'll probably fix this by using
 

339
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,449
so yeah I'll probably fix this by using

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,319
okay it is fixed let's go down to the
east road it seems every patch that's

375
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,950

okay maybe before we go to the ether I

376
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:14,960
okay maybe before we go to the ether I
 

377
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,290
okay maybe before we go to the ether I
should explain something

378
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:17,300
should explain something

is floating how does that work well if I

386
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:39,529
is floating how does that work well if I

push this boat into the water stream

388
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:41,690
push this boat into the water stream
 

389
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,630
push this boat into the water stream
that's flowing down there's only one

390
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:43,640
that's flowing down there's only one
 

391
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,230
that's flowing down there's only one
source block and it's at the top there

392
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
source block and it's at the top there
 

393
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,430
source block and it's at the top there
and there are so this is a downward

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:48,440
and there are so this is a downward
 

395
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,620
and there are so this is a downward
flowing water stream and yet the boat

396
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:53,630
flowing water stream and yet the boat
 

397
00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:07,829
flowing water stream and yet the boat
rises in it very very slowly but it does

398
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839

 

399
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,519

that's the new nerfed water elevators a

400
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:12,529
that's the new nerfed water elevators a
 

401
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:20,980
that's the new nerfed water elevators a
new speed of them very very slow but

402
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:20,990
new speed of them very very slow but
 

403
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,780
new speed of them very very slow but
with our water sensor doesn't work that

404
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:22,790
with our water sensor doesn't work that
 

405
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,410
with our water sensor doesn't work that
way does it

406
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:23,420
way does it
 

407
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,050
way does it
why well if there is air around the

408
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,060
why well if there is air around the
 

409
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,570
why well if there is air around the
water stream blocks it seems to make the

410
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:34,580
water stream blocks it seems to make the
 

411
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,090
water stream blocks it seems to make the
boat rise but I believe I haven't tried

412
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:37,100
boat rise but I believe I haven't tried
 

413
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,930
boat rise but I believe I haven't tried
this yet if there is solid blocks next

414
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:40,940
this yet if there is solid blocks next
 

415
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,590
this yet if there is solid blocks next
to this water screen it won't rise if my

416
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:46,600
to this water screen it won't rise if my
 

417
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,079
to this water screen it won't rise if my
understanding is correct like I said I

418
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:50,089
understanding is correct like I said I
 

419
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:57,760
understanding is correct like I said I
haven't tried this and I am correct so

420
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:57,770
haven't tried this and I am correct so
 

421
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,440
haven't tried this and I am correct so
the boat isn't rising because there is

422
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,450
the boat isn't rising because there is
 

423
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,250
the boat isn't rising because there is
solid blocks next to this water do you

424
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,260
solid blocks next to this water do you
 

425
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,590
solid blocks next to this water do you
remove one still not rising for some

426
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:08,600
remove one still not rising for some
 

427
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,130
remove one still not rising for some
reason

428
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,140

 

429
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:20,550

that's kind of strange still not rising

430
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
that's kind of strange still not rising
 

431
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:28,840
that's kind of strange still not rising
aerial yes that is definitely less Baidu

432
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:28,850
aerial yes that is definitely less Baidu
 

433
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:35,340
aerial yes that is definitely less Baidu
looking knotch good job on this fix I

434
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,350

 

435
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,720

don't know why he wasted his time doing

436
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:37,730
don't know why he wasted his time doing
 

437
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:45,190
don't know why he wasted his time doing
this so yeah that's the new principle

438
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:45,200
this so yeah that's the new principle
 

439
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,250
this so yeah that's the new principle
with the boats maybe before we go down

440
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,260
with the boats maybe before we go down
 

441
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,090
with the boats maybe before we go down
to eats let's test out the new minecarts

442
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,100
to eats let's test out the new minecarts
 

443
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,040
to eats let's test out the new minecarts
too apparently these power rails give

444
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,050
too apparently these power rails give
 

445
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,380
too apparently these power rails give
you a better boost I haven't seen it for

446
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,390
you a better boost I haven't seen it for
 

447
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,110
you a better boost I haven't seen it for
myself yet except through statics video

I watched I think they were a lot faster

450
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,490
I watched I think they were a lot faster
 

451
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,440
I watched I think they were a lot faster
oh yeah that's fast that's fast that's

452
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,450
oh yeah that's fast that's fast that's
 

453
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:18,060
oh yeah that's fast that's fast that's
too fast I can't even catch it

454
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,070

 

455
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:26,620

here comes let's try this again let's

456
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:26,630
here comes let's try this again let's
 

457
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:34,700
here comes let's try this again let's
hop in at this time huh

458
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:34,710
hop in at this time huh
 

459
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,310

I know that looks about the same speed

460
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:37,320
I know that looks about the same speed
 

461
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,140
I know that looks about the same speed
to me maybe the momentum just last

462
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,150
to me maybe the momentum just last
 

463
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:45,940
to me maybe the momentum just last
longer it's probably what it is

464
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:45,950

 

465
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:52,720

okay now let's go down to eats eats is

466
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:52,730
okay now let's go down to eats eats is
 

467

okay now let's go down to eats eats is
very broken by this patch I have been

468
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,490
very broken by this patch I have been
 

469
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,660
very broken by this patch I have been
down here though fixing it little by

470
00:16:59,660 --> 00:16:59,670
down here though fixing it little by
 

471
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,890
down here though fixing it little by
little I've been coming up with ways to

472
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:03,900
little I've been coming up with ways to
 

473
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:17,140
little I've been coming up with ways to
fix it going through lots of boats okay

474
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,150
fix it going through lots of boats okay
 

475
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,070
fix it going through lots of boats okay
first thing the easy loader was broken

476
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,080
first thing the easy loader was broken
 

477
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,010
first thing the easy loader was broken
I'll show you what it was doing this is

478
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,020
I'll show you what it was doing this is
 

479
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,280
I'll show you what it was doing this is
how I had my ez loader normally when you

480
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,290
how I had my ez loader normally when you
 

481
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,920
how I had my ez loader normally when you
place the boat in the center it aligns

482
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,930
place the boat in the center it aligns
 

483
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:39,590
place the boat in the center it aligns
it properly but after the patch it just

484
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
it properly but after the patch it just
 

485
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,930
it properly but after the patch it just
explodes into this wall I almost think

486
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:44,940
explodes into this wall I almost think
 

487
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,210

boats travel faster in water now from

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,220
boats travel faster in water now from
 

489
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,980
boats travel faster in water now from
what I've seen and I think that might be

490
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:48,990
what I've seen and I think that might be
 

491
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,930
what I've seen and I think that might be
why that's happening but I'm not

492
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:50,940
why that's happening but I'm not
 

493
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,140
why that's happening but I'm not
entirely sure why or what has changed

494
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,150
entirely sure why or what has changed
 

495
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,520

thankfully I have come up with a new ez

496
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:58,530
thankfully I have come up with a new ez
 

497
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,590

loader using this new pattern just to

498
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
loader using this new pattern just to
 

499
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,510
loader using this new pattern just to
get our stuff down here

500
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520

 

501
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,880

so I'm glad there's uh other ways of

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:11,890
so I'm glad there's uh other ways of
 

503
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,280
so I'm glad there's uh other ways of
doing it I've heard other people's easy

504
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,290
doing it I've heard other people's easy
 

505
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,110
doing it I've heard other people's easy
loaders are working too so they probably

506
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,120
loaders are working too so they probably
 

507
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,880
loaders are working too so they probably
have them set up slightly different than

508
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:17,890
have them set up slightly different than

source blocks over here and it gets

514
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:29,920
source blocks over here and it gets
 

515
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,360
source blocks over here and it gets
aligned properly which is great and now

516
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,370
aligned properly which is great and now
 

517
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:41,070

elevator is solid source blocks now so

524
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:50,920
elevator is solid source blocks now so
 

525
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,080
elevator is solid source blocks now so
that's why the boat was able to come up

526
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,090

 

527
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,210

it just takes a lot longer now for it to

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:00,220
it just takes a lot longer now for it to
 

529
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,500

533
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,310

yes oh these are all solid water source

it seems to line them properly so they

540
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
it seems to line them properly so they
 

541
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,380
it seems to line them properly so they
get snug like they are supposed to here

542

543
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,040

now the problem is though that eats Road

544
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,050
now the problem is though that eats Road
 

545
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,480

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,100
and if it's hollow underneath you fall
 

557
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,970
and if it's hollow underneath you fall
through the ground so that is garbage

bug to me I had to make one other change

566
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:33,720
bug to me I had to make one other change

here before I had a downward water

568
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:39,480
here before I had a downward water
 

569

I can't put a solid source block here

572
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,370
I can't put a solid source block here
 

573
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,870
I can't put a solid source block here
because the water will pour out and wash

574
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
because the water will pour out and wash

have a sign there to hold the water in

578
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,610
have a sign there to hold the water in
 

579
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:02,890
have a sign there to hold the water in
place and it seems to work just fine

580
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:02,900

 

581
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,080

so yeah

582
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,090

 

583
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,000

now if you try to hop into a boat while

584
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,010
now if you try to hop into a boat while
 

585
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:19,430
now if you try to hop into a boat while
it's already moving it breaks the old

00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
it's already moving it breaks the old

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,530
it's already moving it breaks the old
vitro did that - I'm pretty sure most

588
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:21,540
vitro did that - I'm pretty sure most
 

589
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,200
vitro did that - I'm pretty sure most
the time so yeah this current road

590
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,210
the time so yeah this current road
 

591
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,740
the time so yeah this current road
design does not work I have an idea on

592
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:29,750
design does not work I have an idea on
 

593
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,480
design does not work I have an idea on
how to make a working one but it

594
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:35,490
how to make a working one but it
 

595
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,950
how to make a working one but it
involves more work which sucks

596
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
involves more work which sucks
 

597
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,480
involves more work which sucks
and with the new improvements with the

598
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:41,490
and with the new improvements with the
 

599
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,970
and with the new improvements with the
minecarts you're pretty much better off

600
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:43,980
minecarts you're pretty much better off
 

601
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,200
minecarts you're pretty much better off
just using mine carts from now on in all

602
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,210
just using mine carts from now on in all
 

603
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,800
just using mine carts from now on in all
honesty you were before - really it's

604
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:51,810
honesty you were before - really it's
 

605
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,100
honesty you were before - really it's
just if you want something different in

606
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,110
just if you want something different in
 

607
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,410
just if you want something different in
your world and you then eats road is

608
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,420
your world and you then eats road is
 

609
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,970
your world and you then eats road is
like a choice because it's pretty cool

610
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:58,980
like a choice because it's pretty cool
 

611
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,440
like a choice because it's pretty cool
in my opinion and this is another water

612
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,450
in my opinion and this is another water
 

613
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,980
in my opinion and this is another water
elevator with the water source box at

614
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:06,990
elevator with the water source box at
 

615
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,950
elevator with the water source box at
the top and none throughout so that's

616
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:09,960
the top and none throughout so that's
 

617
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,160
the top and none throughout so that's
why the boats boats are getting stuck

618
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,170
why the boats boats are getting stuck
 

619
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:21,770
why the boats boats are getting stuck
here so that's another major kick in the

620
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:21,780
here so that's another major kick in the
 

621
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,030
here so that's another major kick in the
shins for eats

622
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,040
shins for eats
 

623
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,310
shins for eats
one of the best features of it before

624
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:25,320
one of the best features of it before
 

625
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,280
one of the best features of it before
was you could go up and down pretty much

626
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,290
was you could go up and down pretty much
 

627
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,200
was you could go up and down pretty much
instantly using water elevators and now

628
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,210
instantly using water elevators and now
 

629
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,790
instantly using water elevators and now
that feature has been removed from the

630
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:34,800
that feature has been removed from the
 

631
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:45,680
that feature has been removed from the
game so yeah but if you want to boat

632
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,690
game so yeah but if you want to boat
 

633
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,720
game so yeah but if you want to boat
dispensers still work it's just the road

634
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:47,730
dispensers still work it's just the road
 

635
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,420
dispensers still work it's just the road
itself you can't really ride with this

636
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,430
itself you can't really ride with this
 

637
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:55,100
itself you can't really ride with this
current design so I'm gonna do some more

638
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,110
current design so I'm gonna do some more
 

639
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,890
current design so I'm gonna do some more
experiments with it and I'll hopefully

640
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:57,900
experiments with it and I'll hopefully
 

641
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,580
experiments with it and I'll hopefully
release tutorials like I keep promising

642
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:00,590
release tutorials like I keep promising
 

643
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:07,820
release tutorials like I keep promising
except with the new fixes I think that's

644
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:07,830
except with the new fixes I think that's
 

645
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,190
except with the new fixes I think that's
all I wanted to talk about it for eats I

646
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,200
all I wanted to talk about it for eats I
 

647
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,150
all I wanted to talk about it for eats I
think I've covered the whole world now

648
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,160
think I've covered the whole world now
 

649
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,760
think I've covered the whole world now

779
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,810
maps now not a very useful feature for a
single player in my opinion but that

single player in my opinion but that
 

781
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,970
single player in my opinion but that
would be cool and multiplayer if you

782

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:06,380
so if you look down towards the ground
 

795
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,150
so if you look down towards the ground
you can see the map how it works

796
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,160

 

797
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,380

799
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:22,450
don't know if you can zoom in or
anything and there might be a way of

800
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:22,460
anything and there might be a way of
 

801
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,990
anything and there might be a way of
naming them too but I have no idea how

802
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,000
naming them too but I have no idea how
 

803
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,480
naming them too but I have no idea how
that's cool be cool and multiplayer or

804

809
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,440
I could see maps being useful it's a
very cool from a programming perspective

very cool from a programming perspective
 

811
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:45,160
very cool from a programming perspective
a very cool feature um you've got the

812
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,170
a very cool feature um you've got the
 

813
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,780
a very cool feature um you've got the
trap doors oops

814
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:48,790
trap doors oops
 

815
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,970
trap doors oops
make them like that they can be

816
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:51,980
make them like that they can be
 

817
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,160
make them like that they can be
controlled with redstone as far as I

818
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,170
controlled with redstone as far as I
 

819
00:28:54,170 --> 00:29:01,150
controlled with redstone as far as I
know this is my absolute favorite part

820
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,160
know this is my absolute favorite part
 

821
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,060
know this is my absolute favorite part
of this patch these trap doors I've

822
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,070
of this patch these trap doors I've
 

823
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,740
of this patch these trap doors I've
wanted something like this for a long

824
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:05,750
wanted something like this for a long
 

825
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,230
wanted something like this for a long
time

826
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,240
time
 

827
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,440
time
it's basically my minecart skate

828
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:10,450
it's basically my minecart skate
 

829
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,590
it's basically my minecart skate
compressed into a single block except

830
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:14,600
compressed into a single block except
 

831
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:23,720
compressed into a single block except
even better

832
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:23,730

 

833
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,990

yep

834
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,000
yep
 

835
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,730
yep
and controllable by redstone well that's

836
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:29,740
and controllable by redstone well that's
 

837
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,249
and controllable by redstone well that's
strange then to go back down there when

838
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:32,259
strange then to go back down there when
 

839
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:42,419
strange then to go back down there when
I remove the torch huh wasn't expecting

840
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:42,429
I remove the torch huh wasn't expecting
 

841
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,820
I remove the torch huh wasn't expecting
that

842
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:46,830

 

843
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:53,490

leader and I don't have any buttons on

844
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:53,500
leader and I don't have any buttons on
 

845
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:12,630
leader and I don't have any buttons on
me otherwise I would try that

846
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:12,640

 

847
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,909

yeah that makes it closed a little bit

848
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:18,919
yeah that makes it closed a little bit
 

849
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,820
yeah that makes it closed a little bit
strange okay what I like most about

850
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:21,830
strange okay what I like most about
 

851
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:28,539
strange okay what I like most about
these doors as they open upward I was

852
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:28,549
these doors as they open upward I was
 

853
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:29,860
these doors as they open upward I was
sure they were gonna make him open

854
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:29,870
sure they were gonna make him open
 

855
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,930
sure they were gonna make him open
downward and if they did that they would

856
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:31,940
downward and if they did that they would
 

857
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,990
downward and if they did that they would
be a lot less useful in my opinion and

858
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,000
be a lot less useful in my opinion and
 

859
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,630
be a lot less useful in my opinion and
here's why so if they opened upward the

860
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:43,640
here's why so if they opened upward the
 

861
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,560
here's why so if they opened upward the
hinge doesn't get in the way because now

862
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:50,570
hinge doesn't get in the way because now
 

863
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,590
hinge doesn't get in the way because now
when I opened this the door will be

864
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
when I opened this the door will be
 

865
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,299
when I opened this the door will be
inside of me

866
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:55,309
inside of me
 

867
00:30:55,309 --> 00:31:00,159
inside of me
so I'll fall straight through it that

868
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,169
so I'll fall straight through it that
 

869
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:07,320
so I'll fall straight through it that
means you can drop a one by one block

870
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,330
means you can drop a one by one block
 

871
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,690
means you can drop a one by one block
like and drop a tower that or any other

872
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:10,700
like and drop a tower that or any other
 

873
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,370
like and drop a tower that or any other
mob will fall through this hatch thing

874
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:14,380
mob will fall through this hatch thing
 

875
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,600
mob will fall through this hatch thing
very cool very useful for mob systems

876
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:18,610
very cool very useful for mob systems
 

877
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,990
very cool very useful for mob systems
among other things I see lots of

878
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,000
among other things I see lots of
 

879
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,360
among other things I see lots of
possible uses for this new door doors

880
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,370
possible uses for this new door doors
 

881
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,130
possible uses for this new door doors
are one of my favorite things in the

882
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,140
are one of my favorite things in the
 

883
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,169
are one of my favorite things in the
scheme so to have another type is very

884
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:32,179
scheme so to have another type is very
 

885
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:39,789
scheme so to have another type is very
cool I'm gonna set one other thing up

886
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:39,799
cool I'm gonna set one other thing up
 

887
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:45,789
cool I'm gonna set one other thing up
here another cool use of them alright

888
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:45,799
here another cool use of them alright
 

889
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,380
here another cool use of them alright
here's another cool thing about these

890
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,390
here's another cool thing about these
 

891
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:52,090
here's another cool thing about these
new hatches or trap doors you can use

892
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,100
new hatches or trap doors you can use
 

893
00:31:52,100 --> 00:32:01,280
new hatches or trap doors you can use
them as item drop junctions or gates

894
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,290

 

895
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,500

right now they're collecting there if I

896
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:03,510
right now they're collecting there if I
 

897
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,790
right now they're collecting there if I
was to open this they would fall down

898
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:06,800
was to open this they would fall down
 

899
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,290
was to open this they would fall down
again that's pretty much what I was

900
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:09,300
again that's pretty much what I was
 

901
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,570
again that's pretty much what I was
doing with my minecart gates except this

902
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:11,580
doing with my minecart gates except this
 

903
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,730
doing with my minecart gates except this
is much better and so if I wanted it to

904
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:16,740
is much better and so if I wanted it to
 

905
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,070
is much better and so if I wanted it to
fall down this one instead had it opened

906
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,080
fall down this one instead had it opened
 

907
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,360
fall down this one instead had it opened
and they fall down there instead of

908
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,370
and they fall down there instead of
 

909
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,600
and they fall down there instead of
going to this one so that's really cool

910
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:28,610
going to this one so that's really cool
 

911
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,540
going to this one so that's really cool
if they're on top they fall down even if

912
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:32,550
if they're on top they fall down even if
 

913
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,320
if they're on top they fall down even if
they're above the hinge that's great

914
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,330
they're above the hinge that's great
 

915
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,450
they're above the hinge that's great
mobs will fall down I'm pretty sure if

916
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:38,460
mobs will fall down I'm pretty sure if
 

917
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,350
mobs will fall down I'm pretty sure if
you have a minecart on they'll fall down

918
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
you have a minecart on they'll fall down
 

919
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,300
you have a minecart on they'll fall down
boats they'll fall through players

920
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,310

 

921
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:53,420

probably TNT I would like to try sand

922
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:53,430
probably TNT I would like to try sand
 

923
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,330
probably TNT I would like to try sand
actually I don't think the sand will

924
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:56,340
actually I don't think the sand will
 

925
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:23,039
actually I don't think the sand will
fall through yeah it just floats on top

926
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,049

 

927
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:25,570

929
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,360
yeah I like these things though they're
