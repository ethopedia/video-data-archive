like having a wooden pillar that went
all the way to the ceiling and in the

50
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
all the way to the ceiling and in the
 

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,990
all the way to the ceiling and in the
center there was going to be redstone

52
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,000
center there was going to be redstone
 

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,280

wiring that would connect to a rapid for

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,290
wiring that would connect to a rapid for
 

55
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,670
wiring that would connect to a rapid for
dispenser and I would have a buttons and

56
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
dispenser and I would have a buttons and
 

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,190
dispenser and I would have a buttons and
levers and stuff and it would shoot out

58
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
levers and stuff and it would shoot out
 

59
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,090
levers and stuff and it would shoot out
two cobblestone or whatever but I've

60
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,100
two cobblestone or whatever but I've
 

61
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,200
two cobblestone or whatever but I've
decided not to do that because I would

62
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,210
decided not to do that because I would
 

63
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,540
decided not to do that because I would
need to have four of them one for each

64
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:20,550
need to have four of them one for each
 

65
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,290
need to have four of them one for each
corner and since my world is leggy

66
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,300
corner and since my world is leggy
 

67
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,200
corner and since my world is leggy
enough as it is adding four more

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,210
enough as it is adding four more
 

69
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,770
enough as it is adding four more

redstone clocks would have made things
 

71
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,830
redstone clocks would have made things
much worse because every redstone clock

72
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
much worse because every redstone clock
 

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,190
much worse because every redstone clock

things I can automatically sort string

326
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:46,990
things I can automatically sort string
 

327

340
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,310
got it pretty much figured out in my
 

341
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,290
got it pretty much figured out in my
head I just need to actually do it

342
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,300
head I just need to actually do it
 

343
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,949

sometime just too hard I hope it's a bit

344
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:19,959
sometime just too hard I hope it's a bit
 

345
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,140
sometime just too hard I hope it's a bit
challenging to make the man carts go all

346
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,150
challenging to make the man carts go all
 

347
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,140
challenging to make the man carts go all
the way around cause that is a long

348
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,150
the way around cause that is a long
 

349
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:41,190
the way around cause that is a long
distance so something that's a little

350
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
distance so something that's a little
 

351
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,860
distance so something that's a little
bit of an issue yet is the lighting I've

352
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:46,870
bit of an issue yet is the lighting I've
 

353
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,019
bit of an issue yet is the lighting I've
had expected this from the beginning

354
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,029
had expected this from the beginning
 

355
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,519
had expected this from the beginning
that the lighting was going to be a

356
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:50,529
that the lighting was going to be a
 

357
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,320
that the lighting was going to be a
problem

358
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,330
problem
 

359
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:59,730
problem
um not exactly sure how I want to do it

360
00:12:59,730 --> 00:12:59,740

 

361
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,900

originally I'm just going to do

362
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:01,910
originally I'm just going to do
 

363
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,020
originally I'm just going to do
something like this these torches kind

364
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,030
something like this these torches kind
 

365
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,530
something like this these torches kind
of dropped from the ceiling looks kind

366
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:11,540
of dropped from the ceiling looks kind
 

367
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,690
of dropped from the ceiling looks kind
of cool but there's way too many of them

368
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:13,700
of cool but there's way too many of them
 

369
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,490
of cool but there's way too many of them
so I'm not sure if I'm going to do it

370
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:18,500
so I'm not sure if I'm going to do it
 

371
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,180
so I'm not sure if I'm going to do it
like this even think you may be taking

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,540

somewhere around here I'm going to have

486
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:23,550
somewhere around here I'm going to have
 

487
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,140
somewhere around here I'm going to have
a tactus farm and a reed farm and maybe

488
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,150
a tactus farm and a reed farm and maybe
 

489
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,330
a tactus farm and a reed farm and maybe
a wheat farm with the delivery system

490
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,340
a wheat farm with the delivery system
 

491
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:39,590
a wheat farm with the delivery system
set up ah

492
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600

 

493
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:52,920

let's see last ayah out here I'm going

494
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:52,930
let's see last ayah out here I'm going
 

495
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,740
let's see last ayah out here I'm going
to set up an each row to this island I

496
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:55,750
to set up an each row to this island I
 

497
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,140
to set up an each row to this island I
think I'm going to change this thing

498
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,150
think I'm going to change this thing
 

499
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:05,420
think I'm going to change this thing
around because it's not really working

500
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,430

 

501
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,090

because normally I make them eat wide I

502
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,100
because normally I make them eat wide I
 

503
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,210
because normally I make them eat wide I
wanted to try make one seven wide it's

504
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:12,220
wanted to try make one seven wide it's
 

505
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:18,330
wanted to try make one seven wide it's
too many issues so and I plan on doing a

506
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,340
too many issues so and I plan on doing a
 

507
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,320
too many issues so and I plan on doing a
lot of terraforming around here too

508
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,330
lot of terraforming around here too
 

509
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,160
lot of terraforming around here too
it's not going to be this ugly

510
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,170

 

511
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,140

looking landscape and I will be doing

512
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,150
looking landscape and I will be doing
 

513
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,880
looking landscape and I will be doing
the exterior of the building but I'm

514
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:30,890
the exterior of the building but I'm
 

515
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,700
the exterior of the building but I'm
going to wait till I get more stuff do

516
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:33,710
going to wait till I get more stuff do
 

517
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,640
going to wait till I get more stuff do
it first

518
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:38,650

 

519
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,500

and I'll be doing a little bit around

520
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,510
and I'll be doing a little bit around
 

521
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:50,610
and I'll be doing a little bit around
these pipes here and not quite sure

522
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:50,620
these pipes here and not quite sure
 

523
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,130
these pipes here and not quite sure
where I'm going to in the front but I'll

524
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,140
where I'm going to in the front but I'll
 

525
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,340
where I'm going to in the front but I'll
figure something out you know originally

526
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,350
figure something out you know originally
 

527
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,049
figure something out you know originally
I picked this world because I liked the

528
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:01,059
I picked this world because I liked the
 

529
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,790
I picked this world because I liked the
look of the grass and how I killed all

530
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:02,800
look of the grass and how I killed all
 

531
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,910
look of the grass and how I killed all
the grass which is kind of sad but I've

532
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:05,920
the grass which is kind of sad but I've
 

533
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,740
the grass which is kind of sad but I've
been thinking of maybe using this green

534
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:10,750
been thinking of maybe using this green
 

535
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,400
been thinking of maybe using this green
as fake grass I don't know

536
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,410
as fake grass I don't know
 

537
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,640
as fake grass I don't know
Green is my favorite color pretty close

538
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:20,650
Green is my favorite color pretty close
 

539
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,510
Green is my favorite color pretty close
to that color

540
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:22,520
to that color
 

541
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,740
to that color
I once I set up a cactus farm I might

542
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:25,750
I once I set up a cactus farm I might
 

543
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:32,070
I once I set up a cactus farm I might
start laying fake grass everywhere and

544
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
start laying fake grass everywhere and
 

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,840
start laying fake grass everywhere and
someone else what else at some point of

546
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:37,850
someone else what else at some point of
 

547
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,600
someone else what else at some point of
time I think we need to build like an

548
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:40,610
time I think we need to build like an
 

549
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,970
time I think we need to build like an
underwater base somewhere because

550
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:42,980
underwater base somewhere because
 

551
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,940
underwater base somewhere because
there's just so much ocean in this world

552
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:46,950
there's just so much ocean in this world
 

553
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,890
there's just so much ocean in this world
and it's deep in a lot of places

554
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:51,900

 

555
00:19:51,900 --> 00:20:08,870

so it'd be a crime not to and yeah my

556
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
so it'd be a crime not to and yeah my
 

557
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,530
so it'd be a crime not to and yeah my
TNT supply is up to this plus I have

558
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:12,540
TNT supply is up to this plus I have
 

559
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,670
TNT supply is up to this plus I have
another stack of 64 still haven't

560
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:16,680
another stack of 64 still haven't
 

561
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,650
another stack of 64 still haven't
started the cannons but I will get to

562
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:18,660
started the cannons but I will get to
 

563
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,020
started the cannons but I will get to
that very soon

564
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,030
that very soon
 

565
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:29,200
that very soon
still got 300 subscribers to go I think

566
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,210

 

567
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,240

well anyways guys I think that's about

568
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,250

I know we've just been walking around in

574
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:41,850
I know we've just been walking around in
 

575
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,140
I know we've just been walking around in
storage room but like I said I'm not

576
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,150
storage room but like I said I'm not
 

577
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,590
storage room but like I said I'm not
feeling well today and not feeling very

578
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
feeling well today and not feeling very
 

579
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,919
feeling well today and not feeling very
ambitious so and I put a lot of work

580
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:51,929
ambitious so and I put a lot of work
 

581
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,419
ambitious so and I put a lot of work
into the storage room and I didn't want

582
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:53,429
into the storage room and I didn't want
 

583
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,770
into the storage room and I didn't want
to get too far ahead I thought you guys

584
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:54,780
to get too far ahead I thought you guys
 

585
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,630
to get too far ahead I thought you guys
seen it

586
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:55,640
seen it
 

587
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,060
seen it
and as well I think it's important that

588
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,070
and as well I think it's important that
 

589
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,160
and as well I think it's important that
you guys know a little bit about the

590
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,170
you guys know a little bit about the
 

591
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,130
you guys know a little bit about the
plans of what's going on and why I made

592
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,140
plans of what's going on and why I made
 

593
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,210
plans of what's going on and why I made
the decisions I did in this world like a

594
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:10,220
the decisions I did in this world like a
 

595
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,830
the decisions I did in this world like a
lot of planning and organizing did go

596
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:12,840
lot of planning and organizing did go
 

597
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,930
lot of planning and organizing did go
into this storage room that you guys

598
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:14,940
into this storage room that you guys
 

599
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,270
into this storage room that you guys
might not have really thought about or

600
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
might not have really thought about or
 

601
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,840
might not have really thought about or
realized unless I pointed it out to you

602
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:19,850
realized unless I pointed it out to you
 

603
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,810
realized unless I pointed it out to you
like even when I originally decided on

604
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:23,820
like even when I originally decided on
 

605
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,570
like even when I originally decided on
the size of it and everything I first

606
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:26,580
the size of it and everything I first
 

607
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,250
the size of it and everything I first
figured out how many different types of

608
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,260
figured out how many different types of
 

609
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,890
figured out how many different types of
blocks there were and that's kind of how

610
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:30,900
blocks there were and that's kind of how
 

611
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,270
blocks there were and that's kind of how
I got the size of the storage room

612
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,280
I got the size of the storage room
 

613
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,400
I got the size of the storage room
that's why it's so big there's so many

614
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,410
that's why it's so big there's so many
 

615
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,850
that's why it's so big there's so many
different blocks and you know there's

616
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:37,860
different blocks and you know there's
 

617
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,340
different blocks and you know there's
lots of settled details that you might

618
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,350
lots of settled details that you might
 

619
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,340
lots of settled details that you might
not think about like these three

620
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,350
not think about like these three
 

621
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,520
not think about like these three
redstone items are organized together

622
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,530
redstone items are organized together
 

623
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,200
redstone items are organized together
they're not like one here one here one

624
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,210
they're not like one here one here one
 

625
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,770
they're not like one here one here one
here so little nice details like that

626
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:53,780
here so little nice details like that
 

627
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,830
here so little nice details like that
all around the storage room a lot of

628
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
all around the storage room a lot of
 

629
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,170
all around the storage room a lot of
work went into this

630
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,180
work went into this
 

631
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,560
work went into this
and other things too like just so

632
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,570
and other things too like just so
 

633
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,470
and other things too like just so
happens 12 items fit here pretty nicely

634
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:07,480
happens 12 items fit here pretty nicely
 

635
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,050
happens 12 items fit here pretty nicely
that don't really go into any other

636
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,060
that don't really go into any other
 

637
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,660
that don't really go into any other
categories or

638
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:12,670
categories or
 

639
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,270
categories or
and on the other side there also is

640
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
and on the other side there also is
 

641
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,330
and on the other side there also is
another 12 items I figured that out

642
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:18,340
another 12 items I figured that out
 

643
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,530
another 12 items I figured that out
added them up all technically it's 10

644
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:22,540
added them up all technically it's 10
 

645
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,810
added them up all technically it's 10
