booth like a telephone booth like they

152
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
booth like a telephone booth like they
 

153
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,450
booth like a telephone booth like they
had in Futurama but yeah this works too

154

had in Futurama but yeah this works too
 

155
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,690
had in Futurama but yeah this works too
so the idea is before you go in it you

156
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:00,700
so the idea is before you go in it you
 

157
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,520
so the idea is before you go in it you
place your items in the chest like that

158
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,530
place your items in the chest like that
 

159
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,629
place your items in the chest like that
so that they'll be waiting for you when

160
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:09,639
so that they'll be waiting for you when
 

161
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,320

323
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:51,160
and that takes me to my fake nether this
is man-made as a trick and just because

324
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,170
is man-made as a trick and just because
 

325
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,030
is man-made as a trick and just because
it's cool and then we walk through this

326
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,040
it's cool and then we walk through this
 

327
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,269
it's cool and then we walk through this
portal and we're down here I need to set

328
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
portal and we're down here I need to set
 

329
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,829
portal and we're down here I need to set
up some easy way to call my cart here

330
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
up some easy way to call my cart here
 

331
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,200
up some easy way to call my cart here
from the tornado because right now it's

332
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,210
from the tornado because right now it's
 

333
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,730
from the tornado because right now it's
the only way to get it down is to step

334
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:09,740
the only way to get it down is to step
 

335
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,130
the only way to get it down is to step
on this pressure plate and then wait for

336
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,140
on this pressure plate and then wait for
 

337
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:23,730
on this pressure plate and then wait for
it gotta move these out of here sometime

338
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:23,740
it gotta move these out of here sometime
 

339
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:36,960
it gotta move these out of here sometime
there it is go up the tornado woohoo

340
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:36,970

 

341
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:48,220

and we're back at our alpha base so that

342
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,230
and we're back at our alpha base so that
 

343
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,320
and we're back at our alpha base so that
works pretty good for getting getting

344
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,330
works pretty good for getting getting
 

345
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,390
works pretty good for getting getting
around I like it a lot

346
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,400
around I like it a lot
 

347
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,650
around I like it a lot
I was thinking of laying down a huge

348
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:56,660
I was thinking of laying down a huge
 

349
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,910
I was thinking of laying down a huge
minecart track but this seems like a

350
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:00,920
minecart track but this seems like a
 

351
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,090
minecart track but this seems like a
good way of doing it for now anyway I

352
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,100

 

353
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,410

know what the problem is I have my

354
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:08,420
know what the problem is I have my
 

355
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,050
know what the problem is I have my
junctions which I'm going to the top of

356
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,060
junctions which I'm going to the top of
 

357
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,230
junctions which I'm going to the top of
my roof instead of dying and I think

358
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
my roof instead of dying and I think
 

359
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,120
my roof instead of dying and I think
that's where that ended up

360
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,130

 

361
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,460

anyway so then we can come down here get

362
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:21,470
anyway so then we can come down here get
 

363
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,530
anyway so then we can come down here get
our items again and we're good to go

364
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:23,540
our items again and we're good to go
 

365
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,930
our items again and we're good to go
at our alpha base or if we want to go

366
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:25,940
at our alpha base or if we want to go
 

367
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:33,730
at our alpha base or if we want to go
back to her ice base we just get very

368
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:33,740
back to her ice base we just get very
 

369
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,450
back to her ice base we just get very
slow

370
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:38,460

 

371
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:54,960

yeah and here we go and we're back so I

372
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:54,970
yeah and here we go and we're back so I
 

373
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,880
yeah and here we go and we're back so I
was playing around with glowstone you

374
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:56,890
was playing around with glowstone you
 

375
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,360
was playing around with glowstone you
guys had glowstone melted ice a few

376
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,370
guys had glowstone melted ice a few
 

377
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,760
guys had glowstone melted ice a few
people said it doesn't so I figured I

378
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:02,770
people said it doesn't so I figured I
 

379
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,480
people said it doesn't so I figured I
better try it myself just to be sure and

380
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,490
better try it myself just to be sure and
 

381
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,190
better try it myself just to be sure and
you can see with it one block off the

382
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,200
you can see with it one block off the
 

383
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,530
you can see with it one block off the
ice it melts one two three squares away

384
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:10,540
ice it melts one two three squares away
 

385
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,130
ice it melts one two three squares away
from it

386
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,140
from it
 

387
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,870
from it
so that kind of sucks redstone torches

388
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:15,880
so that kind of sucks redstone torches
 

389
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:24,570
so that kind of sucks redstone torches
don't seem to and

390
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,580

 

391
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,910

I think last episode I mentioned I was

392
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:26,920
I think last episode I mentioned I was
 

393
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,400
I think last episode I mentioned I was
going to get rid all the grass on this

394
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,410
going to get rid all the grass on this
 

395
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,050
going to get rid all the grass on this
island and I seems to be you guys want

396
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,060
island and I seems to be you guys want
 

397
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,280
island and I seems to be you guys want
me to blow up the island is what the

398
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,290
me to blow up the island is what the
 

399
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:45,509
me to blow up the island is what the
common common desire seems to be so I'll

400
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
common common desire seems to be so I'll
 

401
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,009
common common desire seems to be so I'll
leave it up to you guys just to be sure

402
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:47,019
leave it up to you guys just to be sure
 

403
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,069
leave it up to you guys just to be sure
I don't mind blowing it up that sounds

404
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
I don't mind blowing it up that sounds
 

405
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,710
I don't mind blowing it up that sounds
like a fun project I don't have enough

406
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
like a fun project I don't have enough
 

407
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,360
like a fun project I don't have enough
TNT to do it now but I think I I think

408
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,370
TNT to do it now but I think I I think
 

409
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,440
TNT to do it now but I think I I think
it is doable

410
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:58,450
it is doable
 

411
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,410
it is doable
I would only blow it up to that barrier

412
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:01,420
I would only blow it up to that barrier
 

413
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,610
I would only blow it up to that barrier
there and I've gotten pretty good at

414
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:05,620
there and I've gotten pretty good at
 

415
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,579
there and I've gotten pretty good at
placing the charges so it blows

416
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:08,589
placing the charges so it blows
 

417
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,519
placing the charges so it blows
everything up without making a huge mess

418
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:10,529
everything up without making a huge mess
 

419
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:15,420
everything up without making a huge mess
so it's definitely doable if I do blow

420
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,430
so it's definitely doable if I do blow
 

421
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,980
so it's definitely doable if I do blow
up this island I'm gonna do it all at

422
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:16,990
up this island I'm gonna do it all at
 

423
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,840
up this island I'm gonna do it all at
once and record it because I think

424
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:18,850
once and record it because I think
 

425
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,300
once and record it because I think
that's that's the way you would have to

426
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,310
that's that's the way you would have to
 

427
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,800
that's that's the way you would have to
do it and there'd probably be a few

428
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:25,810
do it and there'd probably be a few
 

429
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,509
do it and there'd probably be a few
hundred TNT involved and it would be

430
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
hundred TNT involved and it would be
 

431
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:37,139
hundred TNT involved and it would be
pretty cool well guys it seems I'm gonna

432
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:37,149
pretty cool well guys it seems I'm gonna
 

433
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,340
pretty cool well guys it seems I'm gonna
have to redo all this at the end which

434
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,350
have to redo all this at the end which
 

435
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,389
have to redo all this at the end which
is okay I don't mind redoing it I'd

436
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:45,399
is okay I don't mind redoing it I'd
 

437
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,230
is okay I don't mind redoing it I'd
rather get it right there's a few

438
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,240
rather get it right there's a few
 

439
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,250
rather get it right there's a few
reasons why I need to redo it mainly

440
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:52,260
reasons why I need to redo it mainly
 

441
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,360
reasons why I need to redo it mainly
I've redesigned the EMP units so if you

442
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,370
I've redesigned the EMP units so if you
 

443
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,670
I've redesigned the EMP units so if you
saw my EMP tutorial that's what I'm

444
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
saw my EMP tutorial that's what I'm
 

445
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,150
saw my EMP tutorial that's what I'm
planning on doing that design instead of

446
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
planning on doing that design instead of
 

447
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,660
planning on doing that design instead of
what I have here I realized I'm gonna

448
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:06,670
what I have here I realized I'm gonna
 

449
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,850
what I have here I realized I'm gonna
have to get rid of a lot of this ice

450
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:08,860
have to get rid of a lot of this ice
 

451
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,910
have to get rid of a lot of this ice
here or possibly all of it since

452
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
here or possibly all of it since
 

453
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,720
here or possibly all of it since
glowstone melts ice I need some form of

454
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:15,730
glowstone melts ice I need some form of
 

455
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,620
glowstone melts ice I need some form of
lighting so I can't have this all ice

456
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:18,630
lighting so I can't have this all ice
 

457
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,250
lighting so I can't have this all ice
because it's gonna melt and the other

458
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,260
because it's gonna melt and the other
 

459
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,550
because it's gonna melt and the other
reason is you guys have said that you

460
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
reason is you guys have said that you
 

461
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,620
reason is you guys have said that you
don't really like the sandstone because

462
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:28,630
don't really like the sandstone because
 

463
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:35,470
don't really like the sandstone because
it clashes with the ice color and

464
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:35,480

 

465
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,049

not the size color but this is a snowy

466
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:38,059
not the size color but this is a snowy
 

467
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,900
not the size color but this is a snowy
biome and it doesn't really match and

468
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:40,910
biome and it doesn't really match and
 

469
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,780
biome and it doesn't really match and
that makes sense to me because I believe

470
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:43,790
that makes sense to me because I believe
 

471
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,799
that makes sense to me because I believe
this yellow here is the negative color

472
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:47,809
this yellow here is the negative color
 

473
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:53,109
this yellow here is the negative color
of this blue so on the light spectrum or

474
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:53,119
of this blue so on the light spectrum or
 

475
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,939
of this blue so on the light spectrum or
whatever I think these two are opposites

476
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:54,949
whatever I think these two are opposites
 

477
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,849
whatever I think these two are opposites
so that probably explains why it clashes

478
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:57,859
so that probably explains why it clashes
 

479
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:03,039
so that probably explains why it clashes
and also this is a snowy biome and when

480
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,049
and also this is a snowy biome and when
 

481
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:04,329
and also this is a snowy biome and when
you're in snowy biomes you don't really

482
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:04,339
you're in snowy biomes you don't really
 

483
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,750
you're in snowy biomes you don't really
think of sand or sandstone that's kind

484
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
think of sand or sandstone that's kind
 

485
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,840
think of sand or sandstone that's kind
of kind of like a warm tropical area

486
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:10,850
of kind of like a warm tropical area
 

487
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,129
of kind of like a warm tropical area
type thing so yeah I'll probably not use

488
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:15,139
type thing so yeah I'll probably not use
 

489
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:17,799
type thing so yeah I'll probably not use
sandstone I think my material of choice

490
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:17,809
sandstone I think my material of choice
 

491
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:23,710
sandstone I think my material of choice
is going to actually be snow snow blocks

492
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:23,720
is going to actually be snow snow blocks
 

493
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,329
is going to actually be snow snow blocks
look pretty cool they're bright like

494
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:25,339
look pretty cool they're bright like
 

495
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,850
look pretty cool they're bright like
sandstone so I think they're a good

496
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:27,860
sandstone so I think they're a good
 

497
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,549
sandstone so I think they're a good
substitute and they're fairly easy to

498
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
substitute and they're fairly easy to
 

499
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,230
substitute and they're fairly easy to
collect they're just a little bit of a

500
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
collect they're just a little bit of a
 

501
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,870
collect they're just a little bit of a
pain to deal with because they turn into

502
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
pain to deal with because they turn into
 

503
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,230
pain to deal with because they turn into
snowballs when you destroy them but yeah

504
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,240
snowballs when you destroy them but yeah
 

505
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,700
snowballs when you destroy them but yeah
I think that's what I'm gonna do so I'm

506
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:42,710
I think that's what I'm gonna do so I'm
 

507
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,250
I think that's what I'm gonna do so I'm
gonna work on switching this over to the

508
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,260
gonna work on switching this over to the
 

509
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,340
gonna work on switching this over to the
new style of EMP units and also the new

510
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,350
new style of EMP units and also the new
 

511
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,289
new style of EMP units and also the new
style of blocks and went ahead and

512
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:53,299
style of blocks and went ahead and
 

513
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:57,100
style of blocks and went ahead and
ripped out the first EMP unit here and

514
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,110
ripped out the first EMP unit here and
 

515
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,519
ripped out the first EMP unit here and
I'm gonna try build the new model out of

516
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:00,529
I'm gonna try build the new model out of
 

517
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,649
I'm gonna try build the new model out of
snow or see how it looks

518
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:04,659

 

519
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:09,510

oops

520
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520

 

521
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,740

it'll be careful not to misplace blocks

522
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:12,750
it'll be careful not to misplace blocks
 

523
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,090
it'll be careful not to misplace blocks
not that it's a huge deal it's this

524
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,100
not that it's a huge deal it's this
 

525
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:23,330
not that it's a huge deal it's this
inconvenient yeah do like that and

526
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:23,340
inconvenient yeah do like that and
 

527
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,430
inconvenient yeah do like that and
leavers glass blocks actually I'll

528
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
leavers glass blocks actually I'll
 

529
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,610
leavers glass blocks actually I'll
probably put fences on naval track glass

530
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:32,620
probably put fences on naval track glass
 

531
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:42,240
probably put fences on naval track glass
first and then we'll do barrier still

532
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,250
first and then we'll do barrier still
 

533
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,890
first and then we'll do barrier still
have the tutorial fresh in mind because

534
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:43,900
have the tutorial fresh in mind because
 

535
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:51,090
have the tutorial fresh in mind because
I recorded that today like this

536
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,100
I recorded that today like this
 

537
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,080
I recorded that today like this
I would like to use ice box and set

538
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,090
I would like to use ice box and set
 

539
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:01,610
I would like to use ice box and set
glass but they will melt so I chant and

540
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:01,620

 

541
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:10,890

gonna have snow up here something like

542
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:10,900
gonna have snow up here something like
 

543
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:24,129
gonna have snow up here something like
this but wall here

544
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:24,139

 

545
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:28,669

it looks pretty cool I think I will have

546
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:28,679
it looks pretty cool I think I will have
 

547
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,810
it looks pretty cool I think I will have
to get rid of this ice here this will be

548
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:32,820
to get rid of this ice here this will be
 

549
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,110
to get rid of this ice here this will be
snow actually I figured out if I'm using

550
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
snow actually I figured out if I'm using
 

551
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,490
snow actually I figured out if I'm using
glowstone in the plus sign method I also

552
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:43,500
glowstone in the plus sign method I also
 

553
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,649
glowstone in the plus sign method I also
have to get rid of three more blocks

554
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:45,659
have to get rid of three more blocks
 

555
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:52,669
have to get rid of three more blocks
here something like that so leave quite

556
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:52,679
here something like that so leave quite
 

557
00:19:52,679 --> 00:20:00,409
here something like that so leave quite
a bit of snow it looks pretty good and I

558
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:00,419
a bit of snow it looks pretty good and I
 

559
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,450
a bit of snow it looks pretty good and I
instead of ice here I might use that

560
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:02,460
instead of ice here I might use that
 

561
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,190
instead of ice here I might use that
light blue wool

562
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,200
light blue wool
 

563
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,529
light blue wool
I think that'll look pretty good in my

564
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:06,539
I think that'll look pretty good in my
 

565
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,789
I think that'll look pretty good in my
snowy biome and I may also put snow up

566
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
snowy biome and I may also put snow up
 

567
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:18,259
snowy biome and I may also put snow up
along like this yeah I think that's what

568
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:18,269
along like this yeah I think that's what
 

569
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,299
along like this yeah I think that's what
I'm gonna do let me know what you guys

I probably won't be doing half slabs

584
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:52,409
I probably won't be doing half slabs
 

585
00:20:52,409 --> 00:21:01,009
