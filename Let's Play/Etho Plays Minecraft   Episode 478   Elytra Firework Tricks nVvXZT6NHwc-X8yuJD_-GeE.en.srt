why did i do that okay let's uh let's do
 

47
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,349
why did i do that okay let's uh let's do
a couple experiments here i want to see

48
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
a couple experiments here i want to see
 

49
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:03,990
a couple experiments here i want to see
if there's

50
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
if there's
 

51
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,590
if there's
different ways of taking off from the

52
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
different ways of taking off from the
 

53
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,350
different ways of taking off from the
water because that's a bit of an issue

54
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
water because that's a bit of an issue
 

55
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,270
water because that's a bit of an issue
if you're in the middle of the ocean

56
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
if you're in the middle of the ocean
 

57
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,510
if you're in the middle of the ocean
you might have trouble flying out of it

58
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
you might have trouble flying out of it
 

59
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,469
you might have trouble flying out of it
um so i know if you fly into the water

of swimming animation
 

67
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,550
of swimming animation

i've tried it before spamming space bar

88
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
i've tried it before spamming space bar
 

89
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,630
i've tried it before spamming space bar
and right click right now

90
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
and right click right now
 

91
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,990
and right click right now
is really how did i do that

92
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
is really how did i do that
 

93
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,630
is really how did i do that
oh man it is possible okay it's really

94
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
oh man it is possible okay it's really
 

95
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,109
oh man it is possible okay it's really
tough to do though

96
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
tough to do though
 

97
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,389
tough to do though
really tough to do you gotta get the

98
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
really tough to do you gotta get the
 

99
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,429
really tough to do you gotta get the
timing just perfect and then if you

100
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
timing just perfect and then if you
 

101
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,950
timing just perfect and then if you
spam spacebar right click you can

102
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
spam spacebar right click you can
 

103
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,190
spam spacebar right click you can
probably do it okay another thing i

104
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
probably do it okay another thing i
 

105
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,389
probably do it okay another thing i
wanted to try though is the boats

106
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
wanted to try though is the boats
 

107
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,550
wanted to try though is the boats
um if we get a boat we can probably

108
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
um if we get a boat we can probably
 

109
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,390
um if we get a boat we can probably
activate the wings before we hit the

110
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
activate the wings before we hit the
 

111
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,070

00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
amount of space where
 

141
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,190

you can move players now with a fishing
rod so that's like the ultimate way

174
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
rod so that's like the ultimate way
 

175
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,990
rod so that's like the ultimate way
of trolling your friends on a server if

176
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
of trolling your friends on a server if
 

177
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,469
of trolling your friends on a server if
for some reason they don't have wings

178

for some reason they don't have wings
you can like fly by pick them up and

180
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
you can like fly by pick them up and
 

181
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,990
you can like fly by pick them up and
then drop them

182
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
then drop them
 

183
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,150
then drop them
that's pretty crazy you know actually

184
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
that's pretty crazy you know actually
 

185
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,430

186
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
you can probably
 

187
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,950
you can probably
if you got really good at it you could

188
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
if you got really good at it you could
 

189
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,670
if you got really good at it you could
probably juggle somebody even

probably juggle somebody even
 

191
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,390
probably juggle somebody even

i got him that's pretty easy to do

198
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
i got him that's pretty easy to do
 

199
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,830
i got him that's pretty easy to do
juggling them is a whole nother story

200
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840

 

201
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,510

though

202
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
though
 

203
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,550
though
oh now we're using our noggins here

204
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
oh now we're using our noggins here
 

205
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,310
oh now we're using our noggins here
this might actually be a really good way

206
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
this might actually be a really good way
 

207
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,469
this might actually be a really good way
of moving animals if we use leads

208
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
of moving animals if we use leads
 

209
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,430
of moving animals if we use leads
the thing about the fishing rods is once

210
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
the thing about the fishing rods is once
 

211
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,590
the thing about the fishing rods is once
you get too far away

212
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
you get too far away
 

213
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,110
you get too far away
like it doesn't actually pull the animal

214
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
like it doesn't actually pull the animal
 

215
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,790
like it doesn't actually pull the animal
right or the the mob

216
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
right or the the mob
 

217
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,070
right or the the mob
and if you get too far away it just

218
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
and if you get too far away it just
 

219
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,830
and if you get too far away it just
breaks the connection

220
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
breaks the connection
 

221
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,270
breaks the connection
yeah it's broken so leads

222
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
yeah it's broken so leads
 

223
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,950
yeah it's broken so leads
let's see if we can use the firework

224
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
let's see if we can use the firework
 

225
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,870
let's see if we can use the firework
with the lead like with the fishing rod

226
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
with the lead like with the fishing rod
 

227
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,870
with the lead like with the fishing rod
you can't

228
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
you can't
 

229
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,629
you can't
even if you go into offhand

230
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639

 

231
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,310

it activates the fishing rod first

232
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
it activates the fishing rod first
 

233
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,670
it activates the fishing rod first
unless what if you switch it

234
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
unless what if you switch it
 

235
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,270
unless what if you switch it
now even still why does it always

236
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
now even still why does it always
 

237
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,029
now even still why does it always
activate the fishing rod first

238
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039

 

239
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,070

well anyways let's try with the lead so

240
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
well anyways let's try with the lead so
 

241
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,230
well anyways let's try with the lead so
we got the lead and then the

242
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
we got the lead and then the
 

243
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,790
we got the lead and then the
firework we got a lot of things active

244
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
firework we got a lot of things active
 

245
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,350
firework we got a lot of things active
right now wait a second

246
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
right now wait a second
 

247
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,070
right now wait a second
wait a second

248
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080

 

249
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,749

okay here we go nope

250
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
okay here we go nope
 

251
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,270
okay here we go nope
oh but if you move too fast with the

252
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
oh but if you move too fast with the
 

253
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,430
oh but if you move too fast with the
lead it breaks doesn't it

254
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
lead it breaks doesn't it
 

255
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,629
lead it breaks doesn't it
that's right hmm

256
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
that's right hmm
 

257
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,029
that's right hmm
is there a way around that okay i

258
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
is there a way around that okay i
 

259
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,790
is there a way around that okay i
managed to get one flight here so

260
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
managed to get one flight here so
 

261
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,550
managed to get one flight here so
we'll try it again i think we got to

262
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
we'll try it again i think we got to
 

263
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,309
we'll try it again i think we got to
figure out what angle and when to

264
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
figure out what angle and when to
 

265
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,590
figure out what angle and when to
activate the firework

266
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
activate the firework
 

267
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,150
activate the firework
i think that's the key to this now this

268
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
i think that's the key to this now this
 

269
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,029
i think that's the key to this now this
is really uh

270
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
is really uh
 

271
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,950
is really uh
really useful let's say you got to move

272
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
really useful let's say you got to move
 

273
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,830
really useful let's say you got to move
mushrooms back to your home or something

274
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
mushrooms back to your home or something
 

275
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,510
mushrooms back to your home or something
this is a way to do it quickly not

276
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
this is a way to do it quickly not
 

277
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,950
this is a way to do it quickly not
necessarily safely

278
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
necessarily safely
 

279
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,790
necessarily safely
get back here so

280
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
get back here so
 

281
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,309
get back here so
let's go into this camera view this is

282
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
let's go into this camera view this is
 

283
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,110
let's go into this camera view this is
the way i did it before look straight up

284
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
the way i did it before look straight up
 

285
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,710
the way i did it before look straight up
if we fly straight up it seems to work

286
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
if we fly straight up it seems to work
 

287
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,189
if we fly straight up it seems to work
pretty good

288
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
pretty good
 

289
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,710
pretty good

291
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,909

oh well that was short-lived why didn't

292
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
oh well that was short-lived why didn't
 

293
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,189
oh well that was short-lived why didn't
it activate again

294
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
it activate again
 

295
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,430
it activate again
i think i pressed i think i pressed it

296
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
i think i pressed i think i pressed it
 

297
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,230
i think i pressed i think i pressed it
again but i

298
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
again but i
 

299
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,589

frequently there we'll try to slow it
 

311
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,710
frequently there we'll try to slow it
down a bit more

312
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720

hmm
 

327
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,230
hmm
i know there's a way to do it you just

328
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
i know there's a way to do it you just
 

329
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,909
i know there's a way to do it you just
got to figure out the timings

330
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
got to figure out the timings
 

331
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,550
got to figure out the timings
to the fireworks and the right angle to

332
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
to the fireworks and the right angle to
 

333
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,270
to the fireworks and the right angle to
the flight

334
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
the flight
 

335
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,950
the flight
i'm sure of it

336
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
i'm sure of it
 

337
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,070
i'm sure of it
once you level out stays with us but as

338
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
once you level out stays with us but as
 

339
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,070
once you level out stays with us but as
soon as i activated another firework i

340
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
soon as i activated another firework i
 

341
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,589
soon as i activated another firework i

this is not easy though it might just be
 

657
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,910
this is not easy though it might just be
better to move on through a

658
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
better to move on through a
 

659
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,670
better to move on through a
through another portal unless it's

660
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
through another portal unless it's
 

661

be able to get a llama back that way
because i i keep passing into new chunks

682
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
because i i keep passing into new chunks
 

683
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,150
because i i keep passing into new chunks
and then it lags

684
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
and then it lags
 

685
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,470
and then it lags
and then the llama detaches that's

686
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
and then the llama detaches that's
 

687
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,230

793
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,870

go

794
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880

to like land again before you attack
 

811

1055
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,710
get even more gold out of the gold farm
let's try it out here but in reality

1056
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
let's try it out here but in reality
 

1057
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,590
let's try it out here but in reality
this is a really bad thing to do i think

1058
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
this is a really bad thing to do i think
 

1059
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,310
this is a really bad thing to do i think
because the gold farm nets you infinite

1060
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
because the gold farm nets you infinite
 

1061
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,350
because the gold farm nets you infinite
gold at the expense of time right

1062
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
gold at the expense of time right
 

1063
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,870
gold at the expense of time right
um this will get you more gold

1064
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
um this will get you more gold
 

1065
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,470
um this will get you more gold
in less time it doesn't really cost time

1066
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
in less time it doesn't really cost time
 

1067
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,230
in less time it doesn't really cost time
though because it's totally afkable as

1068
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
though because it's totally afkable as
 

1069
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,190
though because it's totally afkable as
well

1070
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
well
 

1071
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,750
well
but this also has the additional expense

1072
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
but this also has the additional expense
 

1073
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,510
but this also has the additional expense
of consuming fuel

1074
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
of consuming fuel
 

1075
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,149
of consuming fuel
so you have to use coal or wood or

1076
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
so you have to use coal or wood or
 

1077
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,950
so you have to use coal or wood or
charcoal or

1078
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
charcoal or
 

1079
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,470
charcoal or
blaze rods or lava buckets would also

1080
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
blaze rods or lava buckets would also
 

1081
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,990
blaze rods or lava buckets would also
probably be a good one

1082
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
probably be a good one
 

1083
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,310
probably be a good one
um getting all those things though the

1084
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
um getting all those things though the
 

1085
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,110
um getting all those things though the
only one that's

1086
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
only one that's
 

1087
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,269
only one that's
like totally afk able is charcoal or

1088
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:51,279
like totally afk able is charcoal or
 

1089
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,190
like totally afk able is charcoal or
wood

1090
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
