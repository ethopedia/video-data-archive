there if I can but we have bedrock in

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,210
there if I can but we have bedrock in
 

23
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,440
there if I can but we have bedrock in
the way so the minecarts

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,450
the way so the minecarts
 

25
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,810
the way so the minecarts
stopped over there and I want them to

26
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:47,820
stopped over there and I want them to
 

27
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,060
stopped over there and I want them to
continue straight up but we got this

28
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,070
continue straight up but we got this
 

29
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,160
continue straight up but we got this
bedrock there's probably a couple more

30
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,170
bedrock there's probably a couple more
 

31
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,380
bedrock there's probably a couple more
pieces in there there might be like five

32
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,390
pieces in there there might be like five
 

33
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,689
pieces in there there might be like five
pieces of bedrock solid there I don't

34
00:00:59,689 --> 00:00:59,699
pieces of bedrock solid there I don't
 

35
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,540
pieces of bedrock solid there I don't
know it so I'm going to try remove them

36
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:02,550
know it so I'm going to try remove them
 

37
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,560
know it so I'm going to try remove them
using the dark oak tree trick which

38
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:06,570
using the dark oak tree trick which
 

39
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,719
using the dark oak tree trick which
apparently is still in the game which is

awesome I was worried they might have

42
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
awesome I was worried they might have
 

43
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,070
awesome I was worried they might have
fixed it and I want to be able to do

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,080
fixed it and I want to be able to do
 

45
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,760
fixed it and I want to be able to do
this because I would like like it's an

OCD thing I I want I want to go up right

48
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:21,900
OCD thing I I want I want to go up right
 

49
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,289
OCD thing I I want I want to go up right
here I don't want to go up here I want

50
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:24,299
here I don't want to go up here I want
 

51
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,819
here I don't want to go up here I want
it to be centered and continue so

52
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:27,829
it to be centered and continue so
 

53
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,289
it to be centered and continue so
hopefully this turns out if you've ever

54
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:30,299
hopefully this turns out if you've ever
 

55
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,929
hopefully this turns out if you've ever
tried this for yourself it can take a

56
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939
tried this for yourself it can take a
 

57
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,330
tried this for yourself it can take a
really long time you have to get lucky

58
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,340
really long time you have to get lucky
 

59
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,210
really long time you have to get lucky
with it and it just takes so many

60
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:38,220
with it and it just takes so many
 

61
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,340
with it and it just takes so many
saplings to you'll go through tons and

62
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,350
saplings to you'll go through tons and
 

63
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,139
saplings to you'll go through tons and
tons of saplings ouch so I'm I'm like

64
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:45,149
tons of saplings ouch so I'm I'm like
 

65
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,249
tons of saplings ouch so I'm I'm like
doing a dark oak sapling farm and

66
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:48,259
doing a dark oak sapling farm and
 

67
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,330
doing a dark oak sapling farm and
chopping down wood to as I do this

68
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,340
chopping down wood to as I do this
 

69
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,700
chopping down wood to as I do this
starting to fill up a chest so this tree

70
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:55,710
starting to fill up a chest so this tree
 

71
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,100
starting to fill up a chest so this tree
that is grew should have removed some of

72
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,110
that is grew should have removed some of
 

73
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,899
that is grew should have removed some of
the bedrock at least let's check it and

74
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:02,909
the bedrock at least let's check it and
 

75
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,999
the bedrock at least let's check it and
there goes a piece there and eventually

76
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:08,009
there goes a piece there and eventually
 

77
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,059
there goes a piece there and eventually
if you do it enough times it will take

78
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:11,069
if you do it enough times it will take
 

79
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,920
if you do it enough times it will take
out more and more pieces and you

80
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:12,930
out more and more pieces and you
 

81
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,479
out more and more pieces and you
further and further down yeah we

82
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:17,489
further and further down yeah we
 

83
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,280
further and further down yeah we
actually took quite a few pieces so

84
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,290
actually took quite a few pieces so
 

85
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,539
actually took quite a few pieces so
that's good

86
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:20,549
that's good
 

87
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,099
that's good
but anyway this is going to be a long

88
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:22,109
but anyway this is going to be a long
 

89
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:28,819
but anyway this is going to be a long
drug a long long thing to do a long

90
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:28,829
drug a long long thing to do a long
 

91
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,379
drug a long long thing to do a long
thing to do there's a better way of

92
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:30,389
thing to do there's a better way of
 

93
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,959
thing to do there's a better way of
putting that long progress no anyway I'm

94
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:35,969
putting that long progress no anyway I'm
 

95
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:37,009
putting that long progress no anyway I'm
going to I'm going to do it off camera

96
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:37,019
going to I'm going to do it off camera
 

97
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,869
going to I'm going to do it off camera
is what I'm getting it so I'll be I'll

98
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
is what I'm getting it so I'll be I'll
 

99
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,670
is what I'm getting it so I'll be I'll
be back and hopefully it works I've been

100
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
be back and hopefully it works I've been
 

101
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,220
be back and hopefully it works I've been
here for a while quite a while but I

102
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,230
here for a while quite a while but I
 

103
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,289
here for a while quite a while but I
think I'm getting really close this this

104
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:48,299
think I'm getting really close this this
 

105
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,170
think I'm getting really close this this
is one last piece that's giving me a lot

106
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,180
is one last piece that's giving me a lot
 

107
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,960
is one last piece that's giving me a lot
of trouble from what I can tell if you

108
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:53,970
of trouble from what I can tell if you
 

109
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,500
of trouble from what I can tell if you
want to wreck a blot you got to put the

110
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:56,510
want to wreck a blot you got to put the
 

111
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,360
want to wreck a blot you got to put the
tree next to it like to get rid of this

112
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,370
tree next to it like to get rid of this
 

113
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,069
tree next to it like to get rid of this
one I wouldn't really want the dirt over

114
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:01,079
one I wouldn't really want the dirt over
 

115
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,319
one I wouldn't really want the dirt over
top it I want it like one block away

116
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,329
top it I want it like one block away
 

117
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,800
top it I want it like one block away
from the dirt so we might get it this

118
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:06,810
from the dirt so we might get it this
 

119
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,300
from the dirt so we might get it this
time if it'll Griff this will grow it's

120
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,310
time if it'll Griff this will grow it's
 

121
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,009
time if it'll Griff this will grow it's
not going to grow darn it

122
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:13,019
not going to grow darn it
 

123
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,439
not going to grow darn it
that's the other thing you have to get

124
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:18,449
that's the other thing you have to get
 

125
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,539
that's the other thing you have to get
rid of all the bedrock around it that

126
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:20,549
rid of all the bedrock around it that
 

127
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,300
rid of all the bedrock around it that
prevents it from growing so I think it's

128
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,310
prevents it from growing so I think it's
 

129
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,809
prevents it from growing so I think it's
not liking these blocks so it's like a

130
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:26,819
not liking these blocks so it's like a
 

131
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,849
not liking these blocks so it's like a
real puzzle you got to you got to work

132
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:28,859
real puzzle you got to you got to work
 

133
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,399
real puzzle you got to you got to work
your way down like get rid of these

134
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:31,409
your way down like get rid of these
 

135
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,409
your way down like get rid of these
upper blocks first and then you can get

136
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:33,419
upper blocks first and then you can get
 

137
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,230
upper blocks first and then you can get
the lower ones oh man

138
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,240
the lower ones oh man
 

139
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,890
the lower ones oh man
there's the sound hmm

140
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:43,900
there's the sound hmm
 

141
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,200
there's the sound hmm
wonder if it'll grow if I move it over

142
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,210
wonder if it'll grow if I move it over
 

143
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,860
wonder if it'll grow if I move it over
one so should still target that block

144
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:52,870
one so should still target that block
 

145
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,910
one so should still target that block
whoa

146
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:54,920
whoa
 

147
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,979
whoa
darn it

148
00:03:58,979 --> 00:03:58,989

 

149
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,000

all right let's try it out I'm not sure

150
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,010
all right let's try it out I'm not sure
 

151
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,250
all right let's try it out I'm not sure
if this will actually grow but if it

152
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,260
if this will actually grow but if it
 

153
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,530
if this will actually grow but if it
does oh it did grow okay so I think we

154
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:05,540
does oh it did grow okay so I think we
 

155
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,449
does oh it did grow okay so I think we
can get it if we keep growing it in that

156
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:07,459
can get it if we keep growing it in that
 

157
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:13,899
can get it if we keep growing it in that
spot we might have got it even I think

158
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:13,909
spot we might have got it even I think
 

159
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:15,520
spot we might have got it even I think
we got it yes we did

it a try here it takes us from y 64 all
the way up to about 240 so it's it's a

248
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,030
the way up to about 240 so it's it's a
 

249
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,130
the way up to about 240 so it's it's a
pretty pretty tall elevator

because zombie pigmen are causing my
 

259
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,780
because zombie pigmen are causing my
game to like when they're entering the

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,590
amount of time I'll get knocked back
 

279
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,690
amount of time I'll get knocked back
down and I'll be knocked down to an area

out actually because I replaced part of
 

537
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,950
out actually because I replaced part of
my beacon with some of this that's where

538
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:07,960
my beacon with some of this that's where
 

539
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,890
my beacon with some of this that's where
those iron blocks came from but also

540
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:09,900
those iron blocks came from but also
 

541
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,150
those iron blocks came from but also
we're going to be making that time and

542
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
we're going to be making that time and
 

543
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,000
we're going to be making that time and
power rails for the track because I

544
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,010
power rails for the track because I
 

545
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,310
power rails for the track because I
would rather use gold for that than the

546
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,320
would rather use gold for that than the
 

547
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,590
would rather use gold for that than the
iron on the tracks so it's gone a lot of

548
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:22,600
iron on the tracks so it's gone a lot of
 

549
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,970
iron on the tracks so it's gone a lot of
people actually said they liked the coal

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:23,980
people actually said they liked the coal
 

551
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,620
people actually said they liked the coal
so I don't know if I should change this

552
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:25,630
so I don't know if I should change this
 

553
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,410
so I don't know if I should change this
out to cool or what I think it's gonna

554
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:28,420
out to cool or what I think it's gonna
 

555
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,740
out to cool or what I think it's gonna
be too dark those the thing I don't know

556
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:31,750
be too dark those the thing I don't know
 

557
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,710
be too dark those the thing I don't know
I don't know what to do about this room

558
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
I don't know what to do about this room
 

559
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,880
I don't know what to do about this room

stuff I got going around I'm not sure if

562
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,290
stuff I got going around I'm not sure if
 

563
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,340
stuff I got going around I'm not sure if
that would really work with the coal

564
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,350
that would really work with the coal
 

565
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:50,310
that would really work with the coal
but anyway huh I ran out of power rails

566
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
but anyway huh I ran out of power rails
 

567
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,100
but anyway huh I ran out of power rails
I wasn't expecting that so I got most of

568
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,110
I wasn't expecting that so I got most of
 

569
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,620
I wasn't expecting that so I got most of
the way to the wither skeleton farm but

570
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:55,630
the way to the wither skeleton farm but
 

571
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,040
the way to the wither skeleton farm but
not quite all the way we need at least

572
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,050
not quite all the way we need at least
 

573
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,629
not quite all the way we need at least
400 more which is quite a bit actually

574
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
400 more which is quite a bit actually
 

575
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,460
400 more which is quite a bit actually
let's go for a ride it is definitely a

576
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,470
let's go for a ride it is definitely a
 

577
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,379
let's go for a ride it is definitely a
lot faster like you don't really notice

578
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:07,389
lot faster like you don't really notice
 

579
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:12,750
lot faster like you don't really notice
it too too much here we're picking up a

580
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:12,760
it too too much here we're picking up a
 

581
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,290
it too too much here we're picking up a
bit of speed torches are whizzing by

582
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,300
bit of speed torches are whizzing by
 

583
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,370
bit of speed torches are whizzing by
there's no power rails where I'm at

584
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:17,380
there's no power rails where I'm at
 

585
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,569
there's no power rails where I'm at
right now so we're just kind of coasting

586
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:20,579
right now so we're just kind of coasting
 

587
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,819
right now so we're just kind of coasting
but we're here we reach them and then

588
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:23,829
but we're here we reach them and then
 

589
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:30,629
but we're here we reach them and then
whew so much faster we are flying so

590
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
whew so much faster we are flying so
 

591
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,970
whew so much faster we are flying so
cool but there's this thing where you

592
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:34,980
cool but there's this thing where you
 

593
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,259
cool but there's this thing where you
derail if you're going too quick around

594
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:37,269
derail if you're going too quick around
 

595
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:40,079
derail if you're going too quick around
a corner I haven't decided the way I

596
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,089
a corner I haven't decided the way I
 

597
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,639
a corner I haven't decided the way I
want to deal with that just yet there's

598
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:41,649
want to deal with that just yet there's
 

599
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,750
want to deal with that just yet there's
a few tricks too to it some people have

600
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:45,760
a few tricks too to it some people have
 

601
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,470
a few tricks too to it some people have
been putting like unpowered power rails

602
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
been putting like unpowered power rails
 

603
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,569
been putting like unpowered power rails
unpowered power rails yeah before I

604
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:51,579
unpowered power rails yeah before I
 

605
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,160
unpowered power rails yeah before I
returned and that slows you down really

606
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,170
returned and that slows you down really
 

607
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,040
returned and that slows you down really
quick is one way of doing it I found

608
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,050
quick is one way of doing it I found
 

609
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,210
quick is one way of doing it I found
though that if you I don't know if this

610
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,220
though that if you I don't know if this
 

611
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,590
though that if you I don't know if this
is going to be possible but like if

612
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
is going to be possible but like if
 

613
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,269
is going to be possible but like if
you're you on this way and you hit one

614
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
you're you on this way and you hit one
 

615
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,699
you're you on this way and you hit one
of these kind of sections a slanted

616
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:05,709
of these kind of sections a slanted
 

617
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,970
of these kind of sections a slanted
track you instantly go around you don't

618
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:08,980
track you instantly go around you don't
 

619
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,669
track you instantly go around you don't
lose any speed and it stays on the track

620
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
lose any speed and it stays on the track
 

621
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,079
lose any speed and it stays on the track
so if I could come up with a way of

622
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,089
so if I could come up with a way of
 

623
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,010
so if I could come up with a way of
doing that going both ways because going

624
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,020
doing that going both ways because going
 

625
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,740
doing that going both ways because going
this way I'll just I'll derail it but if

626
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:19,750
this way I'll just I'll derail it but if
 

627
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,140
this way I'll just I'll derail it but if
I go this way that works if I can find a

628
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,150
I go this way that works if I can find a
 

629
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,699
I go this way that works if I can find a
way of doing it for for both directions

630
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:23,709
way of doing it for for both directions
 

631
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,539
way of doing it for for both directions
it will be perfect yeah let's keep going

632

it will be perfect yeah let's keep going
here

634
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:32,850

 

635
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,930

such a great change like horses as they

636
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:35,940
such a great change like horses as they
 

637
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,130
such a great change like horses as they
were I think they were about right like

638
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,140
were I think they were about right like
 

639
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,930
were I think they were about right like
it didn't make sense for horses to be

640
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:41,940
it didn't make sense for horses to be
 

641
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,340
it didn't make sense for horses to be
faster than mine carts because mine

642
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,350
faster than mine carts because mine
 

643
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,200
faster than mine carts because mine
carts you gotta go through all this

644
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,210
carts you gotta go through all this
 

645
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,720
carts you gotta go through all this
extra work of laying down a track and

646
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:47,730
extra work of laying down a track and
 

647
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,700
extra work of laying down a track and
collecting tons and materials for it but

648
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:51,710
collecting tons and materials for it but
 

649
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,900
collecting tons and materials for it but
that's just a little bit further down

650
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:53,910
that's just a little bit further down
 

651
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,529
that's just a little bit further down
that way but to mine mine carts were

652
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:57,539
that way but to mine mine carts were
 

653
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,630
that way but to mine mine carts were
slower than horses horses they felt like

654
00:17:59,630 --> 00:17:59,640
slower than horses horses they felt like
 

655
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,830
slower than horses horses they felt like
they were a good speed though I think

656
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:00,840
they were a good speed though I think
 

657
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,159
they were a good speed though I think
they did a good job at 50 how quick

658
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,169
they did a good job at 50 how quick
 

659
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,070
they did a good job at 50 how quick
horses were they're a lot of fun to ride

660
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,080
horses were they're a lot of fun to ride
 

661
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,240
horses were they're a lot of fun to ride
the way they are

662
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,250
the way they are
 

663
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,600
the way they are
and I wouldn't want them to be slower

664
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:10,610
and I wouldn't want them to be slower
 

665
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,440
and I wouldn't want them to be slower
but the only way of really dealing with

666
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,450
but the only way of really dealing with
 

667
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,450
but the only way of really dealing with
that was to make mine carts faster I

668
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:17,460
that was to make mine carts faster I
 

669
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,610
that was to make mine carts faster I
think that was the right choice I know

670
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:22,620
think that was the right choice I know
 

671
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,470
think that was the right choice I know

though that things couldn't go any

684
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:47,220
though that things couldn't go any
 

685
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,760
though that things couldn't go any
quicker because chunks couldn't keep up

686
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:49,770
quicker because chunks couldn't keep up
 

687
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,770
quicker because chunks couldn't keep up
with loading on that at the time anyway

688
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:51,780
with loading on that at the time anyway

there's all obviously been improvements

690
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,640
there's all obviously been improvements
 

691
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,190
there's all obviously been improvements
and optimizations in the game so it

692
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,200
and optimizations in the game so it
 

693
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,659
and optimizations in the game so it
seems like it's possible now like I

694
00:18:59,659 --> 00:18:59,669
seems like it's possible now like I
 

695
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,520

didn't have too much trouble with chunks

696
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,530
didn't have too much trouble with chunks
 

697
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,490

loading even while recording here things
 

699
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,770
loading even while recording here things
are a lot slower and it was able to keep

700
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:06,780
are a lot slower and it was able to keep
 

701
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,649
are a lot slower and it was able to keep
up so that's good when I'm not recording

702
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:09,659
up so that's good when I'm not recording
 

703
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:14,390
up so that's good when I'm not recording

deployer features of red power that the
 

815
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,240
deployer features of red power that the
red power mod and there's a lot of mods

816
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,250
red power mod and there's a lot of mods
 

817
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,730
red power mod and there's a lot of mods
that do similar thing I think that would

818
00:21:59,730 --> 00:21:59,740
that do similar thing I think that would
 

819
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,680
that do similar thing I think that would
be a good a good thing to add but I

something similar to the drawbridge from

824
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:09,940
something similar to the drawbridge from
 

825
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,690
something similar to the drawbridge from
thinker's construct that is a really

cool mechanic because for a long time

828
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,150
cool mechanic because for a long time

like Pistons are really neat but they

830
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:17,590
like Pistons are really neat but they
 

831
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,990
like Pistons are really neat but they
can only move one block around at a time

832
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,000
can only move one block around at a time
 

833
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,419
can only move one block around at a time
and there's sort of a limit to how how

834
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:24,429
and there's sort of a limit to how how
 

835
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:27,539
and there's sort of a limit to how how
far out they can go like you can do 2 or

836
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:27,549
far out they can go like you can do 2 or
 

837
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,970
far out they can go like you can do 2 or
3 blocks and the device becomes really

838
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:29,980
3 blocks and the device becomes really
 

839
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,180
3 blocks and the device becomes really
large but is

840
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,190
large but is
 

841
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,690
large but is
possible but it takes forever and it's

842
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:34,700
possible but it takes forever and it's
 

843
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,610
possible but it takes forever and it's
not really practical so a drawbridge

844
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:36,620
not really practical so a drawbridge
 

845
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,970
not really practical so a drawbridge
sort of breaks breaks those limitations

846
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:39,980
sort of breaks breaks those limitations
 

847
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,670
sort of breaks breaks those limitations
and from what I saw it seems like it was

848
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:42,680
and from what I saw it seems like it was
 

849
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,500
and from what I saw it seems like it was
implemented in a way that's not really

850
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:46,510
implemented in a way that's not really
 

851
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,910
implemented in a way that's not really
too ladylike there's other mods I've

852
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:48,920
too ladylike there's other mods I've
 

853
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,780
too ladylike there's other mods I've
seen that pistons can push like a block

854
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:52,790
seen that pistons can push like a block
 

855
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:56,020
seen that pistons can push like a block
16 blocks instead of just one and those

856
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,030
16 blocks instead of just one and those
 

857
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,980
16 blocks instead of just one and those
look a lot more prone prone to bugs and

858
00:22:59,980 --> 00:22:59,990
look a lot more prone prone to bugs and
 

859
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,690
look a lot more prone prone to bugs and
other problems but that the drawbridge

860
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:03,700
other problems but that the drawbridge
 

861
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,070
other problems but that the drawbridge
looked really cool and I would like to

862
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
looked really cool and I would like to
 

863
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,760
looked really cool and I would like to
see that I think that would be neat so

864
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:09,770
see that I think that would be neat so
 

865
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,980
see that I think that would be neat so
