00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,290
a bunch of blocks together here today so
 

43
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,539
a bunch of blocks together here today so
we can start building with them and

44
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:11,549
we can start building with them and
 

45
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:19,100

you're worse than taxes alright get out
of here yes I thought we would lay these

52
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,020
of here yes I thought we would lay these
 

53
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,749
of here yes I thought we would lay these
out first guys and just take a look at

54
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
out first guys and just take a look at
 

55
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,950
out first guys and just take a look at
them in case you haven't seen them yet

56
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
them in case you haven't seen them yet
 

57
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,690
them in case you haven't seen them yet
in your and you're curious what they're

58
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:32,700
in your and you're curious what they're
 

59
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,050
in your and you're curious what they're
like they're very very bright and

60
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,060
like they're very very bright and
 

61
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,530
like they're very very bright and
vibrant and full of life aren't they

62
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:38,540
vibrant and full of life aren't they
 

63
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,810
vibrant and full of life aren't they
it's gonna be quite the game-changer as

64
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:41,820
it's gonna be quite the game-changer as
 

65
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,789
it's gonna be quite the game-changer as
far as building goes in this game I

66
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:43,799
far as building goes in this game I
 

67
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,719
far as building goes in this game I
think because we didn't have a lot of

68
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:47,729
think because we didn't have a lot of
 

69
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,700
think because we didn't have a lot of
vibrant colors in this game before like

70
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:49,710
vibrant colors in this game before like
 

71
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,940
vibrant colors in this game before like
maybe prismarine per per blocks some of

72
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:52,950
maybe prismarine per per blocks some of
 

73
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,770
maybe prismarine per per blocks some of
the clay colors are pretty byte brights

74
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:54,780
the clay colors are pretty byte brights
 

75
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,940
the clay colors are pretty byte brights
and the wool and stuff but yeah well I

76
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:58,950
and the wool and stuff but yeah well I
 

77
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,550
and the wool and stuff but yeah well I
guess that's quite a few blocks but now

78
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,560
guess that's quite a few blocks but now
 

79
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,950
guess that's quite a few blocks but now
we got like 48 new ones and the wall is

80
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:03,960
we got like 48 new ones and the wall is
 

81
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,980
we got like 48 new ones and the wall is
a lot brighter to kind of go along with

82
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:06,990
a lot brighter to kind of go along with
 

83
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,830
a lot brighter to kind of go along with
the new colors it's gonna be interesting

84
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
the new colors it's gonna be interesting
 

85
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,630
the new colors it's gonna be interesting
I don't think people are gonna build the

86
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
I don't think people are gonna build the
 

87
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,550
I don't think people are gonna build the
same way anymore because previously most

88
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,560
same way anymore because previously most
 

89
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,940
same way anymore because previously most
of our

90
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:13,950
of our
 

91
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,150
of our
builds are some kind of gray color like

92
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
builds are some kind of gray color like
 

93
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,550
builds are some kind of gray color like
a stone then you got your earth tones

94
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:19,560
a stone then you got your earth tones
 

95
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,589
a stone then you got your earth tones
like the wood and stuff browns and

96
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
like the wood and stuff browns and
 

97
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,860
like the wood and stuff browns and
greens and that those are the main main

98
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:24,870
greens and that those are the main main
 

99
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,390
greens and that those are the main main
building blocks in Minecraft and now we

100
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
building blocks in Minecraft and now we
 

101
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,490
building blocks in Minecraft and now we
have all these bright vibrant things and

102
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:28,500
have all these bright vibrant things and
 

103
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,670
have all these bright vibrant things and
the cool thing about them is they are

104
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
the cool thing about them is they are
 

105
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,690
the cool thing about them is they are
directional as well so depending on

106
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:32,700
directional as well so depending on
 

107
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,150
directional as well so depending on
which way you play some changes the

108
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,160
which way you play some changes the
 

109
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,970
which way you play some changes the
rotation and you can combine them

110
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:37,980
rotation and you can combine them
 

111
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,039
rotation and you can combine them
together and create all sorts of cool

112
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,049
together and create all sorts of cool
 

113
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,800
together and create all sorts of cool
textures and patterns and stuff it's

114
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:42,810
textures and patterns and stuff it's
 

115
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,600
textures and patterns and stuff it's
gonna be interesting I don't know

116
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,610
gonna be interesting I don't know
 

117
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,949
gonna be interesting I don't know
exactly what I'm gonna do with them

118
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:45,959
exactly what I'm gonna do with them
 

119
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,289
exactly what I'm gonna do with them
myself but maybe we'll try to do some

120
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:48,299
myself but maybe we'll try to do some
 

121
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:48,949
myself but maybe we'll try to do some
building today

122
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
building today
 

123
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,600
building today
oh there's I never noticed that there's

124
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,610
oh there's I never noticed that there's
 

125
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,289
oh there's I never noticed that there's
creeper faces and those I just noticed

126
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:54,299
creeper faces and those I just noticed
 

127
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,020
creeper faces and those I just noticed
that that's awesome uh-huh this one

128
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,030
that that's awesome uh-huh this one
 

129
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,539
that that's awesome uh-huh this one
reminds me of a sword when I see it and

130
00:02:59,539 --> 00:02:59,549
reminds me of a sword when I see it and
 

131
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,770
reminds me of a sword when I see it and
that's like the the mouse pointer okay

132
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:03,780
that's like the the mouse pointer okay
 

133
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,690
that's like the the mouse pointer okay
let's try something out here first off I

134
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:05,700
let's try something out here first off I
 

135
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,430
let's try something out here first off I
know you can instant mine these with

136
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
know you can instant mine these with
 

137
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,319
know you can instant mine these with
haste - we got haste - right now an

138
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:09,329
haste - we got haste - right now an
 

139
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,420
haste - we got haste - right now an
efficiency 5 on this thing

140
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,430
efficiency 5 on this thing
 

141
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,910
efficiency 5 on this thing
just like clay you can instant mine it

142
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
just like clay you can instant mine it
 

143
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,580
just like clay you can instant mine it
which is awesome makes it a lot easier

144
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:16,590
which is awesome makes it a lot easier
 

145
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,330
which is awesome makes it a lot easier
to fix your mistakes and stuff but we're

146
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,340
to fix your mistakes and stuff but we're
 

147
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,800
to fix your mistakes and stuff but we're
gonna change our beacon here to haste 1c

148
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:24,810
gonna change our beacon here to haste 1c
 

149
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,509
gonna change our beacon here to haste 1c
and you can't instant mine with it okay

150
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:26,519
and you can't instant mine with it okay
 

151
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,319
and you can't instant mine with it okay
so it's not quite like hard and clay and

152
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:29,329
so it's not quite like hard and clay and
 

153
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,460
so it's not quite like hard and clay and
something really worth noting about

154
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,470
something really worth noting about
 

155
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,199
something really worth noting about
these terracotta blocks is when you

156
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,209
these terracotta blocks is when you
 

157
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,580
these terracotta blocks is when you
build with them you're probably gonna

158
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:34,590
build with them you're probably gonna
 

159
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,129
build with them you're probably gonna
want to build with even numbers like if

160
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:37,139
want to build with even numbers like if
 

161
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,539
want to build with even numbers like if
you're using them in your floor or in

162
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:38,549
you're using them in your floor or in
 

163
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,020
you're using them in your floor or in
your wall because the texture aligns on

164
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,030
your wall because the texture aligns on
 

165
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,120
your wall because the texture aligns on
the edges of the blocks and not in the

166
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,130
the edges of the blocks and not in the
 

167
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,030
the edges of the blocks and not in the
center of the block that means you have

168
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
center of the block that means you have
 

169
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,920
center of the block that means you have
this weird thing where you have like one

170
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:48,930
this weird thing where you have like one
 

171
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,460
this weird thing where you have like one
big circle and and a half circle but

172
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,470
big circle and and a half circle but
 

173
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,800
big circle and and a half circle but
this as as your center if you're

174
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:54,810
this as as your center if you're
 

175
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,420
this as as your center if you're
building with odd numbers doesn't look

176
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,430
building with odd numbers doesn't look
 

177
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,870
building with odd numbers doesn't look
quite right right but if you go by by

178
00:03:59,870 --> 00:03:59,880
quite right right but if you go by by
 

179
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,680
quite right right but if you go by by
twos or fours or sixes then you're fine

180
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:02,690
twos or fours or sixes then you're fine
 

181
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,539
twos or fours or sixes then you're fine
if you're rotating the blocks if you're

182
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:05,549
if you're rotating the blocks if you're
 

183
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,420
if you're rotating the blocks if you're
not really rotating them it's not as big

184
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:08,430
not really rotating them it's not as big
 

185
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,559
not really rotating them it's not as big
of an issue okay so I just tried out a

186
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:12,569
of an issue okay so I just tried out a
 

187
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,089
of an issue okay so I just tried out a
little bit of building with the

188
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:14,099
little bit of building with the
 

189
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,759
little bit of building with the
terracotta blocks and yeah I don't know

190
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:19,769
terracotta blocks and yeah I don't know
 

191
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,009
terracotta blocks and yeah I don't know
I might have to I think I'm gonna have

192
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:22,019
I might have to I think I'm gonna have
 

193
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,390
I might have to I think I'm gonna have
to see what other people do with them

194
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,400
to see what other people do with them
 

195
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,760
to see what other people do with them
first to steal some building tricks or

196
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,770
first to steal some building tricks or
 

197
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,860
first to steal some building tricks or
whatever because like they don't

198
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:27,870
whatever because like they don't
 

199
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,629
whatever because like they don't
I find they really don't mix well with a

200
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:29,639
I find they really don't mix well with a
 

201
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,140
I find they really don't mix well with a
lot of the existing blocks in the game

202
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,150
lot of the existing blocks in the game
 

203
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,870
lot of the existing blocks in the game
like that doesn't look good they look

204
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:35,880
like that doesn't look good they look
 

205
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,700
like that doesn't look good they look
cool on their own but then when you do a

206
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:37,710
cool on their own but then when you do a
 

207
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,860
cool on their own but then when you do a
big cluster of them together I'm not

208
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:39,870
big cluster of them together I'm not
 

209
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,530
big cluster of them together I'm not
sure I like it either though yeah I

210
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:42,540
sure I like it either though yeah I
 

211
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,600
sure I like it either though yeah I
think the trick with these terracotta

212
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:44,610
think the trick with these terracotta
 

213
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,070
think the trick with these terracotta
blocks is we're gonna want to use them

214
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
blocks is we're gonna want to use them
 

215
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,860
blocks is we're gonna want to use them
sparingly not like big clusters of them

216
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:48,870
sparingly not like big clusters of them
 

217
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,050
sparingly not like big clusters of them
but just little bits here and there I'll

218
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,060
but just little bits here and there I'll
 

219
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,930
but just little bits here and there I'll
probably look good but going to need to

220
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:53,940
probably look good but going to need to
 

221
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,450
probably look good but going to need to
practice using them because I don't know

222
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:56,460
practice using them because I don't know
 

223
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,129
practice using them because I don't know
what to do with them honestly so we're

224
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:58,139
what to do with them honestly so we're
 

225
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,670
what to do with them honestly so we're
gonna move on to the concrete powder

226
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
gonna move on to the concrete powder
 

227
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,800
gonna move on to the concrete powder
this is a block I'm gonna be using tons

228
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:03,810
this is a block I'm gonna be using tons
 

229
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,770
this is a block I'm gonna be using tons
of I think everybody is out of all the

230
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,780
of I think everybody is out of all the
 

231
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,620
of I think everybody is out of all the
blocks introduced the powder is probably

232
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:09,630
blocks introduced the powder is probably
 

233
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,700
blocks introduced the powder is probably
the real winner in this update

234
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:12,710
the real winner in this update
 

235
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,290
the real winner in this update
so yeah the way you make it you take

236
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,300
so yeah the way you make it you take
 

237
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,750
so yeah the way you make it you take
your die as we just did there you need

238
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:17,760
your die as we just did there you need
 

239
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,029
your die as we just did there you need
gravel and you need sand dye goes in the

240
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:20,039
gravel and you need sand dye goes in the
 

241
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,210
gravel and you need sand dye goes in the
middle gravel and sand and you get 8h

242
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,220
middle gravel and sand and you get 8h
 

243
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,610
middle gravel and sand and you get 8h
crafting yeah so you only need 8 died to

244
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,620
crafting yeah so you only need 8 died to
 

245
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,040
crafting yeah so you only need 8 died to
make a stack of this stuff okay I did

246
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,050
make a stack of this stuff okay I did
 

247
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,360
make a stack of this stuff okay I did
not realize this it's actually a

248
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,370
not realize this it's actually a
 

249
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,180
not realize this it's actually a
shapeless crafting recipe so that's

250
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,190
shapeless crafting recipe so that's
 

251
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,330
shapeless crafting recipe so that's
awesome you you can put the gravel or

252
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,340
awesome you you can put the gravel or
 

253
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,860
awesome you you can put the gravel or
sand in there however you want and the

254
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:39,870
sand in there however you want and the
 

255
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,589
sand in there however you want and the
die and it'll craft it up okay that's

256
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:42,599
die and it'll craft it up okay that's
 

257
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,700
die and it'll craft it up okay that's
cool okay guys here's the big moment can

258
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:46,710
cool okay guys here's the big moment can
 

259
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,629
cool okay guys here's the big moment can
we do it

260
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:47,639
we do it
 

261
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:55,430
we do it
can we do it no oh no cannot instant

262
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
can we do it no oh no cannot instant
 

263
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,330
can we do it no oh no cannot instant
mine concrete blocks it's too bad I like

264
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,340
mine concrete blocks it's too bad I like
 

265
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,560
mine concrete blocks it's too bad I like
that whenever you can instant mine a

266
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,570
that whenever you can instant mine a
 

267
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,180
that whenever you can instant mine a
block in this game it's so much more

268
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,190
block in this game it's so much more
 

269
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,670
block in this game it's so much more
enjoyable right or if you make a mistake

270
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:04,680
enjoyable right or if you make a mistake
 

271
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,839
enjoyable right or if you make a mistake
you don't have to worry about cleaning

272
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:05,849
you don't have to worry about cleaning
 

273
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,800
you don't have to worry about cleaning
up afterwards oh well I made a stack of

274
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:09,810
up afterwards oh well I made a stack of
 

275
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,570
up afterwards oh well I made a stack of
each of the concrete powders your guys

276
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:11,580
each of the concrete powders your guys
 

277
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,089
each of the concrete powders your guys
so we inject them out to your 16 colors

278
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:14,099
so we inject them out to your 16 colors
 

279
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,180
so we inject them out to your 16 colors
in total and they're also pretty bright

280
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,190
in total and they're also pretty bright
 

281
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,450
in total and they're also pretty bright
vibrant blocks very similar to sand

282
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,460
vibrant blocks very similar to sand
 

283
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,400
vibrant blocks very similar to sand
blocks like a similar texture and like

284
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,410
blocks like a similar texture and like
 

285
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,730
blocks like a similar texture and like
sand blocks they also have gravity but

286
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:25,740
sand blocks they also have gravity but
 

287
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,710
sand blocks they also have gravity but
when they touch the water or if water

288
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
when they touch the water or if water
 

289
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,450
when they touch the water or if water
touches them they converts into

290
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:29,460
touches them they converts into
 

291
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,279
touches them they converts into
concrete's that's how you get the

292
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,289
concrete's that's how you get the
 

293
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,430
concrete's that's how you get the
concrete blocks which have a very smooth

294
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,440
concrete blocks which have a very smooth
 

295
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,580
concrete blocks which have a very smooth
texture which is gonna be hard to use

296
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:37,590
texture which is gonna be hard to use
 

297
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,570
texture which is gonna be hard to use
with like most blocks in Minecraft

298
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:41,580
with like most blocks in Minecraft
 

299
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,460
with like most blocks in Minecraft
but it's good for like pixel art or

300
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,470
but it's good for like pixel art or
 

301
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,920
but it's good for like pixel art or
things like that I think right maybe

302
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:45,930
things like that I think right maybe
 

303
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,200
things like that I think right maybe
some unique builds could take advantage

304
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,210
some unique builds could take advantage
 

305
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,939
some unique builds could take advantage
of them

306
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:49,949
of them
 

307
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,119
of them
I did notice so even though they have a

308
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:53,129
I did notice so even though they have a
 

309
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,279
I did notice so even though they have a
similar texture to sand like if you look

310
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:55,289
similar texture to sand like if you look
 

311
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,159
similar texture to sand like if you look
at sand has these two dots over here if

312
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,169
at sand has these two dots over here if
 

313
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,899
at sand has these two dots over here if
you look at orange sand it also has

314
00:06:59,899 --> 00:06:59,909
you look at orange sand it also has
 

315
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,909
you look at orange sand it also has
those two dots just a different color

316
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
those two dots just a different color
 

317
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,670
those two dots just a different color
right these though they have their own

318
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:04,680
right these though they have their own
 

319
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,760
right these though they have their own
unique texture and even between each of

320
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:07,770
unique texture and even between each of
 

321
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,760
unique texture and even between each of
the colors each one has its own

322
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:09,770
the colors each one has its own
 

323
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,920
the colors each one has its own
different noise pattern or texture which

324
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:12,930
different noise pattern or texture which
 

325
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,990
different noise pattern or texture which
is kind of cool right they're not all

326
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,000
is kind of cool right they're not all
 

327
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,999
is kind of cool right they're not all
the same these are gonna be really

328
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:19,009
the same these are gonna be really
 

329
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,439
the same these are gonna be really
really good in the game though because

330
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:21,449
really good in the game though because
 

331
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,089
really good in the game though because
you can use them for so many different

332
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:23,099
you can use them for so many different
 

333
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,879
you can use them for so many different
things like let's say you want to use

334
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:25,889
things like let's say you want to use
 

335
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,520
things like let's say you want to use
them for flooring right or for four

336
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,530
them for flooring right or for four
 

337
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,640
them for flooring right or for four
paths not a problem I would even argue

338
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:31,650
paths not a problem I would even argue
 

339
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,219
paths not a problem I would even argue
that the the texture on these blocks is

340
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:34,229
that the the texture on these blocks is
 

341
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,320
that the the texture on these blocks is
nicer than the wool texture right I

342
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,330
nicer than the wool texture right I
 

343
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,089
nicer than the wool texture right I
think you people are gonna use this as

344
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:38,099
think you people are gonna use this as
 

345
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,450
think you people are gonna use this as
as carpeting in their builds instead of

346
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:41,460
as carpeting in their builds instead of
 

347
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,730
as carpeting in their builds instead of
wool just because it looks better than

348
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,740
wool just because it looks better than
 

349
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,559
wool just because it looks better than
wool in my opinion yeah it's a nice

350
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:48,569
wool in my opinion yeah it's a nice
 

351
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,469
wool in my opinion yeah it's a nice
block and you can use it for walls why

352
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:51,479
block and you can use it for walls why
 

353
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,080
block and you can use it for walls why
nots right it has a nice texture to it

354
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,090
nots right it has a nice texture to it
 

355
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,269
nots right it has a nice texture to it
so why not use it like this wallpaper or

356
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:56,279
so why not use it like this wallpaper or
 

357
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:03,260
so why not use it like this wallpaper or
as paint sure looks great I think here

358
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,270
as paint sure looks great I think here
 

359
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,260

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,270
let's go ahead and sleep real quick and
 

361
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,390
let's go ahead and sleep real quick and
a lot of the blocks can blend well with

362
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
a lot of the blocks can blend well with
 

363
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,430
a lot of the blocks can blend well with
the existing blocks in the game which is

364
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,440
the existing blocks in the game which is
 

365
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,800
the existing blocks in the game which is
really the important thing I think like

366
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:12,810
really the important thing I think like
 

367
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,860
really the important thing I think like

372
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:21,509
concrete powder here it kind of looks
 

373
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,399
concrete powder here it kind of looks
like mud I find looks like mud mixes

374
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:25,409
like mud I find looks like mud mixes
 

375
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,409
like mud I find looks like mud mixes
well with grass because it's got a

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:27,419
well with grass because it's got a
 

377
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,320

also mixes well with dirts
 

381
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,389
also mixes well with dirts
which is a nice plus can be another

382
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:35,399
which is a nice plus can be another
 

383
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,420
which is a nice plus can be another

right and and cyan clay now you have
 

395
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,980
right and and cyan clay now you have
like this beautiful black texture or if

thing now so there's a lot of a lot of
 

403
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,259
thing now so there's a lot of a lot of
options here like mixing this with magma

404
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:03,269
options here like mixing this with magma
 

405
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,150
options here like mixing this with magma
blocks and lava could look like a

406
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,160
blocks and lava could look like a
 

407
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,660

with this stuff so I'm very excited
about that I did also notice like I

424
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:29,339
about that I did also notice like I
 

425
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,980
about that I did also notice like I
placed a few of them together here

426
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:30,990
placed a few of them together here
 

427
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,129
placed a few of them together here
the dots here are the same position on

428
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:34,139
the dots here are the same position on
 

429
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,769
the dots here are the same position on
each of these so they don't rotate or

430
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:36,779
each of these so they don't rotate or
 

431
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,769
each of these so they don't rotate or
anything I have that configured or on

432
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:39,779
anything I have that configured or on
 

433
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,119
anything I have that configured or on
right now like if you look at the grass

434
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,129
right now like if you look at the grass
 

435
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,170
right now like if you look at the grass
blocks they all have a different

436
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:42,180
blocks they all have a different
 

437
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,679
blocks they all have a different
rotation oh yeah I set this up so we can

438
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:45,689
rotation oh yeah I set this up so we can
 

439
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,059
rotation oh yeah I set this up so we can
check out the different concrete blocks

440
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:47,069
check out the different concrete blocks
 

441
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:49,970
check out the different concrete blocks
as well so let's change this over so

442
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:49,980
as well so let's change this over so
 

443
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,519
as well so let's change this over so
like sand you can do the the floating

444
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:52,529
like sand you can do the the floating
 

445
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,739
like sand you can do the the floating
sand trick with it and it seems to have

446
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:54,749
sand trick with it and it seems to have
 

447
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:56,809
sand trick with it and it seems to have
particles yeah I didn't I didn't expect

448
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:56,819
particles yeah I didn't I didn't expect
 

449
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:59,420
particles yeah I didn't I didn't expect
that is it always black though it's not

450
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,430
that is it always black though it's not
 

451
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,740
that is it always black though it's not
the color of the block huh that might

452
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:03,750
the color of the block huh that might
 

453
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,679
the color of the block huh that might
change later but yeah basically you do

454
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:06,689
change later but yeah basically you do
 

455
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,889
change later but yeah basically you do
that and it turns into concrete's

456
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:09,899
that and it turns into concrete's
 

457
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,990
that and it turns into concrete's
so I looked on the reddit some people

458
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
so I looked on the reddit some people
 

459
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,749
so I looked on the reddit some people

these concrete blocks already it sounds

462
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
these concrete blocks already it sounds
 

463
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,150
these concrete blocks already it sounds
like all you got to do is have like a

00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,960
way to prevent you from placing it I
wonder if we could just use a torch here

480
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:43,970
wonder if we could just use a torch here
 

481
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,990
wonder if we could just use a torch here
so it doesn't like place it forward

482
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,000
so it doesn't like place it forward
 

483
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,929
so it doesn't like place it forward
let's try that again

484
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:49,939
let's try that again
 

485
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:52,939
let's try that again
yeah it's right and left click hold it

486
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:52,949
yeah it's right and left click hold it
 

487
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:54,919
yeah it's right and left click hold it
down if you feed yourself the powder

488
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:54,929
down if you feed yourself the powder
 

489
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,470
down if you feed yourself the powder
with dispensers or something then now

490
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:57,480
with dispensers or something then now
 

491
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,329
with dispensers or something then now
you could keep it going forever now just

492
00:10:59,329 --> 00:10:59,339
you could keep it going forever now just
 

493
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,549
you could keep it going forever now just
afk as you make this stuff that's pretty

494
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:01,559
afk as you make this stuff that's pretty
 

495
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,379
afk as you make this stuff that's pretty
cool put a hopper below the blocks

496
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:03,389
cool put a hopper below the blocks
 

497
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,949
cool put a hopper below the blocks
little pick it up - that's not too bad

498
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
little pick it up - that's not too bad
 

499
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,169
little pick it up - that's not too bad
actually right I think that looks pretty

500
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:09,179
actually right I think that looks pretty
 

501
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:09,480
actually right I think that looks pretty
good

502
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,490
good
 

503
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,960
good
maybe maybe not the blue wolf for the

504
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:12,970
maybe maybe not the blue wolf for the
 

505
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,489
maybe maybe not the blue wolf for the
border we might need something with more

506
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:14,499
border we might need something with more
 

507
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,319
border we might need something with more
contrast but I do like this blue

508
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:18,329
contrast but I do like this blue
 

509
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,259
contrast but I do like this blue
concrete powder here yeah I think we're

510
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:22,269
concrete powder here yeah I think we're
 

511
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:25,199
concrete powder here yeah I think we're
gonna go ahead with this what what can

512
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:25,209
gonna go ahead with this what what can
 

513
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:26,970
gonna go ahead with this what what can
we call this concrete powder by the way

514
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:26,980
we call this concrete powder by the way
 

515
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,100
we call this concrete powder by the way
because concrete powder doesn't exactly

516
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,110
because concrete powder doesn't exactly
 

517
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,619
because concrete powder doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue it is like see pal

518
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:33,629
roll off the tongue it is like see pal
 

519
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,379
roll off the tongue it is like see pal
kind of stupid I need some blue C pal

520
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:39,389
kind of stupid I need some blue C pal
 

521
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,549
kind of stupid I need some blue C pal
yeah we got to think of a short form

522
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:41,559
yeah we got to think of a short form
 

523
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,319
yeah we got to think of a short form
though because concrete powders gonna be

524
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:43,329
though because concrete powders gonna be
 

525
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,799
though because concrete powders gonna be
tough to say constantly uh-huh I also

526
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:46,809
tough to say constantly uh-huh I also
 

527
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,189
tough to say constantly uh-huh I also
noticed while doing this I accidentally

528
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:49,199
noticed while doing this I accidentally
 

529
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,929
noticed while doing this I accidentally
while I was trying colors out and I I

530
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:51,939
while I was trying colors out and I I
 

531
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:56,129
while I was trying colors out and I I
put some light grey C POW next to the

532
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:56,139
put some light grey C POW next to the
 

533
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,699
put some light grey C POW next to the
clay and very closely color you could

534
00:11:59,699 --> 00:11:59,709
clay and very closely color you could
 

535
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,179
clay and very closely color you could
use those two together for sure which is

536
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:03,189
use those two together for sure which is
 

537
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,669
use those two together for sure which is
cool that's a good sign whenever you mix

538
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:05,679
cool that's a good sign whenever you mix
 

539
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,439
cool that's a good sign whenever you mix
things like that it means it's gonna be

540
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:07,449
things like that it means it's gonna be
 

541
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:10,590
things like that it means it's gonna be
pretty useful this is what it looked

542
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:10,600
pretty useful this is what it looked
 

543
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,449
pretty useful this is what it looked
like before we just had light blue clay

544
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:12,459
like before we just had light blue clay
 

545
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:16,590
like before we just had light blue clay
with regular clay and now we have the C

546
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:16,600
with regular clay and now we have the C
 

547
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,280
with regular clay and now we have the C
pal so it's it's a good texture like if

548
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,290
pal so it's it's a good texture like if
 

549
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,689
pal so it's it's a good texture like if
you put a bunch of it together it

550
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:21,699
you put a bunch of it together it
 

551
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,679
you put a bunch of it together it
doesn't look bad

552
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:22,689
doesn't look bad
 

553
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,660
doesn't look bad
I don't think anyways I'm curious what

554
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:24,670
I don't think anyways I'm curious what
 

555
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,579
I don't think anyways I'm curious what
you guys have to say about this I think

556
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:26,589
you guys have to say about this I think
 

557
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,289
you guys have to say about this I think
it looks pretty good it's a it's a good

558
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:28,299
it looks pretty good it's a it's a good
 

559
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:31,199
it looks pretty good it's a it's a good
good color good texture blends well with

560
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:31,209
good color good texture blends well with
 

561
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,150
good color good texture blends well with
the the wall here if we're gonna keep it

562
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,160
the the wall here if we're gonna keep it
 

563
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,160
the the wall here if we're gonna keep it
maybe two well maybe not enough contrast

564
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,170
maybe two well maybe not enough contrast
 

565
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,619
maybe two well maybe not enough contrast
I also changed out the blue shiny rocks

566
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:40,629
I also changed out the blue shiny rocks
 

567
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,210
I also changed out the blue shiny rocks
here with the light blue concrete powder

568
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,220
here with the light blue concrete powder
 

569
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,220
here with the light blue concrete powder
okay I just had a silly idea for an

570
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,230
okay I just had a silly idea for an
 

571
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,139
okay I just had a silly idea for an
experiment guys we are going to do a

572
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:49,149
experiment guys we are going to do a
 

573
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,799
experiment guys we are going to do a
physics test get rid of these make our

574
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:52,809
physics test get rid of these make our
 

575
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:53,910
physics test get rid of these make our
floating concrete's

576
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
floating concrete's
 

577
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,309
floating concrete's
so if we're standing on this and it

578
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:56,319
so if we're standing on this and it
 

579
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,919
so if we're standing on this and it
drops as soon as it touches the water

580
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:58,929
drops as soon as it touches the water
 

581
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,079
drops as soon as it touches the water
down there it's gonna turn into solid

582
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:01,089
down there it's gonna turn into solid
 

583
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,970
down there it's gonna turn into solid
concrete so if we're standing on top of

584
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:02,980
concrete so if we're standing on top of
 

585
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,109
concrete so if we're standing on top of
this are we gonna hit the water we're

586
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:07,119
this are we gonna hit the water we're
 

587
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,639
this are we gonna hit the water we're
gonna hit the concrete block after it

588
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:08,649
gonna hit the concrete block after it
 

589
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:10,410
gonna hit the concrete block after it
forms let's find out

590
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:10,420
forms let's find out
 

591
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,949
forms let's find out
here we go oh we fall through it okay so

592
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:13,959
here we go oh we fall through it okay so
 

593
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,379
here we go oh we fall through it okay so
we beat it down actually that's

594
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:16,389
we beat it down actually that's
 

595
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,069
we beat it down actually that's
interesting okay how about this one guys

596
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
interesting okay how about this one guys
 

597
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,250
interesting okay how about this one guys
what if we have a fence and we drop

598
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:23,260
what if we have a fence and we drop
 

599
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,360
what if we have a fence and we drop
bunch of concrete powder on top of it's

600
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:26,370
bunch of concrete powder on top of it's
 

601
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,700
bunch of concrete powder on top of it's
what happens when they hit the water

602
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:28,710
what happens when they hit the water
 

603
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,440
what happens when they hit the water
that's just one block convert today all

604
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,450
that's just one block convert today all
 

605
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,110
that's just one block convert today all
converts to some of them break into item

606
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,120
converts to some of them break into item
 

607
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,160
converts to some of them break into item
entities I'm not sure let's find out

608
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,170
entities I'm not sure let's find out
 

609
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,420
entities I'm not sure let's find out
maybe well we'll throw some sand in

610
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,430
maybe well we'll throw some sand in
 

611
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,450
maybe well we'll throw some sand in
there just for some chaos as well I

612
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,460
there just for some chaos as well I
 

613
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,500
there just for some chaos as well I
don't know if it'll affect it or not

614
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,510
don't know if it'll affect it or not
 

615
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,410
don't know if it'll affect it or not
probably not okay there we go

616
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:46,420
probably not okay there we go
 

617
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,410
probably not okay there we go
put the B's in there too so now if we

618
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:49,420
put the B's in there too so now if we
 

619
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,920
put the B's in there too so now if we
break the fence okay so it looks like

620
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:54,930
break the fence okay so it looks like
 

621
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,540
break the fence okay so it looks like
yeah they turned into item entities most

622
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:57,550
yeah they turned into item entities most
 

623
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,780
yeah they turned into item entities most
of them probably one of them fell on top

624
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:00,790
of them probably one of them fell on top
 

625
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,140
of them probably one of them fell on top
of the concrete block and there only one

626
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,150
of the concrete block and there only one
 

627
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,070
of the concrete block and there only one
turned into concrete itself I got

628
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,080
turned into concrete itself I got
 

629
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,780
turned into concrete itself I got
another one for you here this one's a

630
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:09,790
another one for you here this one's a
 

631
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,480
another one for you here this one's a
really weird one so we're gonna have

632
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:12,490
really weird one so we're gonna have
 

633
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,680
really weird one so we're gonna have
floating concrete powder oh you know I

634
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:16,690
floating concrete powder oh you know I
 

635
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,330
floating concrete powder oh you know I
should put this back one more block

636
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,340
should put this back one more block
 

637
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,060
should put this back one more block
yeah floating concrete powder we're

638
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,070
yeah floating concrete powder we're
 

639
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,550
yeah floating concrete powder we're
gonna run water underneath it's right so

640
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:23,560
gonna run water underneath it's right so
 

641
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,760
gonna run water underneath it's right so
the water's gonna update it so it falls

642
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:25,770
the water's gonna update it so it falls
 

643
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,920
the water's gonna update it so it falls
but it's also gonna touch the block so

644
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:28,930
but it's also gonna touch the block so
 

645
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,990
but it's also gonna touch the block so
what happens first does it fall or does

646
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,000
what happens first does it fall or does
 

647
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,570
what happens first does it fall or does
it convert we're gonna find out if it's

648
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:33,580
it convert we're gonna find out if it's
 

649
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,240
it convert we're gonna find out if it's
if it falls it should turn into

650
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,250
if it falls it should turn into
 

651
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,790
if it falls it should turn into
concrete's one block lower if it just

652
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
concrete's one block lower if it just
 

653
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,380
concrete's one block lower if it just
converts it should stay in the same

654
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:40,390
converts it should stay in the same
 

655
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:50,250
converts it should stay in the same
place I think it fell and converted

656
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:50,260
place I think it fell and converted
 

657
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,340
place I think it fell and converted
right I expected them both to go but I

658
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,350
right I expected them both to go but I
 

659
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,490
right I expected them both to go but I
guess it converted before the water went

660
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:56,500
guess it converted before the water went
 

661
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,060
guess it converted before the water went
any further

662
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,070
any further
 

663
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,020
any further
right now there's also a little bit of

664
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,030
right now there's also a little bit of
 

665
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,090
right now there's also a little bit of
an oddity with this so if we put a water

666
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:03,100
an oddity with this so if we put a water
 

667
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,920
an oddity with this so if we put a water
source block below it

668
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:04,930
source block below it
 

669
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,790
source block below it
check out what happens it almost looks

670
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
check out what happens it almost looks
 

671
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,290
check out what happens it almost looks
like it teleports but maybe it's this

672
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:10,300
like it teleports but maybe it's this
 

673
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,290
like it teleports but maybe it's this
falling very quickly but it it destroys

674
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:13,300
falling very quickly but it it destroys
 

675
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
falling very quickly but it it destroys
the water block without turning into

676
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,310
the water block without turning into
 

677
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,570
the water block without turning into
concrete it's still the powder form

678
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:17,580
concrete it's still the powder form
 

679
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,660
concrete it's still the powder form
which is kind of cool but I bet you I

680
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:21,670
which is kind of cool but I bet you I
 

681
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,960
which is kind of cool but I bet you I
bet you if we remove the block below

682
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:24,970
bet you if we remove the block below
 

683
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,470
bet you if we remove the block below
it'll be difference right

684
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,480
it'll be difference right
 

685
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,760
it'll be difference right
okay so let's not put the glass block

686
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:29,770
okay so let's not put the glass block
 

687
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,190
okay so let's not put the glass block
back over here where it was and then we

688
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,200
back over here where it was and then we
 

689
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,150
back over here where it was and then we
will put the water over here

690
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160

 

691
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,420

how does it destroy it then it should

692
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:40,430
how does it destroy it then it should
 

693
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,430
how does it destroy it then it should
fall through the water source block huh

694
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
fall through the water source block huh
 

695
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,180
fall through the water source block huh
that I did not expect okay are you ready

696
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,190
that I did not expect okay are you ready
 

697
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,250
that I did not expect okay are you ready
for this guys we're gonna do some sponge

698
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,260
for this guys we're gonna do some sponge
 

699
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,210
for this guys we're gonna do some sponge
physics next so if you have a sponge you

700
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,220
physics next so if you have a sponge you
 

701
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,900
physics next so if you have a sponge you
place the water bucket next to it turns

702
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:58,910
place the water bucket next to it turns
 

703
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,630
place the water bucket next to it turns
into a wet sponge right so it happens if

704
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:01,640
into a wet sponge right so it happens if
 

705
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,000
into a wet sponge right so it happens if
you place it by a sponge and also by a

706
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,010
you place it by a sponge and also by a
 

707
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,329
you place it by a sponge and also by a
concrete block you see where I'm going

708
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:07,339
concrete block you see where I'm going
 

709
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:08,889
concrete block you see where I'm going
with this not concrete block concrete

710
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:08,899
with this not concrete block concrete
 

711
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,800
with this not concrete block concrete
powder that's concrete powder we're

712
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:11,810
powder that's concrete powder we're
 

713
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,850
powder that's concrete powder we're
gonna put it right between the two it

714
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:15,860
gonna put it right between the two it
 

715
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,710
gonna put it right between the two it
does both so that turned to concrete and

716
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:17,720
does both so that turned to concrete and
 

717
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,610
does both so that turned to concrete and
it the sponge absorbed it's okay where

718
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:21,620
it the sponge absorbed it's okay where
 

719
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,710
it the sponge absorbed it's okay where
was that sponge it was over here right I

720
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:23,720
was that sponge it was over here right I
 

721
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,230
was that sponge it was over here right I
think I think it might be positional cuz

722
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
think I think it might be positional cuz
 

723
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,980
think I think it might be positional cuz
if we have a sponge here and we place

724
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:29,990
if we have a sponge here and we place
 

725
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,579
if we have a sponge here and we place
the water turns into a wet sponge these

726
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:33,589
the water turns into a wet sponge these
 

727
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,650
the water turns into a wet sponge these
don't convert though if we do the same

728
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:35,660
don't convert though if we do the same
 

729
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,569
don't convert though if we do the same
over here two of them converted one of

730
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:40,579
over here two of them converted one of
 

731
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,340
over here two of them converted one of
them did it yes so it's definitely based

732
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,350
them did it yes so it's definitely based
 

733
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,380
them did it yes so it's definitely based
on where it is in the chunk I'm pretty

734
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,390
on where it is in the chunk I'm pretty
 

735
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:50,230
on where it is in the chunk I'm pretty
sure probably the greatest thing about

736
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
sure probably the greatest thing about
 

737
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,180
sure probably the greatest thing about
having all these different brights

738
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,190
having all these different brights
 

739
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,500
having all these different brights
colors though is we can finally juggle

740
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:56,510
colors though is we can finally juggle
 

741
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:03,550
colors though is we can finally juggle
the proper way there we go so many

742
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:03,560
the proper way there we go so many
 

743
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:10,980
the proper way there we go so many
colors that's amazing

744
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:10,990

 

745
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,610

unfortunately though it doesn't last

746
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:12,620
unfortunately though it doesn't last
 

747
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,079
unfortunately though it doesn't last
forever anyways guys I think we're gonna

748
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,089
forever anyways guys I think we're gonna
 

749
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,179
forever anyways guys I think we're gonna
have to wrap up the episode here for

750
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:19,189
have to wrap up the episode here for
 

751
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,790
have to wrap up the episode here for
today unfortunately I don't know how or

752
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:21,800
today unfortunately I don't know how or
 

753
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,280
today unfortunately I don't know how or
why but I strained my voice recording

754
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,290
why but I strained my voice recording
 

755
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,390
why but I strained my voice recording
here like I can really feel it now and I

756
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
here like I can really feel it now and I
 

757
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,180
here like I can really feel it now and I
probably shouldn't talk anymore having a

758
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,190
probably shouldn't talk anymore having a
 

759
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,850
probably shouldn't talk anymore having a
hard time and unseating words too and

760
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:33,860
hard time and unseating words too and
 

761
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,350
hard time and unseating words too and
then okay so here's the comment of the

762
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,360
then okay so here's the comment of the
 

763
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,419
then okay so here's the comment of the
day it says raise your hand if you

764
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:40,429
day it says raise your hand if you
 

765
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,490
day it says raise your hand if you
didn't know mushrooms could even be used

766
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:42,500
didn't know mushrooms could even be used
 

767
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,690
didn't know mushrooms could even be used
as fuel I think it was a maybe one or

768
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:46,700
as fuel I think it was a maybe one or
 

769
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,730
as fuel I think it was a maybe one or
two updates ago Mojang

770
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:48,740
two updates ago Mojang
 

771
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,990
two updates ago Mojang
maybe even longer but Mojang recently

772
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
maybe even longer but Mojang recently
 

773
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,310
maybe even longer but Mojang recently
changed it so you can burn a whole bunch

774
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
changed it so you can burn a whole bunch
 

775
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,779
changed it so you can burn a whole bunch
of different things in the furnace

776
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:55,789
of different things in the furnace
 

777
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,940
of different things in the furnace
including like wall and banners and some

in Pocket Edition though I found out the

792
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,210
in Pocket Edition though I found out the
 

793
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,919
in Pocket Edition though I found out the
slabs have the same fuel efficiency as

794
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:22,929
slabs have the same fuel efficiency as
 

795
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:25,720
slabs have the same fuel efficiency as
planks so you should definitely convert

796
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:25,730
planks so you should definitely convert
 

797
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,080
