that's one thing you don't want to ever

10
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
that's one thing you don't want to ever
 

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,390
that's one thing you don't want to ever
see in your wiring

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400

 

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,509

so i started working on

14
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
so i started working on
 

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,669
so i started working on
the furnace room while i was watching a

16
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
the furnace room while i was watching a
 

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,990
the furnace room while i was watching a
video and i realized

18
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
video and i realized
 

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,510
video and i realized
like without even realizing it i was

20
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
like without even realizing it i was
 

21
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,430
like without even realizing it i was
working on it and i

22
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
working on it and i
 

23
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,069
working on it and i
sort of stopped myself because i was

24
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
sort of stopped myself because i was
 

25
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,110
sort of stopped myself because i was
supposed to do this

26
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
supposed to do this
 

27
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,910
supposed to do this
while recording but i was working on

28
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
while recording but i was working on
 

29
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,709
while recording but i was working on
this arch

30
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
this arch
 

31
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,270
this arch
just want to see what this looks like

32
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280

 

33
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,189

and do the same over here

34
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199

 

35
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,110

get rid of this i don't know if i want

36
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
get rid of this i don't know if i want
 

37
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,110
get rid of this i don't know if i want
to keep this room it was like this room

38
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
to keep this room it was like this room
 

39
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,110
to keep this room it was like this room
wasn't supposed to be square but it's

40
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
wasn't supposed to be square but it's
 

41
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,470
wasn't supposed to be square but it's
starting to turn very squarish or

42
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
starting to turn very squarish or
 

43
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,149
starting to turn very squarish or
rectanglish

44
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159

 

45
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,950

not sure if that's good or bad

46
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960

 

47
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,590

put that there

48
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600

 

49
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,149

uh-huh that's a nice uh that's a nice

50
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
uh-huh that's a nice uh that's a nice
 

51
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,749
uh-huh that's a nice uh that's a nice
entrance to it

52
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
entrance to it
 

53
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,590
entrance to it
i like how it's open this room

54
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
i like how it's open this room
 

55
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,710
i like how it's open this room
is probably one of my favorites i've

56
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
is probably one of my favorites i've
 

57
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,070
is probably one of my favorites i've
ever made to be honest

58
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
ever made to be honest
 

59
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,030
ever made to be honest
the storage room

60
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040

 

61
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,950

and this one is very similar to it so i

62
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
and this one is very similar to it so i
 

63
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,789
and this one is very similar to it so i
like it a lot

64
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
like it a lot
 

65
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,389
like it a lot
as well uh what did i want to do

66
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399

 

67
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,590

i should have planned things a little

68
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
i should have planned things a little
 

69
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,749
i should have planned things a little
better before i started i guess

70
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
better before i started i guess
 

71
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,350
better before i started i guess
well i'll show these working um

72
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
well i'll show these working um
 

73
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,350
well i'll show these working um
had some feedback on them people said i

74
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
had some feedback on them people said i
 

75
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,510
had some feedback on them people said i
should try lava behind

76
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
should try lava behind
 

77
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,590
should try lava behind
the iron instead of the leaves

78
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
the iron instead of the leaves
 

79
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,950
the iron instead of the leaves
i'm happy with the leaves i'm going to

80
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
i'm happy with the leaves i'm going to
 

81
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,709
i'm happy with the leaves i'm going to
leave it as the leaves

82
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
leave it as the leaves
 

83
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,469
leave it as the leaves
and also people suggested i should

84
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
and also people suggested i should
 

85
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,030
and also people suggested i should
invert these so

86
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
invert these so
 

87
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,790
invert these so
they're on by default and off when

88
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
they're on by default and off when
 

89
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,469
they're on by default and off when
they're cutting but

90
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
they're cutting but
 

91
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,550
they're cutting but
i don't know it just seems seems wrong

92
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
i don't know it just seems seems wrong
 

93
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,390
i don't know it just seems seems wrong
to do it that way

94
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400

 

95
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,110

so i'll keep it like that as well i

96
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
so i'll keep it like that as well i
 

97
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,470
so i'll keep it like that as well i
i'm gonna try to put a piston door here

98
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
i'm gonna try to put a piston door here
 

99
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,110
i'm gonna try to put a piston door here
wait i remember if i decide if i want to

100
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
wait i remember if i decide if i want to
 

101
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,470
wait i remember if i decide if i want to
keep it like that

102
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480

 

103
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,550

yeah we probably can i'm gonna try to

104
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
yeah we probably can i'm gonna try to
 

105
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,229
yeah we probably can i'm gonna try to
put a piston door here

106
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
put a piston door here
 

107
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,350
put a piston door here
just a one a one wide by two high

108
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
just a one a one wide by two high
 

109
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,630
just a one a one wide by two high
type door

110
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640

 

111
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,390

these will squish together and hopefully

112
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
these will squish together and hopefully
 

113
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,150
these will squish together and hopefully
i have enough room to do the wiring for

114
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
i have enough room to do the wiring for
 

115
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,509
i have enough room to do the wiring for
this

116
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
this
 

117
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,470
this
she i might not hmm

118
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480

 

119
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,270

well that shouldn't power it

120
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280

 

121
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,509

i don't i'll try and make it work give

122
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
i don't i'll try and make it work give
 

123
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,869
i don't i'll try and make it work give
me a minute

124
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
me a minute
 

125
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,270
me a minute
i don't know guys there's really not

126
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
i don't know guys there's really not
 

127
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,630
i don't know guys there's really not
much room back here

128
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
much room back here
 

129
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,630
much room back here
so we're just gonna do the iron door i

130
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
so we're just gonna do the iron door i
 

131
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,869
so we're just gonna do the iron door i
think because we can't put anything next

132
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
think because we can't put anything next
 

133
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,830
think because we can't put anything next
to this piston

134
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
to this piston
 

135
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,190
to this piston
and we can't we got the wire right above

136
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
and we can't we got the wire right above
 

137
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,270
and we can't we got the wire right above
there so

138
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
there so
 

139
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:28,390
there so
instead we are going to do an iron door

140
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400

 

141
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,430

how does it look if we flip it

142
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
how does it look if we flip it
 

143
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,630
how does it look if we flip it
and that

144
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640

 

145
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,509

and this

146
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519

 

147
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,550

sure why not we will put

148
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
sure why not we will put
 

149
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,390
sure why not we will put
a button out here and one on the other

150
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
a button out here and one on the other
 

151
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,670
a button out here and one on the other
side i hate using buttons for doors but

152
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680

 

153
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,830

and there

154
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
and there
 

155
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,070
and there
maybe

156
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080

 

157
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,509

no why am i using a button i want to use

158
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
no why am i using a button i want to use
 

159
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,030
no why am i using a button i want to use
a pressure plate

160
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040

 

161
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,309

or at least on one side we can we could

162
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
or at least on one side we can we could
 

163
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,270
or at least on one side we can we could
here if we

164
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
here if we
 

165
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,390
here if we
switched this

166
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400

 

167
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,909

i don't know i i don't really plan on

168
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
i don't know i i don't really plan on
 

169
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,830
i don't know i i don't really plan on
coming back here ever

170
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
coming back here ever
 

171
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,590
coming back here ever
or often but i do want an access way to

172
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
or often but i do want an access way to
 

173
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,990
or often but i do want an access way to
get back

174
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000

175
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,430
get back
there somewhere okay

176
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
there somewhere okay
 

177
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,270
there somewhere okay
um

178
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280

 

179
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,710

i i don't know which one i'm going to

180
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
i i don't know which one i'm going to
 

181
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,150
i i don't know which one i'm going to
use uh i'll think about it for a sec

182
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
use uh i'll think about it for a sec
 

183
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,030
use uh i'll think about it for a sec
this here should we

184
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040

 

185
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,350

should we do stairs or should we do full

186
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
should we do stairs or should we do full
 

187
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,590
should we do stairs or should we do full
blocks

188
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
blocks
 

189
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,270
blocks
we'll try full blocks first

190
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
we'll try full blocks first
 

191
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,070
we'll try full blocks first
okay if we do stairs

192
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
okay if we do stairs
 

193
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,430
okay if we do stairs
we can see more of this archway

194
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
we can see more of this archway
 

195
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,510
we can see more of this archway
but it might be too much of a

196
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
but it might be too much of a
 

197
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,670
but it might be too much of a
ripple effect going on here

198
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680

 

199
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,790

oh no that's not too bad

200
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800

 

201
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,909

and this would continue

202
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919

 

203
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,150

so i hope you guys are enjoying the huge

204
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
so i hope you guys are enjoying the huge
 

205
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,950
so i hope you guys are enjoying the huge
series

206
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
series
 

207
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,390
series
uh we're uploading those every second

208
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
uh we're uploading those every second
 

209
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,510
uh we're uploading those every second
day

210
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
day
 

211
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,790
day
and uh

212
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800

 

213
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,749

it's a tough map man it was or it is

214
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
it's a tough map man it was or it is
 

215
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,029
it's a tough map man it was or it is
we're not done it

216
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
we're not done it
 

217
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,110
we're not done it
we're definitely not done it but yeah

218
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
we're definitely not done it but yeah
 

219
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,710
we're definitely not done it but yeah
it's tough

220
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720

 

221
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,870

um mostly because he doesn't give you

222
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
um mostly because he doesn't give you
 

223
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,469
um mostly because he doesn't give you
stuff and we didn't take the time to

224
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
stuff and we didn't take the time to
 

225
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,430
stuff and we didn't take the time to
farm

226
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
farm
 

227
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,550
farm
anything really at the beginning

228
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560

 

229
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,469

okay

230
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479

 

231
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,189

all right now the window hmm

232
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
all right now the window hmm
 

233
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,150
all right now the window hmm
what should we do with the window

234
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160

 

235
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,430

well let's try to figure out how we're

236
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
well let's try to figure out how we're
 

237
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,350
well let's try to figure out how we're
going to join this to this next wall

238
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
going to join this to this next wall
 

239
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,189
going to join this to this next wall
see the thing i'm concerned about is we

240
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
see the thing i'm concerned about is we
 

241
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,309
see the thing i'm concerned about is we
got the the nice stone look on this side

242
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
got the the nice stone look on this side
 

243
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,390
got the the nice stone look on this side
but we don't

244
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400

 

245
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,510

like it's only one wide so if we make it

246
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
like it's only one wide so if we make it
 

247
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,550
like it's only one wide so if we make it
stone brick

248
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
stone brick
 

249
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,150
stone brick
it's gonna be stone brick on outside and

250
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
it's gonna be stone brick on outside and
 

251
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,590
it's gonna be stone brick on outside and
it'll look weird

252
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
it'll look weird
 

253
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,830
it'll look weird
if we make this thicker

254
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840

 

255
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,830

it's one option

256
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

257
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,350

although and remember i'm just putting

258
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
although and remember i'm just putting
 

259
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,110
although and remember i'm just putting
the sh i'm figuring out the shape of

260
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
the sh i'm figuring out the shape of
 

261
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,270
the sh i'm figuring out the shape of
things first then we will come

262
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
things first then we will come
 

263
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,350
things first then we will come
through here and try use different

264
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
through here and try use different
 

265
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,029
through here and try use different
blocks to add texture

266
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039

 

267
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,469

so we could do that uh it really makes

268
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
so we could do that uh it really makes
 

269
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,270
so we could do that uh it really makes
it stand out now

270
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280

 

271
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,309

um and it does block the view a little

272
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
um and it does block the view a little
 

273
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,189
um and it does block the view a little
bit

274
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199

 

275
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,309

that way we could have it two different

276
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
that way we could have it two different
 

277
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,110
that way we could have it two different
types of blocks

278
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120

 

279
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,749

and then we could put a chest a thing of

280
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
and then we could put a chest a thing of
 

281
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,830
and then we could put a chest a thing of
chests here like a column of them

282
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
chests here like a column of them
 

283
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:37,589
chests here like a column of them
for the blaze rods

284
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599

 

285
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,110

what to do what to do i don't know

286
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
what to do what to do i don't know
 

287
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,110
what to do what to do i don't know
this is another option it opens it up

288
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
this is another option it opens it up
 

289
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,629
this is another option it opens it up
some more

290
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
some more
 

291
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,390
some more
helps to highlight it

292
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400

 

293
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,350

let's try this

294
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360

 

295
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,990

no i liked it the other way more

296
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000

 

297
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,070

or do i that doesn't look bad either

298
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
or do i that doesn't look bad either
 

299
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,309
or do i that doesn't look bad either
um one thing i don't like about this

300
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
um one thing i don't like about this
 

301
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,309
um one thing i don't like about this
though

302
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
though
 

303
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,909
though
because we normally have the furnace

304
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
because we normally have the furnace
 

305
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,430
because we normally have the furnace
flush with the wall

306
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
flush with the wall
 

307
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,510
flush with the wall
and on this side the wall would be right

308
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
and on this side the wall would be right
 

309
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,270
and on this side the wall would be right
here

310
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
here
 

311
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:25,189
here
it should be more like that

312
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199

 

313
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,510

but then this side doesn't really work

314
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
but then this side doesn't really work
 

315
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,990
but then this side doesn't really work
unless we take this back further

316
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000

 

317
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,709

and i tried adding something like this

318
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
and i tried adding something like this
 

319
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,990
and i tried adding something like this
but it's not going to work

320
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
but it's not going to work
 

321
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,829
but it's not going to work
we can't get rid of these blocks here

322
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
we can't get rid of these blocks here
 

323
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,070
we can't get rid of these blocks here
we need them

324
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080

 

325
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,509

i tried this too not liking it either

326
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519

 

327
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,350

i'm still having trouble with this i

328
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
i'm still having trouble with this i
 

329
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,870
i'm still having trouble with this i
think i know the reason

330
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
think i know the reason
 

331
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,750
think i know the reason
i need this to go back one more block

332
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
i need this to go back one more block
 

333
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,630
i need this to go back one more block
and then this would be really easy

334
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
and then this would be really easy
 

335
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,030
and then this would be really easy
but i'm not going to do that it's

336
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
but i'm not going to do that it's
 

337
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,829
but i'm not going to do that it's
already

338
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
already
 

339
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,910
already
pretty close to the bridge and i don't

340
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
pretty close to the bridge and i don't
 

341
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,389
pretty close to the bridge and i don't
want to bring it in a block

342
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
want to bring it in a block
 

343
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,949
want to bring it in a block
so we'll just we'll just make it or try

344
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
so we'll just we'll just make it or try
 

345
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,949
so we'll just we'll just make it or try
and make it work like this

346
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
and make it work like this
 

347
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,030
and make it work like this
i just want to see how to look if we put

348
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
i just want to see how to look if we put
 

349

ah whatever see another trick we could

369
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,190
do
is i'm sure we could

370
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200

 

371
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,470

i just like that

373
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,750

would be weird um

374
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
would be weird um
 

375
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
would be weird um
like for example we could

451
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,310
we're at 9 or 10 whatever then
this corner again we're pretty light the

452
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
this corner again we're pretty light the
 

453
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,110
this corner again we're pretty light the
only real dark spot

454
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
only real dark spot
 

455
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,790
only real dark spot
is this corner

456
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
is this corner
 

457
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,750
is this corner
drops down to five that's pretty bad we

458
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
drops down to five that's pretty bad we
 

459
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,750
drops down to five that's pretty bad we
could hide some

460
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
could hide some
 

461
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,750
could hide some
dim lighting in this corner and it would

462
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
dim lighting in this corner and it would
 

463
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,509
dim lighting in this corner and it would
work out okay i think

464
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519

 

465
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,310

uh this is probably eight i'm gonna go

466
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
uh this is probably eight i'm gonna go
 

467
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,790
uh this is probably eight i'm gonna go
down

468
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
down
 

469
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,030

471
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,550

yeah if we hide dim lighting it'll be

472
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
yeah if we hide dim lighting it'll be
 

473
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,230
yeah if we hide dim lighting it'll be
okay and then

474
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
okay and then
 

475
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,910
okay and then
this i think i'm going to leave these

476
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
this i think i'm going to leave these
 

477
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,509
this i think i'm going to leave these
two in as my

wait a minute if that shows me when the

484
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
wait a minute if that shows me when the
 

485
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:19,990
wait a minute if that shows me when the

furnaces are all done
 

487
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,069

the master these two these two all
 

515
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,670
the master these two these two all
invert so they're off most the time and

there we'll put pumpkins below

654
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
there we'll put pumpkins below
 

655
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,150

and that'll take care of the walkway no

656
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
and that'll take care of the walkway no
 

657

problem

658
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
problem
 

659
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,230
problem
so even if these are off it'll still be

660
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
so even if these are off it'll still be
 

661
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,510
so even if these are off it'll still be
bright enough here

662
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
bright enough here
 

663
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,950
bright enough here
so that mobs won't spawn

664
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960

 

665
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,150

and it will look decent because it's got

666
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
and it will look decent because it's got
 

667
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,110
and it will look decent because it's got
the wood texture

668
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120

 

669
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,270

you can see we have like a a ring of
 

679
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,510
you can see we have like a a ring of
light going all the way around the walls

680
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
light going all the way around the walls
 

681
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,430
light going all the way around the walls

685
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,990

uh maybe let's mess around with the

686
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
uh maybe let's mess around with the
 

687
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,230
uh maybe let's mess around with the
noteblocks real quick here

688
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
noteblocks real quick here
 

689
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,909
noteblocks real quick here

happen like it's
 

813
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,070

i should try to increase that but it's
difficult

822
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
difficult
 

823
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,669
difficult
unless i do shorter

824
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
unless i do shorter
 

825
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,390
unless i do shorter
and shorter episodes and i'm trying to

826
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400

a lot easier
and more frequent

836
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640

 

837
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,470

with this project it's perfect because

838
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
with this project it's perfect because
 

839
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,149
with this project it's perfect because
it's it's a small project

840
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
it's it's a small project
 

841
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,470
it's it's a small project
and there's lots of variation to it so

842
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
and there's lots of variation to it so
 

843
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,310
and there's lots of variation to it so
you know it doesn't get repetitive quick

844
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
you know it doesn't get repetitive quick
 

845
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,669
you know it doesn't get repetitive quick
there's once you do something it's

846

847
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,190
there's once you do something it's
you know you start something else pretty

848
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
you know you start something else pretty
 

849
