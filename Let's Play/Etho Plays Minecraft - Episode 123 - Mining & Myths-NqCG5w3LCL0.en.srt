you're looking for diamonds and you

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:38,489
you're looking for diamonds and you
 

19
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,000
you're looking for diamonds and you
would blow through your diamond pickaxe

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,010
would blow through your diamond pickaxe
 

21
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,680
would blow through your diamond pickaxe
looking for diamonds faster than you

absolutely absolutely garbage but I ran

26
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:51,539
absolutely absolutely garbage but I ran
 

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,029
absolutely absolutely garbage but I ran
out of redstone the other day so I

28
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
out of redstone the other day so I
 

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,250
out of redstone the other day so I
figured I'd had to do something about it

30
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,260
figured I'd had to do something about it
 

31
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,790
figured I'd had to do something about it
and really these days shaft mining isn't

00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
and really these days shaft mining isn't
 

33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,119

00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:19,950
to last a long time the mining is going
 

45
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,820
to last a long time the mining is going
to go fast and not only that I got a

to go fast and not only that I got a
 

47
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,630
to go fast and not only that I got a

I've mined a shaft like this about a

54
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
I've mined a shaft like this about a
 

55
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,170
I've mined a shaft like this about a
thousand blocks and in total I got about

56
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,180
thousand blocks and in total I got about
 

57
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,440
thousand blocks and in total I got about
40 diamonds from that it was crazy 40

58
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,450
40 diamonds from that it was crazy 40

diamonds I think about eight stacks of
 

61
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,230
diamonds I think about eight stacks of
redstone just from going a thousand

what's going on but again I'm having

00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:57,689
what's going on but again I'm having
 

67
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,350
what's going on but again I'm having
pretty good success here found some more

68
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,360
pretty good success here found some more
 

69
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,920
pretty good success here found some more
diamonds found a ton of redstone here

70
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:05,930
diamonds found a ton of redstone here
 

71
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,900
diamonds found a ton of redstone here
finally have some diamonds guys

72
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:08,910
finally have some diamonds guys
 

73
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,030
finally have some diamonds guys
that was really bugging me before I

74
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,040
that was really bugging me before I
 

75
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,020
that was really bugging me before I
could not find any but now I'm I should

76
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,030
could not find any but now I'm I should
 

77
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,960
could not find any but now I'm I should
be good for a long time especially if I

78
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:17,970
be good for a long time especially if I
 

79
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:28,480
be good for a long time especially if I
continue shaft mining here yes that's it

80
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,490
continue shaft mining here yes that's it
 

81
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,270
continue shaft mining here yes that's it
so before I start mining here I decide I

82
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,280
so before I start mining here I decide I
 

83
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,430
so before I start mining here I decide I
should figure out what the best tide is

84
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
should figure out what the best tide is
 

85
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,690
should figure out what the best tide is
to define diamonds in redstone so I did

86
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:38,700
to define diamonds in redstone so I did
 

87
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,240
to define diamonds in redstone so I did
a little research on on that because I

88
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,250
a little research on on that because I
 

89
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,730
a little research on on that because I
think recently I think in the 1.0.0

all compared so the other day I created
 

109
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,910
all compared so the other day I created
a new test world and I used mcedit to

110
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
a new test world and I used mcedit to
 

111
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,500
a new test world and I used mcedit to

this but this is what I found this is
 

121
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,520
this but this is what I found this is

think this is two blocks below the lava

140
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:08,459
think this is two blocks below the lava
 

141
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,380
think this is two blocks below the lava
level so when you're digging there's a

142
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,390

143
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,530
level so when you're digging there's a
good chance you're going to run to big

144
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:15,540
good chance you're going to run to big
 

145
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,020
good chance you're going to run to big
lava pools and if you're not careful you

things in this game that I've been
 

245
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,560
things in this game that I've been
wondering about and we're going to check

246

wondering about and we're going to check
 

247
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,180
wondering about and we're going to check
whether or not they're true or not

whether or not they're true or not
 

249

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,760
anyway so it doesn't matter but I'm
worried it's wrecking my armor by eating

320
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:13,770
worried it's wrecking my armor by eating
 

321
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,710
worried it's wrecking my armor by eating
these so the best way of testing this

322
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
these so the best way of testing this
 

323
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,780
these so the best way of testing this
please probably just get a fresh suit of

324
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,790
please probably just get a fresh suit of
 

325
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,180
please probably just get a fresh suit of
armor on it has no damage bar on and

326
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,190
armor on it has no damage bar on and
 

327
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,950
armor on it has no damage bar on and
then if I eat one and there's a damage

328
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:27,960
then if I eat one and there's a damage
 

329
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:36,080
then if I eat one and there's a damage
bar on the armor after then Armour is

330
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,090
bar on the armor after then Armour is
 

331
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,850
bar on the armor after then Armour is
blocking damage it's not blocking damage

332
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:37,860
blocking damage it's not blocking damage
 

333
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,810
blocking damage it's not blocking damage
from the poison okay so that's one thing

334
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:41,820
from the poison okay so that's one thing
 

335
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,470
from the poison okay so that's one thing
it doesn't work against let's try

336
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
it doesn't work against let's try
 

337
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,580
it doesn't work against let's try
suffocation this is just just some

338
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:49,590
suffocation this is just just some
 

339
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,970
suffocation this is just just some
things I've been wondering about

340
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:51,980
things I've been wondering about
 

341
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,810
things I've been wondering about
probably common knowledge Hill here we

342
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:56,820
probably common knowledge Hill here we
 

343
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:05,660
probably common knowledge Hill here we
go yeah okay

344
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:05,670
go yeah okay
 

345
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,080
go yeah okay
so ooh jarring does a lot of damage

346
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,090
so ooh jarring does a lot of damage
 

347
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,070
so ooh jarring does a lot of damage
action that's taken full hearts away

348
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,080
action that's taken full hearts away
 

349
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,270
action that's taken full hearts away
yeah so that does not affect armor you

350
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,280
yeah so that does not affect armor you
 

351
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,120
yeah so that does not affect armor you
take full damage from drowning we should

352
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,130
take full damage from drowning we should
 

353
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:29,150
take full damage from drowning we should
try suffocation I got scared there let's

354
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,160
try suffocation I got scared there let's
 

355
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,610
try suffocation I got scared there let's
try that again

356
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:30,620
try that again
 

357
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:39,350
try that again
chickened out now that's as quick as

358
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
chickened out now that's as quick as
 

359
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,420
chickened out now that's as quick as
drowning was actually okay that doesn't

360
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,430
drowning was actually okay that doesn't
 

361
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,579
drowning was actually okay that doesn't
affect armor now let's see what else do

362
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:46,589
affect armor now let's see what else do
 

363
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:48,410
affect armor now let's see what else do
we have to test fall damage and fire

364
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,420
we have to test fall damage and fire
 

365
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,010
we have to test fall damage and fire
damage

366
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,020

 

367
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,860

hey Armour is still at full don't try

368
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:54,870
hey Armour is still at full don't try
 

369
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:02,210
hey Armour is still at full don't try
this at home kids be safe ouch that was

370
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,220
this at home kids be safe ouch that was
 

371
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,370
this at home kids be safe ouch that was
even that far yet okay does not block

372
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,380
even that far yet okay does not block
 

373
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,579
even that far yet okay does not block
fall damage that's for sure

374
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:09,589
fall damage that's for sure
 

375
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:15,910
fall damage that's for sure
one last thing the test is fire damage

376
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
one last thing the test is fire damage
 

377
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,200
one last thing the test is fire damage
this is kind of two parts actually

378
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,210
this is kind of two parts actually
 

379
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,450
this is kind of two parts actually
because I think yeah when you first

380
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:20,460
because I think yeah when you first
 

381
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,550
because I think yeah when you first
touch lava you take five hearts damage

382
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
touch lava you take five hearts damage
 

383
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,220
touch lava you take five hearts damage
if I remember right and then you can

384
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,230
if I remember right and then you can
 

385
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,130
if I remember right and then you can
catch on fire which does another type of

386
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,140
catch on fire which does another type of
 

387
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:40,420
catch on fire which does another type of
damage possibly yeah this is dangerous

388
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:40,430

 

389
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:54,350

hmm all that affected it doesn't do I

390
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,360
hmm all that affected it doesn't do I
 

391
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,530
hmm all that affected it doesn't do I
thought Lapidus damage did more click

392
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:57,540
thought Lapidus damage did more click
 

393
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
thought Lapidus damage did more click
away more hearts in that so when you

394
00:11:59,540 --> 00:11:59,550
away more hearts in that so when you
 

395
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,520
away more hearts in that so when you
first touch it

396
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,530
first touch it
 

397
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:07,850
first touch it
is not okay we're going to have to do

398
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:07,860
is not okay we're going to have to do
 

399
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,160
is not okay we're going to have to do
this a little differently then touching

400
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,170
this a little differently then touching
 

401
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,470
this a little differently then touching
lava does affect armor what about the

402
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
lava does affect armor what about the
 

403
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,110
lava does affect armor what about the
actual flame like when you catch on fire

404
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,120
actual flame like when you catch on fire
 

405
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,770
actual flame like when you catch on fire
we'll have to figure that out separately

406
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:21,780
we'll have to figure that out separately
 

407
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,660
we'll have to figure that out separately
I think we only really need to put boots

408
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:26,670
I think we only really need to put boots
 

409
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:33,080
I think we only really need to put boots
on or something okay so all I'll just

410
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,090
on or something okay so all I'll just
 

411
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,970
on or something okay so all I'll just
have them on the ground here touch the

412
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:37,980
have them on the ground here touch the
 

413
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,640
have them on the ground here touch the
lava then one on my fire I'll put the

414
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:40,650
lava then one on my fire I'll put the
 

415
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,090
lava then one on my fire I'll put the
boots on and see if it gets the damage

416
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,100
boots on and see if it gets the damage
 

417
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,550
boots on and see if it gets the damage
bar then you catch fire

418
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:51,560

 

419
00:12:51,560 --> 00:13:03,380

aerial well I'm going to die for science

420
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,390
aerial well I'm going to die for science
 

421
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,250
aerial well I'm going to die for science
let's check out our armor a date then

422
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,260
let's check out our armor a date then
 

423
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,200
let's check out our armor a date then
take damage from the actual flame of

424
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,210
take damage from the actual flame of
 

425
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,240
take damage from the actual flame of
being on fire but touching the lava did

426
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,250
being on fire but touching the lava did
 

427
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,520
being on fire but touching the lava did
cause it did absorb deborah touching the

428
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,530
cause it did absorb deborah touching the
 

429
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:22,850
cause it did absorb deborah touching the
lava did touching the lava did it affect

430
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:22,860
lava did touching the lava did it affect
 

431
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:31,280
lava did touching the lava did it affect
the armor yeah okay moving on yeah okay

432
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,290
the armor yeah okay moving on yeah okay
 

433
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,870
the armor yeah okay moving on yeah okay
so the next thing we're going to check

434
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
so the next thing we're going to check
 

435
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,840
so the next thing we're going to check
out here is whether or not we can have

436
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:35,850
out here is whether or not we can have
 

437
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,140
out here is whether or not we can have
our fall damage using a sword by

438
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,150
our fall damage using a sword by
 

439
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,450
our fall damage using a sword by
blocking with it I've heard a few

440
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,460
blocking with it I've heard a few
 

441
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,920
blocking with it I've heard a few
different things about this some people

442
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:42,930
different things about this some people
 

443
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,870
different things about this some people
say you can some people say you can't

444
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
say you can some people say you can't
 

445
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,270
say you can some people say you can't
I've had some people say you have to be

446
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,280
I've had some people say you have to be
 

447
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,850
I've had some people say you have to be
looking straight down for it to work ah

448
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:51,860

 

449
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,650

that last doing that seems a little

450
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:53,660
that last doing that seems a little
 

451
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,570
that last doing that seems a little
fishy I've been doing it recently though

452
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:55,580
fishy I've been doing it recently though
 

453
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,760
fishy I've been doing it recently though
just because that's what people have

454
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,770
just because that's what people have
 

455
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,760
just because that's what people have
said is it true or not though that's

456
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:00,770
said is it true or not though that's
 

457
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,020
said is it true or not though that's
what we need to find out and judging on

458
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,030
what we need to find out and judging on
 

459
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,200
what we need to find out and judging on
the fact that the armor doesn't block

460
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,210
the fact that the armor doesn't block
 

461
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,630
the fact that the armor doesn't block
fall damage I'm almost thinking the

462
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:10,640
fall damage I'm almost thinking the
 

463
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,240
fall damage I'm almost thinking the
sword doesn't either just just through

464
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,250
sword doesn't either just just through
 

465
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,410
sword doesn't either just just through
my Jess on it so we're just going to do

466
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:17,420
my Jess on it so we're just going to do
 

467
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,390
my Jess on it so we're just going to do
a straight fall here have no armor on

468
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,400
a straight fall here have no armor on
 

469
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,860
a straight fall here have no armor on
right now let's see how many hearts

470
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:20,870
right now let's see how many hearts
 

471
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,750
right now let's see how many hearts
damage I take just from walking forward

472
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:24,760
damage I take just from walking forward
 

473
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,870
damage I take just from walking forward
four okay now we're going to do it with

474
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
four okay now we're going to do it with
 

475
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,910
four okay now we're going to do it with
a sword

476
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
a sword
 

477
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,960
a sword
blocking same exact spot and we will try

478
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:37,970
blocking same exact spot and we will try
 

479
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,250
blocking same exact spot and we will try
first of all blocking facing forward and

480
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:41,260
first of all blocking facing forward and
 

481
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,570
first of all blocking facing forward and
if that doesn't work we'll try blocking

482
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:43,580
if that doesn't work we'll try blocking
 

483
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:50,500
if that doesn't work we'll try blocking
facing down dum-dum Oh health

484
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,510
facing down dum-dum Oh health
 

485
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,470
facing down dum-dum Oh health
regenerates so slowly so this should

486
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:53,480
regenerates so slowly so this should
 

487
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,900
regenerates so slowly so this should
give us two hearts damage if it actually

488
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:55,910
give us two hearts damage if it actually
 

489
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,720
give us two hearts damage if it actually
works

490
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:00,730

 

491
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,170

aha

492
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,180
aha
 

493
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,980
aha
does not work if it's facing forward at

494
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:05,990
does not work if it's facing forward at
 

495
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,760
does not work if it's facing forward at
least let's try facing down I've been

496
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:09,770
least let's try facing down I've been
 

497
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,310
least let's try facing down I've been
blocked in like an idiot this whole for

498
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
blocked in like an idiot this whole for
 

499
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,760
blocked in like an idiot this whole for
like a few weeks now oh well so I'm

500
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:18,770
like a few weeks now oh well so I'm
 

501
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,190
like a few weeks now oh well so I'm
guessing it doesn't block suffocation

502
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,200
guessing it doesn't block suffocation
 

503
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:29,130
guessing it doesn't block suffocation
poison fire damage and drowning either

504
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,140

 

505
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,340

probably just things that Armour effects

506
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:32,350
probably just things that Armour effects
 

507
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,830
probably just things that Armour effects
the sword effects as well if if I was to

508
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:35,840
the sword effects as well if if I was to
 

509
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,240
the sword effects as well if if I was to
guess maybe we'll try a few of those ok

510
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,250
guess maybe we'll try a few of those ok
 

511
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,250
guess maybe we'll try a few of those ok
facing straight down now four hearts so

512
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,260
facing straight down now four hearts so
 

513
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,200
facing straight down now four hearts so
no does not work that maybe let's try

514
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,210
no does not work that maybe let's try
 

515
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,390
no does not work that maybe let's try
drown ourselves

516
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:53,400
drown ourselves
 

517
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,269
drown ourselves
I really don't expect it to work though

518
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:58,279
I really don't expect it to work though
 

519
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,519
I really don't expect it to work though
so we were taking about one hearts every

520
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:01,529
so we were taking about one hearts every
 

521
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,519
so we were taking about one hearts every
drowning hit so let's see if this makes

522
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:04,529
drowning hit so let's see if this makes
 

523
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:13,090
drowning hit so let's see if this makes
it half a heart nope

524
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,100
it half a heart nope
 

525
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,150
it half a heart nope
yeah so it doesn't block drowning damage

526
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
yeah so it doesn't block drowning damage
 

527
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,290
yeah so it doesn't block drowning damage
pretty sure it doesn't block any of

528
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:18,300
pretty sure it doesn't block any of
 

529
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,829
pretty sure it doesn't block any of
those things

530
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:18,839
those things
 

531
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,800
those things
it'll probably block the labid damage so

532
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:21,810
it'll probably block the labid damage so
 

533
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,300
it'll probably block the labid damage so
like on contact

534
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,310
like on contact
 

535
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,500
like on contact
I almost almost want to try swimming

536
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:27,510
I almost almost want to try swimming
 

537
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,950
I almost almost want to try swimming
lava doing that but the flame will get

538
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:30,960
lava doing that but the flame will get
 

539
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:44,720
lava doing that but the flame will get
me anyway that seems to okay well took

540
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,730
me anyway that seems to okay well took
 

541
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,790
me anyway that seems to okay well took
it too far

542
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800

 

543
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,560

okay there was another thing I was going

544
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:54,570
okay there was another thing I was going
 

545
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,820
okay there was another thing I was going
to check out here I noticed like when I

546
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:58,830
to check out here I noticed like when I
 

547
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,980
to check out here I noticed like when I
enchant my armor it seems to wear out a

548
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:00,990
enchant my armor it seems to wear out a
 

549
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,560
enchant my armor it seems to wear out a
lot faster than when I don't enchant it

550
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,570
lot faster than when I don't enchant it
 

551
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,140
lot faster than when I don't enchant it
and I thought maybe that was a glitch

552
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,150
and I thought maybe that was a glitch
 

553
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,790
and I thought maybe that was a glitch
with the game like something wasn't

554
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:07,800
with the game like something wasn't
 

555
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,960
with the game like something wasn't
being calculated properly but I just

556
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,970
being calculated properly but I just
 

557
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,449
being calculated properly but I just
checked the wiki and I got my answer -

558
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:14,459
checked the wiki and I got my answer -
 

559
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,260
checked the wiki and I got my answer -
what's going on ah if you have armor

560
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,270
what's going on ah if you have armor
 

561
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,049
what's going on ah if you have armor
that has protection one on it protects

562
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:21,059
that has protection one on it protects
 

563
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:25,699
that has protection one on it protects
you against environmental hazards so I

564
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:25,709
you against environmental hazards so I
 

565
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,650
you against environmental hazards so I
think if I have this on it will protect

566
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:27,660
think if I have this on it will protect
 

567
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,260
think if I have this on it will protect
me from fall damage pretty sure normally

568
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,270
me from fall damage pretty sure normally
 

569
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,049
me from fall damage pretty sure normally
we take four hearts from this three and

570
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:36,059
we take four hearts from this three and
 

571
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:42,440
we take four hearts from this three and
a half Oh

572
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,450

 

573
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,210

oh that's that was unexpected it didn't

574
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,220
oh that's that was unexpected it didn't
 

575
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,310
oh that's that was unexpected it didn't
damage the armor even though it seemed

576
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,320
damage the armor even though it seemed
 

577
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,259
damage the armor even though it seemed
to protect me maybe it gives you the

578
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:54,269
to protect me maybe it gives you the
 

579
00:17:54,269 --> 00:18:00,169
to protect me maybe it gives you the
benefit without any any sacrifice that

580
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:00,179
benefit without any any sacrifice that
 

581
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,119
benefit without any any sacrifice that
would be cool let's try it one more time

582
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:04,129
would be cool let's try it one more time
 

583
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:06,619
would be cool let's try it one more time
we were taking four hearts damage from

584
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:06,629
we were taking four hearts damage from
 

585
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:13,070
we were taking four hearts damage from
this fall before three hearts still no

586
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,080
this fall before three hearts still no
 

587
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:20,830
this fall before three hearts still no
damage okay

588
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:20,840

 

589
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,180

okay ah as I'm expected the thing is

590
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,190
okay ah as I'm expected the thing is
 

591
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,310
okay ah as I'm expected the thing is
that doesn't explain why my armor seems

592
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
that doesn't explain why my armor seems
 

593
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,930
that doesn't explain why my armor seems
to be wearing out faster I thought it's

594
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:29,940
to be wearing out faster I thought it's
 

595
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,019
to be wearing out faster I thought it's
good it was absorbing environmental

596
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:33,029
good it was absorbing environmental
 

597
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,690
good it was absorbing environmental
damage and taking durability for that

598
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:35,700
damage and taking durability for that
 

599
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,549
damage and taking durability for that
but if it's not taking the your ability

600
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:37,559
but if it's not taking the your ability
 

601
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,419
but if it's not taking the your ability
even though it's giving me the benefit

602
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:40,429
even though it's giving me the benefit
 

603
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:47,239
even though it's giving me the benefit
I'm still confused okay so that kind of

604
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:47,249
I'm still confused okay so that kind of
 

605
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:50,930
I'm still confused okay so that kind of
blew my mind a little bit like I said I

606
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:50,940
blew my mind a little bit like I said I
 

607
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,039
blew my mind a little bit like I said I
haven't done a whole lot of vintage

608
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:52,049
haven't done a whole lot of vintage
 

609
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,539
haven't done a whole lot of vintage
handing yet pretty much the only thing

610
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:53,549
handing yet pretty much the only thing
 

611
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,139
handing yet pretty much the only thing
I've enchanted is pickaxes I haven't

612
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:57,149
I've enchanted is pickaxes I haven't
 

613
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,489
I've enchanted is pickaxes I haven't
really played around with the armor too

614
00:18:58,489 --> 00:18:58,499
really played around with the armor too
 

615
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:01,729
really played around with the armor too
much but I'm learning a lot here today

616
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:01,739
much but I'm learning a lot here today
 

617
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:05,359
much but I'm learning a lot here today
so I'm doing another test here again

618
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:05,369
so I'm doing another test here again
 

619
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,690
so I'm doing another test here again
kids don't do this at home this is being

620
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:08,700
kids don't do this at home this is being
 

621
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,849
kids don't do this at home this is being
done by that trained professional here I

622
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:10,859
done by that trained professional here I
 

623
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:18,379
done by that trained professional here I
know what I'm doing I got two pieces of

624
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:18,389
know what I'm doing I got two pieces of
 

625
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:21,080
know what I'm doing I got two pieces of
armor with blast protection on I'm

626
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,090
armor with blast protection on I'm
 

627
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,119
armor with blast protection on I'm
wondering if it's going to use up

628
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:23,129
wondering if it's going to use up
 

629
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,349
wondering if it's going to use up
durability if I blow myself up here

630
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:26,359
durability if I blow myself up here
 

631
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,609
durability if I blow myself up here
that's what we're testing out so I'm

632
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:28,619
that's what we're testing out so I'm
 

633
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,210
that's what we're testing out so I'm
going to go right to this corner here

634
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,220
going to go right to this corner here
 

635
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,340
going to go right to this corner here
after I detonate this and see what

636
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,350
after I detonate this and see what
 

637
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:45,859
after I detonate this and see what
happens so two hearts damage and it did

638
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:45,869
happens so two hearts damage and it did
 

639
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:50,570
happens so two hearts damage and it did
take durability I'm really confused now

640
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:50,580
take durability I'm really confused now
 

641
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,810
take durability I'm really confused now
because it really shouldn't have if the

642
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:53,820
because it really shouldn't have if the
 

643
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,580
because it really shouldn't have if the
protection stuff wasn't taking fall

644
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:55,590
protection stuff wasn't taking fall
 

645
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,960
protection stuff wasn't taking fall
damage

646
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:56,970
damage
 

647
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:02,640
damage
for durability huh my world is shaken

648
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:02,650
for durability huh my world is shaken
 

649
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:09,120
for durability huh my world is shaken
here nothing's making sense okay we're

650
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,130
here nothing's making sense okay we're
 

651
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,400
here nothing's making sense okay we're
going to do that same thing again this

652
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,410
going to do that same thing again this
 

653
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,080
going to do that same thing again this
time though I don't have any armor on I

654
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,090
time though I don't have any armor on I
 

655
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,390
time though I don't have any armor on I
just want to see how much those two

656
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,400
just want to see how much those two
 

657
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,990
just want to see how much those two
armor points helped protect me with the

658
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,000
armor points helped protect me with the
 

659
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,440
armor points helped protect me with the
with the blast protection if you see how

660
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,450
with the blast protection if you see how
 

661
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,760
with the blast protection if you see how
much it helps go to the exact same

662
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:26,770
much it helps go to the exact same
 

663
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:32,670
much it helps go to the exact same
position four hearts so it half the

664
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:32,680
position four hearts so it half the
 

665
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:42,060
position four hearts so it half the
damage huh Wow let's blow ourselves up

666
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,070
damage huh Wow let's blow ourselves up
 

667
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,510
damage huh Wow let's blow ourselves up
again here this time again I have no

668
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
again here this time again I have no
 

669
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,180
again here this time again I have no
armor on but I'm going to try block the

670
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,190
armor on but I'm going to try block the
 

671
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,950
armor on but I'm going to try block the
explosion with my sword to see if it

672
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:49,960
explosion with my sword to see if it
 

673
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,830
explosion with my sword to see if it
does anything because I kind of think it

674
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:52,840
does anything because I kind of think it
 

675
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,000
does anything because I kind of think it
does but I want to know for sure so we

676
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,010
does but I want to know for sure so we
 

677
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,420
does but I want to know for sure so we
should take two hearts damage from this

678
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,430
should take two hearts damage from this
 

679
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:07,280
should take two hearts damage from this
approximately same position yeah perfect

680
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,290

 

681
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,870

okay we're going to do a combo this time

682
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:09,880
okay we're going to do a combo this time
 

683
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,060
okay we're going to do a combo this time
got the the two pieces of blast

684
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,070
got the the two pieces of blast
 

685
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,540
got the the two pieces of blast
protection on so that half did before

686
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:15,550
protection on so that half did before
 

687
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,670
protection on so that half did before
and now we're going to also half it

688
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:17,680
and now we're going to also half it
 

689
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,010
and now we're going to also half it
again with our with our swords so we

690
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,020
again with our with our swords so we
 

691
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,980
again with our with our swords so we
should take I think one harder damage

692
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:24,990
should take I think one harder damage
 

693
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:34,140
should take I think one harder damage
same position perfect we're going to do

694
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,150
same position perfect we're going to do
 

695
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,130
same position perfect we're going to do
one final test here with the TNT says

696
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,140
one final test here with the TNT says
 

697
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,170
one final test here with the TNT says
moved on from Mythbusters episode two

698
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:40,180
moved on from Mythbusters episode two
 

699
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,510

etho fascinated with the new armor

700
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,520
etho fascinated with the new armor
 

701
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,090
etho fascinated with the new armor
system but the thing I want to check out

702
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,100
system but the thing I want to check out
 

703
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,840
system but the thing I want to check out
like normal armor or right now we have

704
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:51,850
like normal armor or right now we have
 

705
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,520
like normal armor or right now we have
two armor points out of ten and

706
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:55,530
two armor points out of ten and
 

707
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,530
two armor points out of ten and
according to wiki each of these reduces

708
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:58,540
according to wiki each of these reduces
 

709
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,140
according to wiki each of these reduces
damage by 8% so 10 would reduce by 80%

710
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,150
damage by 8% so 10 would reduce by 80%
 

711
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:10,820
damage by 8% so 10 would reduce by 80%
to here reduces damage we take by 16%

712
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,830

 

713
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,799

so without armor we took four hearts

714
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:13,809
so without armor we took four hearts
 

715
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,999
so without armor we took four hearts
damage with this blast protection stuff

716
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:17,009
damage with this blast protection stuff
 

717
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,749
damage with this blast protection stuff
we have that so I'm guessing that means

718
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:21,759
we have that so I'm guessing that means
 

719
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,810
we have that so I'm guessing that means
blast protection one is about three

720
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:24,820
blast protection one is about three
 

721
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,960
blast protection one is about three
times more effective than regular armor

722
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:27,970
times more effective than regular armor
 

723
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,009
times more effective than regular armor
if it's if it has an enchantment for for

724
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:32,019
if it's if it has an enchantment for for
 

725
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,539
if it's if it has an enchantment for for
protecting you against explosions

726
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:33,549
protecting you against explosions
 

727
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:37,470
protecting you against explosions
because that's about half two times 16

728
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:37,480
because that's about half two times 16
 

729
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,909
because that's about half two times 16
is 48 percent and that's that's the belt

730
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
is 48 percent and that's that's the belt
 

731
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,019
is 48 percent and that's that's the belt
what it was so right now we're going to

732
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:46,029
what it was so right now we're going to
 

733
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:49,739
what it was so right now we're going to
switch this out for regular armor and so

734
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:49,749
switch this out for regular armor and so
 

735
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:53,129
switch this out for regular armor and so
it will only be 16% and that means we

736
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:53,139
it will only be 16% and that means we
 

737
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,350
it will only be 16% and that means we
should take either three and a half to

738
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
should take either three and a half to
 

739
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,409
should take either three and a half to
three hearts damage if I if I use my

740
00:22:58,409 --> 00:22:58,419
three hearts damage if I if I use my
 

741
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,249
three hearts damage if I if I use my
calculator properly here just wanted

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:05,590
wanted confirmation go to the same
 

745
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:16,830
wanted confirmation go to the same
position why doesn't the world make

746
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:16,840
position why doesn't the world make
 

747
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,389
position why doesn't the world make
sense sometimes yeah I really don't know

754
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,330
is 48 I meant to say 3 times 16 is 48 48
 

755
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,139
is 48 I meant to say 3 times 16 is 48 48
percent anyway
