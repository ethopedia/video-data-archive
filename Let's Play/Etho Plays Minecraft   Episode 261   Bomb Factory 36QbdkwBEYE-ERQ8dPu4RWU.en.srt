performance issue and not everybody

18
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
performance issue and not everybody
 

19
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,790
performance issue and not everybody
experienced it i was

20
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
experienced it i was
 

21
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,710
experienced it i was
one person that was experiencing it

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
one person that was experiencing it
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,510
one person that was experiencing it
though i definitely noticed a

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
though i definitely noticed a
 

25
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,670
though i definitely noticed a
performance hit between 1.5 and 1.4.7

26
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
performance hit between 1.5 and 1.4.7
 

27
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,790
performance hit between 1.5 and 1.4.7
and now it seems to be really smooth

28
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
and now it seems to be really smooth
 

29
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,270
and now it seems to be really smooth
so that little bit of jitter is gone for

30
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
so that little bit of jitter is gone for
 

31
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,709
so that little bit of jitter is gone for
me some people had it worse than others

32
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
me some people had it worse than others
 

33
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,430
me some people had it worse than others
i know

34
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
i know
 

35
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,750
i know
like some people could hardly even play

36
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
like some people could hardly even play
 

37
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,830
like some people could hardly even play
so that is awesome

38
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
so that is awesome
 

39
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,750
so that is awesome
uh to get things back the way they were

40
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
uh to get things back the way they were
 

41
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,350
uh to get things back the way they were
but yeah i was just about to do the

42
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
but yeah i was just about to do the
 

43
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,150
but yeah i was just about to do the
redstone well i kind of started already

44
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
redstone well i kind of started already
 

45
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,150
redstone well i kind of started already
for this and i thought i would cue you

46
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
for this and i thought i would cue you
 

47
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,029
for this and i thought i would cue you
guys in on what we're doing

48
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
guys in on what we're doing
 

49
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,070
guys in on what we're doing
uh so what we have to do is we got to

50
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
uh so what we have to do is we got to
 

51
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,670
uh so what we have to do is we got to
make this trap door open

52
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
make this trap door open
 

53
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,789
make this trap door open
and close really quick

54
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
and close really quick
 

55
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,270
and close really quick
the mob will drop down onto that trap

56
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
the mob will drop down onto that trap
 

57
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,710
the mob will drop down onto that trap
door there

58
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
door there
 

59
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,190
door there
and then after after a little bit of

60
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
and then after after a little bit of
 

61
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,270
and then after after a little bit of
time we want that to open and close

62
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
time we want that to open and close
 

63
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,310
time we want that to open and close
as well and then let another mob in

64
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
as well and then let another mob in
 

65
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,429
as well and then let another mob in
so uh the way i have this

66
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
so uh the way i have this
 

67
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,550
so uh the way i have this
there's a tripwire hook right there

68
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
there's a tripwire hook right there
 

69
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,030
there's a tripwire hook right there
so when the mob is one blocked in front

70
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
so when the mob is one blocked in front
 

71
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,149
so when the mob is one blocked in front
of the tr

72
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
of the tr
 

73
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,670
of the tr
the trap door it'll basically do this

74
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
the trap door it'll basically do this
 

75
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,350
the trap door it'll basically do this
it'll flip this torch

76
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
it'll flip this torch
 

77
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,030
it'll flip this torch
and that allows this clock to run

78
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
and that allows this clock to run
 

79
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,469
and that allows this clock to run
and once the mob passes by the tripwire

80
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
and once the mob passes by the tripwire
 

81
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,069
and once the mob passes by the tripwire
it stops so it's not going to be running

82
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
it stops so it's not going to be running
 

83
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,270
it stops so it's not going to be running
all the time which is something that

84
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
all the time which is something that
 

85
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,630
all the time which is something that
bugs me about clocks i don't like it

86
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
bugs me about clocks i don't like it
 

87
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,830
bugs me about clocks i don't like it
when they run all the time

88
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840

 

89
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,350

that'll be good uh this is much too fast

90
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
that'll be good uh this is much too fast
 

91
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,910
that'll be good uh this is much too fast
though if we slow this down

92
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920

 

93
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,950

yeah that might be better

94
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
yeah that might be better
 

95
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,830
yeah that might be better
maybe even slower i think we gotta stick

96
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
maybe even slower i think we gotta stick
 

97
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,589
maybe even slower i think we gotta stick
a mono stable in here though so the trap

98
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
a mono stable in here though so the trap
 

99
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,229
a mono stable in here though so the trap
door

100
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
door
 

101
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,309
door
does a quick open and close just not as

102
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
does a quick open and close just not as
 

103
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,910
does a quick open and close just not as
often

104
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
often
 

105
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,110
often
then we gotta go down below here

106
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
then we gotta go down below here
 

107
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,830
then we gotta go down below here
and try to connect it to here too right

108
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
and try to connect it to here too right
 

109
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,030
and try to connect it to here too right
there

110
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
there
 

111
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,830
there
okay i'm gonna try to put two repeaters

112
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
okay i'm gonna try to put two repeaters
 

113
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,030
okay i'm gonna try to put two repeaters
here actually

114
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
here actually
 

115
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
here actually
i'm guessing we'll need to because it's

116
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
i'm guessing we'll need to because it's
 

117
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,030
i'm guessing we'll need to because it's
got to be the time

118
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
got to be the time
 

119
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,990
got to be the time
from when they drop there to down there

120
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
from when they drop there to down there
 

121
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,509
from when they drop there to down there
which i'm sure is more than

122
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
which i'm sure is more than
 

123
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,350
which i'm sure is more than
four ticks so we'll have to

124
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360

 

125
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,589

set these at eights

126
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599

 

127
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,670

and i am trapped um

128
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
and i am trapped um
 

129
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,990
and i am trapped um
don't ender pearl into the mob system

130
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
don't ender pearl into the mob system
 

131
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,589
don't ender pearl into the mob system
that's never a good idea

132
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599

 

133
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,430

okay very good

134
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440

 

135
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,990

now if we flip this

136
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
now if we flip this
 

137
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,670
now if we flip this
it's almost in reverse that's that's

138
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
it's almost in reverse that's that's
 

139
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,430
it's almost in reverse that's that's
good so

140
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
good so
 

141
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,190
good so
i'm just gonna hook up a monostable to

142
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
i'm just gonna hook up a monostable to
 

143
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,350
i'm just gonna hook up a monostable to
this yet and it should be

144
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
this yet and it should be
 

145
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,110
this yet and it should be
good to go

146
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120

 

147
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,110

so all the redstone should be done now

148
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
so all the redstone should be done now
 

149
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,190
so all the redstone should be done now
we might have to change some timings on

150
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
we might have to change some timings on
 

151
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,110
we might have to change some timings on
things but all the components are here

152
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
things but all the components are here
 

153
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,070
things but all the components are here
so

154
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
so
 

155
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,190
so
we have our our clock activator here

156
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
we have our our clock activator here
 

157
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,509
we have our our clock activator here
this is our clock then it goes to a

158
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
this is our clock then it goes to a
 

159
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,190
this is our clock then it goes to a
monostable circuit here

160
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
monostable circuit here
 

161
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,270
monostable circuit here
this changes it from like a long pulse

162
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
this changes it from like a long pulse
 

163
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,430
this changes it from like a long pulse
to a short pulse

164
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
to a short pulse
 

165
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,589
to a short pulse
uh or in other words instead of the

166
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
uh or in other words instead of the
 

167
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,949
uh or in other words instead of the
trapdoor being like

168
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
trapdoor being like
 

169
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,550
trapdoor being like
open close open close

170
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
open close open close
 

171
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,750
open close open close
it's like open close pause open close

172
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
it's like open close pause open close
 

173
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,350
it's like open close pause open close
pause open close you know real quick

174
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
pause open close you know real quick
 

175
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,670
pause open close you know real quick
and then but it's still the same

176
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
and then but it's still the same
 

177
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,430
and then but it's still the same
duration of time between

178
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
duration of time between
 

179
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,110
duration of time between
uh the pulses and then it goes down to

180
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
uh the pulses and then it goes down to
 

181
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,949
uh the pulses and then it goes down to
here to the other trap door with an

182
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
here to the other trap door with an
 

183
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,949
here to the other trap door with an
eight tick delay i'm guessing we will

184
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
eight tick delay i'm guessing we will
 

185
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,309
eight tick delay i'm guessing we will
have to add more to that though because

186
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
have to add more to that though because
 

187
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,270
have to add more to that though because
i forgot

188
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
i forgot
 

189
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,789
i forgot
not only do we need to account for the

190
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
not only do we need to account for the
 

191
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,550
not only do we need to account for the
time it takes them to fall

192
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
time it takes them to fall
 

193
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,110
time it takes them to fall
down onto the trapdoor but also for

194
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
down onto the trapdoor but also for
 

195
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,949
down onto the trapdoor but also for
their pathfinding to kick in

196
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
their pathfinding to kick in
 

197
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,070
their pathfinding to kick in
so they go where they need to but we can

198
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
so they go where they need to but we can
 

199
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,509
so they go where they need to but we can
run a test now to see what happens

200
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
run a test now to see what happens
 

201
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,590
run a test now to see what happens
so i'm gonna flip this and should have

202
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
so i'm gonna flip this and should have
 

203
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,110
so i'm gonna flip this and should have
checked if it's night or day that's

204
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
checked if it's night or day that's
 

205
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,390
checked if it's night or day that's
gonna affect our

206
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
gonna affect our
 

207
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,310
gonna affect our
spawn rates here

208
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
spawn rates here
 

209
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,749
spawn rates here

00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
i am stuck i can't jump feeling
 

233
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,070
i am stuck i can't jump feeling
claustrophobic let's go over here where

234
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
claustrophobic let's go over here where
 

235
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,070
claustrophobic let's go over here where
it's open

236
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080

 

237
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,270

oh we got a skeleton coming

238
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
oh we got a skeleton coming
 

239
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,310
oh we got a skeleton coming
sounds like

240
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320

 

241
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:30,790

oh you see that first problem

242
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800

 

243
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,590

he's he didn't land on the door even

244
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
he's he didn't land on the door even
 

245
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,870
he's he didn't land on the door even
that's the problem

246
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880

 

247
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,550

yeah so there's definitely timing issues

248
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
yeah so there's definitely timing issues
 

249
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,390
yeah so there's definitely timing issues
already

250
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
already
 

251
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,510
already
it's okay we'll work him out

252
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
it's okay we'll work him out
 

253
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,110
it's okay we'll work him out
see that opens before he gets to the

254
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
see that opens before he gets to the
 

255
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,950
see that opens before he gets to the
trap door even

256
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960

 

257
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,189

okay so i'm gonna do some fine tuning

258
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
okay so i'm gonna do some fine tuning
 

259
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,150
okay so i'm gonna do some fine tuning
here and then we'll

260
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
here and then we'll
 

261
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,790
here and then we'll
we'll see it really working hopefully

262
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800

 

263
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,629

well good news it looks like the

264
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
well good news it looks like the
 

265
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,309
well good news it looks like the
silverfish farm is still working

266
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
silverfish farm is still working
 

267
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,710
silverfish farm is still working
perfectly even after the redstone update

268
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
perfectly even after the redstone update
 

269
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,670
perfectly even after the redstone update
so all the redstone changes did not

270
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
so all the redstone changes did not
 

271
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,990
so all the redstone changes did not
break

272
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
break
 

273
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,590
break
it which is very good i am not

274
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
it which is very good i am not
 

275
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,350
it which is very good i am not
i don't want to change anything with

276
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
i don't want to change anything with
 

277
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,990
i don't want to change anything with
this i'm i'm happy with the redstone on

278
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
this i'm i'm happy with the redstone on
 

279
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,510
this i'm i'm happy with the redstone on
it and i don't want to

280
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
it and i don't want to
 

281
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,110
it and i don't want to
have to fiddle with it anymore because

282
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
have to fiddle with it anymore because
 

283
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,270
have to fiddle with it anymore because
it is like 100

284
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
it is like 100
 

285
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,629
it is like 100
accurate now um

286
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
accurate now um
 

287
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,430
accurate now um
took me a long time to get that right i

288
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
took me a long time to get that right i
 

289
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,990
took me a long time to get that right i
did not

290
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
did not
 

291
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,150
did not
say the same about our mob sorter though

292
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
say the same about our mob sorter though
 

293
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,590
say the same about our mob sorter though
it is not 100

294
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
it is not 100
 

295
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,990
it is not 100
accurate at the moment it is maybe about

296
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
accurate at the moment it is maybe about
 

297
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,950
accurate at the moment it is maybe about
95

298
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
95
 

299
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,629
95
from what i just tested uh we

300
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
from what i just tested uh we
 

301
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,390
from what i just tested uh we
will go check out the changes i did it's

302
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
will go check out the changes i did it's
 

303
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,309
will go check out the changes i did it's
a little bit more improved but we have

304
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
a little bit more improved but we have
 

305
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,150
a little bit more improved but we have
to do some more

306
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
to do some more
 

307
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,990
to do some more
improvements maybe first thing i changed

308
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
improvements maybe first thing i changed
 

309
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,350
improvements maybe first thing i changed
i increased the clocks so this is

310
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
i increased the clocks so this is
 

311
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,790
i increased the clocks so this is
21 ticks now about 2.1 seconds

312
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
21 ticks now about 2.1 seconds
 

313
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,510
21 ticks now about 2.1 seconds
and monostable is as short as it can be

314
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
and monostable is as short as it can be
 

315
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,029
and monostable is as short as it can be
for operating the trip door i have added

316
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
for operating the trip door i have added
 

317
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,150
for operating the trip door i have added
in

318
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
in
 

319
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,189
in
more delay down here as well to to make

320
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
more delay down here as well to to make
 

321
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,309
more delay down here as well to to make
that work because they have to be

322
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
that work because they have to be
 

323
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,110
that work because they have to be
like the same length for it to work down

324
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
like the same length for it to work down
 

325
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,870
like the same length for it to work down
here too on this trip door

326
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
here too on this trip door
 

327
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,070
here too on this trip door
uh so this is what do we got here we got

328
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
uh so this is what do we got here we got
 

329
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,189
uh so this is what do we got here we got
20 20 ticks down there

330
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199

 

331
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,270

or two seconds and then i added in a

332
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
or two seconds and then i added in a
 

333
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,230
or two seconds and then i added in a
trip door

334
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
trip door
 

335
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,430
trip door
right over here which doesn't move at

336
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
right over here which doesn't move at
 

337
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,990
right over here which doesn't move at
all it's just there to create

338
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
all it's just there to create
 

339
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,270
all it's just there to create
a few pixels distance from this wall

340
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
a few pixels distance from this wall
 

341
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,870
a few pixels distance from this wall
because they were falling down and not

342
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
because they were falling down and not
 

343
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,629
because they were falling down and not
landing on the trip door there they were

344
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
landing on the trip door there they were
 

345
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,469
landing on the trip door there they were
landing on that block

346
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
landing on that block
 

347
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,350
landing on that block
it's connected to and that is not good

348
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
it's connected to and that is not good
 

349
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,230
it's connected to and that is not good
so

350
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
so
 

351
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,469
so
anyway let's run a test we'll see what

352
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
anyway let's run a test we'll see what
 

353
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,790
anyway let's run a test we'll see what
it's like now

354
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800

 

355
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,749

uh one issue i was having is it can't

356
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
uh one issue i was having is it can't
 

357
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,830
uh one issue i was having is it can't
keep up with my mob

358
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
keep up with my mob
 

359
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,670
keep up with my mob

it's like he fell then he came back up

368
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
it's like he fell then he came back up
 

369
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,309
it's like he fell then he came back up
and went that way

370
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
and went that way
 

371
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,070
and went that way
skeletons they just sit there and fall

372
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
skeletons they just sit there and fall
 

373
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,230
skeletons they just sit there and fall
down

374
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240

 

375
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,990

the main problem having with this at the

376
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
the main problem having with this at the
 

377
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,909
the main problem having with this at the
moment is the creepers

378
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
moment is the creepers
 

379
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,510
moment is the creepers
they kind of sit there too long

380
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
they kind of sit there too long
 

381
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,189
they kind of sit there too long
sometimes and they'll just fall down

382
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
sometimes and they'll just fall down
 

383
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,350
sometimes and they'll just fall down
it does seem to matter how many guys are

384
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
it does seem to matter how many guys are
 

385
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,230
it does seem to matter how many guys are
up there though

386
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
up there though
 

387
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,430
up there though
look how backed up it is

388
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440

 

389
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,709

it's pretty accurate though as long as

390
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
it's pretty accurate though as long as
 

391
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,630
it's pretty accurate though as long as
things are running smooth it's accurate

392
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
things are running smooth it's accurate
 

393
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,430
things are running smooth it's accurate
but when it starts jamming up like that

394
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440

 

395
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,590

yeah you fell in with the skeleton

396
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600

 

397
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,829

they start pushing each other a lot up

398
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
they start pushing each other a lot up
 

399
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,550
they start pushing each other a lot up
there it starts to mess up sometimes two

400
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
there it starts to mess up sometimes two
 

401
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,829
there it starts to mess up sometimes two
will fall into the time

402
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
will fall into the time
 

403
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,870
will fall into the time
too

404
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880

 

405
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,509

that seat just sat there i tried

406
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
that seat just sat there i tried
 

407
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,990
that seat just sat there i tried
extending the size of this platform

408
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
extending the size of this platform
 

409
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,790
extending the size of this platform
uh it seemed to help a bit but we need

410
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
uh it seemed to help a bit but we need
 

411
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,550
uh it seemed to help a bit but we need
something else we either need

412
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
something else we either need
 

413
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,150
something else we either need
i don't know if adding a second cap

414
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
i don't know if adding a second cap
 

415
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,070
i don't know if adding a second cap
would make them run away quicker

416
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
would make them run away quicker
 

417
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,230
would make them run away quicker
or if i can add like another layer

418
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
or if i can add like another layer
 

419
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,550
or if i can add like another layer
to this like if i went up like this and

420
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
to this like if i went up like this and
 

421
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,790
to this like if i went up like this and
made a path

422
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
made a path
 

423
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,230
made a path
for them to get up like if i start

424
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
for them to get up like if i start
 

425
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,150
for them to get up like if i start
making the second platform if they would

426
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
making the second platform if they would
 

427
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,430
making the second platform if they would
see that

428
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
see that
 

429
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,470
see that
i don't know what the

430
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
i don't know what the
 

431
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,550
i don't know what the
the range is on the path finding for the

432
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
the range is on the path finding for the
 

433
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,949
the range is on the path finding for the
mobs

434
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959

 

435
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,389

but that's another idea but generally

436
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
but that's another idea but generally
 

437
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,350
but that's another idea but generally
it's working

438
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
it's working
 

439
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,710
it's working
relatively decently at the moment

440
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
relatively decently at the moment
 

441
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,350
relatively decently at the moment
but what is this all for you might be

442
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
but what is this all for you might be
 

443
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,389
but what is this all for you might be
wondering

444
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
wondering
 

445
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,350
wondering
uh i had fun reading the comments for

446
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
uh i had fun reading the comments for
 

447
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,990
uh i had fun reading the comments for
last episode

448
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
last episode
 

449
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,030
last episode
because a lot of people are trying to

450
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
because a lot of people are trying to
 

451
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,590
because a lot of people are trying to
guess what i'm what i'm intending to use

452
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
guess what i'm what i'm intending to use
 

453
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,750
guess what i'm what i'm intending to use
this for like what's the point if

454
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
this for like what's the point if
 

455
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,990
this for like what's the point if
if we can separate items out now using

456
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
if we can separate items out now using
 

457
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,590
if we can separate items out now using
hoppers and all that why don't we just

458
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
hoppers and all that why don't we just
 

459
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,829
hoppers and all that why don't we just
separate the items instead of the mobs

460
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
separate the items instead of the mobs
 

461
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,310
separate the items instead of the mobs
and i'll tell you why

462
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
and i'll tell you why
 

463
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,670
and i'll tell you why
uh this is an idea i had about

464
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
uh this is an idea i had about
 

465
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,550
uh this is an idea i had about
six six months ago to a year ago already

466
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
six six months ago to a year ago already
 

467

six six months ago to a year ago already
actually it's just been sitting there

468
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
actually it's just been sitting there
 

469
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,670
actually it's just been sitting there
and it's been bugging me that i haven't

470
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
and it's been bugging me that i haven't
 

471
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,910
and it's been bugging me that i haven't
done it yet so we're gonna go to one of

472
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
done it yet so we're gonna go to one of
 

473
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,670
done it yet so we're gonna go to one of
my old creative worlds i

474
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
my old creative worlds i
 

475
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,829
my old creative worlds i
managed to find the project again and

476
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
managed to find the project again and
 

477
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,790
managed to find the project again and
i'll show you

478
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
i'll show you
 

479
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:30,069
i'll show you
step three of the mob system

480
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079

 

481
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,590

all right guys here we are in one of my

old old creative worlds
uh i have five or six or seven

486
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
uh i have five or six or seven
 

487
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,110
uh i have five or six or seven
main worlds i use i'll just pick one

488
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
main worlds i use i'll just pick one
 

489
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,470
main worlds i use i'll just pick one
randomly and i'll

490
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
randomly and i'll
 

491
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,030
randomly and i'll
start building little experiments like

492
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
start building little experiments like
 

493
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,550
start building little experiments like
this all over the landscape

494
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
this all over the landscape
 

495
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,750
this all over the landscape
no real order to it or anything so

496
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
no real order to it or anything so
 

497
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,790
no real order to it or anything so
it can be really challenging to find an

498
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
it can be really challenging to find an
 

499
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,790
it can be really challenging to find an
old project after i've built it

500
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
old project after i've built it
 

501
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,670
old project after i've built it
and this was no exception this took me i

502
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
and this was no exception this took me i
 

503
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,310
and this was no exception this took me i
had to go through every single world

504
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
had to go through every single world
 

505
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,949
had to go through every single world
and like fly around the worlds for quite

506
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
and like fly around the worlds for quite
 

507
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,230
and like fly around the worlds for quite
a ways to see if i

508
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
a ways to see if i
 

509
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,630
a ways to see if i
maybe missed it somewhere finally i

510
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
maybe missed it somewhere finally i
 

511
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,230
maybe missed it somewhere finally i
found it here it is

512
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
found it here it is
 

513
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,470
found it here it is
this is gonna be step three of our mob

514
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
this is gonna be step three of our mob
 

515
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,509
this is gonna be step three of our mob
system

516
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
system
 

517
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,710
system
uh the bomb factory

518
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
uh the bomb factory
 

519
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,910
uh the bomb factory
this is a bomb factory um

520
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
this is a bomb factory um
 

521
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,350
this is a bomb factory um
this is really cool maybe we'll start

522
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
this is really cool maybe we'll start
 

523
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,670
this is really cool maybe we'll start
with

524
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
with
 

525
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,389
with
just an example of it so there's going

526
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
just an example of it so there's going
 

527
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,670
just an example of it so there's going
to be three

528
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
to be three
 

529
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,710
to be three
main components to it uh there's a snow

530
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
main components to it uh there's a snow
 

531
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,670
main components to it uh there's a snow
golem over there

532
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
golem over there
 

533
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,190
golem over there
safely tucked away behind closed doors

534
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
safely tucked away behind closed doors
 

535
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,389
safely tucked away behind closed doors
safe from any danger we have a skeleton

536
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
safe from any danger we have a skeleton
 

537
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,430
safe from any danger we have a skeleton
uh we're gonna have a creeper in this

538
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
uh we're gonna have a creeper in this
 

539
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,910
uh we're gonna have a creeper in this
path

540
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
path
 

541
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,110
path
here

542
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120

 

543
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,230

all right right between the snow golem

544
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
all right right between the snow golem
 

545
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,990
all right right between the snow golem
and the skeleton

546
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
and the skeleton
 

547
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,750
and the skeleton
but he doesn't get released right away

548
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
but he doesn't get released right away
 

549
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,509
but he doesn't get released right away
this is what happens uh

550
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
this is what happens uh
 

551
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,470
this is what happens uh
this is made for like several months ago

552
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
this is made for like several months ago
 

553
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,590
this is made for like several months ago
and it doesn't work

554
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
and it doesn't work
 

555
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,069
and it doesn't work
quite right anymore because mom behavior

556
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
quite right anymore because mom behavior
 

557
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,670
quite right anymore because mom behavior
has changed

558
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680

 

559
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,910

before i had to use a monostable circuit

560
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
before i had to use a monostable circuit
 

561
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,190
before i had to use a monostable circuit
to run it

562
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
to run it
 

563
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,150
to run it
but now i found if i put a wooden button

564
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
but now i found if i put a wooden button
 

565
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,110
but now i found if i put a wooden button
here

566
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
here
 

567
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,150
here
it pretty much works every time

568
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
it pretty much works every time
 

569
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,910
it pretty much works every time
the the main thing that's changed is

570
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
the the main thing that's changed is
 

571
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,550
the the main thing that's changed is
skeletons and like snow golems they take

572
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
skeletons and like snow golems they take
 

573
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,230
skeletons and like snow golems they take
a good second before they shoot the

574
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
a good second before they shoot the
 

575
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,710
a good second before they shoot the
first time before in the past it was

576
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
first time before in the past it was
 

577
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,030
first time before in the past it was
like

578
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
like
 

579
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,030
like
instant like he would instantly shoot

580
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
instant like he would instantly shoot
 

581
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,389
instant like he would instantly shoot
when this door opens and then the

582
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
when this door opens and then the
 

583
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,790
when this door opens and then the
skeleton would instantly shoot back and

584
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
skeleton would instantly shoot back and
 

585
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,670
skeleton would instantly shoot back and
it was a real challenge to to close this

586
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
it was a real challenge to to close this
 

587
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,069
it was a real challenge to to close this
door

588
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
door
 

589
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,470
door
quick enough so that the snow golem

590
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
quick enough so that the snow golem
 

591
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,150
quick enough so that the snow golem
wouldn't get shot by the skeleton but

592
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
wouldn't get shot by the skeleton but
 

593
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,430
wouldn't get shot by the skeleton but
now

594
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
now
 

595
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,829
now
it's really easy so anyway here's an

596
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
it's really easy so anyway here's an
 

597
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,230
it's really easy so anyway here's an
example

598
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
example
 

599
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,470
example
boom so what happened there

600
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
boom so what happened there
 

601
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,150
boom so what happened there
uh the door is open long enough for the

602
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
uh the door is open long enough for the
 

603
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,949
uh the door is open long enough for the
snow golem to see the skeleton

604
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
snow golem to see the skeleton
 

605
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,829
snow golem to see the skeleton
he shot the skeleton there's a check

606
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
he shot the skeleton there's a check
 

607
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,670
he shot the skeleton there's a check
that happens here though to make sure

608
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
that happens here though to make sure
 

609
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,670
that happens here though to make sure
the skeleton gets shot because sometimes

610
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
the skeleton gets shot because sometimes
 

611
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,389
the skeleton gets shot because sometimes
these guys

612
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
these guys
 

613
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,389
these guys
miss the snow golems and

614
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
miss the snow golems and
 

615
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,829
miss the snow golems and
this piston retracts glass block

616
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
this piston retracts glass block
 

617
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,030
this piston retracts glass block
it looks like it doesn't put it back

618
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
it looks like it doesn't put it back
 

619
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,110
it looks like it doesn't put it back
like it's supposed to because it's not

620
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
like it's supposed to because it's not
 

621
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,310
like it's supposed to because it's not
it's not set up right but

622
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
it's not set up right but
 

623
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,710
it's not set up right but
it retracts this glass block and

624
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
it retracts this glass block and
 

625
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,350
it retracts this glass block and
allows the skeleton to get moved to on

626
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
allows the skeleton to get moved to on
 

627
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,430
allows the skeleton to get moved to on
top of that pressure plate

628
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
top of that pressure plate
 

629
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,389
top of that pressure plate
and that pressure plates activates this

630
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
and that pressure plates activates this
 

631
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,949
and that pressure plates activates this
piston which pushes them off of it

632
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
piston which pushes them off of it
 

633
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,190
piston which pushes them off of it
and then it's going to run and release

634
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
and then it's going to run and release
 

635
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,710
and then it's going to run and release
our creeper

636
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
our creeper
 

637
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,629
our creeper
which now that we have a mob sorter we

638
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
which now that we have a mob sorter we
 

639
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,870
which now that we have a mob sorter we
can have a gate that just releases

640
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
can have a gate that just releases
 

641
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,389
can have a gate that just releases
one one creeper and we can control it

642
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
one one creeper and we can control it
 

643
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,629
one one creeper and we can control it
properly that way

644
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
properly that way
 

645
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,470
properly that way
so the second time we open the door

646
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480

 

647
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,829

uh the skeleton will shoot the creeper

648
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839

 

649
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,110

first

650
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
first
 

651
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,269
first
um i'm not quite sure how this is going

652
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
um i'm not quite sure how this is going
 

653
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,710
um i'm not quite sure how this is going
to work out like uh

654
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
to work out like uh
 

655
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,069
to work out like uh
i have to adjust the timings and

656
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
i have to adjust the timings and
 

657
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,189
i have to adjust the timings and
everything to make it work again

658
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
everything to make it work again
 

659
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,949
everything to make it work again
but you should you saw the skeleton shot

660
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
but you should you saw the skeleton shot
 

661
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,629
but you should you saw the skeleton shot
the creeper because this creepers in

662
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
the creeper because this creepers in
 

663
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,230
the creeper because this creepers in
between the two

664
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
between the two
 

665
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,550
between the two
uh the snowglobe shot afterwards i think

666
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
uh the snowglobe shot afterwards i think
 

667
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,470
uh the snowglobe shot afterwards i think
the creeper will still detonate on the

668
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
the creeper will still detonate on the
 

669
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,710
the creeper will still detonate on the
skeleton though once they come together

670
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720

 

671
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,389

yeah don't blow up

672
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
yeah don't blow up
 

673
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,870
yeah don't blow up
so what i can do

674
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880

 

675
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,910

is transport the skeleton and the

676
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
is transport the skeleton and the
 

677

blow up blocks
like uh it's kind of like

684
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
like uh it's kind of like
 

685

like uh it's kind of like
free tnt basically that i don't have to

686
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
free tnt basically that i don't have to
 

687
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,949
free tnt basically that i don't have to
craft or anything it's all automatic

688
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
craft or anything it's all automatic
 

689

you can get the skeleton and the creeper

690
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
you can get the skeleton and the creeper
 

691
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,550
you can get the skeleton and the creeper
from my mob system

692
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
from my mob system
 

693
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,829
from my mob system
no problem and then

694
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
no problem and then
 

695
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,949
no problem and then
we can get them to blow stuff up so

696
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
we can get them to blow stuff up so
 

697
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,829
we can get them to blow stuff up so
step four or five or whatever i don't

698
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
step four or five or whatever i don't
 

699
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,230
step four or five or whatever i don't
know what

700
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
know what
 

701
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,269
know what
we'll call it later but one of the

702
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
we'll call it later but one of the
 

703
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,310
we'll call it later but one of the
things i want to make

704
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
things i want to make
 

705
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,230
things i want to make
is a cobblestone farms so

706
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
is a cobblestone farms so
 

707
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,990
is a cobblestone farms so
we'll have cobblestone generators and

708
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
we'll have cobblestone generators and
 

709
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,269
we'll have cobblestone generators and
then

710
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
then
 

711
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,110
then
we'll make them detonate the cobblestone

712
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
we'll make them detonate the cobblestone
 

713
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,470
we'll make them detonate the cobblestone
and then we'll collect it

714
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
and then we'll collect it
 

715
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,230
and then we'll collect it
but the main thing i want to use this

716
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
but the main thing i want to use this
 

717
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,670
but the main thing i want to use this
for is an automatic

718
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
for is an automatic
 

719
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,949
for is an automatic
tree farm to automatically collect wood

720
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
tree farm to automatically collect wood
 

721
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,750
tree farm to automatically collect wood
uh it's gonna be really tough to do and

722
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
uh it's gonna be really tough to do and
 

723
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,750
uh it's gonna be really tough to do and
a lot of fun

724
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
a lot of fun
 

725
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,550
a lot of fun
but it is possible with the game now i'm

726
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
but it is possible with the game now i'm
 

727
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,110
but it is possible with the game now i'm
pretty sure

728
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
pretty sure
 

729
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,350
pretty sure
uh it's going to be a fun project that's

730
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
uh it's going to be a fun project that's
 

731
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,710
uh it's going to be a fun project that's
for sure

732
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
for sure
 

733
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,230
for sure
but there's there's going to be a lot of

734
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
but there's there's going to be a lot of
 

735
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,069
but there's there's going to be a lot of
complicated steps to it

736
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
complicated steps to it
 

737
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,350
complicated steps to it
but basically we combine them at like a

738
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
but basically we combine them at like a
 

739
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,110
but basically we combine them at like a
sheet of

740
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
sheet of
 

741
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,670
sheet of
wood or something have them blow it up

742
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
wood or something have them blow it up
 

743
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,110
wood or something have them blow it up
and then the wood will fall down onto

744
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
and then the wood will fall down onto
 

745
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,550
and then the wood will fall down onto
hoppers or whatever

746
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
hoppers or whatever
 

747
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,470
hoppers or whatever
this is something i set up like months

748
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
this is something i set up like months
 

749
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,550
this is something i set up like months
ago because i think i planned on using

750
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
ago because i think i planned on using
 

751
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,269
ago because i think i planned on using
it

752
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
it
 

753
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,990
it
for a tree farm even back then but now

754
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
for a tree farm even back then but now
 

755
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,550
for a tree farm even back then but now
it's a lot easier to make this all work

756
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
it's a lot easier to make this all work
 

757
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,389
it's a lot easier to make this all work
so yeah

758
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
so yeah
 

759
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,670
so yeah
it's going to be fun it's going to be a

760
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
it's going to be fun it's going to be a
 

761
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,749
it's going to be fun it's going to be a
lot of fun so that's the idea we're not

762
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
lot of fun so that's the idea we're not
 

763
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,870
lot of fun so that's the idea we're not
going to work on that today maybe we'll

764
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
going to work on that today maybe we'll
 

765
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,550
going to work on that today maybe we'll
go do something else just to change

766
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
go do something else just to change
 

767
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,590
go do something else just to change

yesterday
 

795
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,990
yesterday
and i did the ceiling and i kind of like

796
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
and i did the ceiling and i kind of like
 

797
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,829
and i did the ceiling and i kind of like
how it looks actually we did like this

798
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
how it looks actually we did like this
 

799
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,990
how it looks actually we did like this
grid pattern thing

800
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
grid pattern thing
 

801
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,150
grid pattern thing
i thought i'd show you i'm trying to

802
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
i thought i'd show you i'm trying to
 

803
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,749
i thought i'd show you i'm trying to
figure out how to connect it to the wall

804
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
figure out how to connect it to the wall
 

805
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,550
figure out how to connect it to the wall
now

806
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
now
 

807
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,310
now
and i experimented with some other block

808
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
and i experimented with some other block
 

809
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,749
and i experimented with some other block
types because i

810
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
types because i
 

811
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,150
types because i
was hoping to change like it's just all

812
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
was hoping to change like it's just all
 

813
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,150
was hoping to change like it's just all
one color and i was hoping to

814
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
one color and i was hoping to
 

815
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,910
one color and i was hoping to
add another color in with the wall but i

816
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
add another color in with the wall but i
 

817
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,189
add another color in with the wall but i
couldn't find anything i like

818
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
couldn't find anything i like
 

819
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,829
couldn't find anything i like
so we might just keep it this isn't

820
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
so we might just keep it this isn't
 

821
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,269
so we might just keep it this isn't
exactly going to be a

822
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
exactly going to be a
 

823
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,669
exactly going to be a
high high use building i don't think

824
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
high high use building i don't think
 

825
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,949
high high use building i don't think
so i'm not too picky about it i tried

826
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
so i'm not too picky about it i tried
 

827
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,829
so i'm not too picky about it i tried
putting some wool behind the fences

828
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
putting some wool behind the fences
 

829
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,309
putting some wool behind the fences
i don't know not sure what to do

830
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
i don't know not sure what to do
 

831
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,750
i don't know not sure what to do
when the mushroom grows it's going to

832
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
when the mushroom grows it's going to
 

833
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,189
when the mushroom grows it's going to
activate some redstone

834
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199

 

835
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,429

turn the light up or turn the light on

836
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
turn the light up or turn the light on
 

837
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,590
turn the light up or turn the light on
up there

838
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
up there
 

839
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,310
up there
then i want it to do like a light show

840
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
then i want it to do like a light show
 

841
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,070
then i want it to do like a light show
on the ground maybe some note blocks

842
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
on the ground maybe some note blocks
 

843
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,230
on the ground maybe some note blocks
like a little tune that will play

844
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
like a little tune that will play
 

845
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,710
like a little tune that will play
until we harvest the mushroom then on

846
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
until we harvest the mushroom then on
 

847
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,870
until we harvest the mushroom then on
this end we gotta

848
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
this end we gotta
 

849
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,390
this end we gotta
put something i don't know what we'll do

850
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
put something i don't know what we'll do
 

851
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,150
put something i don't know what we'll do
here either

852
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160

 

853
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,669

we might even to continue

854
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
we might even to continue
 

855
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,870
we might even to continue
here like have a door that goes further

856
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
here like have a door that goes further
 

857
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,870
here like have a door that goes further
into another part of the cave

858
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880

 

859
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,990

oh maybe

860
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
oh maybe
 

861
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,029
oh maybe
this nether brick and sandstone

862
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
this nether brick and sandstone
 

863
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,750
this nether brick and sandstone
at the top here i never really made it

864
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
at the top here i never really made it
 

865
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,590
at the top here i never really made it
end anywhere i just

866
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
end anywhere i just
 

867
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,070
end anywhere i just
just randomly stopped it same with on

868
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
just randomly stopped it same with on
 

869
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,990
just randomly stopped it same with on
the other side i never really

870
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,000
the other side i never really
 

871
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,830
the other side i never really
made it do anything it just randomly

872
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
made it do anything it just randomly
 

873
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,430
made it do anything it just randomly
ends so

874
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
ends so
 

875
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,750
ends so
uh maybe what we'll do

876
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760

 

877
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,710

like it kind of wraps around the ufo

878
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
like it kind of wraps around the ufo
 

879
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,669
like it kind of wraps around the ufo
there

880
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
there
 

881
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,230
there
maybe we'll mimic oh i said that fast

882
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
maybe we'll mimic oh i said that fast
 

883
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,070
maybe we'll mimic oh i said that fast
mimic

884
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
mimic
 

885
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,070
mimic
uh what we did there and make it wrap

886
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
uh what we did there and make it wrap
 

887
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,909
uh what we did there and make it wrap
into the wall

888
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919

 

889
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,150

on this other side so

890
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160

 

891
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,590

do something like that

892
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600

 

893
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,830

and another brick will only go up to

894
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
and another brick will only go up to
 

895
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,029
and another brick will only go up to
there and then

896
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
there and then
 

897
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,029
there and then
we'll figure out some other ceiling for

898
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
we'll figure out some other ceiling for
 

899
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,510
we'll figure out some other ceiling for
this tree farm area if we ever do that

900
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
this tree farm area if we ever do that
 

901
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,029
this tree farm area if we ever do that
that's a lot of work to change the

902
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
that's a lot of work to change the
 

903
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,549
that's a lot of work to change the
ceiling on there

904
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
ceiling on there
 

905
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,549
ceiling on there
um but maybe eventually we'll get to it

906
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
um but maybe eventually we'll get to it
 

907
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,070
um but maybe eventually we'll get to it
this will all be wait is that right

908
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080

 

909
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,390

huh this is four blocks wide

910
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400

 

911
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,230

it seems a little off doesn't it

912
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
it seems a little off doesn't it
 

913
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,110
it seems a little off doesn't it
oh well it'll work

914
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120

 

915
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,630

there we go that looks a little bit

916
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
there we go that looks a little bit
 

917
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,270
there we go that looks a little bit
better i would say a little more finish

918
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280
better i would say a little more finish
 

919
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,470
better i would say a little more finish
complete uh it still connects to nothing

920
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
complete uh it still connects to nothing
 

921
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,150
complete uh it still connects to nothing
though but you don't really see it at

922
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
though but you don't really see it at
 

923
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,590
though but you don't really see it at
the moment

924
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
the moment
 

925
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,590
the moment
we don't know what we're doing with this

926
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
we don't know what we're doing with this
 

927
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,110
we don't know what we're doing with this
area

928
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120
area
 

929
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,950
area
and then eventually it'll transition to

930
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
and then eventually it'll transition to
 

931
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,950
and then eventually it'll transition to
another type of ceiling if we do one

932
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
another type of ceiling if we do one
 

933
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,470
another type of ceiling if we do one
over the tree farm

934
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
over the tree farm
 

935
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,590
over the tree farm
if we ever get to it this side turned

936
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
if we ever get to it this side turned
 

937
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,430
if we ever get to it this side turned
out okay

938
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
out okay
 

939
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,950
out okay
changed this wall moved the fence

940
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
changed this wall moved the fence
 

941
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,190
changed this wall moved the fence
uh maybe

942
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200

 

943
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,549

yeah that's better right

944
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
yeah that's better right
 

945
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,830
yeah that's better right
we'll put something here it's not going

946
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
we'll put something here it's not going
 

947
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,110
we'll put something here it's not going
to be a flat wall but for now it will be

948
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
to be a flat wall but for now it will be
 

949
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,270
to be a flat wall but for now it will be
had to transition here that was a bit

950
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
had to transition here that was a bit
 

951
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,150
had to transition here that was a bit
tough but

952
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
tough but
 

953
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,190
tough but
it works it's good

954
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
it works it's good
 

955
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,230

up there or there's another
ender pearl spot over here i use often

1022
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
ender pearl spot over here i use often
 

1023
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,630
ender pearl spot over here i use often
so i got a few easier ways out than in

1024
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640
so i got a few easier ways out than in
 

1025
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,070
so i got a few easier ways out than in
but let's just try and make a staircase

1026
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
but let's just try and make a staircase
 

1027
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,590
but let's just try and make a staircase
here and see

1028
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
here and see
 

1029
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,870
here and see
what that's like

1030
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880

 

1031
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,390

00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
and started making terrible noise this
 

1051
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,830
and started making terrible noise this
goes quite a ways

1052
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:10,840
goes quite a ways
 

1053
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,710
goes quite a ways

1058
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400

vacuumed out my computer though
 

1063
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,510
vacuumed out my computer though
there was a lot of a lot of

1064
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
there was a lot of a lot of
 

1065
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,549
there was a lot of a lot of
dust a whole bunch of it

1066
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
dust a whole bunch of it
 

1067
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,710
dust a whole bunch of it
uh and i was getting blue screens before

1068
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
uh and i was getting blue screens before
 

1069
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,270
uh and i was getting blue screens before
like

1070
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
like
 

1071
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,990
like
one a day usually and i was considering

1072
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
one a day usually and i was considering
 

1073
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,070
one a day usually and i was considering
maybe getting a new computer by now

1074
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
maybe getting a new computer by now
 

1075
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,990
maybe getting a new computer by now
because it usually every three years or

1076
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
because it usually every three years or
 

1077
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,909
because it usually every three years or
so i'll get a new computer

1078
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
so i'll get a new computer
 

1079
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,070
so i'll get a new computer
you know i don't get top of the line

1080
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
you know i don't get top of the line
 

1081
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,830
you know i don't get top of the line
when i get a new one i'll get like above

1082
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
when i get a new one i'll get like above
 

1083
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,789
when i get a new one i'll get like above
average

1084
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:48,799
average
 

1085
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,909
average
usually so it's a bit cheaper

1086
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
usually so it's a bit cheaper
 

1087
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,190
usually so it's a bit cheaper
but still kind of expensive

1088
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
but still kind of expensive
 

1089
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,909
but still kind of expensive
but i think i can hold out a little

1090
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
but i think i can hold out a little
 

1091
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,830
but i think i can hold out a little
longer now because ever since i vacuumed

1092
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
longer now because ever since i vacuumed
 

1093
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,350
longer now because ever since i vacuumed
out all the dust

1094
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
out all the dust
 

1095
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,270
out all the dust
i haven't gotten a blue screen so i'm

1096
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
i haven't gotten a blue screen so i'm
 

1097
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,110
i haven't gotten a blue screen so i'm
guessing it was overheating

1098
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
guessing it was overheating
 

1099
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,789
guessing it was overheating
and everything's pretty good now

1100
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799

 

1101
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,789

so yeah maybe we'll do this it goes up

1102
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
so yeah maybe we'll do this it goes up
 

1103
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,350
so yeah maybe we'll do this it goes up
quite a ways though doesn't it

1104
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
quite a ways though doesn't it
 

1105
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,630
quite a ways though doesn't it
it's thinking of just having a nice

1106
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
it's thinking of just having a nice
 

1107
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,430
it's thinking of just having a nice
little staircase entrance

1108
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440

 

1109
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,870

that's a pretty big staircase

1110
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880

 

1111
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,350

[Music]

1112
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
[Music]
 

1113
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,950
[Music]
yeah we'll do it this is a good place

1114
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
yeah we'll do it this is a good place
 

1115
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,909
yeah we'll do it this is a good place
like we got a nice view over here

1116
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
like we got a nice view over here
 

1117
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,430
like we got a nice view over here
i think that's a good idea

1118
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
i think that's a good idea
 

1119
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,070
i think that's a good idea
and maybe i'll break it up too instead

1120
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
and maybe i'll break it up too instead
 

1121
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,029
and maybe i'll break it up too instead
of like having a

1122
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
of like having a
 

1123
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,710
of like having a
solid staircase all the way up i'll have

1124
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
solid staircase all the way up i'll have
 

1125
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,870
solid staircase all the way up i'll have
a platform halfway

1126
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
a platform halfway
 

1127
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,190
a platform halfway
with something and then we'll go the

1128
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
with something and then we'll go the
 

1129
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,390
with something and then we'll go the
rest of the way

1130
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400

 

1131
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,710

okay i got the basic idea laid out here

1132
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
okay i got the basic idea laid out here
 

1133
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,590
okay i got the basic idea laid out here
this

1134
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
this
 

1135
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,310
this
area i extend it to seven blocks so we

1136
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320
area i extend it to seven blocks so we
 

1137
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,230
area i extend it to seven blocks so we
can put something on the walls and

1138
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
can put something on the walls and
 

1139
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,909
can put something on the walls and
we'll have a ceiling or something maybe

1140
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
we'll have a ceiling or something maybe
 

1141
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,549
we'll have a ceiling or something maybe
another arch over here that goes over

1142
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
another arch over here that goes over
 

1143
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,510
another arch over here that goes over
top and then

1144
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
top and then
 

1145
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,190
top and then
up we go we got a platform i made this

1146
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
up we go we got a platform i made this
 

1147
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,310
up we go we got a platform i made this
five blocks and then we go the rest of

1148
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
five blocks and then we go the rest of
 

1149
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,269
five blocks and then we go the rest of
the way

1150
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
the way
 

1151
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,350
the way
and each of these flight of stairs goes

1152
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
and each of these flight of stairs goes
 

1153
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,230
and each of these flight of stairs goes
up seven blocks

1154
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
up seven blocks
 

1155
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,430
up seven blocks
so it splits right in the middle and

1156
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
so it splits right in the middle and
 

1157
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,590
so it splits right in the middle and
should be good so i think that's what

1158
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
should be good so i think that's what
 

1159
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,029
should be good so i think that's what
we'll go with

1160
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
we'll go with
 

1161
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,750
we'll go with
and i'm just gonna make it like i made

1162
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
and i'm just gonna make it like i made
 

1163
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,909
and i'm just gonna make it like i made
the other staircases to be consistent

1164
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
the other staircases to be consistent
 

1165
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,590
the other staircases to be consistent
with the the logs on the sides and

1166
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
with the the logs on the sides and
 

1167
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,430
with the the logs on the sides and
the regular oak stairs

1168
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
the regular oak stairs
 

1169
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,950
the regular oak stairs
and it'll look pretty good maybe we'll

1170
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
and it'll look pretty good maybe we'll
 

1171
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,630
and it'll look pretty good maybe we'll
put fences on the logs

1172
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
put fences on the logs
 

1173
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,390
put fences on the logs
too

1174
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400

 

1175
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,990

it'll be nice to have a proper entrance

1176
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
it'll be nice to have a proper entrance
 

1177
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,149
it'll be nice to have a proper entrance
to get into here because i do

1178
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
to get into here because i do
 

1179
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,549
to get into here because i do
i do feel a little silly jumping down

1180
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:50,559
i do feel a little silly jumping down
 

1181
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,990
i do feel a little silly jumping down
holes all the time

1182
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
holes all the time
 

1183
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,990
holes all the time
to get down here

1184
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000

 

1185
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,549

it's not very convenient

1186
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
it's not very convenient
 

1187
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,630
it's not very convenient
cool well i think we're about done for

1188
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
cool well i think we're about done for
 

1189
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,669
cool well i think we're about done for
today aren't we

1190
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
today aren't we
 

1191
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,230
today aren't we
it's about that time uh

1192
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
it's about that time uh
 

1193
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,870
it's about that time uh
i guess maybe we'll head over to the

1194
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
i guess maybe we'll head over to the
 

1195
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,590
i guess maybe we'll head over to the
library

1196
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
library
 

1197
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,110
library
we should do one thing on the library

1198
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
we should do one thing on the library
 

1199
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,110
we should do one thing on the library
i'm going to wire up the door to it

1200
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
i'm going to wire up the door to it
 

1201
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,950
i'm going to wire up the door to it
today just so we make some progress on

1202
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
today just so we make some progress on
 

1203
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,870
today just so we make some progress on
it

1204
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880

 

1205
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,029

here we are at the library and i just

1206
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
here we are at the library and i just
 

1207
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,029
here we are at the library and i just
finished wiring the door so let's take a

1208
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
finished wiring the door so let's take a
 

1209
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,789
finished wiring the door so let's take a
quick look at it

1210
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
quick look at it
 

1211
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,269
quick look at it
so it's a three by three door with the

1212
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
so it's a three by three door with the
 

1213
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,950
so it's a three by three door with the
center missing

1214
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
center missing
 

1215
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,789
center missing
and this is what the pistons do on it we

1216
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
and this is what the pistons do on it we
 

1217
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,070
and this is what the pistons do on it we
have eight pistons

1218
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
have eight pistons
 

1219
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,549
have eight pistons
three per side and then one at the top

1220
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
three per side and then one at the top
 

1221
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,789
three per side and then one at the top
one at the bottom

1222
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
one at the bottom
 

1223
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,149
one at the bottom
and they all do a quick pulse like that

1224
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:48,159
and they all do a quick pulse like that
 

1225
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,350
and they all do a quick pulse like that
so if we put this here here

1226
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
so if we put this here here
 

1227
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,390
so if we put this here here
here here and

1228
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
here here and
 

1229
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,669
here here and
there there there and

1230
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
there there there and
 

1231
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,190
there there there and
there that's our door

1232
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
there that's our door
 

1233
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,310
there that's our door
just like that so this is a quick

1234
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320
just like that so this is a quick
 

1235
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,510
just like that so this is a quick
pulsing door

1236
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
pulsing door
 

1237
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,350
pulsing door
it leaves the blocks behind even though

1238
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
it leaves the blocks behind even though
 

1239
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,669
it leaves the blocks behind even though
it's sticky pistons

1240
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
it's sticky pistons
 

1241
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,310
it's sticky pistons
oh i guess we need we need to put some

1242
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
oh i guess we need we need to put some
 

1243
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,909
oh i guess we need we need to put some
courts there there

1244
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
courts there there
 

1245
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,190
courts there there
there and there too um

1246
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
there and there too um
 

1247
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,630
there and there too um
but yeah pretty cool the reason i really

1248
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
but yeah pretty cool the reason i really
 

1249
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,430
but yeah pretty cool the reason i really
like this door is because you can

1250
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
like this door is because you can
 

1251
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,830
like this door is because you can
run and keep going like it doesn't you

1252
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
run and keep going like it doesn't you
 

1253
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,669
run and keep going like it doesn't you
don't hit the door

1254
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
don't hit the door
 

1255
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,990
don't hit the door
as you run through it so that's pretty

1256
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
as you run through it so that's pretty
 

1257
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,029
as you run through it so that's pretty
cool

1258
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
cool
 

1259
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,990
cool
so this is the wiring goes up to the top

1260
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
so this is the wiring goes up to the top
 

1261
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,830
so this is the wiring goes up to the top
piston from there

1262
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
piston from there
 

1263
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,070
piston from there
half slabs the wire just goes back and

1264
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
half slabs the wire just goes back and
 

1265
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,029
half slabs the wire just goes back and
forth

1266
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
forth
 

1267
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,470
forth
up to the top and

1268
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
up to the top and
 

1269
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,669
up to the top and
underneath the pressure plates it goes

1270
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
underneath the pressure plates it goes
 

1271
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,549
underneath the pressure plates it goes
to a monostable circuit here it's just

1272
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559
to a monostable circuit here it's just
 

1273
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,789
to a monostable circuit here it's just
the piston that goes up and it lets

1274
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
the piston that goes up and it lets
 

1275
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,510
the piston that goes up and it lets
it turns it into a one tick pulse that

1276
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:55,520
it turns it into a one tick pulse that
 

1277
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,870
it turns it into a one tick pulse that
goes up to the middle

1278
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
goes up to the middle
 

1279
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,190
goes up to the middle
which goes up the side and it goes to

1280
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
which goes up the side and it goes to
 

1281
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,710
which goes up the side and it goes to
this this piston

1282
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
this this piston
 

1283
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,269
this this piston
over here and it can go underneath that

1284
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
over here and it can go underneath that
 

1285
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,269
over here and it can go underneath that
as well to the other side and that's how

1286
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
as well to the other side and that's how
 

1287
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:05,590
as well to the other side and that's how
it

1288
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
it
 

1289
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,350
it
it gets to there so

1290
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
it gets to there so
 

1291
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,110
it gets to there so
from the other side of the door exact

1292
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
from the other side of the door exact
 

1293
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,990
from the other side of the door exact
same thing just reversed

1294
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000
same thing just reversed
 

1295
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,029
same thing just reversed
and it's pretty simple so that's

1296
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,039
and it's pretty simple so that's
 

1297
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,830
and it's pretty simple so that's
that's one more thing done with the

1298
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:18,840
that's one more thing done with the
 

1299
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,549
that's one more thing done with the
library it's

1300
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
library it's
 

1301
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,070
library it's
fairly large though um it's okay we got

1302
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
fairly large though um it's okay we got
 

1303
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,830
fairly large though um it's okay we got
lots of space

1304
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:25,840
lots of space
 

1305
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,750
lots of space
it'll work out and we'll put a skin over

1306
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:27,760
it'll work out and we'll put a skin over
 

1307
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,590
it'll work out and we'll put a skin over
top this side too so you won't see all

1308
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
top this side too so you won't see all
 

1309
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,669
top this side too so you won't see all
this stuff

1310
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
this stuff
 

1311
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,269
this stuff
but yeah i picked out two comments for

1312
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
but yeah i picked out two comments for
 

1313
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,750
but yeah i picked out two comments for
today let's check these out

1314
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,760
today let's check these out
 

1315
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,630
today let's check these out
number one why do you only wear boots

1316
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
number one why do you only wear boots
 

1317
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,710
number one why do you only wear boots
for armor

1318
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
for armor
 

1319
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,310
for armor
i have a helmet on no i got this from

1320
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
i have a helmet on no i got this from
 

1321
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,789
i have a helmet on no i got this from
a mob last episode so i decided to just

1322
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
a mob last episode so i decided to just
 

1323
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,149
a mob last episode so i decided to just
put it on

1324
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
put it on
 

1325
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,789
put it on
this these are my boots protection three

1326
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
this these are my boots protection three
 

1327
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,310
this these are my boots protection three
feather falling four

1328
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320
feather falling four
 

1329
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,510
feather falling four
i always wear feather falling four boots

1330
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,520
i always wear feather falling four boots
 

1331
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,149
i always wear feather falling four boots
for ender pearls because they reduce the

1332
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
for ender pearls because they reduce the
 

1333
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,750
for ender pearls because they reduce the
fall damage you take from them

1334
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
fall damage you take from them
 

1335
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,029
fall damage you take from them
you can ender pearl a lot

1336
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039
you can ender pearl a lot
 

1337
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,750
you can ender pearl a lot
uh more often without any trouble

1338
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
uh more often without any trouble
 

1339
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,830
uh more often without any trouble
because normally you take 2.5 hertz of

1340
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840
because normally you take 2.5 hertz of
 

1341
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,510
