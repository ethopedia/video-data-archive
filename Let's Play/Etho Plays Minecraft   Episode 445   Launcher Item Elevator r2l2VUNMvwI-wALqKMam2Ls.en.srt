together and and see what the situation
is

74
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
is
 

75
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,109

though i'll be able to use a sword and i

84
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
though i'll be able to use a sword and i
 

85
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,590
though i'll be able to use a sword and i
should be able to

86
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
should be able to
 

87
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,510
should be able to
kill them all with one swing instead of

88
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
kill them all with one swing instead of
 

89
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,030
kill them all with one swing instead of
using the

90
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
using the
 

91
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,830
using the
the tnt explosion mechanic we had before

92
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
the tnt explosion mechanic we had before
 

93
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,350
the tnt explosion mechanic we had before
uh it'll be a lot simpler now but yeah i

94
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
uh it'll be a lot simpler now but yeah i
 

95
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,149
uh it'll be a lot simpler now but yeah i
i don't know how tricky this is gonna be

96
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
i don't know how tricky this is gonna be
 

97
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,789
i don't know how tricky this is gonna be
i think the

98
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
i think the
 

99
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,230
i think the
best thing to do is probably to go to

100
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
best thing to do is probably to go to
 

101
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,070
best thing to do is probably to go to
the very top and like

102
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
the very top and like
 

103
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,309
the very top and like
fall down one layer at a time and and

104
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
fall down one layer at a time and and
 

105
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,150
fall down one layer at a time and and
place the string that way maybe

106
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
place the string that way maybe
 

107
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,350
place the string that way maybe
i should have brought some blocks with

108
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
i should have brought some blocks with
 

109
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,150
i should have brought some blocks with
me ah

110
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
me ah
 

111
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,589
me ah
this little stack up here

112
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599

 

113
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,750

how high does this thing go oh here we

114
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
how high does this thing go oh here we
 

115
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,510
how high does this thing go oh here we
go here we go

116

go here we go
 

117
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,270
go here we go
127 okay so what goes uh below 128

118
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
127 okay so what goes uh below 128
 

119
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,990
127 okay so what goes uh below 128
was my original design with it i'm gonna

120
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
was my original design with it i'm gonna
 

121
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,910
was my original design with it i'm gonna
put a torch at the top

122
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
put a torch at the top
 

123
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,150

here's the problem though we have
 

125
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,229
here's the problem though we have
enderman stuck in here at and

126
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
enderman stuck in here at and
 

127
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,910

as i'm working on this i have to deal
with them i think

130
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
with them i think
 

131
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,750
with them i think
i should be able to hop down one layer

132
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
i should be able to hop down one layer
 

133
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,190
i should be able to hop down one layer
at a time

134
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
at a time
 

135
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,589
at a time

170
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
and it actually wasn't too difficult to
 

171
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,830
and it actually wasn't too difficult to
do that if an enderman got in my way

172
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
do that if an enderman got in my way
 

173
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,990
do that if an enderman got in my way
there's a trick you can do with them

174
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
there's a trick you can do with them
 

175
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,110
there's a trick you can do with them
if you look down

176
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120

 

177
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,550

i don't think there's any way for them

178
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
i don't think there's any way for them
 

179
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,270
i don't think there's any way for them
to get angry at you

180
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
to get angry at you
 

181
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,630
to get angry at you
even if you walk through them so that's

182
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
even if you walk through them so that's
 

183
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,149
even if you walk through them so that's
pretty good you even have a pretty good

184
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
pretty good you even have a pretty good
 

185
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,509
pretty good you even have a pretty good
amount of leeway like i think you can

186
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
amount of leeway like i think you can
 

187
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,149
amount of leeway like i think you can
walk like this

188
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
walk like this
 

189
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,430
walk like this
even but if you go a little bit

190
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
even but if you go a little bit
 

191
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,390
even but if you go a little bit
higher what is the range

192
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
higher what is the range
 

193
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,630
higher what is the range
that's the range right there you don't

194
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
that's the range right there you don't
 

195
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,990
that's the range right there you don't
want to aim your cursor

196
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
want to aim your cursor
 

197
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,309
want to aim your cursor
any higher than that uh but yeah now

198
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
any higher than that uh but yeah now
 

199
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,869
any higher than that uh but yeah now
that it's all done check this out so

200
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
that it's all done check this out so
 

201
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,110
that it's all done check this out so
we can use the sword to get the splash

202
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
we can use the sword to get the splash
 

203
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,309
we can use the sword to get the splash
damage

204
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
damage
 

205
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,470
damage
so when we attack one it it seems to

206
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
so when we attack one it it seems to
 

207
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,869
so when we attack one it it seems to
attack like a three by three area

208
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
attack like a three by three area
 

209
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,509
attack like a three by three area
which is pretty sweet so it does the

210
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
which is pretty sweet so it does the
 

211
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,270
which is pretty sweet so it does the
full damage of the sword to one target

212
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
full damage of the sword to one target
 

213
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,870
full damage of the sword to one target
and then i think like half a heart to

214
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
and then i think like half a heart to
 

215
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,789
and then i think like half a heart to
all the ones around it

216
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
all the ones around it
 

217
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,030
all the ones around it
and if you have looting on your sword

218
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
and if you have looting on your sword
 

219
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,710
and if you have looting on your sword
you do get the looting effect on the

220
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
you do get the looting effect on the
 

221
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,550
you do get the looting effect on the
ones you kill with splash damage too

222
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
ones you kill with splash damage too
 

223
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,950
ones you kill with splash damage too
which is cool

224
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
which is cool
 

225
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,550
which is cool
but uh yeah unfortunately this

226
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
but uh yeah unfortunately this
 

227
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,230
but uh yeah unfortunately this
this enderman farm wasn't designed for

228
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
this enderman farm wasn't designed for
 

229
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,710
this enderman farm wasn't designed for
this so there's more spread out than i

230
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
this so there's more spread out than i
 

231
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
this so there's more spread out than i
would like to take advantage of this

232
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
would like to take advantage of this
 

233
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,790
would like to take advantage of this
trick

234
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
trick
 

235
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,550
trick
if you guys build one nowadays you want

236
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
if you guys build one nowadays you want
 

237
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,270
if you guys build one nowadays you want
to try to get them all into a 3x3 area

238
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
to try to get them all into a 3x3 area
 

239
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,510
to try to get them all into a 3x3 area
so you can take full advantage of it but

240
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
so you can take full advantage of it but
 

241
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,550
so you can take full advantage of it but
it's pretty good even

242
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
it's pretty good even
 

243
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,550
it's pretty good even
even like this i would say

244
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560

 

245
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,909

oh man we're getting tons of levels

246
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
oh man we're getting tons of levels
 

247
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,270
oh man we're getting tons of levels
already

248
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280

 

249
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,310

all right so maybe i'll

250
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
all right so maybe i'll
 

251
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,670
all right so maybe i'll
enchant a couple of books here real

252
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
enchant a couple of books here real
 

253
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,150

00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
ran out of iron and glass blocks and
 

293
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,629
ran out of iron and glass blocks and
burper blocks and

294

ice yeah i thought when i was making

324
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
ice yeah i thought when i was making
 

325
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,629
ice yeah i thought when i was making
this originally that i could just put

326
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
this originally that i could just put
 

327
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,710
this originally that i could just put
slabs on both sides like i usually do so

328
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
slabs on both sides like i usually do so
 

329
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,230
slabs on both sides like i usually do so
you do like

330
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
you do like
 

331
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,790
you do like
slabs over here slaps over here and that

332
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
slabs over here slaps over here and that
 

333
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,830
slabs over here slaps over here and that
you would get the

334
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
you would get the
 

335
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,390
you would get the
uh slippery effect on the boat still

336
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
uh slippery effect on the boat still
 

337
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,309
uh slippery effect on the boat still
through the slab because it applies to

338
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
through the slab because it applies to
 

339
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,430
through the slab because it applies to
the player like

340
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
the player like
 

341
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,070
the player like
to your guy you see i'm kind of sliding

342
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
to your guy you see i'm kind of sliding
 

343
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,790
to your guy you see i'm kind of sliding
around on the

344
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
around on the
 

345
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,590
around on the
the slabs here so the ice effect is

346
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
the slabs here so the ice effect is
 

347
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,309
the slabs here so the ice effect is
still triggered

348
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
still triggered
 

349
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,150
still triggered
but if you do it with a boat

350
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
but if you do it with a boat
 

351
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,590
but if you do it with a boat
oh it's not going to let me place it is

352
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
oh it's not going to let me place it is
 

353
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,830
oh it's not going to let me place it is
it all right

354
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
it all right
 

355
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,230
it all right
yeah it's it's just like normal ground

356
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
yeah it's it's just like normal ground
 

357
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,830
yeah it's it's just like normal ground
you don't get the slippery effect

358
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
you don't get the slippery effect
 

359
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,309
you don't get the slippery effect
the speed effect from the ice and i

360
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
the speed effect from the ice and i
 

361
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,909
the speed effect from the ice and i
tried it with carpet and a few other

362
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
tried it with carpet and a few other
 

363
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,749
tried it with carpet and a few other
things so if you want to stop zombie big

364
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
things so if you want to stop zombie big
 

365
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,510
things so if you want to stop zombie big
man from spawning

366
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
man from spawning
 

367
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,469
man from spawning
you i don't know what you could use

368
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
you i don't know what you could use
 

369
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,950
you i don't know what you could use
besides rails if there is anything even

370
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
besides rails if there is anything even
 

371
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,950
besides rails if there is anything even
but they don't spawn on rails anymore so

372
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
but they don't spawn on rails anymore so
 

373
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,390
but they don't spawn on rails anymore so
i decided to go with that

374
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
i decided to go with that
 

375
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,950
i decided to go with that
i don't know if if buttons stop it i

376
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
i don't know if if buttons stop it i
 

377
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,710
i don't know if if buttons stop it i
need to look into the spawning mechanics

378
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
need to look into the spawning mechanics
 

379
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,830
need to look into the spawning mechanics
a bit more

380
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
a bit more
 

381
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,589
a bit more
uh because they've changed a lot

382
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
uh because they've changed a lot
 

383
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,830
uh because they've changed a lot
yeah rails are for sure safe to use to

384
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
yeah rails are for sure safe to use to
 

385
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,950
yeah rails are for sure safe to use to
stop the spawning

386
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
stop the spawning
 

387
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,629
stop the spawning
let's go for a bit of a ride here

388
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639

 

389
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,550

i went for a pretty simple design

390
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
i went for a pretty simple design
 

391
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,629
i went for a pretty simple design
nothing too crazy just so that would be

392
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
nothing too crazy just so that would be
 

393
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,550
nothing too crazy just so that would be
a little bit faster to build

394
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
a little bit faster to build
 

395
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,710
a little bit faster to build
still took many many hours though i

396
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
still took many many hours though i
 

397
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,710
still took many many hours though i
gotta say like

398
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
gotta say like
 

399
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,430
gotta say like
if you if you have to go a thousand

400
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
if you if you have to go a thousand
 

401
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,189
if you if you have to go a thousand
blocks in another even a simple design

402
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
blocks in another even a simple design
 

403
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,950
blocks in another even a simple design
like this is going to take you at least

404
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
like this is going to take you at least
 

405
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,629
like this is going to take you at least
three hours there's no way of doing it

406
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
three hours there's no way of doing it
 

407
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,469
three hours there's no way of doing it
any faster i don't think

408
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
any faster i don't think
 

409
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,749
any faster i don't think
because for for every

410
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
because for for every
 

411
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,110
because for for every
here let's slow down for a sec oh every

412
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120

 

413
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,189

let's see one block you go forward you

414
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
let's see one block you go forward you
 

415
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,550
let's see one block you go forward you
have to re

416
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
have to re
 

417
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,710
have to re
remove all the netherrack in this space

418
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
remove all the netherrack in this space
 

419
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,029
remove all the netherrack in this space
for example so

420
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
for example so
 

421
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,670
for example so
probably have to remove at least you

422
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
probably have to remove at least you
 

423
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,469
probably have to remove at least you
know 15

424
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
know 15
 

425
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,830
know 15
20 25 blocks right for your tunnel every

426
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
20 25 blocks right for your tunnel every
 

427
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,350
20 25 blocks right for your tunnel every
block so if you're going a thousand

428
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
block so if you're going a thousand
 

429
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,309
block so if you're going a thousand
blocks

430
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
blocks
 

431
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,589
blocks
that's 25 000. that's a lot of

432
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
that's 25 000. that's a lot of
 

433
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,309
that's 25 000. that's a lot of
netherrack

434
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
netherrack
 

435
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,830
netherrack
there's a lot of netherrack and then you

436
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
there's a lot of netherrack and then you
 

437
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,830
there's a lot of netherrack and then you
gotta place the blocks

438
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
gotta place the blocks
 

439
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,390
gotta place the blocks
and collect the materials to do it so

440
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
and collect the materials to do it so
 

441
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,469
and collect the materials to do it so
you got three blocks on this side three

442
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
you got three blocks on this side three
 

443
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,790
you got three blocks on this side three
three three that's twelve

444
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
three three that's twelve
 

445
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,390
three three that's twelve
even with the simple design if you put

446
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
even with the simple design if you put
 

447
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,949
even with the simple design if you put
blocks in the corner that's sixteen

448
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
blocks in the corner that's sixteen
 

449
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,430
blocks in the corner that's sixteen
times that by a thousand this tunnel's

450
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
times that by a thousand this tunnel's
 

451
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,949
times that by a thousand this tunnel's
actually fifteen hundred blocks long

452
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
actually fifteen hundred blocks long
 

453
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,990
actually fifteen hundred blocks long
though so

454
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
though so
 

455
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,909
though so
it's a lot of blocks you have to like

456
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
it's a lot of blocks you have to like
 

457
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,029
it's a lot of blocks you have to like
deal with

458
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
deal with
 

459
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,790
deal with
and there's only so fast you can place

460
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
and there's only so fast you can place
 

461
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,230
and there's only so fast you can place
them so

462
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
them so
 

463
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,310
them so
yeah if you do another tunnel design i

464
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
yeah if you do another tunnel design i
 

465
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,310
yeah if you do another tunnel design i
suggest you go simple don't do anything

466
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
suggest you go simple don't do anything
 

467
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,470
suggest you go simple don't do anything
too crazy i've learned the hard way

468
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
too crazy i've learned the hard way
 

469
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,550
too crazy i've learned the hard way
that it's just not worth it whoa

470
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
that it's just not worth it whoa
 

471
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,550
that it's just not worth it whoa
if you smack the boat with your sword it

472
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
if you smack the boat with your sword it
 

473
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:04,150
if you smack the boat with your sword it
just goes flying

474
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160

 

475
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,590

that was weird you know what else is

476
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
that was weird you know what else is
 

477
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,350
that was weird you know what else is
weird look at this so if you go up the

478
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
weird look at this so if you go up the
 

479
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,070
weird look at this so if you go up the
stairs

480
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080

 

481
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,829

sometimes it happens i think it depends

482
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
sometimes it happens i think it depends
 

483
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,630
sometimes it happens i think it depends
on just how he lines up with the stairs

484
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
on just how he lines up with the stairs
 

485
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,030
on just how he lines up with the stairs
but he does this like jitter jitter

486
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
but he does this like jitter jitter
 

487
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,509
but he does this like jitter jitter
climb

488
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519

 

489
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,870

and sometimes it's smooth like that

490
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
and sometimes it's smooth like that
 

491
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,670
and sometimes it's smooth like that
second second set was smooth there

492
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
second second set was smooth there
 

493
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,630
second second set was smooth there
uh-huh all right so guys it happened

494
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
uh-huh all right so guys it happened
 

495
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,070
uh-huh all right so guys it happened
again

496
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
again
 

497
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,509
again
something terrible oh we even did it

498
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
something terrible oh we even did it
 

499
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,190
something terrible oh we even did it
over there

500
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
over there
 

501
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,150
over there
yes there's a tiny staircase there uh

502
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160

yes there's a tiny staircase there uh
while building that nether tunnel

504
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
while building that nether tunnel
 

505
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,790
while building that nether tunnel
i needed a whole bunch of burper blocks

506
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
i needed a whole bunch of burper blocks
 

507
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,949
i needed a whole bunch of burper blocks
right so i used the coarse fruit farm

508
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
right so i used the coarse fruit farm
 

509
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,110
right so i used the coarse fruit farm
quite a bit and when i went to use it i

510
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
quite a bit and when i went to use it i
 

511
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,670
quite a bit and when i went to use it i
got a little bit of a surprise

512
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
got a little bit of a surprise
 

513
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,269
got a little bit of a surprise
we weren't getting any coarse fruit from

514
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
we weren't getting any coarse fruit from
 

515
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,110
we weren't getting any coarse fruit from
it like we made a system

516
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
it like we made a system
 

517
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,790
it like we made a system
to totally automate it like a collect

518
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
to totally automate it like a collect
 

519
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,310
to totally automate it like a collect
well not totally but it collects

520
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
well not totally but it collects
 

521
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,150
well not totally but it collects
the it breaks the plant collects all the

522
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
the it breaks the plant collects all the
 

523
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,630
the it breaks the plant collects all the
the drops together and then auto smelts

524
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
the drops together and then auto smelts
 

525
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,750
the drops together and then auto smelts
it right

526
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
it right
 

527
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,030
it right
when i went to use it though that did

528
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
when i went to use it though that did
 

529
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,389
when i went to use it though that did
not happen so it turns out

530
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
not happen so it turns out
 

531
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,389
not happen so it turns out
i totally forgot but we actually used an

532
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
i totally forgot but we actually used an
 

533
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,990
i totally forgot but we actually used an
item elevator

534
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
item elevator
 

535
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,750
item elevator
in our design for this thing there's a

536
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
in our design for this thing there's a
 

537
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,670
in our design for this thing there's a
tiny little spot here

538
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
tiny little spot here

we have to go up like five blocks you

540
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
we have to go up like five blocks you
 

541
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,269
we have to go up like five blocks you
know

542

know
 

543
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,190
know
not a big deal with old elevator design

544
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
not a big deal with old elevator design
 

545
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,190
not a big deal with old elevator design
but now we need

546
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
but now we need
 

547
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,790
but now we need
we need something else so guess what i

548
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
we need something else so guess what i
 

549
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,150
we need something else so guess what i
still don't know how to make an item

550
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160

i looked at some tutorials it seems like

554
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
i looked at some tutorials it seems like
 

555
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,069
i looked at some tutorials it seems like
the most common way of doing it

556
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
the most common way of doing it
 

557
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,710
the most common way of doing it
is with two trap doors um

558
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
is with two trap doors um
 

559
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,829
is with two trap doors um
one i i think you guys know what i'm

go up and the other one acts as a gate
 

565
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,910
go up and the other one acts as a gate
so the other items can't get through

566
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
so the other items can't get through
 

567

try to figure out something to do and
 

573
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,110
try to figure out something to do and
then figure out how to do it so

outside the box what's another way of

578
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
outside the box what's another way of
 

579

outside the box what's another way of
doing item elevators

580
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
doing item elevators
 

581
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,509
doing item elevators
and i might have come up with a good

582
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
and i might have come up with a good
 

583
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,310
and i might have come up with a good
idea here

584
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
idea here
 

585
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,269
idea here
we're gonna try to figure it out

586
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
we're gonna try to figure it out
 

587
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,230
we're gonna try to figure it out
together let's see

588
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
together let's see
 

589
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,269
together let's see
let's find a flatter spot to try this

590
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
let's find a flatter spot to try this
 

591
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,910
let's find a flatter spot to try this
looks like it all fully grew again um

592
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
looks like it all fully grew again um
 

593
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,350
looks like it all fully grew again um
just about there's a couple white ones

594
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
just about there's a couple white ones
 

595
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,829
just about there's a couple white ones
still

596
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
still
 

597
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,430
still
some of them grow very fast and some of

598
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
some of them grow very fast and some of
 

599
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,269
some of them grow very fast and some of
them take quite a while they stay

600
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
them take quite a while they stay
 

601
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,150
them take quite a while they stay
super short like look at these this

602
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
super short like look at these this
 

603
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,230
super short like look at these this
one's only

604
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
one's only
 

605
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,630
one's only
two blocks tall other ones are like

606
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
two blocks tall other ones are like
 

607
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,150
two blocks tall other ones are like
fully grown i don't know why it's

608
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
fully grown i don't know why it's
 

609
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,710
fully grown i don't know why it's
it varies so much alright

610
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
it varies so much alright
 

611
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,710
it varies so much alright
yeah so let's do this here's the idea

612
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
yeah so let's do this here's the idea
 

613
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,850
yeah so let's do this here's the idea
we are going to

614
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:37,860
we are going to
 

615
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,990
we are going to
[Music]

616
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
[Music]
 

617
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,790
[Music]
have our column of glass right i want to

618
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
have our column of glass right i want to
 

619
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,870
have our column of glass right i want to
have a sticky piston

620
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
have a sticky piston
 

621
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,630
have a sticky piston
push the items up and i meant to silk

622
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
push the items up and i meant to silk
 

623
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,550
push the items up and i meant to silk
touch that but somehow i switched out

624
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
touch that but somehow i switched out
 

625
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,590
touch that but somehow i switched out
my silk touch pick all right the block

626
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
my silk touch pick all right the block
 

627
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,430
my silk touch pick all right the block
will come up

628
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
will come up
 

629
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,470
will come up
and here is the great

630
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
and here is the great
 

631
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,230
and here is the great
idea i hope we're gonna use a dropper

632
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
idea i hope we're gonna use a dropper
 

633
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,670
idea i hope we're gonna use a dropper
to shoot the items down

634
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
to shoot the items down
 

635
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,550
to shoot the items down
and hopefully get around the whole like

636
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
and hopefully get around the whole like
 

637
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,710
and hopefully get around the whole like
timing issues with water streams and all

638
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
timing issues with water streams and all
 

639
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,990
timing issues with water streams and all
that kind of stuff

640
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
that kind of stuff
 

641
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,509
that kind of stuff
so we can activate this dropper through

642
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
so we can activate this dropper through
 

643
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,870
so we can activate this dropper through
the wall here and we can

644
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
the wall here and we can
 

645
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,190
the wall here and we can
also check if there's any items in it

646
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
also check if there's any items in it
 

647
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,030
also check if there's any items in it
pretty easily using a comparator so if

648
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
pretty easily using a comparator so if
 

649
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,990
pretty easily using a comparator so if
we have a comparator

650
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
we have a comparator
 

651
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,629
we have a comparator
here if there's anything in here

652
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
here if there's anything in here
 

653
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,310
here if there's anything in here
we can find out and then we can tell it

654
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
we can find out and then we can tell it
 

655
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,750
we can find out and then we can tell it
to shoot the item out then make the

656
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
to shoot the item out then make the
 

657
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,670
to shoot the item out then make the
piston activate and it'll shoot the item

658
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
piston activate and it'll shoot the item
 

659
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,310
piston activate and it'll shoot the item
up

660
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
up
 

661
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,949
up
right and the really cool thing about

662
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
right and the really cool thing about
 

663
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,069
right and the really cool thing about
doing it this way

664
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
doing it this way
 

665
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,509
doing it this way
let's let's build this up just a little

666
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
let's let's build this up just a little
 

667
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,350
let's let's build this up just a little
bit taller so we can check it out and

668
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
bit taller so we can check it out and
 

669
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,269
bit taller so we can check it out and
it's full glory here

670
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279

 

671
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,910

all right it's like a rocket elevator

672
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
all right it's like a rocket elevator
 

673
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,750
all right it's like a rocket elevator
it's super fast

674
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
it's super fast
 

675
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,190
it's super fast
you'll see what i mean in a second let's

676
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
you'll see what i mean in a second let's
 

677
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,829
you'll see what i mean in a second let's
put a

678
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
put a
 

679
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,910
put a
couple blocks in here oh yeah and to get

680
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
couple blocks in here oh yeah and to get
 

681
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,710
couple blocks in here oh yeah and to get
items into this dropper

682
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
items into this dropper
 

683
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,949
items into this dropper
i think we want to use a hopper like so

684
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
i think we want to use a hopper like so
 

685
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,110
i think we want to use a hopper like so
so you would have like your

686
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
so you would have like your
 

687
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,870
so you would have like your
your water stream drop the items off

688
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
your water stream drop the items off
 

689
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,389
your water stream drop the items off
into this hopper here

690
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
into this hopper here
 

691
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,389
into this hopper here
like you would have your ice stream

692
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
like you would have your ice stream
 

693
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,590
like you would have your ice stream
going into it

694
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
going into it
 

695
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,030
going into it
they'll go into the dropper use the

696
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
they'll go into the dropper use the
 

697
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,629
they'll go into the dropper use the
comparator to check it check when

698
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
comparator to check it check when
 

699
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,990
comparator to check it check when
there's items in there if there are

700
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
there's items in there if there are
 

701
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,310
there's items in there if there are
items in there make a clock runs

702
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
items in there make a clock runs
 

703
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,150
items in there make a clock runs
that shoots items out of here

704
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
that shoots items out of here
 

705
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,870
that shoots items out of here
this is being complicated shoots an item

706
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
this is being complicated shoots an item
 

707
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,430
this is being complicated shoots an item
out

708
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
out
 

709
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,829
out
or several and then activate the

710
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
or several and then activate the
 

711
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,030
or several and then activate the
piston over here

712
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040

 

713
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,949

i can't make a lever no oh man

714
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
i can't make a lever no oh man
 

715
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,829
i can't make a lever no oh man
tell you what let's do it like this

716
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839

 

717
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,710

and i'm totally missed it but yeah

718
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
and i'm totally missed it but yeah
 

719
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,710
and i'm totally missed it but yeah
something like that

720
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
something like that
 

721
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,870
something like that
um oops yeah let's put the glass blocks

722
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
um oops yeah let's put the glass blocks
 

723
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,150
um oops yeah let's put the glass blocks
back

724
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
back
 

725
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,670
back
fill it in properly i really need a

726
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
fill it in properly i really need a
 

727
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,590
fill it in properly i really need a
lever for here

728
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
lever for here
 

729
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,670
lever for here
and make a button okay let's do a button

730
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
and make a button okay let's do a button
 

731
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,829
and make a button okay let's do a button
that's better

732
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
that's better
 

733
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,310
that's better
alright so shoot an item out it goes

734
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
alright so shoot an item out it goes
 

735
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,990
alright so shoot an item out it goes
into that space there and then when this

736
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
into that space there and then when this
 

737
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,509
into that space there and then when this
gets activated

738
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519

 

739
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,990

it shoots it out the top super quickly

740
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
it shoots it out the top super quickly
 

741
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,509
it shoots it out the top super quickly
which is awesome

742
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
which is awesome
 

743
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,310
which is awesome
and even like flies through the air so

744
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
and even like flies through the air so
 

745
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,509
and even like flies through the air so
you could have it

746
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
you could have it
 

747
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,430
you could have it
an item elevator that's invisible

748
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
an item elevator that's invisible
 

749
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,790
an item elevator that's invisible
basically it'll shoot the item up

750
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
basically it'll shoot the item up
 

751
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,590
basically it'll shoot the item up
through the air

752
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
through the air
 

753
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,949
through the air
and then you can catch it at the top

754
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
and then you can catch it at the top
 

755
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,829
and then you can catch it at the top
there um

756
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
there um
 

757
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,949
there um
what i'm gonna have to do is figure out

758
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
what i'm gonna have to do is figure out
 

759
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,509
what i'm gonna have to do is figure out
exactly how to time all this stuff

760
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
exactly how to time all this stuff
 

761
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,110
exactly how to time all this stuff
because we need to make sure the items

762
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
because we need to make sure the items
 

763
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,870
because we need to make sure the items
aren't moving after they get shot out of

764
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
aren't moving after they get shot out of
 

765
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,550
aren't moving after they get shot out of
the dropper they need to settle

766
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
the dropper they need to settle
 

767
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,230
the dropper they need to settle
that's why we're shooting them down so

768
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240
that's why we're shooting them down so
 

769
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,990
that's why we're shooting them down so
that it

770
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
that it
 

771
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,470
that it
has that velocity to go downwards so

772
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
has that velocity to go downwards so
 

773
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,150
has that velocity to go downwards so
they'll settle to the block there

774
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
they'll settle to the block there
 

775
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,509
they'll settle to the block there
quicker than if we were to shoot it

776
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
quicker than if we were to shoot it
 

777
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,870
quicker than if we were to shoot it
sideways or something

778
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
sideways or something
 

779
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,470
sideways or something
you know all right

780
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
you know all right
 

781
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,110
you know all right
okay so yeah this may or may not be a

782
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
okay so yeah this may or may not be a
 

783
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,870
okay so yeah this may or may not be a
good item elevator in the end of this

784
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
good item elevator in the end of this
 

785
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,310
good item elevator in the end of this
i'm not sure

786
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
i'm not sure
 

787
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,189
i'm not sure
i'm designing it as we go here i realize

788
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
i'm designing it as we go here i realize
 

789
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,949
i'm designing it as we go here i realize
though the biggest flaw it's gonna have

790
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
though the biggest flaw it's gonna have
 

791
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,030
though the biggest flaw it's gonna have
is the time it takes for the items to

792
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
is the time it takes for the items to
 

793
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,350
is the time it takes for the items to
shoot out of the dropper and settle

794
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
shoot out of the dropper and settle
 

795
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,110
shoot out of the dropper and settle
so that they stop moving on top of the

796
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
so that they stop moving on top of the
 

797
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,030
so that they stop moving on top of the
block there and then it's gonna take

798
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
block there and then it's gonna take
 

799
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,269
block there and then it's gonna take
two redstone ticks for the piston to

800
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
two redstone ticks for the piston to
 

801
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,110
two redstone ticks for the piston to
extend

802
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
extend
 

803
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,150
extend
and retract so in total that might be

804
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
and retract so in total that might be
 

805
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,470
and retract so in total that might be
like

806
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
like
 

807
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,030
like
four redstone ticks if i was to guess

808
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
four redstone ticks if i was to guess
 

809
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,710
four redstone ticks if i was to guess
which doesn't sound like much

810
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
which doesn't sound like much
 

811
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,310
which doesn't sound like much
in that time you can shoot two items

812
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
in that time you can shoot two items
 

813
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,310
in that time you can shoot two items
from the dropper but that's time

814
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
from the dropper but that's time
 

815
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,110
from the dropper but that's time
where we have to stop this so if we're

816
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
where we have to stop this so if we're
 

817
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,150
where we have to stop this so if we're
doing one item

818
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
doing one item
 

819
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,230
doing one item
at a time it will take a very long time

820
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
at a time it will take a very long time
 

821
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,430
at a time it will take a very long time
between each item

822
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
between each item
 

823
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,910
between each item
so i think we're gonna have to do do it

824
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
so i think we're gonna have to do do it
 

825
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,509
so i think we're gonna have to do do it
in batches and then trigger

826
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
in batches and then trigger
 

827
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,910
in batches and then trigger
the piston so we might use a circuit

828
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
the piston so we might use a circuit
 

829
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,350
the piston so we might use a circuit
like this

830
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
like this
 

831
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,030
like this
to do that this is kind of kind of cool

832
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
to do that this is kind of kind of cool
 

833
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,829
to do that this is kind of kind of cool
basically we got two comparators here to

834
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
basically we got two comparators here to
 

835
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,790
basically we got two comparators here to
give it a

836
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
give it a
 

837
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,949
give it a
a thing you see how the signal slowly

838
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
a thing you see how the signal slowly
 

839
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,829
a thing you see how the signal slowly
disappears there

840
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
disappears there
 

841
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,230
disappears there
oh it's got to be a pulse though i think

842
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
oh it's got to be a pulse though i think
 

843
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,189
oh it's got to be a pulse though i think
yeah so it slowly fades away in that

844
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
yeah so it slowly fades away in that
 

845
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,150
yeah so it slowly fades away in that
time

846
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
time
 

847
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,790
time
we loop this comparator back to itself

848
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
we loop this comparator back to itself
 

849
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,710
we loop this comparator back to itself
and that activates the comparator clock

850
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
and that activates the comparator clock
 

851
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,910
and that activates the comparator clock
which will shoot items out of the

852
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
which will shoot items out of the
 

853
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,910
which will shoot items out of the
dropper as quick as possible

854
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
dropper as quick as possible
 

855
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,949
dropper as quick as possible
and then when it stops that's one will

856
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
and then when it stops that's one will
 

857
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,550
and then when it stops that's one will
probably trigger the piston so i think

858
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
probably trigger the piston so i think
 

859
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,990
probably trigger the piston so i think
we could even do something like a

860
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
we could even do something like a
 

861
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,509
we could even do something like a
redstone torch here

862
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
redstone torch here
 

863
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,310
redstone torch here
to figure out when it's done let's try

864
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
to figure out when it's done let's try
 

865
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,990
to figure out when it's done let's try
this again

866
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000

 

867
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,870

oh it does flash actually hmm

868
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880

 

869
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,110

maybe we put it over here

870
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120

 

871
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,470

stays off and when it's done it turns on

872
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
stays off and when it's done it turns on
 

873
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,310
stays off and when it's done it turns on
so when it goes on it would trigger the

874
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
so when it goes on it would trigger the
 

875
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,430
so when it goes on it would trigger the
piston

876
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440

 

877
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,550

well i don't know what to tell you guys

878
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
well i don't know what to tell you guys
 

879
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,550
well i don't know what to tell you guys
i thought i had something really cool

880
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
i thought i had something really cool
 

881
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,910
i thought i had something really cool
here

882
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
here
 

883
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,230
here
a very nice eloquent redstone circuit

884
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240

 

885
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,550

that did pulse it did pulse but this did

886
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
that did pulse it did pulse but this did
 

887
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,389
that did pulse it did pulse but this did
not change

888
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
not change
 

889
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,389
not change
uh i have discovered some

890
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
uh i have discovered some
 

891
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,429
uh i have discovered some
inconsistencies with redstone doing this

892
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
inconsistencies with redstone doing this
 

893
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,510
inconsistencies with redstone doing this
all right and that works exactly like i

894
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
all right and that works exactly like i
 

895
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,949
all right and that works exactly like i
want this one works

896
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
want this one works
 

897
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,390
want this one works
right

898
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400

 

899
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,510

sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does

900
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does
 

901
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,230
sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does
weird things

902
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240

 

903
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,150

what time it works yeah if you look at

904
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
what time it works yeah if you look at
 

905
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,669
what time it works yeah if you look at
this though

906
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
this though
 

907
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,270
this though
you see the shape of the redstone so at

908
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
you see the shape of the redstone so at
 

909
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,870
you see the shape of the redstone so at
the bottom left we have redstone

910
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
the bottom left we have redstone
 

911
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,549
the bottom left we have redstone
top left and top middle right and bottom

912
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
top left and top middle right and bottom
 

913
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,350
top left and top middle right and bottom
right

914
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
right
 

915
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,270
right
if we go over here that's exactly what i

916
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
if we go over here that's exactly what i
 

917
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,470
if we go over here that's exactly what i
did i i'm

918
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
did i i'm
 

919
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,549
did i i'm
there's no way i did any any different

920
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
there's no way i did any any different
 

921
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,990
there's no way i did any any different
right bottom left

922
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000

right
 

927
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,150
right
it's the exact same thing this is the

928
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
it's the exact same thing this is the
 

929
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,190
it's the exact same thing this is the
comparator that was switched

930
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200

 

931
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,070

i don't know and even if we get rid of

932
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
i don't know and even if we get rid of
 

933
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,390
i don't know and even if we get rid of
this thing and we use a lever

934
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
this thing and we use a lever
 

935
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,430
this thing and we use a lever
like we have down there

936
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
like we have down there
 

937
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,270
like we have down there
like look at this this comparator is

938
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
like look at this this comparator is
 

939
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,029
like look at this this comparator is
stuck on right now

940
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
stuck on right now
 

941
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,549
stuck on right now
it's being powered even though it's not

942
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
it's being powered even though it's not
 

943
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,390
it's being powered even though it's not
powered i don't i don't get what's going

944
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
powered i don't i don't get what's going
 

945
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,789
powered i don't i don't get what's going
on

946
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
on
 

947
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,350
on
in this world and this redstone dust is

948
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
in this world and this redstone dust is
 

949
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,390
in this world and this redstone dust is
not getting powered by it

950
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
not getting powered by it
 

951
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,470
not getting powered by it
that's got to be a visual glitch right

952
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480

 

953
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,510

so confused lever

954
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
so confused lever
 

955
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,070
so confused lever

guys if you know what's wrong

966
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
guys if you know what's wrong
 

967
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,830
guys if you know what's wrong
please let me know i do not understand

968
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
please let me know i do not understand
 

969
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,750
please let me know i do not understand
this and it's very frustrating i was

970
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
this and it's very frustrating i was
 

971
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,230
this and it's very frustrating i was
trying to avoid using a hopper clock

972
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
trying to avoid using a hopper clock
 

973
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,950
trying to avoid using a hopper clock
i wanted to try to make this simple but

974
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
i wanted to try to make this simple but
 

975
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,990
i wanted to try to make this simple but
that's out the window now i think

976
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
that's out the window now i think
 

977
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,350
that's out the window now i think
aha so guys i replaced that comparator

978
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
aha so guys i replaced that comparator
 

979
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,909
aha so guys i replaced that comparator
gizmo with a hopper clock over there

980
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
gizmo with a hopper clock over there
 

981
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,430
gizmo with a hopper clock over there
and as you can see it looks pretty

982
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
and as you can see it looks pretty
 

983
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,110
and as you can see it looks pretty
complicated

984
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
complicated
 

985
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,630
complicated
uh that was the advantage of the

986
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
uh that was the advantage of the
 

987
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,789
uh that was the advantage of the
comparative thing it looks simple you

988
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
comparative thing it looks simple you
 

989
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,350
comparative thing it looks simple you
know

990
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
know
 

991
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,350
know
now we got all this all this mess there

992
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
now we got all this all this mess there
 

993
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,230
now we got all this all this mess there
but it does seem to work pretty good

994
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
but it does seem to work pretty good
 

995
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,549
but it does seem to work pretty good
let's try it out so we throw that into

996
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
let's try it out so we throw that into
 

997
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,470
let's try it out so we throw that into
our hoppers

998
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
our hoppers
 

999
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,150
our hoppers
which are now funneling into the dropper

1000
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
which are now funneling into the dropper
 

1001
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,270
which are now funneling into the dropper
and with our timing gizmo we now

1002
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
and with our timing gizmo we now
 

1003
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,870
and with our timing gizmo we now
receive fat dice in midair

1004
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
receive fat dice in midair
 

1005
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,710
receive fat dice in midair
so it shoots it up at us which is a

1006
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
so it shoots it up at us which is a
 

1007
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,750
so it shoots it up at us which is a
really cool effect

1008
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760

 

1009
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,430

quite a distance too actually isn't it

1010
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
quite a distance too actually isn't it
 

1011
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,070
quite a distance too actually isn't it
now i don't know how consistent this is

1012
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
now i don't know how consistent this is
 

1013
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,110
now i don't know how consistent this is
like it seems

1014
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
like it seems
 

1015
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,510
like it seems
good yeah we got all 59 back

1016
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
good yeah we got all 59 back
 

1017
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,310
good yeah we got all 59 back
let's try it one more time i'm worried

1018
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
let's try it one more time i'm worried
 

1019
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,750
let's try it one more time i'm worried
that's the thing if i make my

1020
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
that's the thing if i make my
 

1021
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,590
that's the thing if i make my
if i use my own design i have to worry

1022
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
if i use my own design i have to worry
 

1023
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,669
if i use my own design i have to worry
about losing items

1024
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:51,679
about losing items
 

1025
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,830
about losing items
like if there's a problem with this i

1026
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
like if there's a problem with this i
 

1027
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,950
like if there's a problem with this i
really need to

1028
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
really need to
 

1029
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,750
really need to
find it before i switch over to using

1030
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
find it before i switch over to using
 

1031
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,230
find it before i switch over to using
this

1032
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240

 

1033
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,470

oh oh that's because we were too far

1034
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
oh oh that's because we were too far
 

1035
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,590
oh oh that's because we were too far
away though

1036
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
away though
 

1037
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,870
away though
uh-huh okay it's looking good looks like

1038
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
uh-huh okay it's looking good looks like
 

1039
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,110
uh-huh okay it's looking good looks like
we missed one block there but it did go

1040
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
we missed one block there but it did go
 

1041
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,830
we missed one block there but it did go
up straight

1042
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
up straight
 

1043
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,710
up straight
we were just too far away to grab it 44

1044
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720

 

1045
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,590

58 plus the one down there

1046
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600

 

1047
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,029

aha cool so that's that's quite a

1048
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
aha cool so that's that's quite a
 

1049
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,029
aha cool so that's that's quite a
distance one two three four five

1050
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
distance one two three four five
 

1051
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,510
distance one two three four five
six seven eight nine about ten blocks i

1052
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
six seven eight nine about ten blocks i
 

1053
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,190
six seven eight nine about ten blocks i
would say that shoots it

1054
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
would say that shoots it
 

1055
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,190
would say that shoots it
which is cool here i'll show you it

1056
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
which is cool here i'll show you it
 

1057
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,470
which is cool here i'll show you it
working down low here

1058
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
working down low here
 

1059
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,990
working down low here
it looks really neat

1060
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000

 

1061
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,310

it shoots items into the empty space the

1062
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
it shoots items into the empty space the
 

1063
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,789
it shoots items into the empty space the
void space

1064
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
void space
 

1065
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,430
void space
and it stops for a brief moment there

1066
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
and it stops for a brief moment there
 

1067
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,669
and it stops for a brief moment there
and then the piston extends up

1068
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679

 

1069
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,510

and however many items you wanted to

1070
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
and however many items you wanted to
 

1071
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,270
and however many items you wanted to
shoot you can adjust with the hopper

1072
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
shoot you can adjust with the hopper
 

1073
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,990
shoot you can adjust with the hopper
clock which is

1074
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
clock which is
 

1075
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,630
clock which is
cool kind of kind of a neat effect to it

1076
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
cool kind of kind of a neat effect to it
 

1077
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,190
cool kind of kind of a neat effect to it
it definitely has some cons compared to

1078
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
it definitely has some cons compared to
 

1079
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,070
it definitely has some cons compared to
the other

1080
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
the other
 

1081
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,990
the other
item elevator designs i've seen like

1082
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
item elevator designs i've seen like
 

1083
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,750
item elevator designs i've seen like
most of them

1084
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
most of them
 

1085
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,909
most of them
can handle a continuous stream this

1086
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
can handle a continuous stream this
 

1087
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,149
can handle a continuous stream this
cannot it has to pause

1088
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
cannot it has to pause
 

1089
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,190
cannot it has to pause
and also you're limited

1090
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
and also you're limited
 

1091
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,350
and also you're limited
how fast you can inject items into the

1092
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
how fast you can inject items into the
 

1093
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,710
how fast you can inject items into the
dropper

1094
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
dropper
 

1095
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,950
dropper
by the speed of the hoppers you could

1096
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
by the speed of the hoppers you could
 

1097
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,830
by the speed of the hoppers you could
set up another

1098
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
set up another
 

1099
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,630
set up another
thing of hoppers on this side but how do

1100
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
thing of hoppers on this side but how do
 

1101
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,430
thing of hoppers on this side but how do
you get

1102
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
you get
 

1103
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,190
you get
the items to go into both sets of

1104
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
the items to go into both sets of
 

1105
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,390
the items to go into both sets of
hoppers i'm not sure

1106
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400

 

1107
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,390

this is our little setup here it's got

1108
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
this is our little setup here it's got
 

1109
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,070
this is our little setup here it's got
some

1110
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
some
 

1111
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,549
some
eight blocks in there for right now so

1112
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
eight blocks in there for right now so
 

1113
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,070
eight blocks in there for right now so
if there's

1114
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
if there's
 

1115
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,710
if there's
items in here it unlocks the hopper

1116
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
items in here it unlocks the hopper
 

1117
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,710
items in here it unlocks the hopper
clock this torch goes off

1118
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
clock this torch goes off
 

1119
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,789
clock this torch goes off
which allows us to run these are both

1120
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
which allows us to run these are both
 

1121
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,630
which allows us to run these are both
sticky pistons

1122
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
sticky pistons
 

1123
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,549
sticky pistons
and then if there's no items in here

1124
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
and then if there's no items in here
 

1125
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,710
and then if there's no items in here
this comparator is off so this the

1126
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
this comparator is off so this the
 

1127
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,630
this comparator is off so this the
comparator clock here doesn't run

1128
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
comparator clock here doesn't run
 

1129
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,950
comparator clock here doesn't run
but when this hopper clock is running

1130
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
but when this hopper clock is running
 

1131
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,549
but when this hopper clock is running
this turns on

1132
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
this turns on
 

1133
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,270
this turns on
which allows the comparator clock to run

1134
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
which allows the comparator clock to run
 

1135
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,669
which allows the comparator clock to run
which

1136
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
which
 

1137
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,029
which
makes it shoot items out of the dropper

1138
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
makes it shoot items out of the dropper
 

1139
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,110
makes it shoot items out of the dropper
and also it goes down here

1140
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
and also it goes down here
 

1141
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,270
and also it goes down here
to our piston oops

1142
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280
to our piston oops
 

1143
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,909
to our piston oops
yeah over here so every cycle with the

1144
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
yeah over here so every cycle with the
 

1145
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,870
yeah over here so every cycle with the
hopper clock

1146
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
hopper clock
 

1147
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,149
hopper clock
there's a brief moment where

1148
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
there's a brief moment where
 

1149
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,710
there's a brief moment where
there's no items in here like eight

1150
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
there's no items in here like eight
 

1151
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,430
there's no items in here like eight
items here

1152
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
items here
 

1153
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,870
items here
flow slowly into this one right and then

1154
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
flow slowly into this one right and then
 

1155
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,310
flow slowly into this one right and then
there'll be eight items in here then

1156
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
there'll be eight items in here then
 

1157
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,870
there'll be eight items in here then
they flow

1158
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
they flow
 

1159
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,430
they flow
out and there'll be a brief moment where

1160
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
out and there'll be a brief moment where
 

1161
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,230
out and there'll be a brief moment where
there'll be none

1162
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
there'll be none
 

1163
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,270
there'll be none
in here and that's the start of the next

1164
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
in here and that's the start of the next
 

1165
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,630
in here and that's the start of the next
cycle basically

1166
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
cycle basically
 

1167
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,669
cycle basically
in that moment we we make this piston

1168
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
in that moment we we make this piston
 

1169
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,549
in that moment we we make this piston
extend up

1170
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
extend up
 

1171
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,789
extend up
so we take advantage of it and

1172
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:44,799
so we take advantage of it and
 

1173
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,070
so we take advantage of it and
yeah kind of cool

1174
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
yeah kind of cool
 

1175
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,470
yeah kind of cool
okay guys so right now we are over at

1176
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
okay guys so right now we are over at
 

1177
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,990
okay guys so right now we are over at
the purper farm

1178
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
the purper farm
 

1179
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,230
the purper farm
on the auto smelting line here so i

1180
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
on the auto smelting line here so i
 

1181
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,270
on the auto smelting line here so i
replaced that

1182
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
replaced that
 

1183
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,230
replaced that
item elevator we tore out with this new

1184
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
item elevator we tore out with this new
 

1185
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,669
item elevator we tore out with this new
one we designed

1186
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
one we designed
 

1187
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,430
one we designed
and this will be a good test just to try

1188
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
and this will be a good test just to try
 

1189
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,190
and this will be a good test just to try
it out see if it works if we lose the

1190
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
it out see if it works if we lose the
 

1191
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,110
it out see if it works if we lose the
odd purper block i don't mind

1192
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120

 

1193
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,029

this this is a bit overkill for this i

1194
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
this this is a bit overkill for this i
 

1195
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,470
this this is a bit overkill for this i
think

1196
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
think
 

1197
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,230
think
unfortunately we're not taking advantage

1198
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
unfortunately we're not taking advantage
 

1199
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,430
unfortunately we're not taking advantage
of the item shooting

1200
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440

 

1201
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,950

oh it actually shot over to the side hmm

1202
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
oh it actually shot over to the side hmm
 

1203
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,710
oh it actually shot over to the side hmm
i don't know

1204
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720

 

1205
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,590

that was odd okay well we'll try it out

1206
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
that was odd okay well we'll try it out
 

1207
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,669
that was odd okay well we'll try it out
so where do they come up they come up

1208
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
so where do they come up they come up
 

1209
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,270
so where do they come up they come up
right here this will be

1210
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
right here this will be
 

1211
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,630
right here this will be
where the ice stream continues so we can

1212
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
where the ice stream continues so we can
 

1213
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,390
where the ice stream continues so we can
then put a block over top if we don't

1214
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
then put a block over top if we don't
 

1215
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,870
then put a block over top if we don't
want it

1216
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
want it
 

1217
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,549
want it
shooting up through the land like we

1218
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
shooting up through the land like we
 

1219
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,310
shooting up through the land like we
have it currently

1220
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
have it currently
 

1221
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,750
have it currently
that should stop it let's uh let's throw

1222
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
that should stop it let's uh let's throw
 

1223
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,230
that should stop it let's uh let's throw
a couple items in again just to try that

1224
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240

 

1225
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,269

all right and it should be good to go i

1226
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
all right and it should be good to go i
 

1227
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,870
all right and it should be good to go i
would say

1228
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
would say
 

1229
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,390
would say
see if anything flies out no it stopped

1230
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
see if anything flies out no it stopped
 

1231
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,070
see if anything flies out no it stopped
it's good

1232
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
it's good
 

1233
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,110
it's good
and one more time no that was everything

1234
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
and one more time no that was everything
 

1235
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,590
and one more time no that was everything
okay so i didn't adjust how many items

1236
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
okay so i didn't adjust how many items
 

1237
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,789
okay so i didn't adjust how many items
shoot it at a time

1238
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
shoot it at a time
 

1239
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,549
shoot it at a time
by how many items i put in the hopper

1240
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
by how many items i put in the hopper
 

1241
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,149
by how many items i put in the hopper
clock there by the way so we could have

1242
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
clock there by the way so we could have
 

1243
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,750
clock there by the way so we could have
it do a full stack at a time or whatever

1244
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
it do a full stack at a time or whatever
 

1245
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,269
it do a full stack at a time or whatever
yeah so to try it out we're just going

1246
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
yeah so to try it out we're just going
 

1247
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,510
yeah so to try it out we're just going
to do a quick harvest here at the perper

1248
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
to do a quick harvest here at the perper
 

1249
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,870
to do a quick harvest here at the perper
farm

1250
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
farm
 

1251
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,590
farm
or coarse fruit farm it's easy to mix

1252
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
or coarse fruit farm it's easy to mix
 

1253
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,029
or coarse fruit farm it's easy to mix
the two up

1254
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
the two up
 

1255
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,710
the two up
it starts out as coarse fruit and then

1256
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
it starts out as coarse fruit and then
 

1257
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,310
it starts out as coarse fruit and then
it becomes purper

1258
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
it becomes purper
 

1259
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,789
it becomes purper
all right so just doing the final couple

1260

breaks
 

1263
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,669
breaks

on the sides here maybe i should do
 

1289
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,269
on the sides here maybe i should do
something about that

1290
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
something about that
 

1291
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,350

and 16. let's run around and just see

1294
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
and 16. let's run around and just see
 

1295
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,430
and 16. let's run around and just see
what we get here

1296
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,440
what we get here
 

1297
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,230
what we get here
but it is a little bit and sometimes

1298
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
but it is a little bit and sometimes
 

1299
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,549
but it is a little bit and sometimes
they get trapped in the stairs here even

1300
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:24,559

 

1301
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,310

yeah not too bad like i could uh

1302
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
yeah not too bad like i could uh
 

1303
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,990
yeah not too bad like i could uh
get rid of these stairs and put block

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,390
full blocks there instead
i did that for uh decorative looks

1308
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,400

 

1309
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,390

oh yeah and over on the very end here

or the the plants they grow too far over
 

1319
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,789
or the the plants they grow too far over
i should say

1320
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:48,799
i should say
 

1321
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,350
i should say
all right anyways i'm rambling let's go

1322
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
all right anyways i'm rambling let's go
 

1323
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,789
all right anyways i'm rambling let's go
check this out so we got

1324
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
check this out so we got
 

1325
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,269
check this out so we got
maybe like 15 or 20 of each there

1326
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
maybe like 15 or 20 of each there
 

1327
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,110
maybe like 15 or 20 of each there
so it's shooting items down the item

1328
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
so it's shooting items down the item
 

1329
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,350
so it's shooting items down the item
stream

1330
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
stream
 

1331
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,029
stream
all right and

1332
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039

 

1333
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,549

it goes quite a ways actually so let's

1334
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,149
something out of redstone and then it
doesn't work

is it because maybe this isn't built up
 

1371
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,870
is it because maybe this isn't built up
all the way

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880

 

1373
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,310

it needs that extra air space so that it
 

1417
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,470
