it chains them down the brewing stands
 

147
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,650
it chains them down the brewing stands
here and they end up in all these chests

259
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,480
you can't glitch mobs through the floor
anymore so a lot of the standard designs

260
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,490
anymore so a lot of the standard designs
 

261
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,350
anymore so a lot of the standard designs
aren't aren't really applicable and that

262
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
aren't aren't really applicable and that
 

263
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,420
aren't aren't really applicable and that
was a voicecrack applicable anymore so I

264
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,430
was a voicecrack applicable anymore so I
 

265
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,820
was a voicecrack applicable anymore so I
sort of have free rein to do whatever I

266
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:48,830
sort of have free rein to do whatever I
 

267
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,309
sort of have free rein to do whatever I
want here without being tempted to go

268
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:51,319
want here without being tempted to go
 

269
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,290
want here without being tempted to go
the standard method you know so I've had

270
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,300
the standard method you know so I've had
 

271
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,830
the standard method you know so I've had
a couple ideas with this I think it's

272
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:56,840
a couple ideas with this I think it's
 

273
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,369
a couple ideas with this I think it's
going to be pretty cool all right

274
00:06:59,369 --> 00:06:59,379
going to be pretty cool all right
 

275
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,059
going to be pretty cool all right
especially since we're building it out

276
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:01,069
especially since we're building it out
 

277
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,879
especially since we're building it out
of ice you know it doesn't get get much

278
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:03,889
of ice you know it doesn't get get much
 

279
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,529
of ice you know it doesn't get get much
cooler than that oops so it is a seven

280
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:08,539
cooler than that oops so it is a seven
 

281
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:10,570
cooler than that oops so it is a seven
by nine area and there's three layers

282
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:10,580
by nine area and there's three layers
 

283
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,119
by nine area and there's three layers
and you start it at the the foot of the

284
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:15,129
and you start it at the the foot of the
 

285
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:18,640
and you start it at the the foot of the
witch huts is the way it works so I'm

286
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:18,650
witch huts is the way it works so I'm
 

287
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,929
witch huts is the way it works so I'm
going to fill these in then I'm going to

288
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:19,939
going to fill these in then I'm going to
 

289
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,879
going to fill these in then I'm going to
fill in our Sun shield here and we'll

290
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:21,889
fill in our Sun shield here and we'll
 

291
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:23,469
fill in our Sun shield here and we'll
climb up the ladder and just see if we

292
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:23,479
climb up the ladder and just see if we
 

293
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:24,760
climb up the ladder and just see if we
can get any spawns here

294
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:24,770
can get any spawns here
 

295
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,469
can get any spawns here
I haven't lit any of the caves and that

296

299
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,739
we haven't finished clearing the land
but I think during the day we can

300
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:32,749
but I think during the day we can
 

301
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:37,929
but I think during the day we can
actually get witnesses spawn here and we

302
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:37,939
actually get witnesses spawn here and we
 

303
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,089
actually get witnesses spawn here and we
are just about done with the Sun shield

304
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:40,099

00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:58,490
far know mom's okay I didn't think there
 

321
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,800
far know mom's okay I didn't think there
would be because we haven't left that

322
00:07:59,800 --> 00:07:59,810
would be because we haven't left that
 

323
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,209
would be because we haven't left that
area as we get a little farther away

324
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:03,219
area as we get a little farther away
 

325
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,679
area as we get a little farther away
chances of us getting a witch to spawn

326
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:05,689
chances of us getting a witch to spawn
 

327
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,689
chances of us getting a witch to spawn
they're pretty low I don't think it'll

328
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:07,699
they're pretty low I don't think it'll
 

329
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,679
they're pretty low I don't think it'll
actually happen and I'm assuming they

330
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:11,689
actually happen and I'm assuming they
 

331
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,959
actually happen and I'm assuming they
spawn on packed ice I'm that's right

332
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:13,969
spawn on packed ice I'm that's right
 

333
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:17,170
spawn on packed ice I'm that's right
right oh it better be right or this is

334
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:17,180
right oh it better be right or this is
 

335
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,820
right oh it better be right or this is
gonna be a big disaster I recall that

336
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:21,830
gonna be a big disaster I recall that
 

337
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,999
gonna be a big disaster I recall that
they do though there's so many facts to

338
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:25,009
they do though there's so many facts to
 

339
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,510
they do though there's so many facts to
this game I often forgets so many of

340
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:28,520
this game I often forgets so many of
 

341
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,909
this game I often forgets so many of
them that I that I know at some point

342
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:30,919
them that I that I know at some point
 

343
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,500
them that I that I know at some point
and then it just gets pushed out of my

344
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:32,510
and then it just gets pushed out of my
 

345
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,529
and then it just gets pushed out of my
head by another one or two facts that

346
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:35,539
head by another one or two facts that
 

347
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,230
head by another one or two facts that
come out okay but let's look at our our

348
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
come out okay but let's look at our our
 

349
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,309
come out okay but let's look at our our
II so near the top left there easy Roe /

350
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:42,319
II so near the top left there easy Roe /
 

351
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,630

ish we want to climb up until that gets

354
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,260
ish we want to climb up until that gets
 

355
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,950
ish we want to climb up until that gets
to like zero so I made sure to build

356
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:47,960
to like zero so I made sure to build
 

357
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,680
to like zero so I made sure to build
this pretty tall once we get up to about

358
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:50,690
this pretty tall once we get up to about
 

359
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,320
this pretty tall once we get up to about
192 I don't think we'll have any mobs at

360
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,330
192 I don't think we'll have any mobs at
 

361
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,900
192 I don't think we'll have any mobs at
start decrease now we're going down 60s

362
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:55,910
start decrease now we're going down 60s
 

363
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:03,310
start decrease now we're going down 60s
50s 40s 30s 20s Oh actually there's

364
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,320
50s 40s 30s 20s Oh actually there's
 

365
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,510
50s 40s 30s 20s Oh actually there's
going to be passive mobs so it's not

366
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:04,520
going to be passive mobs so it's not
 

367
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,280
going to be passive mobs so it's not
going to hit zero now that I think of it

368
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,290
going to hit zero now that I think of it
 

369
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,550
going to hit zero now that I think of it
and squid and stuff okay but at this

370
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:09,560
and squid and stuff okay but at this
 

371
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,110
and squid and stuff okay but at this
point I think everything in the caves

372
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
point I think everything in the caves
 

373
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,830
point I think everything in the caves
has D spawned we're probably too far

374
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:14,840
has D spawned we're probably too far
 

375
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,540
has D spawned we're probably too far
away for any witches to spawn there as

376
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:16,550
away for any witches to spawn there as
 

377
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,160
away for any witches to spawn there as
well though so let's climb down a little

378
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,170
well though so let's climb down a little
 

379
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,810
well though so let's climb down a little
bit I don't know the exact height we

380
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:19,820
bit I don't know the exact height we
 

381
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,570
bit I don't know the exact height we
want to be and we're going to have to do

382
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:22,580
want to be and we're going to have to do
 

383
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,760
want to be and we're going to have to do
this until I light up all the caves this

384
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:24,770
this until I light up all the caves this
 

385
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,910
this until I light up all the caves this
is this like a temporary thing okay

386
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
is this like a temporary thing okay
 

387
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,560
is this like a temporary thing okay
let's slowly go down until that number

388
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:29,570
let's slowly go down until that number
 

389
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,520
let's slowly go down until that number
starts to increase and then we're going

390
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:33,530
starts to increase and then we're going
 

391
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,500
starts to increase and then we're going
to jump down and just see if we got any

392
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,510
to jump down and just see if we got any
 

393
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,800
to jump down and just see if we got any
witches yeah it's starting to go up now

394
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:37,810
witches yeah it's starting to go up now
 

395
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,580
witches yeah it's starting to go up now
so we'll go here did we get any please

396
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:42,590
so we'll go here did we get any please
 

397
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,520
so we'll go here did we get any please

please please oh yes oh wow we got we
 

399
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,490
please please oh yes oh wow we got we
got six or so that's somewhat of a

400
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:48,500
got six or so that's somewhat of a
 

401
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,100
got six or so that's somewhat of a
result okay that's good that means I'm

402
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,110
result okay that's good that means I'm
 

403
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,450
result okay that's good that means I'm
comfortable moving ahead with our design

404
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:54,460
comfortable moving ahead with our design
 

405
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,830
comfortable moving ahead with our design
all right it's very good so now we know

406
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:56,840
all right it's very good so now we know
 

407
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,300
all right it's very good so now we know
for sure that they're going to spawn on

408
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,310
for sure that they're going to spawn on
 

409
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,240
for sure that they're going to spawn on
packed ice here and in this area now we

410
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,250
packed ice here and in this area now we
 

411
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,760
packed ice here and in this area now we
can move on to the next step so we need

412
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:03,770
can move on to the next step so we need
 

413
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,280
can move on to the next step so we need
some way of clearing them off of our our

414
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,290
some way of clearing them off of our our
 

415
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,000
some way of clearing them off of our our
spawning platform here the current best

416
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,010
spawning platform here the current best
 

417
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,540
spawning platform here the current best
method is probably to use water streams

418
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:13,550
method is probably to use water streams
 

419
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,970
method is probably to use water streams
now that they fix the glitching them

420
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:15,980
now that they fix the glitching them
 

421
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,520
now that they fix the glitching them
through the blocks method I'm not

422
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,530
through the blocks method I'm not
 

423
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,830
through the blocks method I'm not
exactly sure though but I want to try

424
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:20,840
exactly sure though but I want to try
 

425
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,230
exactly sure though but I want to try
something crazy something wacky if you

426
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,240
something crazy something wacky if you
 

427
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,690
something crazy something wacky if you
were hoping for a high-efficiency which

428
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:25,700
were hoping for a high-efficiency which
 

429
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,020
were hoping for a high-efficiency which
farm I am sorry to let you down because

430
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,030
farm I am sorry to let you down because
 

431
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,670
farm I am sorry to let you down because
that is not what we're doing here I've

432
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
that is not what we're doing here I've
 

433
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,590
that is not what we're doing here I've
made a lot of mob systems in this game I

434
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
made a lot of mob systems in this game I
 

435
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
made a lot of mob systems in this game I
like to make them a little bit different

436
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,130
like to make them a little bit different
 

437
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,500
like to make them a little bit different
from each other every time though just

438
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,510
from each other every time though just
 

439
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,880
from each other every time though just
so it's a different experience for me

440
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:39,890
so it's a different experience for me
 

441
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,910
so it's a different experience for me
different challenges and stuff and in my

442
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:42,920
different challenges and stuff and in my
 

443
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,540
different challenges and stuff and in my
world I have so many arrows I don't know

444
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:46,550
world I have so many arrows I don't know
 

445
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,310
world I have so many arrows I don't know
what to do with them I keep saving them

446
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
what to do with them I keep saving them
 

447
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,700
what to do with them I keep saving them
I can't stand to just throw stuff away

448
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:50,710
I can't stand to just throw stuff away
 

449
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,140
I can't stand to just throw stuff away
but I thought you know what let's make

450
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,150
but I thought you know what let's make
 

451
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,060
but I thought you know what let's make
the witch farm

452
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,070
the witch farm
 

453
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,710
the witch farm
shoot arrows at the witches the clearing

454
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:57,720
shoot arrows at the witches the clearing
 

455
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,080
shoot arrows at the witches the clearing
off the platform and I did a little

456
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,090
off the platform and I did a little
 

457
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,000
off the platform and I did a little
testing creative it takes between one

458
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,010
testing creative it takes between one
 

459
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,460
testing creative it takes between one
and three arrows to clear a witch off of

460
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:04,470
and three arrows to clear a witch off of
 

461
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,950
and three arrows to clear a witch off of
here like if the witch spawns like right

462
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:06,960
here like if the witch spawns like right
 

463
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,490
here like if the witch spawns like right
here I think it takes three to shoot

464
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:10,500
here I think it takes three to shoot
 

465
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,380
here I think it takes three to shoot
them off the end if they spawn like at

466
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,390
them off the end if they spawn like at
 

467
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,160
them off the end if they spawn like at
the end here though that's that's only

468
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,170
the end here though that's that's only
 

469
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,710
the end here though that's that's only
gonna take one right and we're going to

470
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
gonna take one right and we're going to
 

471
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,290
gonna take one right and we're going to
be using spectral arrows as well so when

472
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,300
be using spectral arrows as well so when
 

473
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,870
be using spectral arrows as well so when
when the dispenser hits the witch we're

474
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:23,880
when the dispenser hits the witch we're
 

475
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,730
when the dispenser hits the witch we're
going to be able to see through all the

476
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:25,740
going to be able to see through all the
 

477
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,220
going to be able to see through all the
blocks and stuff we place here clearly

478
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,230
blocks and stuff we place here clearly
 

479
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,380
blocks and stuff we place here clearly
every time there which spawns which i

480
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,390
every time there which spawns which i
 

481
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,820
every time there which spawns which i
think is going to be really cool and

482
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:31,830
think is going to be really cool and
 

483
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,080
think is going to be really cool and
just to double check just to make sure

484
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,090
just to double check just to make sure
 

485
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,020
just to double check just to make sure
it's going to do a button it seemed like

486
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,030
it's going to do a button it seemed like
 

487
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,120
it's going to do a button it seemed like
it went to the end of the platform when

488
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,130
it went to the end of the platform when
 

489
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,980
it went to the end of the platform when
I did it yeah even at the bottom layer

490
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:42,990
I did it yeah even at the bottom layer
 

491
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,490
I did it yeah even at the bottom layer
here ideally for mob firms oh I don't

492
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:46,500
here ideally for mob firms oh I don't
 

493
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,850
here ideally for mob firms oh I don't
think you want to put the anything at

494
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:49,860
think you want to put the anything at
 

495
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,410
think you want to put the anything at
the bottom layer here like at this

496
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:51,420
the bottom layer here like at this
 

497
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,020
the bottom layer here like at this
height here that reduces the spawning

498
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,030
height here that reduces the spawning
 

499
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,850
height here that reduces the spawning
rates but we can't really help it with

500
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:55,860
rates but we can't really help it with
 

501
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,340
rates but we can't really help it with
these dispensers we need we need to put

502
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,350
these dispensers we need we need to put
 

503
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,010
these dispensers we need we need to put
them down here because I'm going to do

504
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,020
them down here because I'm going to do
 

505
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,320
them down here because I'm going to do
tripwires to detect whenever a witch

506
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,330
tripwires to detect whenever a witch
 

507
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,910
tripwires to detect whenever a witch
spawns that way we're not wasting arrows

508
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:04,920
spawns that way we're not wasting arrows
 

509
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,540
spawns that way we're not wasting arrows
needlessly just if like a witch spawns

510
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:08,550
needlessly just if like a witch spawns
 

511
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,420
needlessly just if like a witch spawns
in this tripwire then we want this to

512
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,430
in this tripwire then we want this to
 

513
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,370
in this tripwire then we want this to
repeatedly shoot until they're out of it

514
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,380
repeatedly shoot until they're out of it
 

515
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,560
repeatedly shoot until they're out of it
is the plan so going to do tripwires I

516
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,570
is the plan so going to do tripwires I
 

517
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,610
is the plan so going to do tripwires I
guess we can't wait a second I have not

518
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:22,620
guess we can't wait a second I have not
 

519
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,950
guess we can't wait a second I have not
thought this out very much so we're

520
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:24,960
thought this out very much so we're
 

521
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,660
thought this out very much so we're
about to have some trouble but maybe we

522
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:26,670
about to have some trouble but maybe we
 

523
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,190
about to have some trouble but maybe we
would do the tripwire here we need at

524
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
would do the tripwire here we need at
 

525
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,290
would do the tripwire here we need at
least one block wide for them to fall

526
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,300
least one block wide for them to fall
 

527
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,130
least one block wide for them to fall
down here yeah maybe we'll do one there

528
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,140
down here yeah maybe we'll do one there
 

529
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,660
down here yeah maybe we'll do one there
and the other one I want a little ways

530
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:38,670
and the other one I want a little ways
 

531
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,370
and the other one I want a little ways
away from this dispenser oh no I forgot

532
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:43,380
away from this dispenser oh no I forgot
 

533
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,710
away from this dispenser oh no I forgot
you can't you can't put the dispenser

534
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:45,720
you can't you can't put the dispenser
 

535
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,030
you can't you can't put the dispenser
here because then the tripwire doesn't

536
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
here because then the tripwire doesn't
 

537
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,660
here because then the tripwire doesn't
connect ah that's gonna be a problem

538
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:52,670
connect ah that's gonna be a problem
 

539
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,310
connect ah that's gonna be a problem
yeah that's gonna change things a lot

540
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:55,320
yeah that's gonna change things a lot
 

541
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,440
yeah that's gonna change things a lot
here actually uh but we're still going

542
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,450
here actually uh but we're still going
 

543
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,210
here actually uh but we're still going
to try to do it still going to go for

544
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,220
to try to do it still going to go for
 

545
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,610
to try to do it still going to go for
the arrow idea problem is we can't be as

546
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:01,620
the arrow idea problem is we can't be as
 

547
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,770
the arrow idea problem is we can't be as
precise with our mob detection so

548
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:03,780
precise with our mob detection so
 

549
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,320
precise with our mob detection so
instead we're just going to detect the

550
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,330
instead we're just going to detect the
 

551
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,760
instead we're just going to detect the
whole platform here

552
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:07,770
whole platform here
 

553
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,940
whole platform here
so if there's a witch on here anywhere

554
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:10,950
so if there's a witch on here anywhere
 

555
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,030
so if there's a witch on here anywhere
then all these dispensaries are going to

556
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,040
then all these dispensaries are going to
 

557
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,790
then all these dispensaries are going to
fire at once downside of that is it's

558
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
fire at once downside of that is it's
 

559
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,820
fire at once downside of that is it's
more wasteful the upside is it's going

560
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:19,830
more wasteful the upside is it's going
 

561
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,290
more wasteful the upside is it's going
to be a lot easier to build this and as

562
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:24,300
to be a lot easier to build this and as
 

563
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,880
to be a lot easier to build this and as
well it's probably going to work a

564
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:25,890
well it's probably going to work a
 

565
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,440
well it's probably going to work a
little bit better too because if there's

566
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,450
little bit better too because if there's
 

567
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,930
little bit better too because if there's
a PAC spawn on the platform here it'll

568
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:29,940
a PAC spawn on the platform here it'll
 

569
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,510
a PAC spawn on the platform here it'll
be able to take them all outs you know

570
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:31,520
be able to take them all outs you know
 

571
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,010
be able to take them all outs you know
pretty quickly or if they're moving if

572
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,020
pretty quickly or if they're moving if
 

573
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
pretty quickly or if they're moving if
they like dodge out of the way of one of

574
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,030
they like dodge out of the way of one of
 

575
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,630
they like dodge out of the way of one of
the arrows that that was meant for them

576
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:38,640
the arrows that that was meant for them
 

577
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,340
the arrows that that was meant for them
then one of the other ones is going to

578
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,350
then one of the other ones is going to
 

579
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,300
then one of the other ones is going to
hit them so it's a trade-off but I think

580
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,310
hit them so it's a trade-off but I think
 

581
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,800
hit them so it's a trade-off but I think
we'll do it because we don't have a

582
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:45,810
we'll do it because we don't have a
 

583
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,350
we'll do it because we don't have a
choice we can't just put the trip wires

584
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,360
choice we can't just put the trip wires
 

585
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,300
choice we can't just put the trip wires
on the dispensers either because that

586
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,310
on the dispensers either because that
 

587
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,290
on the dispensers either because that
locks them we can only shoot one arrow

588
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:54,300
locks them we can only shoot one arrow
 

589
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,780
locks them we can only shoot one arrow
and if it takes three to get them off

590
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:56,790
and if it takes three to get them off
 

591
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,150
and if it takes three to get them off
here then we have a problem all right

592
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,160
here then we have a problem all right
 

593
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,310
here then we have a problem all right
okay so yeah I'm going to fill this up

594
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
okay so yeah I'm going to fill this up
 

595
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,780
okay so yeah I'm going to fill this up
with tripwire let's get out of here

596
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:05,790
with tripwire let's get out of here
 

597
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,260
with tripwire let's get out of here
though I'll do that off camera then on

598
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,270
though I'll do that off camera then on
 

599
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,150
though I'll do that off camera then on
one side here we'll have wire running

600
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,160
one side here we'll have wire running
 

601
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,790
one side here we'll have wire running
all along the trip wires they also can

602
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:13,800
all along the trip wires they also can
 

603
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,680
all along the trip wires they also can
potentially fall off the side here now

604
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:15,690
potentially fall off the side here now
 

605
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,750
potentially fall off the side here now
too if they like bump into each other

606
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
too if they like bump into each other
 

607
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,380
too if they like bump into each other
they might fall off the side which we'll

608
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,390
they might fall off the side which we'll
 

609
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,470
they might fall off the side which we'll
have to account for unless I put blocks

610
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
have to account for unless I put blocks
 

611
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,210
have to account for unless I put blocks
lower down but that that'll block the

612
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,220
lower down but that that'll block the
 

613
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,810
lower down but that that'll block the
spawns a little bit ah lots of lots of

614
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:29,820
spawns a little bit ah lots of lots of
 

615
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,680
spawns a little bit ah lots of lots of
choices with designing this what we're

616
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:33,690
choices with designing this what we're
 

617
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,890
choices with designing this what we're
going to do though see trying to be

618
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:36,900
going to do though see trying to be
 

619
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,680
going to do though see trying to be
careful not to block any spawn spawn

620
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:39,690
careful not to block any spawn spawn
 

621
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,520
careful not to block any spawn spawn
points I'm gonna put a tripwire actually

622
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:43,530
points I'm gonna put a tripwire actually
 

623
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,030
points I'm gonna put a tripwire actually
no we need a repeater first repeater

624
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
no we need a repeater first repeater
 

625
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,560
no we need a repeater first repeater
we're going to do a comparator clock

626
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,570
we're going to do a comparator clock
 

627
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:58,100
we're going to do a comparator clock
like this so and then that's thinking

628
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,110
like this so and then that's thinking
 

629
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,010
like this so and then that's thinking
thinking right now how do we want this

630
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,020
thinking right now how do we want this
 

631
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,500
thinking right now how do we want this
to go so that'll that'll send out the

632
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,510
to go so that'll that'll send out the
 

633
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,090
to go so that'll that'll send out the
signal I guess so we want to go back

634
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,100
signal I guess so we want to go back
 

635
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,980
signal I guess so we want to go back
then I need a repeater though too before

636
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:09,990
then I need a repeater though too before
 

637
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,110
then I need a repeater though too before
we go into this if we do it like this I

638
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,120
we go into this if we do it like this I
 

639
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,340
we go into this if we do it like this I
think that'll still activate all of them

640
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,350
think that'll still activate all of them
 

641
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,620
think that'll still activate all of them
right we'll try that out okay so if any

642
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:21,630
right we'll try that out okay so if any
 

643
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,920
right we'll try that out okay so if any
any of these are triggered I'll just try

644
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:24,930
any of these are triggered I'll just try
 

645
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,420
any of these are triggered I'll just try
push a button to mimic it yeah that'll

646
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:29,430
push a button to mimic it yeah that'll
 

647
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,600
push a button to mimic it yeah that'll
work

648
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:29,610
work
 

649
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,519
work
we want to slows down though for sure

650
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:31,529
we want to slows down though for sure
 

651
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,499
we want to slows down though for sure
otherwise we're going to waste arrows

652
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:35,509

 

653
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,790

well I tell you what guys I want to try

654
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,800
well I tell you what guys I want to try
 

655
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,620
well I tell you what guys I want to try
to do a test here and just see how this

656
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:39,630
to do a test here and just see how this
 

657
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,590
to do a test here and just see how this
works as it is right now this is what I

658
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,600
works as it is right now this is what I
 

659
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,110
works as it is right now this is what I
did so we have the redstone wire goes to

660
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
did so we have the redstone wire goes to
 

661
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,319
did so we have the redstone wire goes to
a block then to the repeater comparator

662
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:48,329
a block then to the repeater comparator
 

663
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,930
a block then to the repeater comparator
clock this has to travel three blocks

664
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:50,940
clock this has to travel three blocks
 

665
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,160
clock this has to travel three blocks
before it can go to the repeater

666
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,170
before it can go to the repeater
 

667
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,990
before it can go to the repeater
otherwise the repeater gets locked on

668
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
otherwise the repeater gets locked on
 

669
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,840
otherwise the repeater gets locked on
and then we have a delay on that it will

670
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:56,850
and then we have a delay on that it will
 

671
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,879
and then we have a delay on that it will
stall the dispensers and then to

672
00:15:58,879 --> 00:15:58,889
stall the dispensers and then to
 

673
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,490
stall the dispensers and then to
actually get the arrows circulated

674
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:01,500
actually get the arrows circulated
 

675
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,930
actually get the arrows circulated
through the whole system we're going to

676
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:02,940
through the whole system we're going to
 

677
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,790
through the whole system we're going to
have hoppers doing that too so let's go

678
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
have hoppers doing that too so let's go
 

679
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,730
have hoppers doing that too so let's go
into the dispensers then we'll probably

680
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:07,740
into the dispensers then we'll probably
 

681
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,670
into the dispensers then we'll probably
have you know more hoppers above going

682
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
have you know more hoppers above going
 

683
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,590
have you know more hoppers above going
sideways and as long as these are filled

684
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:12,600
sideways and as long as these are filled
 

685
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,230
sideways and as long as these are filled
up there's always going to be hoppers of

686
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
up there's always going to be hoppers of
 

687
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,999
up there's always going to be hoppers of
it not hoppers arrows in the system

688
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:19,009
it not hoppers arrows in the system
 

689
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:22,009
it not hoppers arrows in the system
uh-huh and we'll just have to drop them

690
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:22,019
uh-huh and we'll just have to drop them
 

691
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,249
uh-huh and we'll just have to drop them
off into HS somewhere basically all

692
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:25,259
off into HS somewhere basically all
 

693
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,960
off into HS somewhere basically all
right so let's do a little test here

694
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:26,970
right so let's do a little test here
 

695
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,059
right so let's do a little test here
that will do 32 arrows in each of these

696
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:29,069
that will do 32 arrows in each of these
 

697
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:30,769
that will do 32 arrows in each of these
just going to manually put them in this

698
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:30,779
just going to manually put them in this
 

699
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,220
just going to manually put them in this
time maybe I didn't bring a lot of

700
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,230
time maybe I didn't bring a lot of
 

701
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,230
time maybe I didn't bring a lot of
spectral arrows with me on this trip so

702
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
spectral arrows with me on this trip so
 

703
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,509
spectral arrows with me on this trip so
I will only have 32 we'll just put them

704
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:38,519
I will only have 32 we'll just put them
 

705
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,100
I will only have 32 we'll just put them
in one if we're lucky we'll we'll get a

706
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,110
in one if we're lucky we'll we'll get a
 

707
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,749
in one if we're lucky we'll we'll get a
guy to spawn in the middle and we'll be

708
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:44,759
guy to spawn in the middle and we'll be
 

709
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,019
guy to spawn in the middle and we'll be
able to see it okay this is what it

710
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:48,029
able to see it okay this is what it
 

711
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,939
able to see it okay this is what it
looks like right now inside oh and I

712
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:49,949
looks like right now inside oh and I
 

713
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:54,079
looks like right now inside oh and I
didn't did I remove the torch I don't

714
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,089
didn't did I remove the torch I don't
 

715
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:56,030
didn't did I remove the torch I don't
know if I did know I didn't we

716
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,040
know if I did know I didn't we
 

717
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,079
know if I did know I didn't we
definitely got to do that too all right

718
00:16:59,079 --> 00:16:59,089
definitely got to do that too all right
 

719
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:01,220
definitely got to do that too all right
they're nice and dark I'm going to climb

720
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,230
they're nice and dark I'm going to climb
 

721
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,659
they're nice and dark I'm going to climb
up the tower and see if anything happens

722
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:04,669
up the tower and see if anything happens
 

723
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,949
up the tower and see if anything happens
yeah I see the arrows on the ground

724
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
yeah I see the arrows on the ground
 

725
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,419
yeah I see the arrows on the ground
there okay I'm gonna hop down I see a

726
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:11,429
there okay I'm gonna hop down I see a
 

727
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:18,439
there okay I'm gonna hop down I see a
lot of arrows oh my goodness wire oh no

728
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:18,449
lot of arrows oh my goodness wire oh no
 

729
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,419
lot of arrows oh my goodness wire oh no
an arrow got stuck in the top and it

730
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:20,429
an arrow got stuck in the top and it
 

731
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:26,980
an arrow got stuck in the top and it
stuck the tripwire oh that's terrible

732
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:26,990
stuck the tripwire oh that's terrible
 

733
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,910
stuck the tripwire oh that's terrible
as a huge flaw

734
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:31,920

 

735
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,370

this is why we want a depth Strider by

736
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,380
this is why we want a depth Strider by
 

737
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,040
this is why we want a depth Strider by
the way I've I've used it a lot oh we

738
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,050
the way I've I've used it a lot oh we
 

739
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,780
the way I've I've used it a lot oh we
got which spawn all right I got hit by a

740
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:38,790
got which spawn all right I got hit by a
 

741
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,700
got which spawn all right I got hit by a
spectral arrow why is it why is it still

742
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:43,710
spectral arrow why is it why is it still
 

743
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,620
spectral arrow why is it why is it still
going though oh come on there's no

744
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:48,630
going though oh come on there's no
 

745
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,350
going though oh come on there's no
arrows anywhere in there guys

746
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
arrows anywhere in there guys
 

747
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,180
arrows anywhere in there guys
why is the tripwire still activated

748
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,190
why is the tripwire still activated
 

749
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:04,030
why is the tripwire still activated
I tried lowering the droppers by the way

750
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,040

 

751
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,530

did you see where an arrow is stucked I

752
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:06,540
did you see where an arrow is stucked I
 

753
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,940
did you see where an arrow is stucked I
didn't I'm gonna have to watch that back

754
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:07,950
didn't I'm gonna have to watch that back
 

755
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,800
didn't I'm gonna have to watch that back
oh right right oh right okay I know what

756
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:12,810
oh right right oh right okay I know what
 

757
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,950
oh right right oh right okay I know what
it is it's because every time the

758
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:15,960
it is it's because every time the
 

759
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,900
it is it's because every time the
dispenser shoot an arrow that arrow

760
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:17,910
dispenser shoot an arrow that arrow
 

761
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,080
dispenser shoot an arrow that arrow
flies through the tripwires so what I

762
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,090
flies through the tripwires so what I
 

763
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,150
flies through the tripwires so what I
need to do is change the redstone so it

764
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,160
need to do is change the redstone so it
 

765
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,480
need to do is change the redstone so it
waits until the arrows are outside the

766
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,490
waits until the arrows are outside the
 

767
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,790
waits until the arrows are outside the
tripwire before it tries to detect for

768
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:28,800
tripwire before it tries to detect for
 

769
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,800
tripwire before it tries to detect for
another mob yes that's what I'll do

770
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:32,810
another mob yes that's what I'll do
 

771
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,300
another mob yes that's what I'll do
all right I look at this now and I'm

772
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,310
all right I look at this now and I'm
 

773
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,890
all right I look at this now and I'm
ashamed guys I'm ashamed of my redstone

774
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:38,900
ashamed guys I'm ashamed of my redstone
 

775
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,940
ashamed guys I'm ashamed of my redstone
yeah the thing about the comparator

776
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:40,950
yeah the thing about the comparator
 

777
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,010
yeah the thing about the comparator
clock method I had here it's simple to

778
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,020
clock method I had here it's simple to
 

779
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,340
clock method I had here it's simple to
do but we have one two three four five

780
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,350
do but we have one two three four five
 

781
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,950
do but we have one two three four five
six delay before it fires the first

782
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
six delay before it fires the first
 

783
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,290
six delay before it fires the first
arrow and with mob systems you want to

784
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:51,300
arrow and with mob systems you want to
 

785
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,820
arrow and with mob systems you want to
get the guys out of there as fast as

786
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:52,830
get the guys out of there as fast as
 

787
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,360
get the guys out of there as fast as
possible

788
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,370
possible
 

789
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,370
possible
if you're going for efficiency which I'm

790
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:55,380
if you're going for efficiency which I'm
 

791
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,530
if you're going for efficiency which I'm
not really not but you know if I can get

792
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:57,540
not really not but you know if I can get
 

793
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,230
not really not but you know if I can get
it I'm going to try to get it so the new

794
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
it I'm going to try to get it so the new
 

795
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,910
it I'm going to try to get it so the new
method is going to be something like

796
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:01,920
method is going to be something like
 

797
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,820
method is going to be something like
this I do believe it's just the very

798
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:04,830
this I do believe it's just the very
 

799
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,940
this I do believe it's just the very
basic clock don't ask me why but I have

800
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:07,950
basic clock don't ask me why but I have
 

801
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,090
basic clock don't ask me why but I have
a lot of trouble figuring this out I

802
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:10,100
a lot of trouble figuring this out I
 

803
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,320
a lot of trouble figuring this out I
ripped out the comparator clock though

804
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,330
ripped out the comparator clock though
 

805
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,360
ripped out the comparator clock though
the the tricky parts that kind of

806
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,370
the the tricky parts that kind of
 

807
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,640
the the tricky parts that kind of
confuse me is I needed to invert it

808
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:16,650
confuse me is I needed to invert it
 

809
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,090
confuse me is I needed to invert it
before going to the clock and the very

810
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,100
before going to the clock and the very
 

811
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,310
before going to the clock and the very
important thing about this it

812
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
important thing about this it
 

813
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,860
important thing about this it
deactivates this redstone torch and then

814
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:24,870
deactivates this redstone torch and then
 

815
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,970
deactivates this redstone torch and then
it deactivate or it reactivates this one

816
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:27,980
it deactivate or it reactivates this one
 

817
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,920
it deactivate or it reactivates this one
so that's only to delay compared to the

818
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:30,930
so that's only to delay compared to the
 

819
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,320
so that's only to delay compared to the
six delay we had before so it's still a

820
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,330
six delay we had before so it's still a
 

821
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,650
six delay we had before so it's still a
little bit delay but it's a little bit

822
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:36,660
little bit delay but it's a little bit
 

823
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,210
little bit delay but it's a little bit
faster and it now checks as well or it

824
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,220
faster and it now checks as well or it
 

825
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,740
faster and it now checks as well or it
gives enough time for the arrow to get

826
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:42,750
gives enough time for the arrow to get
 

827
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,060
gives enough time for the arrow to get
through which is important that's the

828
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,070
through which is important that's the
 

829
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,700
through which is important that's the
main reason we did this

830
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:45,710
main reason we did this
 

831
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,550
main reason we did this
so yeah we can set the delay over here I

832
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:51,560
so yeah we can set the delay over here I
 

833
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,870
so yeah we can set the delay over here I
don't know what that's going to be yet

834
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
don't know what that's going to be yet
 

835
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,270
don't know what that's going to be yet
we'll have to do a test so let me just

836
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
we'll have to do a test so let me just
 

837
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,500
we'll have to do a test so let me just
throw in some arrows and we'll just give

838
00:19:59,500 --> 00:19:59,510
throw in some arrows and we'll just give
 

839
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,680
throw in some arrows and we'll just give
it a quick activation like a mob spawned

840
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:04,690

 

841
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,610

why didn't that shoot

842
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:06,620
why didn't that shoot
 

843
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,570
why didn't that shoot
oh I digestion I don't know where the

844
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:13,580
oh I digestion I don't know where the
 

845
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,240
oh I digestion I don't know where the
arrows might they're not going in there

846
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,250
arrows might they're not going in there
 

847
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,160
arrows might they're not going in there
though what oh come on don't give me so

848
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,170
though what oh come on don't give me so
 

849
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,310
though what oh come on don't give me so
much trouble I can't click because the

850
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,320
much trouble I can't click because the
 

851
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,200
much trouble I can't click because the
stupid trip wires in my face so I have

852
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,210
stupid trip wires in my face so I have
 

853
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,600
stupid trip wires in my face so I have
to go down lower those should be in here

854
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,610
to go down lower those should be in here
 

855
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:45,250
to go down lower those should be in here
they are in there why why just why I

856
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:45,260
they are in there why why just why I
 

857
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,770
they are in there why why just why I
don't know let me let me double-check

858
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:47,780
don't know let me let me double-check
 

859
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,480
don't know let me let me double-check
this what am I doing wrong this is

860
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,490
this what am I doing wrong this is
 

861
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,660
this what am I doing wrong this is
getting powered right oh I fall again

862
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:57,670

 

863
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:04,570

yeah it's getting powered okay so

864
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:04,580
yeah it's getting powered okay so
 

865
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,310
yeah it's getting powered okay so
there's arrows in there and it's getting

866
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
there's arrows in there and it's getting
 

867
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,710
there's arrows in there and it's getting
powered I'm so confused

868
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:13,720
powered I'm so confused
 

869
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,180
powered I'm so confused
is this an ice thing Oh what was that

870
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,190
is this an ice thing Oh what was that
 

871
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:27,310
is this an ice thing Oh what was that
skewer that there is arrows in here

872
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:27,320
skewer that there is arrows in here
 

873
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,690
skewer that there is arrows in here
right yes dispensers can be weird

874
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:31,700
right yes dispensers can be weird
 

875
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,170
right yes dispensers can be weird
sometimes it's because it's being

876
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,180
sometimes it's because it's being
 

877
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,910
sometimes it's because it's being
powered diagonally isn't it here let's

878
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:36,920
powered diagonally isn't it here let's
 

879
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,720
powered diagonally isn't it here let's
try the one down something goofy is

880
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:40,730
try the one down something goofy is
 

881
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,760
try the one down something goofy is
going on here if we put arrows in here

882
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:42,770
going on here if we put arrows in here
 

883
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:49,480
going on here if we put arrows in here
I'll bet you'll go yeah okay let's

884
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,490
I'll bet you'll go yeah okay let's
 

885
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,350
I'll bet you'll go yeah okay let's
unpowered this now I don't know we got

886
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
unpowered this now I don't know we got
 

887
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,020
unpowered this now I don't know we got
to give it one quick pulse

888
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,030

 

889
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:07,240

it's shot twice that's bad news let's

890
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,250
it's shot twice that's bad news let's
 

891
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:15,070
it's shot twice that's bad news let's
add a little bit more delay still shot

892
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,080
add a little bit more delay still shot
 

893
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,740
add a little bit more delay still shot
twice or is the one next to it shooting

894
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:17,750
twice or is the one next to it shooting
 

895
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:41,860
twice or is the one next to it shooting
now okay so rather than trying to figure

896
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:41,870
now okay so rather than trying to figure
 

897
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,320
now okay so rather than trying to figure
out how to recontact all the Redstone

898
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,330
out how to recontact all the Redstone
 

899
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,630
out how to recontact all the Redstone
and redo it I just threw in a repeater

900
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
and redo it I just threw in a repeater
 

901
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,990
and redo it I just threw in a repeater
here does the trick now now we've got to

902
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
here does the trick now now we've got to
 

903
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,620
here does the trick now now we've got to
find a delay where it doesn't do this

904
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:52,630
find a delay where it doesn't do this
 

905
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,350
find a delay where it doesn't do this
yeah getting stuck in a clock if we add

906
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,360
yeah getting stuck in a clock if we add
 

907
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,620
yeah getting stuck in a clock if we add
more delay it should stop yeah let's try

908
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:02,630
more delay it should stop yeah let's try
 

909
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,020
more delay it should stop yeah let's try
active it again it's good yeah so it's

910
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,030
active it again it's good yeah so it's
 

911
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,850
active it again it's good yeah so it's
giving the arrow enough time to clear

912
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:09,860
giving the arrow enough time to clear
 

913
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,620
giving the arrow enough time to clear
the tripwires before it tries to go

914
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:11,630
the tripwires before it tries to go
 

915
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,070
the tripwires before it tries to go
again

916
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
again
 

917
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,470
again
so it'll only keep going if there's a

918
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
so it'll only keep going if there's a
 

919
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,730
so it'll only keep going if there's a
mob in here now instead of just arrows

920
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:17,740
mob in here now instead of just arrows
 

921
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,980
mob in here now instead of just arrows
let's pretend I'm a witch once I get

922
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:20,990
let's pretend I'm a witch once I get
 

923
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,310
let's pretend I'm a witch once I get
knocked off at you stop oh I was short

924
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
knocked off at you stop oh I was short
 

925
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,530
knocked off at you stop oh I was short
oh I just if I'm at the very edge it has

926
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:29,540
oh I just if I'm at the very edge it has
 

927
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,170
oh I just if I'm at the very edge it has
a chance is not making it all the way

928
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:31,180
a chance is not making it all the way
 

929
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,850
a chance is not making it all the way
but yeah it shut off on its own this

930
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:33,860
but yeah it shut off on its own this
 

931
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,660
but yeah it shut off on its own this
time that's good that's what we wanted

932
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:36,670
time that's good that's what we wanted
 

933
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,180
time that's good that's what we wanted
okay okay here we go

934
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,190
okay okay here we go
 

935
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,090
okay okay here we go
yeah they got knocked off all that was

936
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,100
yeah they got knocked off all that was
 

937
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,570
yeah they got knocked off all that was
sweet that was like two three shots and

938
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:46,580
sweet that was like two three shots and
 

939
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,310
sweet that was like two three shots and
and both of them got knocked off one of

940
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
and both of them got knocked off one of
 

941
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
and both of them got knocked off one of
them got hit by a spectral area arrow

942
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,090
them got hit by a spectral area arrow
 

943
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,250
them got hit by a spectral area arrow
