63
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,749
that's all i can say that's it period so
these slime blocks

64
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759

 

65
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,749

to begin with it's an awesome way to

66
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
to begin with it's an awesome way to
 

67
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,429
to begin with it's an awesome way to
store slime like if you got a lot of

68
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
store slime like if you got a lot of
 

69
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,270
store slime like if you got a lot of
slime balls around which i happen to

70
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
slime balls around which i happen to
 

71
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,990
slime balls around which i happen to
have or

72
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
have or
 

73
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,510
have or
i did have in my world i had like um

74
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
i did have in my world i had like um
 

75
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,190
i did have in my world i had like um
three or four double chests full of

76
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
three or four double chests full of
 

77
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,429
three or four double chests full of
slime balls and now i condensed them all

78
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
slime balls and now i condensed them all
 

79
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,510
slime balls and now i condensed them all
down into less than

80
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
down into less than
 

81
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,830
down into less than
or like into one chest so that's that's

82
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
or like into one chest so that's that's
 

83
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,270
or like into one chest so that's that's
pretty cool so it takes nine

84
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
pretty cool so it takes nine
 

85
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,950
pretty cool so it takes nine
slime balls uh in the grid

86
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
slime balls uh in the grid
 

87
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,910
slime balls uh in the grid
i don't know if i'm going to show all

88
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
i don't know if i'm going to show all
 

89
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,670
i don't know if i'm going to show all
the recipes today i'm sure you guys know

90
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
the recipes today i'm sure you guys know
 

91
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,950
the recipes today i'm sure you guys know
about it already

92
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
about it already
 

93
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,310
about it already
the snapshot's been out for a while but

94
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
the snapshot's been out for a while but
 

95
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,469
the snapshot's been out for a while but
you can make these slime

96
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
you can make these slime
 

97
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,510
you can make these slime
slime blocks just like this i'm curious

98
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
slime blocks just like this i'm curious
 

99
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,109
slime blocks just like this i'm curious
like i feel like they need to add a

100
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
like i feel like they need to add a
 

101
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,109
like i feel like they need to add a
magma cream block now like

102
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
magma cream block now like
 

103
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,550
magma cream block now like
i don't know what what it would do

104
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
i don't know what what it would do
 

105
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,190
i don't know what what it would do
though has to do something with physics

106
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
though has to do something with physics
 

107
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,309
though has to do something with physics
so like like these do

108
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
so like like these do
 

109
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,550
so like like these do
but to complete the set you know we need

110
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
but to complete the set you know we need
 

111
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,830
but to complete the set you know we need
we need like a

112
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
we need like a
 

113
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,110
we need like a
a fire block of some sort we do have

114
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
a fire block of some sort we do have
 

115
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,229
a fire block of some sort we do have
fire

116
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
fire
 

117
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,510
fire
i don't know uh yeah

118
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
i don't know uh yeah
 

119
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,270
i don't know uh yeah
these things are bouncy um

120
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
these things are bouncy um
 

121
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,150
these things are bouncy um
i think i think uh you can't bounce

122
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
i think i think uh you can't bounce
 

123
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,710
i think i think uh you can't bounce
higher

124
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
higher
 

125
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,630
higher
on it than than your initial bounce it

126
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
on it than than your initial bounce it
 

127
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,030
on it than than your initial bounce it
gets cut in half or something

128
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
gets cut in half or something
 

129
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,030
gets cut in half or something
i'm not exactly sure what it is you can

130
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
i'm not exactly sure what it is you can
 

131
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,910
i'm not exactly sure what it is you can
see as you walk on it

132
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
see as you walk on it
 

133
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,390
see as you walk on it
things are pretty slow um

134
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
things are pretty slow um
 

135
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,030
things are pretty slow um
this is also a really unique block

136
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
this is also a really unique block
 

137
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,390
this is also a really unique block
because oops

138
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
because oops
 

139
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,630
because oops
it is semi-transparent has like several

140
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
it is semi-transparent has like several
 

141
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,470
it is semi-transparent has like several
layers of transparency

142
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
layers of transparency
 

143
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,470
layers of transparency
throughout it we got the little cube

144
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
throughout it we got the little cube
 

145
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,070
throughout it we got the little cube
inside and the big cube on

146
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
inside and the big cube on
 

147
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,910
inside and the big cube on
on the outside i think this is going to

148
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
on the outside i think this is going to
 

149
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,589
on the outside i think this is going to
be used for building a lot too not just

150
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
be used for building a lot too not just
 

151
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,949
be used for building a lot too not just
for like this physics

152
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
for like this physics
 

153
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,750
for like this physics
fun with physics thing i think it is a

154
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
fun with physics thing i think it is a
 

155
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,270
fun with physics thing i think it is a
good block all around like it looks

156
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
good block all around like it looks
 

157
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,710
good block all around like it looks
pretty neat

158
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
pretty neat
 

159
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,509
pretty neat
um and it has a few other unique

160
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
um and it has a few other unique
 

161
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,229
um and it has a few other unique
qualities to it as well

162
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
qualities to it as well
 

163
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,790
qualities to it as well
yeah actually i wanted to check do i

164
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
yeah actually i wanted to check do i
 

165
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,470
yeah actually i wanted to check do i
have torches on me i do not have torches

166
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
have torches on me i do not have torches
 

167
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,869
have torches on me i do not have torches
on me

168
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
on me
 

169
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,149
on me
darn it i'm pretty sure it lets light

170
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
darn it i'm pretty sure it lets light
 

171
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,110
darn it i'm pretty sure it lets light
through

172
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
through
 

173
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,270
through
um here where can we get a torch

174
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
um here where can we get a torch
 

175
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,270
um here where can we get a torch
where can we get a torch how do i not

176
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
where can we get a torch how do i not
 

177
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,390
where can we get a torch how do i not
have a single torch anywhere uh

178
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
have a single torch anywhere uh
 

179
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,030
have a single torch anywhere uh
and cut and resume i got a torch

180
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
and cut and resume i got a torch
 

181
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,110
and cut and resume i got a torch
so i could have used sunlight but i want

182
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
so i could have used sunlight but i want
 

183
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,350
so i could have used sunlight but i want
to check something specifically here

184
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
to check something specifically here
 

185
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,190
to check something specifically here
which is this i think easier to do

186
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
which is this i think easier to do
 

187
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,830
which is this i think easier to do
without the sun

188
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
without the sun
 

189
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,789
without the sun
so pretty sure it's translucent

190
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
so pretty sure it's translucent
 

191
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,229
so pretty sure it's translucent
yeah it lets light through it's still

192
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
yeah it lets light through it's still
 

193
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,149
yeah it lets light through it's still
light in here that's good uh what i was

194
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
light in here that's good uh what i was
 

195
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,350
light in here that's good uh what i was
wondering is

196
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
wondering is
 

197
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,390
wondering is
if it cuts the lighting down uh in

198
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
if it cuts the lighting down uh in
 

199
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,470
if it cuts the lighting down uh in
in level at all like kind of like water

200
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
in level at all like kind of like water
 

201
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,630
in level at all like kind of like water
does so let's just check

202
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
does so let's just check
 

203
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,509
does so let's just check
the torch should be 14 slime block would

204
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
the torch should be 14 slime block would
 

205
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,630
the torch should be 14 slime block would
be 13

206
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
be 13
 

207
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,910
be 13
12 at our feet and 11 at our head

208
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
12 at our feet and 11 at our head
 

209
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,070
12 at our feet and 11 at our head
and block light says 11 so it doesn't

210
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
and block light says 11 so it doesn't
 

211
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,910
and block light says 11 so it doesn't
reduce the light level at all

212
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
reduce the light level at all
 

213
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,229
reduce the light level at all
so that's good to know

214
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239

 

215
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,670

and this block

216
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
and this block
 

217
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,749
and this block
behaves like a solid block which is a

218
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
behaves like a solid block which is a
 

219
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,950
behaves like a solid block which is a
weird thing so

220
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
weird thing so
 

221
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,550
weird thing so
this is the only block in the game that

222
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
this is the only block in the game that
 

223
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,629
this is the only block in the game that
does this look at the mobs

224
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
does this look at the mobs
 

225
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,550
does this look at the mobs
oh man this stuff is slower than slow

oh you feeling my cannon dude um
 

231
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,350
oh you feeling my cannon dude um
yeah so you can use this with redstone

232
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
yeah so you can use this with redstone
 

233
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,270
yeah so you can use this with redstone
and stuff you can put tracks on this

234
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
and stuff you can put tracks on this
 

235
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,790
and stuff you can put tracks on this
you can it behaves exactly like

236
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
you can it behaves exactly like
 

237
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,590
you can it behaves exactly like
any normal block except it lets light

238
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
any normal block except it lets light
 

239
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,110
any normal block except it lets light
through which is the only block in the

240
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
through which is the only block in the
 

241
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,550
through which is the only block in the
game that does that

242
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
game that does that
 

243
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,670
game that does that
like if you if you do the staircase

244
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
like if you if you do the staircase
 

245
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,749
like if you if you do the staircase
thing

246
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
thing
 

247
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,189
thing
like that and then you put one over top

248
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
like that and then you put one over top
 

249
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,430
like that and then you put one over top
it cuts it um

250
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
it cuts it um
 

251
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,820
it cuts it um
so that's that's important to know um

252
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:04,830
so that's that's important to know um
 

253
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,950
so that's that's important to know um

would that might be worth checking
actually

284
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639

369
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,710
i don't think it bounced i think it's
just like hitting any other block

370
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720

 

371
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,029

uh all right enough with the bouncy

372
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
uh all right enough with the bouncy
 

373
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,430
uh all right enough with the bouncy
blocks

374
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440

 

375
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,870

about them just yet they're they're just

378
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
about them just yet they're they're just
 

379
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,390
about them just yet they're they're just
so amazing aren't they like look

380
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
so amazing aren't they like look
 

381
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,869
so amazing aren't they like look
look at that even when i'm holding in my

382
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
look at that even when i'm holding in my
 

383
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,390
look at that even when i'm holding in my
hand you can see the tree through it

384
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
hand you can see the tree through it
 

385
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,710
hand you can see the tree through it
it's

386
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
it's
 

387
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,469
it's
it's so transparent so cool uh i noticed

388
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
it's so transparent so cool uh i noticed
 

389
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,830
it's so transparent so cool uh i noticed
so it's very similar

390
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
so it's very similar
 

391
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,029
so it's very similar
in color to forest biome grass

392
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
in color to forest biome grass
 

393
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,950
in color to forest biome grass
so i might be using this in the man cave

394
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
so i might be using this in the man cave
 

395
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,550
so i might be using this in the man cave
a little bit

396
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
a little bit
 

397
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,830
a little bit
i had an idea of maybe

398
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
i had an idea of maybe
 

399
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,990
i had an idea of maybe
switching this out and just see what

400
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
switching this out and just see what
 

401
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,990
switching this out and just see what
this looks like

402
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
this looks like
 

403
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,230
this looks like
no never mind never mind

404
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
no never mind never mind
 

405
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,510
no never mind never mind
it was worth a shot um it is very

406
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
it was worth a shot um it is very
 

407
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,430
it was worth a shot um it is very
similar to the grass color though

408
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
similar to the grass color though
 

409
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,950
similar to the grass color though
so it might be used in a few places

410
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
so it might be used in a few places
 

411
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,230
so it might be used in a few places
uh i just give a little more variety so

412
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
uh i just give a little more variety so
 

413
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,150
uh i just give a little more variety so

and cobble and all that and look really
 

507
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,990
and cobble and all that and look really
good on their own

508
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
good on their own
 

509
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,829
good on their own
just period you know where can we set up

510
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
just period you know where can we set up
 

511
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,630
just period you know where can we set up
let's make a wall right here um

512
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640

 

513
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,350

that's what they look like and you can

514
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
that's what they look like and you can
 

515
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,230
that's what they look like and you can
put the polished on

516
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
put the polished on
 

517
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,910
put the polished on
i think it behaves just like stone i

518
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
i think it behaves just like stone i
 

519
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,590
i think it behaves just like stone i
think this is just a

520
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
think this is just a
 

521
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,310
think this is just a
different damage value for the stone i

522
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
different damage value for the stone i
 

523
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,230
different damage value for the stone i
tried it out in creative silverfish

524
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
tried it out in creative silverfish
 

525
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,990
tried it out in creative silverfish
will enter these blocks as well by the

526
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
will enter these blocks as well by the
 

527
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,350
will enter these blocks as well by the
way

528
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
way
 

529
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,350
way
and they convert to the regular stone

530
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
and they convert to the regular stone
 

531
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,110
and they convert to the regular stone
texture when that happens it turns into

532
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
texture when that happens it turns into
 

533
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,630
texture when that happens it turns into
the stone

534
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
the stone
 

535
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,310

silverfish blocks but yeah these look

536
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
silverfish blocks but yeah these look
 

537
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,069
silverfish blocks but yeah these look
really really good they go well with

538
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
really really good they go well with
 

539
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,550
really really good they go well with
cobble um

540
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
cobble um
 

541
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,430
cobble um
like this is this is so similar these

542
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
like this is this is so similar these
 

543
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,310
like this is this is so similar these
two but

544
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
two but
 

545
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,509
two but
varied it looks good uh gravel

546
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
varied it looks good uh gravel
 

547
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,389
varied it looks good uh gravel
do i have any gravel this this looks

really good with gravel this block
 

551
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,710
really good with gravel this block
here let's let's get these down too i

552
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
here let's let's get these down too i
 

553
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,990
here let's let's get these down too i
know i'm playing favorites

554
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
know i'm playing favorites
 

555
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,389
know i'm playing favorites
but uh these look good with just like

556
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
but uh these look good with just like
 

557
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,670
but uh these look good with just like
hard and clay and stuff

558
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
hard and clay and stuff
 

559
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,110
hard and clay and stuff
i found and uh

560
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
i found and uh
 

561
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,389
i found and uh
if you mix these up

562
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
if you mix these up
 

563
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,670
if you mix these up
here let's let's make a little

564
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
here let's let's make a little
 

565
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,910
here let's let's make a little
randomness into this if you mix them up

566
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
randomness into this if you mix them up
 

567
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,350
randomness into this if you mix them up
like this

568
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
like this
 

569
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,710
like this
looks really cool too it looks like uh

570
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
looks really cool too it looks like uh
 

571
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,949
looks really cool too it looks like uh
because of this sharp border around it

572
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
because of this sharp border around it
 

573
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,430
because of this sharp border around it
the edges it looks like

574
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
the edges it looks like
 

575
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,350
the edges it looks like
these panels are sticking out a little

576
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
these panels are sticking out a little
 

577
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,750
these panels are sticking out a little
bit and these ones are indented

578
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
bit and these ones are indented
 

579
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,030
bit and these ones are indented
has like a 3d effect almost in my

580
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
has like a 3d effect almost in my
 

581
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,590
has like a 3d effect almost in my
opinion

582
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
opinion
 

583
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,990
opinion
but i don't know it looks like you make

584
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
but i don't know it looks like you make
 

585
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,670
but i don't know it looks like you make
really cool walls with this stuff

586
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
really cool walls with this stuff
 

587
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,870
really cool walls with this stuff
especially when you combine it with

588
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
especially when you combine it with
 

589
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,350
especially when you combine it with
other blocks it looks really good

590
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
other blocks it looks really good
 

591
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,710
other blocks it looks really good

it shouldn't like cause uh terrain
borders

618

it'll just be
in addition to the usual terrain you'll

624
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
in addition to the usual terrain you'll
 

625
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,150
in addition to the usual terrain you'll
have this stuff

626

showing up in pockets every so often

628
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
showing up in pockets every so often
 

629
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,269
showing up in pockets every so often
underground

630
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279

intentional because a lot of stuff is

710
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
intentional because a lot of stuff is
 

711
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,269
intentional because a lot of stuff is
catching fire

712
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
catching fire

if it is intentional i'm gonna have to
 

723
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,230
if it is intentional i'm gonna have to
redesign a few areas i think

it's nice to get new blocks every now
 

735
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,030
it's nice to get new blocks every now
and then in the game and

so i looked in my enchanting tables
 

1055
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,110
so i looked in my enchanting tables
around my world they all say the same

1056
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
around my world they all say the same

thing they all have the same
enchantments available so it seems to be

1060
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
enchantments available so it seems to be
 

1061
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,950
enchantments available so it seems to be
worldwide i've tried

1062
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
worldwide i've tried
 

1063
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,630
worldwide i've tried
moving the enchanting tables around in

1064
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
moving the enchanting tables around in
 

1065
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,390
moving the enchanting tables around in
different spots too and that doesn't

1066
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
different spots too and that doesn't
 

1067
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,750
different spots too and that doesn't
change anything

1068
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
change anything
 

1069
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,909
change anything
so it seems to be a worldwide thing that

1070
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
so it seems to be a worldwide thing that
 

1071
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,830
so it seems to be a worldwide thing that
doesn't change until you enchant

1072
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
doesn't change until you enchant
 

1073
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,070
doesn't change until you enchant
something

efficiency three

1102
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
efficiency three
 

1103
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,430
efficiency three
oh one breaking three efficiency two

1104
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440

1133
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,149

let's see so just let's try to do a

1134
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
let's see so just let's try to do a
 

1135
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,909
let's see so just let's try to do a
trade here

1136
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
trade here
 

1137
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,390
trade here
looking at this honestly compared to

1138
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
looking at this honestly compared to
 

1139
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,230
looking at this honestly compared to
efficiency three and unbreaking three i

1140
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
efficiency three and unbreaking three i
 

1141
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,830
efficiency three and unbreaking three i
would rather have unbreaking three on a

1142
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
would rather have unbreaking three on a
 

1143
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,350
would rather have unbreaking three on a
pick

1144
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
pick
 

1145
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,390
pick
so let's do that because i can upgrade

1146
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
so let's do that because i can upgrade
 

1147
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,710
so let's do that because i can upgrade
that

1148
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
that
 

1149
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,549
that
to a work pick pretty nicely

1150
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
to a work pick pretty nicely
 

1151
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,549
to a work pick pretty nicely
if i get efficiency books efficiency

1152
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
if i get efficiency books efficiency
 

1153
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,669
if i get efficiency books efficiency
five

1154
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679

 

1155
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,870

and it's cheaper so let's do it that way

1156
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
and it's cheaper so let's do it that way
 

1157
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,990
and it's cheaper so let's do it that way
we're gonna get a bad second enchant if
