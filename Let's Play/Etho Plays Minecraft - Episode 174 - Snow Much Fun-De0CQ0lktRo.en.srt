would be sound pops and that but over
 

113
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,350
would be sound pops and that but over
time I figured out how to position it

114
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,360
time I figured out how to position it
 

115
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,319
time I figured out how to position it
from my face properly but this new one

116
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,329
from my face properly but this new one
 

117
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,840
from my face properly but this new one
it tends to want to rub against my face

118
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:15,850
it tends to want to rub against my face
 

119
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,800
it tends to want to rub against my face
that the microphone parts so hopefully

120
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:18,810
that the microphone parts so hopefully
 

121
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,199
that the microphone parts so hopefully
that gets bent properly and it's not too

122
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,209
that gets bent properly and it's not too
 

123
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,640
that gets bent properly and it's not too
loud today I don't know how it's going

124
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:23,650
loud today I don't know how it's going
 

125
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,670
loud today I don't know how it's going
to sound I haven't tested it yet but the

126
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:26,680
to sound I haven't tested it yet but the
 

127
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,180
to sound I haven't tested it yet but the
new one is actually a lot more

128
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,190
new one is actually a lot more
 

129
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,190
new one is actually a lot more
comfortable and the sound quality's a

130
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,200
comfortable and the sound quality's a
 

131
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,069
comfortable and the sound quality's a
lot better so I'm pretty sure the old

132
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:35,079
lot better so I'm pretty sure the old
 

133
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,300
lot better so I'm pretty sure the old

135
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,339

161
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,240
skylight like digging up to the surface
instead of having these lamps that way

162
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,250
instead of having these lamps that way
 

163
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,790
instead of having these lamps that way
it'll light up the void fog below so

164
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
it'll light up the void fog below so
 

165
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,540
it'll light up the void fog below so
that's what we're going to do I also had

166
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:40,550
that's what we're going to do I also had
 

167
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,240
that's what we're going to do I also had
suggestions to switch this glass out

168
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,250
suggestions to switch this glass out
 

169
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,820
suggestions to switch this glass out
with ice which I think would look really

170
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:45,830
with ice which I think would look really
 

171
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,770
with ice which I think would look really
cool we'll do that in the new patch when

172
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:47,780
cool we'll do that in the new patch when
 

173
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,710
cool we'll do that in the new patch when
we can pick it up with silk touch and

174
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:49,720
we can pick it up with silk touch and
 

175
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,510
we can pick it up with silk touch and
also dad a little bit more to it so it's

176
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,520
also dad a little bit more to it so it's
 

177
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,080
also dad a little bit more to it so it's
not solid solid glass or solid ice to

178
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,090
not solid solid glass or solid ice to
 

179
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,370
not solid solid glass or solid ice to
add a little bit of a grid to it what

180
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,380

 

181
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,210

okay so that's the plan with that but

182
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,220
okay so that's the plan with that but
 

183
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,900
okay so that's the plan with that but
we're not just going to do a glass son

184
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:10,910
we're not just going to do a glass son
 

185
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,360
we're not just going to do a glass son
lights here I kind of came up with

186
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,370
lights here I kind of came up with
 

187
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,120
lights here I kind of came up with
another idea that works with it and I

188
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,130
another idea that works with it and I
 

189
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,530
another idea that works with it and I
will get to that in a bit I'm going to

190
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:17,540
will get to that in a bit I'm going to
 

191
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,030
will get to that in a bit I'm going to
haul this one out yet and we'll get

192
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,040
haul this one out yet and we'll get
 

193
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:26,260
haul this one out yet and we'll get
started okay let's get started here so

194
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,270
started okay let's get started here so
 

195
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,230
started okay let's get started here so
the advantage of using sunlight is

196
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
the advantage of using sunlight is
 

197
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,150
the advantage of using sunlight is
sunlight is a light level of 15 and that

198
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,160
sunlight is a light level of 15 and that
 

199
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,280
sunlight is a light level of 15 and that
gets all the way to the glass here look

200
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,290
gets all the way to the glass here look
 

201
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,890
gets all the way to the glass here look
how bright this room is right now it's

202
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:35,900
how bright this room is right now it's
 

203
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,280
how bright this room is right now it's
really really bright but if you were to

204
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,290
really really bright but if you were to
 

205
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,740
really really bright but if you were to
have like a lamp or a piece of glowstone

206
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:41,750
have like a lamp or a piece of glowstone
 

207
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,500
have like a lamp or a piece of glowstone
there it's it's light level 15 as well

208
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:44,510
there it's it's light level 15 as well
 

209
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,330
there it's it's light level 15 as well
but only at that block and then the

210
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:46,340
but only at that block and then the
 

211
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,180
but only at that block and then the
light dwindles in a diamond shape from

212
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,190
light dwindles in a diamond shape from
 

213
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,460
light dwindles in a diamond shape from
that so you go down one block it's

214
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,470
that so you go down one block it's
 

215
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,240
that so you go down one block it's
fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten

216
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,250
fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten
 

217
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,890
fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten
glass by the time it gets the glass its

218
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:56,900
glass by the time it gets the glass its
 

219
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,170
glass by the time it gets the glass its
light little light level nine but if

220
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,180
light little light level nine but if
 

221
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,020
light little light level nine but if
it's sunlight glass is light level 15

222
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,030
it's sunlight glass is light level 15
 

223
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,020
it's sunlight glass is light level 15
you know in a column all the way down

224
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,030
you know in a column all the way down
 

225
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,820
you know in a column all the way down
the disadvantage of having a glass

226
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:08,830
the disadvantage of having a glass
 

227
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,089
the disadvantage of having a glass
sunlight is at night the light level

228
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:12,099
sunlight is at night the light level
 

229
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:15,749
sunlight is at night the light level
drops down to level 4 so a lamp would

230
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
drops down to level 4 so a lamp would
 

231
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,209
drops down to level 4 so a lamp would
almost be better at night and Sun lights

232
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:20,219
almost be better at night and Sun lights
 

233
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,820
almost be better at night and Sun lights
during the day and I think the sunlight

234
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:23,830
during the day and I think the sunlight
 

235
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,149
during the day and I think the sunlight
also blocks out void fog or used to

236
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:27,159
also blocks out void fog or used to
 

237
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:32,279
also blocks out void fog or used to
anyway I don't know yeah yeah it's gone

238
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:32,289
anyway I don't know yeah yeah it's gone
 

239
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,260
anyway I don't know yeah yeah it's gone
I'm pretty sure it's gone so that's

240
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,270
I'm pretty sure it's gone so that's
 

241
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,850
I'm pretty sure it's gone so that's
another advantage of having a sunlight

242
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:35,860
another advantage of having a sunlight
 

243
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,059
another advantage of having a sunlight
so here's what we're going to do we're

244
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:39,069
so here's what we're going to do we're
 

245
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,170
so here's what we're going to do we're
going to try to get the best of both

246
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,180
going to try to get the best of both
 

247
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,869
going to try to get the best of both
worlds I have this idea to do a block

248
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:42,879
worlds I have this idea to do a block
 

249
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,589
worlds I have this idea to do a block
switcher right above one of these

250
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:48,599
switcher right above one of these
 

251
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,439
switcher right above one of these
so let's I'll hollow this out and then

252
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:52,449
so let's I'll hollow this out and then
 

253
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,779
so let's I'll hollow this out and then
we'll get started I know I said that

254
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:54,789
we'll get started I know I said that
 

255
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,550
we'll get started I know I said that
right but I mean like take out the roof

256
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
right but I mean like take out the roof
 

257
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,100
right but I mean like take out the roof
the ceiling whatever let's go okay so

258
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,110
the ceiling whatever let's go okay so
 

259
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,269
the ceiling whatever let's go okay so
this is what we're going to do we're

260
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:03,279
this is what we're going to do we're
 

261
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,679
this is what we're going to do we're
going to build the block switcher here

262
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:04,689
going to build the block switcher here
 

263
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:08,610
going to build the block switcher here
and I believe this is C and B minecraft

264
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:08,620
and I believe this is C and B minecraft
 

265
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,029
and I believe this is C and B minecraft
blocks which er if I remember right it

266
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:12,039
blocks which er if I remember right it
 

267
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,499
blocks which er if I remember right it
could be wrong but I believe that's

268
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:13,509
could be wrong but I believe that's
 

269
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:23,029
could be wrong but I believe that's
right um goes like that then you have

270
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039

 

271
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,029

redstone there right stone there torch

272
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
redstone there right stone there torch
 

273
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,200
redstone there right stone there torch
and the torch there and a torch there

274
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,210
and the torch there and a torch there
 

275
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,769
and the torch there and a torch there
okay and then you get a sticky piston it

276
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:37,779
okay and then you get a sticky piston it
 

277
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:40,740
okay and then you get a sticky piston it
has to go the same levels that redstone

278
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:40,750
has to go the same levels that redstone
 

279
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:49,019
has to go the same levels that redstone
torch fireman writes see if we can get

280
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:49,029
torch fireman writes see if we can get
 

281
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:51,730
torch fireman writes see if we can get
this

282
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:51,740

 

283
00:07:51,740 --> 00:08:00,650

mm that's not let me place it where did

284
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:00,660
mm that's not let me place it where did
 

285
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,280
mm that's not let me place it where did
that go

286
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,290
that go
 

287
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:06,860
that go
Oh total miss let's try one more time

288
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:06,870
Oh total miss let's try one more time
 

289
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,040
Oh total miss let's try one more time
there we go now I'm stuck in it good job

290
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,050
there we go now I'm stuck in it good job
 

291
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,879
there we go now I'm stuck in it good job
I tried to break something I will break

292
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:13,889
I tried to break something I will break
 

293
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,180
I tried to break something I will break
the piston and we don't want that okay

294
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,190
the piston and we don't want that okay
 

295
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,970
the piston and we don't want that okay
so we got a 1 going down like that then

296
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:19,980
so we got a 1 going down like that then
 

297
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,820
so we got a 1 going down like that then
we have one here and we got to place our

298
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:25,830
we have one here and we got to place our
 

299
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,730
we have one here and we got to place our
other block I think I have to use

300
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:28,740
other block I think I have to use
 

301
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,409
other block I think I have to use
glowstone for it but we'll use a lamp

302
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:30,419
glowstone for it but we'll use a lamp
 

303
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:36,110
glowstone for it but we'll use a lamp
for right now and then another piston

304
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,120
for right now and then another piston
 

305
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,870
for right now and then another piston
here like that we will put glass here

306
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:41,880
here like that we will put glass here
 

307
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,450
here like that we will put glass here
for the skylight I keep saying sunlight

308
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:44,460
for the skylight I keep saying sunlight
 

309
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,940
for the skylight I keep saying sunlight
when I should be saying skylight ok and

310
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:48,950
when I should be saying skylight ok and
 

311
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,370
when I should be saying skylight ok and
then that is all there is to it so we

312
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,380
then that is all there is to it so we
 

313
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,290
then that is all there is to it so we
will test this out an idea is Pistons

314
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:57,300
will test this out an idea is Pistons
 

315
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,270
will test this out an idea is Pistons
are a transparent block so the light

316
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,280
are a transparent block so the light
 

317
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,070
are a transparent block so the light
watch she passes through it and also

318
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,080
watch she passes through it and also
 

319
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,160
watch she passes through it and also
through the glass so that's going to

320
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,170
through the glass so that's going to
 

321
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,000
through the glass so that's going to
work out really well now what am i doing

322
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,010
work out really well now what am i doing
 

323
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:15,910
work out really well now what am i doing
I want a button so just to demonstrate

324
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920

 

325
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,870

actually I don't know if we saw that so

326
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:17,880
actually I don't know if we saw that so
 

327
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,470
actually I don't know if we saw that so
it was glass now it's the lamp

328
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
it was glass now it's the lamp
 

329
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,740
it was glass now it's the lamp
let's make ladders up because I'm going

330
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:24,750
let's make ladders up because I'm going
 

331
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,510
let's make ladders up because I'm going
to have to keep going up and down over

332
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:26,520
to have to keep going up and down over
 

333
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,120
to have to keep going up and down over
and over again this piston is not

334
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,130
and over again this piston is not
 

335
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,420
and over again this piston is not
necessary yeah press it again it will

336
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,430
necessary yeah press it again it will
 

337
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,450
necessary yeah press it again it will
switch the glass again so that's that's

338
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:38,460
switch the glass again so that's that's
 

339
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,260
switch the glass again so that's that's
what we're going to do we're going to

340
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,270
what we're going to do we're going to
 

341
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,079
what we're going to do we're going to
have a sunlight I did it again skylights

342
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:42,089
have a sunlight I did it again skylights
 

343
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:43,850
have a sunlight I did it again skylights
we're out of a skylight during the day

344
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:43,860
we're out of a skylight during the day
 

345
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,160
we're out of a skylight during the day
and at night we will have it

346
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,170
and at night we will have it
 

347
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,160
and at night we will have it
automatically switch to a piece of

348
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,170
automatically switch to a piece of
 

349
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,310
automatically switch to a piece of
glowstone probably using a day-night

350
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
glowstone probably using a day-night
 

351
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,079
glowstone probably using a day-night
sensor but we'll do that later that's

352
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:54,089
sensor but we'll do that later that's
 

353
00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:01,040
sensor but we'll do that later that's
just the plan so with this setup I think

354
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,050
just the plan so with this setup I think
 

355
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,860
just the plan so with this setup I think
I can't run wire on these

356
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:03,870
I can't run wire on these
 

357
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,050
I can't run wire on these
slabs or stairs so what I'll actually do

358
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,060
slabs or stairs so what I'll actually do
 

359
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,500
slabs or stairs so what I'll actually do
is change this a little bit get rid of

360
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,510
is change this a little bit get rid of
 

361
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,760
is change this a little bit get rid of
that and we don't really need the button

362
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:13,770
that and we don't really need the button
 

363
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,690
that and we don't really need the button
actually so we'll do it like this we'll

364
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:17,700
actually so we'll do it like this we'll
 

365
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,840
actually so we'll do it like this we'll
have the torch over on the side like

366
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:20,850
have the torch over on the side like
 

367
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:31,579
have the torch over on the side like
this yeah and then we can have wire

368
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:31,589
this yeah and then we can have wire
 

369
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,140
this yeah and then we can have wire
running to it like like that at that

370
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,150
running to it like like that at that
 

371
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,820
running to it like like that at that
level we can put down a block that way

372
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:37,830
level we can put down a block that way
 

373
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,090
level we can put down a block that way
so we'll probably have a central wire in

374
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,100
so we'll probably have a central wire in
 

375
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,150
so we'll probably have a central wire in
the middle here which will branch out to

376
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
the middle here which will branch out to
 

377
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,720
the middle here which will branch out to
this one the one over here and same with

378
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:47,730
this one the one over here and same with
 

379
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,310
this one the one over here and same with
over there and there so this is all

380
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
over there and there so this is all
 

381
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,500
over there and there so this is all
built and wired now this is the main

382
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:54,510
built and wired now this is the main
 

383
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,690
built and wired now this is the main
wire here in the middle it connects to

384
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:56,700
wire here in the middle it connects to
 

385
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,740
wire here in the middle it connects to
all four of the switchers and when we

386
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:00,750
all four of the switchers and when we
 

387
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,600
all four of the switchers and when we
build the day-night sensor that's will

388
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:02,610
build the day-night sensor that's will
 

389
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,880
build the day-night sensor that's will
hook up to this wire but in the meantime

390
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:04,890
hook up to this wire but in the meantime
 

391
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,510
hook up to this wire but in the meantime
we just have a button which we can

392
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:08,520
we just have a button which we can
 

393
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,220
we just have a button which we can
switch between the two with and for the

394
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,230
switch between the two with and for the
 

395
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,199
switch between the two with and for the
default tool just leave it on glass

396
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:15,209
default tool just leave it on glass
 

397
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,000
default tool just leave it on glass
until we get the day-night sensor hooked

398
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,010
until we get the day-night sensor hooked
 

399
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,390
until we get the day-night sensor hooked
up because I think fake press yeah and I

400
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:23,400
up because I think fake press yeah and I
 

401
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,829
up because I think fake press yeah and I
got a dirt block there until we get

402
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:24,839
got a dirt block there until we get
 

403
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,960
got a dirt block there until we get
glowstone over here to I switch I

404
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:26,970
glowstone over here to I switch I
 

405
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,670
glowstone over here to I switch I
switched out the lamps because I think

406
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,680
switched out the lamps because I think
 

407
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,960
switched out the lamps because I think
they were causing more lag so yeah that

408
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:32,970
they were causing more lag so yeah that
 

409
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,519
they were causing more lag so yeah that
is done for right now anyway and I don't

410
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:37,529
is done for right now anyway and I don't
 

411
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,990
is done for right now anyway and I don't
think that's going to interfere with the

412
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,000
think that's going to interfere with the
 

413
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,180
think that's going to interfere with the
ceiling I think I think that'll work out

414
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,190
ceiling I think I think that'll work out
 

415
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:48,800
ceiling I think I think that'll work out
okay beautiful world's just beautiful

build it out of a few episodes ago and

470
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,030
build it out of a few episodes ago and

snow was suggested by many loved the

snow was suggested by many loved the
 

473
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,300
snow was suggested by many loved the
idea so it's going to be out of snow

I'll probably build the whole thing out
 

477
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,290
I'll probably build the whole thing out
of snow just to begin with and if I want

478
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:14,300
of snow just to begin with and if I want
 

479
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,470
of snow just to begin with and if I want
to add more character to it later we can

480
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:17,480
to add more character to it later we can
 

481
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,710
to add more character to it later we can
go back and revise it but I got one of

482
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
go back and revise it but I got one of
 

483
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:30,160
go back and revise it but I got one of
these guys here give us snow and sorry

484
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,170
these guys here give us snow and sorry
 

485
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,260
these guys here give us snow and sorry
distract got lots of snow I'll tell you

486
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,270
distract got lots of snow I'll tell you
 

487
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,450
distract got lots of snow I'll tell you
what we're gonna do

488
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:36,460
what we're gonna do
 

489
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,770
what we're gonna do
this is where it's bowing right above

490
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:38,780
this is where it's bowing right above
 

491
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,820
this is where it's bowing right above
the silverfish farm because the

492
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:42,830
the silverfish farm because the
 

493
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,020
the silverfish farm because the
silverfish farm is going to be the

494
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,030
silverfish farm is going to be the
 

495
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:49,750
silverfish farm is going to be the
basement and the storage room slash mob

496
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
basement and the storage room slash mob
 

497
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,630
basement and the storage room slash mob
system ground level is going to be about

498
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:52,640
system ground level is going to be about
 

499
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,750
system ground level is going to be about
here maybe a little bit higher for the

500
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
here maybe a little bit higher for the
 

501
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,940
here maybe a little bit higher for the
mob system right at this block here that

502
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:00,950
mob system right at this block here that
 

503
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,410
mob system right at this block here that
is where the silverfish spawner is that

504
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:05,420
is where the silverfish spawner is that
 

505
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,400
is where the silverfish spawner is that
is the epicenter of everything I plan to

506
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,410
is the epicenter of everything I plan to
 

507
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,260
is the epicenter of everything I plan to
build here a lot of people are wondering

508
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,270
build here a lot of people are wondering
 

509
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,060
build here a lot of people are wondering
why I haven't built the mob system yet

510
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,070
why I haven't built the mob system yet
 

511
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,550
why I haven't built the mob system yet
and I don't really have a good answer

512
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:15,560
and I don't really have a good answer
 

513
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,880
and I don't really have a good answer
for you but one of the reasons was

514
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:18,890
for you but one of the reasons was
 

515
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,670
for you but one of the reasons was
because when I build it I want it to be

516
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
because when I build it I want it to be
 

517
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,620
because when I build it I want it to be
built right I want everything in the

518
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:23,630
built right I want everything in the
 

519
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,800
built right I want everything in the
right place I don't want to have any

520
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:25,810
right place I don't want to have any
 

521
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,410
right place I don't want to have any
design regrets after it's done like I've

522
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:29,420
design regrets after it's done like I've
 

523
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,350
design regrets after it's done like I've
had in the past so I just want to make

524
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,360
had in the past so I just want to make
 

525
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,850
had in the past so I just want to make
sure I get it right position

526
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:33,860
sure I get it right position
 

527
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,990
sure I get it right position
right built right all right and then it

528
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
right built right all right and then it
 

529
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,759
right built right all right and then it
will be cool and I'll be happy with it

530
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:39,769
will be cool and I'll be happy with it
 

531
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:44,889
will be cool and I'll be happy with it
so this is the center right here the

532
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:44,899
so this is the center right here the
 

533
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,460
so this is the center right here the
plan is to build for EMP units you guys

534
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:48,470
plan is to build for EMP units you guys
 

535
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,449
plan is to build for EMP units you guys
remember the EMP units from the ice base

536
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:51,459
remember the EMP units from the ice base
 

537
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,930
remember the EMP units from the ice base
round episode 7080 ish that project

538
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:55,940
round episode 7080 ish that project
 

539
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,090
round episode 7080 ish that project
never really got finished because of the

540
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,100
never really got finished because of the
 

541
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,360
never really got finished because of the
patch and the new world here but we're

542
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,370
patch and the new world here but we're
 

543
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,790
patch and the new world here but we're
going to do we're just going to have for

544
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:03,800
going to do we're just going to have for
 

545
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,579
going to do we're just going to have for
EMP units it's going to be pretty simple

546
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:05,589
EMP units it's going to be pretty simple
 

547
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,420
EMP units it's going to be pretty simple
those are five by four five wide by four

548
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,430
those are five by four five wide by four
 

549
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,670
those are five by four five wide by four
deep a lot of the deepness is from the

550
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
deep a lot of the deepness is from the
 

551
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,240
deep a lot of the deepness is from the
wiring but this is the center and we're

552
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,250
wiring but this is the center and we're
 

553
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,130
wiring but this is the center and we're
going to do four of them this is how I

554
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,140
going to do four of them this is how I
 

555
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,620
going to do four of them this is how I
plan on laying it out this is what I've

556
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:23,630
plan on laying it out this is what I've
 

557
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,949
plan on laying it out this is what I've
been trying to figure out we're going to

558
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
been trying to figure out we're going to
 

559
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,340
been trying to figure out we're going to
have a five by five empty area around

560
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,350
have a five by five empty area around
 

561
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,949
have a five by five empty area around
the center like that and then each of

562
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
the center like that and then each of
 

563
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,199
the center like that and then each of
the EMP units will go like one will go

564
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:41,209
the EMP units will go like one will go
 

565
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,740
the EMP units will go like one will go
here so but I need five by five wait

566
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:44,750
here so but I need five by five wait
 

567
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,310
here so but I need five by five wait
wait wait

568
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:45,320
wait wait
 

569
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,180
wait wait
I feel like I figured out something

570
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,190
I feel like I figured out something
 

571
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:59,009
I feel like I figured out something
wrong here goes yeah we'll have ah

572
00:16:59,009 --> 00:16:59,019

 

573
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:04,630

you got something wrong how's this kind

574
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
you got something wrong how's this kind
 

575
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,390
you got something wrong how's this kind
of layouts one will go there and then

576
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
of layouts one will go there and then
 

577
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,699
of layouts one will go there and then
yeah it's got to be spaced further okay

578
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:12,709
yeah it's got to be spaced further okay
 

579
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,860
yeah it's got to be spaced further okay
so it has to go from from there you're

580
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:17,870
so it has to go from from there you're
 

581
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,990
so it has to go from from there you're
imagining it right I know it's it's

582
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
imagining it right I know it's it's
 

583
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,640
imagining it right I know it's it's
pretty tough from that so one will go

584
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:21,650
pretty tough from that so one will go
 

585
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,179
pretty tough from that so one will go
there so the front of the IMP unit will

586
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:25,189
there so the front of the IMP unit will
 

587
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,470
there so the front of the IMP unit will
be right here

588
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
be right here
 

589
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,409
be right here
and it's five wide that's the Front's

590
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:29,419
and it's five wide that's the Front's
 

591
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:31,870
and it's five wide that's the Front's
then one two three blocks for the wiring

592
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:31,880
then one two three blocks for the wiring
 

593
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,460
then one two three blocks for the wiring
we will reserve another one we'll go

594
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:35,470
we will reserve another one we'll go
 

595
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,010
we will reserve another one we'll go
here so I'm just laying out of five by

596
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,020
here so I'm just laying out of five by
 

597
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,919
here so I'm just laying out of five by
four area for it so and it's faceplate

598
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:41,929
four area for it so and it's faceplate
 

599
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,240
four area for it so and it's faceplate
will be here

600
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,250
will be here
 

601
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,669
will be here
and then again so all the way around

602
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:46,679
and then again so all the way around
 

603
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,750
and then again so all the way around
we're going to have for a lot of blocks

604
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:52,760

 

605
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,409

as one will go there and main one will

606
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:57,419
as one will go there and main one will
 

607
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,830
as one will go there and main one will
be over here I think the one on the side

608
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:00,840
be over here I think the one on the side
 

609
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,659
be over here I think the one on the side
it doesn't really matter much which side

610
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:02,669
it doesn't really matter much which side
 

611
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:06,110
it doesn't really matter much which side
I choose and its face will be here again

612
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,120
I choose and its face will be here again
 

613
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,470
I choose and its face will be here again
and these will be for the wiring this

614
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,480
and these will be for the wiring this
 

615
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,169
and these will be for the wiring this
area here so this middle part will

616
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:15,179
area here so this middle part will
 

617
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,510
area here so this middle part will
probably just be empty space or I might

618
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
probably just be empty space or I might
 

619
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,120
probably just be empty space or I might
keep it open in case I have to add

620
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,130
keep it open in case I have to add
 

621
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,940
keep it open in case I have to add
something behind the NP units I don't

622
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:22,950
something behind the NP units I don't
 

623
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,360
something behind the NP units I don't
know now this main one over here is

624
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,370
know now this main one over here is
 

625
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,320
know now this main one over here is
going to be for creepers zombies and

626
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,330
going to be for creepers zombies and
 

627
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,000
going to be for creepers zombies and
skeletons so all three of them and then

628
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,010
skeletons so all three of them and then
 

629
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,799
skeletons so all three of them and then
one of these will be just for creepers

630
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:36,809
one of these will be just for creepers
 

631
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,860
one of these will be just for creepers
one will be just for skeletons one will

632
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:39,870
one will be just for skeletons one will
 

633
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,710
one will be just for skeletons one will
be just for zombies okay now for the

634
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:45,720
be just for zombies okay now for the
 

635
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,169
be just for zombies okay now for the
main one we're going to build the mob

636
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:48,179
main one we're going to build the mob
 

637
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,299
main one we're going to build the mob
system directly above it okay because we

638
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:53,309
system directly above it okay because we
 

639
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:54,890
system directly above it okay because we
want to be able to kill them as quick as

640
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:54,900
want to be able to kill them as quick as
 

641
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,600
want to be able to kill them as quick as
possible it's probably the one I'll use

642
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,610
possible it's probably the one I'll use
 

643
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,210
possible it's probably the one I'll use
the most so I want as short as travel

644
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,220
the most so I want as short as travel
 

645
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,480
the most so I want as short as travel
time as possible for the mobs so that we

646
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,490
time as possible for the mobs so that we
 

647
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,310
time as possible for the mobs so that we
can spawn more and get more items

648
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
can spawn more and get more items
 

649
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,810
can spawn more and get more items
quicker all right so the mob system will

650
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:08,820
quicker all right so the mob system will
 

651
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,549
quicker all right so the mob system will
probably be right over here it doesn't

652
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
probably be right over here it doesn't
 

653
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,049
probably be right over here it doesn't
need to be centered around the

654
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:12,059
need to be centered around the
 

655
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,370
need to be centered around the
silverfish spawner we just want the room

656
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:15,380
silverfish spawner we just want the room
 

657
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,470
silverfish spawner we just want the room
centered around that so if we're walking

658
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
centered around that so if we're walking
 

659
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,960
centered around that so if we're walking
around like over here or whatever

660
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:20,970
around like over here or whatever
 

661
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,899
around like over here or whatever
silverfish will be spawning as we're

662
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:23,909
silverfish will be spawning as we're
 

663
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:26,960
silverfish will be spawning as we're
doing stuff and then the storage room

664
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:26,970
doing stuff and then the storage room
 

665
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,720
doing stuff and then the storage room
will probably be like all the chests

666
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:29,730
will probably be like all the chests
 

667
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,310
will probably be like all the chests
will probably be all around this main

668
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,320
will probably be all around this main
 

669
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,710
will probably be all around this main
centerpiece but we're going to elevate

670
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:33,720
centerpiece but we're going to elevate
 

671
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,169
centerpiece but we're going to elevate
this a little bit off the floor to make

672
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:36,179
this a little bit off the floor to make
 

673
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,770
this a little bit off the floor to make
it stand out and have the storage room

674
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:38,780
it stand out and have the storage room
 

675
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,690
it stand out and have the storage room
level a few blocks lower than the EMP

676
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:41,700
level a few blocks lower than the EMP
 

677
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,470
level a few blocks lower than the EMP
level probably is what I'm thinking okay

678
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:47,480
level probably is what I'm thinking okay
 

679
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,630
level probably is what I'm thinking okay
lots of talking today ah as far as where

680
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:53,640
lots of talking today ah as far as where
 

681
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,540
lots of talking today ah as far as where
the building starts

682
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:55,550
the building starts
 

683
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,480
the building starts
it's going to start at y61 is what I

684
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,490
it's going to start at y61 is what I
 

685
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,480
it's going to start at y61 is what I
figured out on paper here so that gives

686
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,490
figured out on paper here so that gives
 

687
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,970
figured out on paper here so that gives
wait let me get my calculator 61 - where

688
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:06,980
wait let me get my calculator 61 - where
 

689
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,150
wait let me get my calculator 61 - where
do we get 30 while our feet are at 34

690
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,160
do we get 30 while our feet are at 34
 

691
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,360
do we get 30 while our feet are at 34
okay that's 27 blocks so we need 24

692
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,370
okay that's 27 blocks so we need 24
 

693
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,640
okay that's 27 blocks so we need 24
blocks for them to fall and die so

694
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:18,650
blocks for them to fall and die so
 

695
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,169
blocks for them to fall and die so
that's why we're going to have that

696
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:20,179
that's why we're going to have that
 

697
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,980
that's why we're going to have that
buffer there and each layer of the mob

698
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:23,990
buffer there and each layer of the mob
 

699
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,690
buffer there and each layer of the mob
system is five blocks tall so you'll

700
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:28,700
system is five blocks tall so you'll
 

701
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,610
system is five blocks tall so you'll
start at 61 will be the floor of it

702
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:30,620
start at 61 will be the floor of it
 

703
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:36,940
start at 61 will be the floor of it
it'll go all the way up to 127 we don't

704
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:36,950
it'll go all the way up to 127 we don't
 

705
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,090
it'll go all the way up to 127 we don't
want to go above that because then the

706
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,100
want to go above that because then the
 

707
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,460
want to go above that because then the
game has to check more space to spawn

708
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:42,470
game has to check more space to spawn
 

709
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,080
game has to check more space to spawn
mobs so it'll lower rates which is the

710
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,090
mobs so it'll lower rates which is the
 

711
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,210
mobs so it'll lower rates which is the
reason why my Enderman farm still works

712
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,220
reason why my Enderman farm still works
 

713
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,549
reason why my Enderman farm still works
good even after the anvil format is

714
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:51,559
good even after the anvil format is
 

715
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,210
good even after the anvil format is
because they only check extra area if

716
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,220
because they only check extra area if
 

717
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,450
because they only check extra area if
you build in the extra area like above

718
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:58,460
you build in the extra area like above
 

719
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,430
you build in the extra area like above
the the olds nap height right because

720
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
the the olds nap height right because
 

721
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,160

when it I figured when the new format

722
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,170
when it I figured when the new format
 

723
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,990
when it I figured when the new format
came out my Enderman farm was going to

724
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
came out my Enderman farm was going to
 

725
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,640
came out my Enderman farm was going to
be twice as slow because it would have

726
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:09,650
be twice as slow because it would have
 

727
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,940
be twice as slow because it would have
to check twice a space but it only does

728
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:12,950
to check twice a space but it only does
 

729
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,680
to check twice a space but it only does
that if you build above that so we're

730
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:14,690
that if you build above that so we're
 

731
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,540
that if you build above that so we're
going to avoid doing that if possible at

732
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,550
going to avoid doing that if possible at
 

733
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,919
going to avoid doing that if possible at
least I'm pretty sure that's the way it

734
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:20,929
least I'm pretty sure that's the way it
 

735
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:28,960
least I'm pretty sure that's the way it
works or still works okay so up we go

736
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:28,970
works or still works okay so up we go
 

737
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,810
works or still works okay so up we go
again that lag I stocked in a doctor

738
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:31,820
again that lag I stocked in a doctor
 

739
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,880
again that lag I stocked in a doctor
other day he says that's cause from the

740
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:33,890
other day he says that's cause from the
 

741
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:41,290
other day he says that's cause from the
game having to play sound or or like the

742
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,300
game having to play sound or or like the
 

743
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,880
game having to play sound or or like the
silverfish jumping in the water that's

744
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:42,890
silverfish jumping in the water that's
 

745
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,410
silverfish jumping in the water that's
what's causing that leg and that I

746
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:44,420
what's causing that leg and that I
 

747
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,470
what's causing that leg and that I
believe that makes sense so because it I

748
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
believe that makes sense so because it I
 

749
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,200
believe that makes sense so because it I
get that whenever I go like 16 blocks

750
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,210
get that whenever I go like 16 blocks
 

751
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,760
get that whenever I go like 16 blocks
away from the silverfish doesn't matter

752
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:54,770
away from the silverfish doesn't matter
 

753
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,290
away from the silverfish doesn't matter
which direction it could be up or down

754
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:56,300
which direction it could be up or down
 

755
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,750
which direction it could be up or down
well not down but left right you know

756
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:00,760
well not down but left right you know
 

757
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,410
well not down but left right you know
okay so rates

758
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:05,420

 

759
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,140

here this level this is a start I gotta

760
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,150
here this level this is a start I gotta
 

761
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,380
here this level this is a start I gotta
clear out space forts and I'll probably

762
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,390
clear out space forts and I'll probably
 

763
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,090
clear out space forts and I'll probably
try build a few layers today but I'm

764
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:13,100
try build a few layers today but I'm
 

765
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,040
try build a few layers today but I'm
going to do that off camera and we'll

766
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,050
going to do that off camera and we'll
 

767
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:21,010
going to do that off camera and we'll
see how it looks made of snow so we've

768
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,020
see how it looks made of snow so we've
 

769
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,960
see how it looks made of snow so we've
broken the land here we're getting

770
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:22,970
broken the land here we're getting
 

771
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,060
broken the land here we're getting
started I got a clear about three blocks

772
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,070
started I got a clear about three blocks
 

773
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,340
started I got a clear about three blocks
down for the first layer and then beyond

774
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,350
down for the first layer and then beyond
 

775
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,850
down for the first layer and then beyond
that it should get a lot simpler because

776
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:30,860
that it should get a lot simpler because
 

777
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,040
that it should get a lot simpler because
we're we got the space all cleared up

778
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,050
we're we got the space all cleared up
 

779
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,280
we're we got the space all cleared up
above but this mountain is in the way so

780
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,290
above but this mountain is in the way so
 

781
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,220
above but this mountain is in the way so
I'll have to chisel a lot of it away

782
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,230
I'll have to chisel a lot of it away
 

783
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,950
I'll have to chisel a lot of it away
probably which will slow things down a

784
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:41,960
probably which will slow things down a
 

785
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,010
probably which will slow things down a
bit and my dad you decide to teleport

786
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,020
bit and my dad you decide to teleport
 

787
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,920
bit and my dad you decide to teleport
here and watch me for some unknown

788
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:46,930
here and watch me for some unknown
 

789
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,010
here and watch me for some unknown
reason but that's okay I've marked the

790
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,020
reason but that's okay I've marked the
 

791
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,110
reason but that's okay I've marked the
center with the snow block here so like

792
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,120
center with the snow block here so like
 

793
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,070
center with the snow block here so like
I gotta go I think what is it's probably

794
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
I gotta go I think what is it's probably
 

795
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,140
I gotta go I think what is it's probably
close to about ten blocks this way still

796
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,150
close to about ten blocks this way still
 

797
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,490
close to about ten blocks this way still
and all the way up to 128 so I'll have

798
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:06,500
and all the way up to 128 so I'll have
 

799
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,730
and all the way up to 128 so I'll have
to remove a fair bit of the mountain now

800
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:09,740
to remove a fair bit of the mountain now
 

801
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,710
to remove a fair bit of the mountain now
I was looking at my old EMP video

802
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
I was looking at my old EMP video
 

803
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,550
I was looking at my old EMP video
tutorial to see how I did the wiring and

804
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:17,560
tutorial to see how I did the wiring and
 

805
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,020
tutorial to see how I did the wiring and
it looks like I can actually move the

806
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,030
it looks like I can actually move the
 

807
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,570
it looks like I can actually move the
them in a little bit one more block in

808
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:22,580
them in a little bit one more block in
 

809
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,980
them in a little bit one more block in
so it's going to be not quite as big of

810
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:26,990
so it's going to be not quite as big of
 

811
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,280
so it's going to be not quite as big of
a circle around so this is a this is the

812
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,290
a circle around so this is a this is the
 

813
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,220
a circle around so this is a this is the
four points the five by five and instead

814
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,230
four points the five by five and instead
 

815
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,410
four points the five by five and instead
of having them all the way out here

816
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:38,420
of having them all the way out here
 

817
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,230
of having them all the way out here
they're going to be over here now I

818
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,240
they're going to be over here now I
 

819
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,420
they're going to be over here now I
think it'll work out

820
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:45,430

 

821
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,670

oh boy well started raining I ran out of

822
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:50,680
oh boy well started raining I ran out of
 

823
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,880
oh boy well started raining I ran out of
snow blocks so I guess this is probably

824
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:53,890
snow blocks so I guess this is probably
 

825
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,650
snow blocks so I guess this is probably
as far as we'll get with this today

826
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:55,660
as far as we'll get with this today
 

827
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,470
as far as we'll get with this today
because I did get some more

828
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
because I did get some more
 

829
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,980
because I did get some more
I had like over 10 stacks I'm sure when

830
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:01,990
I had like over 10 stacks I'm sure when
 

831
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,470
I had like over 10 stacks I'm sure when
I started by just that's just as far as

832
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
I started by just that's just as far as
 

833
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,830
I started by just that's just as far as
10 stacks gets you so about one layer is

834
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
10 stacks gets you so about one layer is
 

835
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,100
10 stacks gets you so about one layer is
worth and I have to make a lot of them

836
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,110
worth and I have to make a lot of them
 

837
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,230
worth and I have to make a lot of them
which is good I'm glad I pick a snow

838
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:13,240
which is good I'm glad I pick a snow
 

839
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,850
which is good I'm glad I pick a snow
blocks because they're really easy to

840
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:14,860
blocks because they're really easy to
 

841
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,240
blocks because they're really easy to
make and make them real quick and I like

842
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,250
make and make them real quick and I like
 

843
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,580
make and make them real quick and I like
the way it looks it's pretty cool they

844
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:20,590
the way it looks it's pretty cool they
 

845
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,120
the way it looks it's pretty cool they
all look good when it's all done and

846
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,130
all look good when it's all done and
 

847
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,250
all look good when it's all done and
it's really easy to mix colored wool

848
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:26,260
it's really easy to mix colored wool
 

849
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,350
it's really easy to mix colored wool
with snow blocks too so if I want to

850
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,360
with snow blocks too so if I want to
 

851
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,200
with snow blocks too so if I want to
decorate it afterwards I can as also

852
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,210
decorate it afterwards I can as also
 

853
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,540
decorate it afterwards I can as also
thinking maybe using ice to decorate it

854
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,550
thinking maybe using ice to decorate it
 

855
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,480
thinking maybe using ice to decorate it
afterwards when we can pick it up again

856
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:36,490
afterwards when we can pick it up again
 

857
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:42,090
afterwards when we can pick it up again
that might be cool but yeah a little

858
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,100
that might be cool but yeah a little
 

859
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,980
that might be cool but yeah a little
more info about the mob system it's

860
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:43,990
more info about the mob system it's
 

861
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,260
more info about the mob system it's
going to be 12 layers is what I figured

862
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,270
going to be 12 layers is what I figured
 

863
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,440
going to be 12 layers is what I figured
it will be each layers a hundred

864
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,450
it will be each layers a hundred
 

865
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,390
it will be each layers a hundred
spawning spaces I found out a way to add

866
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:51,400
spawning spaces I found out a way to add
 

867
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,570
spawning spaces I found out a way to add
four more so it's an even hundred so

868
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:54,580
four more so it's an even hundred so
 

869
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,350
four more so it's an even hundred so
twelve hundred total when it's all done

870
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,360
twelve hundred total when it's all done
 

871
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,550
twelve hundred total when it's all done
and it should work really really well

872
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:01,560
and it should work really really well
 

873
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,800
and it should work really really well
but I am going to go to bed now thanks

874
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:04,810
but I am going to go to bed now thanks
 

875
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,860
but I am going to go to bed now thanks
for watching everybody and until next
