as a win okay I think we're good so
 

39
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,790
as a win okay I think we're good so
today we're going to answer one of

40
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:01,800
today we're going to answer one of
 

41
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,179
today we're going to answer one of
life's greatest questions guys how did I

42
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:05,189
life's greatest questions guys how did I
 

43
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,630
life's greatest questions guys how did I
make the llamas walk around Sandy City

44
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
make the llamas walk around Sandy City
 

45
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,300
make the llamas walk around Sandy City
like that no actually that's a secret

46
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,310
like that no actually that's a secret
 

47
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,100
like that no actually that's a secret
what we're going to do instead a little

48
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,110
what we're going to do instead a little
 

49
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,480
what we're going to do instead a little
experiment here I want to see what

50
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,490
experiment here I want to see what
 

51
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,789
experiment here I want to see what
happens if how do we position this I

52
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
happens if how do we position this I
 

53
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,320
happens if how do we position this I
think we wanted to dispenser and

54
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,330
think we wanted to dispenser and
 

55
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,460
think we wanted to dispenser and
observer facing the other way like that

56
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,470
observer facing the other way like that
 

57
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,960
observer facing the other way like that
right and then observer this way and the

58
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:32,970
right and then observer this way and the
 

59
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,319
right and then observer this way and the
dispenser two dispensers two buckets of

60
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,329
dispenser two dispensers two buckets of
 

61
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,289
dispenser two dispensers two buckets of
water two observers so what happens if

62
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:39,299
water two observers so what happens if
 

63
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,280
water two observers so what happens if
we activate the observer is it going to

64
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,290
we activate the observer is it going to
 

65
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,200
we activate the observer is it going to
just activate them once I think it's

66
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,210
just activate them once I think it's
 

67
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,789
just activate them once I think it's
going to add it like create a clock like

68
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
going to add it like create a clock like
 

69
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,830
going to add it like create a clock like
they'll they'll pulse constantly all

70
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840
they'll they'll pulse constantly all
 

71
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,670
they'll they'll pulse constantly all
right let's find out I'm just curious

72
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,680

 

73
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:04,270

that's pretty cool yeah so it seems

74
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,280
that's pretty cool yeah so it seems
 

75
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,370
that's pretty cool yeah so it seems
water streams with observer blocks are a

76
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:06,380
water streams with observer blocks are a
 

77
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,660
water streams with observer blocks are a
little bit weird

78
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:07,670
little bit weird
 

79
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,240
little bit weird
they don't work quite like I expected so

80
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,250
they don't work quite like I expected so
 

81
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,680
they don't work quite like I expected so
you see it triggers twice

82
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:14,690
you see it triggers twice
 

83
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,650
you see it triggers twice
it always triggers twice that time I

84
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:20,660
it always triggers twice that time I
 

85
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,930
it always triggers twice that time I
triggered three times I think

86
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:22,940
triggered three times I think
 

87
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,440
triggered three times I think
but yeah so when the water stream gets

88
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,450
but yeah so when the water stream gets
 

89
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,199
but yeah so when the water stream gets
updated like when this water flows to

90
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,209
updated like when this water flows to
 

91
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,570
updated like when this water flows to
like where this observers it updates

92
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:31,580
like where this observers it updates
 

93
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,930
like where this observers it updates
once and then when it flows down it

94
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:34,940
once and then when it flows down it
 

95
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,089
once and then when it flows down it
updates again at this block so you can

96
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:37,099
updates again at this block so you can
 

97
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,160
updates again at this block so you can
see check this out light if I open the

98
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,170
see check this out light if I open the
 

99
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,520
see check this out light if I open the
chest next to the water stream that

100
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,530
chest next to the water stream that
 

101
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,259
chest next to the water stream that
causes the observer to update because it

102
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:44,269
causes the observer to update because it
 

103
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,880
causes the observer to update because it
updates the water which and updates

104
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:45,890
updates the water which and updates
 

105
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:57,809
updates the water which and updates
observer I think open and close yeah huh

106
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:57,819
observer I think open and close yeah huh
 

107
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,550
observer I think open and close yeah huh
okay this is unrelated to what we were

108
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
okay this is unrelated to what we were
 

109
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,199
okay this is unrelated to what we were
just doing but I have a question

110
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,209
just doing but I have a question
 

111
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,000
just doing but I have a question
maybe maybe somebody out there knows

112
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,010
maybe maybe somebody out there knows
 

113
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,069
maybe maybe somebody out there knows
what's going on when you load up the

114
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:06,079
what's going on when you load up the
 

115
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,849
what's going on when you load up the
game in the minecraft Launcher it says

116
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:09,859
game in the minecraft Launcher it says
 

117
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,680
game in the minecraft Launcher it says
loaded like 488 advancements and then

118
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:14,690
loaded like 488 advancements and then
 

119
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,099
loaded like 488 advancements and then
later it keeps saying loaded for 344

120
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:20,109
later it keeps saying loaded for 344
 

121
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:22,420
later it keeps saying loaded for 344
does anyone know what that's that's

122
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,430
does anyone know what that's that's
 

123
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,830
does anyone know what that's that's
talking about because if you look at the

124
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
talking about because if you look at the
 

125
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,050
talking about because if you look at the
advancements there's like only 50 listed

126
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,060
advancements there's like only 50 listed
 

127
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,349
advancements there's like only 50 listed
here right so where are the other 300

128
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:29,359
here right so where are the other 300
 

129
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,890
here right so where are the other 300
coming from or what's it loading

130
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:31,900
coming from or what's it loading
 

131
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,080
coming from or what's it loading
constantly curious just wondering we're

132
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,090
constantly curious just wondering we're
 

133
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,190
constantly curious just wondering we're
going to do something here I got a

134
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
going to do something here I got a
 

135
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,379
going to do something here I got a
stupid little project in mind it's going

136
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:41,389
stupid little project in mind it's going
 

137
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,740
stupid little project in mind it's going
to require 40 dispensers so what better

138
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:44,750
to require 40 dispensers so what better
 

139
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,180
to require 40 dispensers so what better
opportunity to try out the new crafting

140
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,190
opportunity to try out the new crafting
 

141
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,550
opportunity to try out the new crafting
system here then making dispensers

142
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:51,560
system here then making dispensers
 

143
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,440
system here then making dispensers
dispensers if you don't know are the

144
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,450
dispensers if you don't know are the
 

145
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,390
dispensers if you don't know are the
absolute worst thing to craft in the

146
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:55,400
absolute worst thing to craft in the
 

147
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,979
absolute worst thing to craft in the
game so we want to try this out so we

148
00:03:59,979 --> 00:03:59,989
game so we want to try this out so we
 

149
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,720
game so we want to try this out so we
still gotta like throw them that's fine

150
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:01,730
still gotta like throw them that's fine
 

151
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,370
still gotta like throw them that's fine
I expected that all right throw that I

152
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,380
I expected that all right throw that I
 

153
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,319
I expected that all right throw that I
think we still got to do it one by one

154
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,329
think we still got to do it one by one
 

155
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,070
think we still got to do it one by one
all right

156
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,080
all right
 

157
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,000
all right
I'm going to grab some cobblestone

158
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,010
I'm going to grab some cobblestone
 

159
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,820
I'm going to grab some cobblestone
boo-boo-boo-boo then we'll start picking

160
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:15,830
boo-boo-boo-boo then we'll start picking
 

161
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:23,380
boo-boo-boo-boo then we'll start picking
up the bows so I think we can go on here

162
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,390
up the bows so I think we can go on here
 

163
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,630
up the bows so I think we can go on here
like I've actually contemplated making a

164
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:25,640
like I've actually contemplated making a
 

165
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,210
like I've actually contemplated making a
machine to make crafting dispensers

166
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:28,220
machine to make crafting dispensers
 

167
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,090
machine to make crafting dispensers
easier because they're just such a pain

168
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,100
easier because they're just such a pain
 

169
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,320
easier because they're just such a pain
there's a worst oh we need redstone

170
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,330
there's a worst oh we need redstone
 

171
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,710
there's a worst oh we need redstone
that's what's missing so what's going on

172
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
that's what's missing so what's going on
 

173
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,520
that's what's missing so what's going on
okay let's try this notes dispensers so

174
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:39,530
okay let's try this notes dispensers so
 

175
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,870
okay let's try this notes dispensers so
yeah you got to do it one by one it

176
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
yeah you got to do it one by one it
 

177
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:50,230
yeah you got to do it one by one it
looks like oh no I messed up normally

178
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
looks like oh no I messed up normally
 

179
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,730
looks like oh no I messed up normally
the way I would do it is I would press Q

180
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:53,740
the way I would do it is I would press Q
 

181
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,290
the way I would do it is I would press Q
then the number key Q number key and I

182
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,300
then the number key Q number key and I
 

183
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,100
then the number key Q number key and I
think that's actually faster still all

184
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,110
think that's actually faster still all
 

185
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,050
think that's actually faster still all
right very cool very cool so we're also

186
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,060
right very cool very cool so we're also
 

187
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,180
right very cool very cool so we're also
going to need a few blaze rods for our

188
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,190
going to need a few blaze rods for our
 

189
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,090
going to need a few blaze rods for our
build here and you might be thinking

190
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,100
build here and you might be thinking
 

191
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,110
build here and you might be thinking
etho what could possibly require blaze

192
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,120
etho what could possibly require blaze
 

193
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,940
etho what could possibly require blaze
rods why would you need blaze rods for a

194
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:15,950
rods why would you need blaze rods for a
 

195
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,320
rods why would you need blaze rods for a
bill I'm gonna give you one guess all

going to get loaded into the dispensers
 

219
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,050

not too bad this is our ethos circuit

242
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,380
not too bad this is our ethos circuit
 

243
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,390
not too bad this is our ethos circuit
over here

244
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
over here
 

245
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,820
over here
and we want to try and make it look cool

246
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:24,830
and we want to try and make it look cool
 

247
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,260
and we want to try and make it look cool
right so we don't want them to all

248
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,270
right so we don't want them to all
 

249
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,540
right so we don't want them to all
activate at the same time kind of wanted

250

down you know so got the button set up
here we'll do it once before we cover it

256
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,490

 

257
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,680

just to make sure it works I got it on

258
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:41,690
just to make sure it works I got it on
 

259
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,840

Adelaide uh-huh so I think that's gonna

260
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:46,850
Adelaide uh-huh so I think that's gonna
 

261
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,450
Adelaide uh-huh so I think that's gonna
be pretty cool the whole thing activated

262
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:49,460
be pretty cool the whole thing activated
 

263
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,980
be pretty cool the whole thing activated
that's a good sign that means we didn't

264
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:50,990
that's a good sign that means we didn't
 

265
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,810
that's a good sign that means we didn't
miss a piece of redstone anywhere and

266
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:52,820
miss a piece of redstone anywhere and
 

267
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,400
miss a piece of redstone anywhere and
now all we got to do is cover it up so I

268
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,410
now all we got to do is cover it up so I
 

269
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,110
now all we got to do is cover it up so I
put slabs in places where the redstone

270
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
put slabs in places where the redstone
 

271
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,610
put slabs in places where the redstone
goes uphill like that so it shouldn't

272
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:00,620
goes uphill like that so it shouldn't
 

273
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,120
goes uphill like that so it shouldn't
get cut off and I think it should be

274
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,130
get cut off and I think it should be
 

275
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,810
get cut off and I think it should be
good all right hopefully we'll find out

276
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:09,820
good all right hopefully we'll find out
 

277
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,340
good all right hopefully we'll find out
cool so here we go guys I think we're

278
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,350
cool so here we go guys I think we're
 

279
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,100
cool so here we go guys I think we're
ready now so the idea is you could hide

280
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,110
ready now so the idea is you could hide
 

281
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,040
ready now so the idea is you could hide
like a secret message or an arrow or

282
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,050
like a secret message or an arrow or
 

283
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,529

couldn't quite get that the timings

294
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:39,380
couldn't quite get that the timings
 

295
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,900
couldn't quite get that the timings
perfect at the end there just because

296
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:40,910
perfect at the end there just because
 

297
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,490
perfect at the end there just because
the way it worked out there was enough

298
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:42,500
the way it worked out there was enough
 

299
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,390
the way it worked out there was enough
space to do it

300
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,400
space to do it
 

301
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,930
space to do it
like where it was perfectly smooth but

302
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:45,940
like where it was perfectly smooth but
 

303
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,250
like where it was perfectly smooth but
that wasn't too bad that was pretty good

304
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,260
that wasn't too bad that was pretty good
 

305
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,570
that wasn't too bad that was pretty good
I thought let's try it one more time and

306
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:51,580
I thought let's try it one more time and
 

307
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,770
I thought let's try it one more time and
then the fire will disappear over time

308
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:53,780
then the fire will disappear over time
 

309
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,469
then the fire will disappear over time

look her might lose it eventually
 

315
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,920
look her might lose it eventually
because like outside creepers kind of

316
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:02,930

00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:18,569
with glass kind of like we did over here
 

413
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:22,100
with glass kind of like we did over here
just to create some more depth okay well

00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:58,850
kind of block so maybe we will try get
 

441
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,450
kind of block so maybe we will try get
rid of some of this a couple blocks here

442

447
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,100

that might be that might be good

448
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,110
that might be that might be good
 

449
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,130
that might be that might be good
actually and then it might be easier to

450
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,140
actually and then it might be easier to
 

451
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,730
actually and then it might be easier to
make this look good over here

452
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:20,740
make this look good over here
 

453
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,170

479
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,760
it's on the back side right so next
thing we're going to do we're going to

480
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:57,770
thing we're going to do we're going to
 

481
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,710
thing we're going to do we're going to
run maybe some purpose stairs along the

482
00:11:59,710 --> 00:11:59,720
run maybe some purpose stairs along the
 

483
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,710
run maybe some purpose stairs along the
top here on both sides we'll see if

484
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
top here on both sides we'll see if
 

485
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
top here on both sides we'll see if
anything comes with that

486
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,130
anything comes with that
 

487
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,580
anything comes with that
and I think we'll make it stick out like

488
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:06,590
and I think we'll make it stick out like
 

489
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,710
and I think we'll make it stick out like
this all along good stuff all right next

490
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:11,720
this all along good stuff all right next
 

491
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,680
this all along good stuff all right next
we're going to bring the perper down

492
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:13,690
we're going to bring the perper down
 

493
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,210
we're going to bring the perper down
next to the spawner there on the right

494
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,220
next to the spawner there on the right
 

495
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,480
next to the spawner there on the right
spring it down and then mere that on the

to the room that we can fill in the
space and get it finished looking you

508
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:34,279
space and get it finished looking you
 

509
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,910
space and get it finished looking you
know not really thinking too too much

510

about it we're going to do another skunk

512
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:40,730
about it we're going to do another skunk
 

513
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,579
about it we're going to do another skunk
line thing like we have over there we're

514
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:42,589
line thing like we have over there we're
 

515
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:43,989
line thing like we have over there we're
going to mirror that on the top of the

516
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:43,999
going to mirror that on the top of the
 

517
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:47,129
going to mirror that on the top of the
roof here so we'll put sandstone between

518
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:47,139
roof here so we'll put sandstone between
 

519
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,129
roof here so we'll put sandstone between
and that's hopefully look cool too

520
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:51,139
and that's hopefully look cool too
 

521
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,069
and that's hopefully look cool too
what is this what is this stone brick

522
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
what is this what is this stone brick
 

523
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,109
what is this what is this stone brick
over here is that red stone I hope

524

it's just a bunch of blocks for some
 

529
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,900
it's just a bunch of blocks for some
reason

530
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:03,910
reason
 

531
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,049
reason
what about above no there is on that

532
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:08,059
what about above no there is on that
 

533

line I think that's really good
 

539
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,410
line I think that's really good
because it creates like a continuation

540
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:20,420
because it creates like a continuation
 

541
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,809
because it creates like a continuation
effect it goes whoop and then whoop and

542
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:22,819
effect it goes whoop and then whoop and
 

543
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,009
effect it goes whoop and then whoop and
it's almost like they connect together

544
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:24,019
it's almost like they connect together
 

545
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,889
it's almost like they connect together
up over there from this angle but when

546
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:26,899
up over there from this angle but when
 

547
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,480
up over there from this angle but when
you're up over here you can see that

548
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:28,490
you're up over here you can see that
 

549
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,319
you're up over here you can see that
they don't actually I think that's good

550
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:32,329
they don't actually I think that's good
 

551
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,129
they don't actually I think that's good

here before it added in a door so we can
 

637
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,380
here before it added in a door so we can
still go back here if we want to and

638
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,390
still go back here if we want to and
 

639
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,380
still go back here if we want to and
look at like how the gizmo works where

640
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,390
look at like how the gizmo works where
 

641
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,660
look at like how the gizmo works where
for some reason they get stuck we might

642
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:53,670
for some reason they get stuck we might
 

643
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,770
for some reason they get stuck we might
be able to reach it from here too

644
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:56,780
be able to reach it from here too
 

645
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,300
be able to reach it from here too
didn't want to cut off that access like

646
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,310
didn't want to cut off that access like
 

647
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,820
didn't want to cut off that access like

you had before up over there I just
 

649
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,130
you had before up over there I just
filled in with glass you can see that

650
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,140
filled in with glass you can see that
 

651
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,200
filled in with glass you can see that
netherrack back there through the glass

652
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,210
netherrack back there through the glass
 

653
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,820
netherrack back there through the glass
but I think I'm okay with that because

654
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:07,830
but I think I'm okay with that because
 

655
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,010
but I think I'm okay with that because
but you can see it through this glass

656
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,020
but you can see it through this glass
 

657
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,190
but you can see it through this glass
over here too and I don't really want to

658
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:13,200
over here too and I don't really want to
 

659
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,110
over here too and I don't really want to
change all that out it makes it feel

660
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
change all that out it makes it feel
 

661
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,850
change all that out it makes it feel
like we're still in the nether if you

662
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:16,860
like we're still in the nether if you
 

663
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,000
like we're still in the nether if you
see a little bit of nether act right so

664
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,010
see a little bit of nether act right so
 

665
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,920
see a little bit of nether act right so
I think that's okay then up over there I

666
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:21,930
I think that's okay then up over there I
 

667
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,380
I think that's okay then up over there I
put in a pot light because it was kind

668
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,390
put in a pot light because it was kind
 

669
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,380
put in a pot light because it was kind
of dark and got some lighting behind the

670
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,390
of dark and got some lighting behind the
 

671
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,520
of dark and got some lighting behind the
door there too what else what else

672
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:30,530
door there too what else what else
 

673
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,870
door there too what else what else
connected the arch across like that and

674
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
connected the arch across like that and
 

675
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,730
connected the arch across like that and
I think the top part of this room is all

676
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:37,740
I think the top part of this room is all
 

677
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,130
I think the top part of this room is all
finished now oh yeah and there's like

678
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,140
finished now oh yeah and there's like
 

679
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,750
finished now oh yeah and there's like
some weird things here like where this

680
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:41,760
some weird things here like where this
 

681
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,570
some weird things here like where this
wasn't stairs this was solid blocks I

682
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:44,580
wasn't stairs this was solid blocks I
 

683
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,910
wasn't stairs this was solid blocks I
got that all fixed changed a little bit

684
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:46,920
got that all fixed changed a little bit
 

685
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,400
got that all fixed changed a little bit
with the door here and I'm just going to

686
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,410
with the door here and I'm just going to
 

687
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,720
with the door here and I'm just going to
block them off with glass until they

688
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:50,730
block them off with glass until they
 

689
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,280
block them off with glass until they
actually put something there

690
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,290
actually put something there
 

691
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,829
actually put something there
made like a little support stair thing

692
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:54,839
made like a little support stair thing
 

693
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,730
made like a little support stair thing
here for pathway and yeah we got the

694
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:58,740
here for pathway and yeah we got the
 

695
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,259
here for pathway and yeah we got the
bottom part of this to do which I think

696
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:00,269
bottom part of this to do which I think
 

697
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,579
bottom part of this to do which I think
we'll say for another day because that's

698
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:01,589
we'll say for another day because that's
 

699
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:02,690
we'll say for another day because that's
probably gonna take me a little bit of

700
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:02,700
probably gonna take me a little bit of
 

701
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,350
probably gonna take me a little bit of
time too

702
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
time too
 

703
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,020
time too
won't be as difficult as this top part

704
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,030
won't be as difficult as this top part
 

705
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,590
won't be as difficult as this top part
but still um and maybe we will try to

706
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
but still um and maybe we will try to
 

707
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,240
but still um and maybe we will try to
work on the tunnel here before we finish

708
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,250
work on the tunnel here before we finish
 

709
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,929
work on the tunnel here before we finish
op because this is what's really bud

710
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:16,939
op because this is what's really bud
 

711
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,689

buttering buttering me bothering me
 

713
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,549
buttering buttering me bothering me
because this tunnel because I got to

714
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
because this tunnel because I got to
 

715
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,500
because this tunnel because I got to
walk it right we should really change

716
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:24,510
walk it right we should really change
 

717
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,010
walk it right we should really change
this out with some some ice so that I

718
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,020
this out with some some ice so that I
 

719
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:41,510

come down to pick up his ice because
 

741
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,260

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:41,549
like there's something back there hard
 

759
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,810
like there's something back there hard
to decide option three we do this but we

760
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:44,820
to decide option three we do this but we
 

761
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,220
to decide option three we do this but we
also fill it with glass what does that

762
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,230
also fill it with glass what does that
 

763
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,710
also fill it with glass what does that
look like

764
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720

 

765
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,580

I think that's better all right very

766
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:56,590
I think that's better all right very
 

767
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,169
I think that's better all right very
cool guys so check it out our tunnels

768
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:58,179
cool guys so check it out our tunnels
 

769
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,750
cool guys so check it out our tunnels
pretty much all done here I would say

770
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
pretty much all done here I would say
 

771
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,340
pretty much all done here I would say
ended up going with option three I think

772
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,350
ended up going with option three I think
 

773
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,560
ended up going with option three I think
it looks the best out of them or it's

774
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:04,570
it looks the best out of them or it's
 

775
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,529
it looks the best out of them or it's
the most interesting anyway so if in

776
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:07,539
the most interesting anyway so if in
 

777
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,760
the most interesting anyway so if in
doubt always go with the most

778

do one final thing here is we got to
 

783
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,750
do one final thing here is we got to
make a connection to the tunnel up here

784
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
make a connection to the tunnel up here
 

785
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,460
make a connection to the tunnel up here
the way I get up here normally is to

786
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:17,470
the way I get up here normally is to
 

787
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,460
the way I get up here normally is to
enderpearl or I use my fireworks it'd be

788
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,470

cool if we could actually ride the boat

790
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,030
cool if we could actually ride the boat
 

791
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,360
cool if we could actually ride the boat
up here and connect to this tunnel and

792
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,370
up here and connect to this tunnel and
 

793
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,570
up here and connect to this tunnel and
then like drop down to so I'm going to

794
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:27,580
then like drop down to so I'm going to
 

795
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,799
then like drop down to so I'm going to
try set up a slime launcher and I'm not

796
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:31,809
try set up a slime launcher and I'm not
 

797
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,870
try set up a slime launcher and I'm not
sure I just will try and keep it in line

798
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:33,880
sure I just will try and keep it in line
 

799
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,330
sure I just will try and keep it in line
here and see if this is the right spot

800
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:35,340
here and see if this is the right spot
 

801
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,289
here and see if this is the right spot
it's going to be a trial and error thing

802
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:37,299
it's going to be a trial and error thing
 

803
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,180
it's going to be a trial and error thing
I don't know the exact distance they

804
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,190
I don't know the exact distance they
 

805
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,980
I don't know the exact distance they
launch you so we want slime launcher

806
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:43,990
launch you so we want slime launcher
 

807
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,590
launch you so we want slime launcher
right here this is going to have to be

808
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:46,600
right here this is going to have to be
 

809
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,240
right here this is going to have to be
like noteblocks or something that

810
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,250
like noteblocks or something that
 

811
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,779
like noteblocks or something that
doesn't move with the slime and I got

812
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:51,789
doesn't move with the slime and I got
 

813
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:57,029
doesn't move with the slime and I got
one do we got more doodoo oh no I don't

814
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
one do we got more doodoo oh no I don't
 

815
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,330
one do we got more doodoo oh no I don't
think we have more no okay I'll make

816
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:00,340
think we have more no okay I'll make
 

817
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,430
think we have more no okay I'll make
another one unless I'm blind I didn't

818
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:02,440
another one unless I'm blind I didn't
 

819
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,799
another one unless I'm blind I didn't
see it do we still have redstone yeah

820
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:04,809
see it do we still have redstone yeah
 

821
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,590
see it do we still have redstone yeah
we're running low on redstone again

822
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:06,600
we're running low on redstone again
 

823
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,330
we're running low on redstone again
sometime we really need to finish up

824
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,340
sometime we really need to finish up
 

825
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,909
sometime we really need to finish up
that witch farm I kind of left it in

826
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
that witch farm I kind of left it in
 

827
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,640
that witch farm I kind of left it in
heaven haven't fixed it right and I'm

828
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:14,650
heaven haven't fixed it right and I'm
 

829
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,169
heaven haven't fixed it right and I'm
running low on redstone again so it

830
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:16,179
running low on redstone again so it
 

831
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,640
running low on redstone again so it
might be a good time to get that done

832
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:19,650
might be a good time to get that done
 

833
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,289
might be a good time to get that done
okay so we do that then we're going to

834
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:22,299
okay so we do that then we're going to
 

835
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,549
okay so we do that then we're going to
have a pressure plate over here I think

836
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
have a pressure plate over here I think
 

837
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,320
have a pressure plate over here I think
you want it on the backside so if we're

838
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,330
you want it on the backside so if we're
 

839
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,510
you want it on the backside so if we're
approaching from this side towards it

840
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:30,520
approaching from this side towards it
 

841
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,890
approaching from this side towards it
then I think the pressure plate goes

842
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:31,900
then I think the pressure plate goes
 

843
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,640
then I think the pressure plate goes
here if I remember right and then we

844
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:35,650
here if I remember right and then we
 

845
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,520
here if I remember right and then we
just need to run that down to the piston

846
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:40,530
just need to run that down to the piston
 

847
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,860
just need to run that down to the piston
don't have a block something okay let's

848
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:43,870
don't have a block something okay let's
 

849
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,950
don't have a block something okay let's
just use the ice I guess and that should

850
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
just use the ice I guess and that should
 

851
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,500
just use the ice I guess and that should
be good hopefully so we're going to take

852
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:49,510
be good hopefully so we're going to take
 

853
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,770
be good hopefully so we're going to take
a running charge at this launcher and

854
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:52,780
a running charge at this launcher and
 

855
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,200
a running charge at this launcher and
see if it'll take us up to the tunnel so

856
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,210
see if it'll take us up to the tunnel so
 

857
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,200
see if it'll take us up to the tunnel so
height and distance is the big concern

858
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,210
height and distance is the big concern
 

859
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,130
height and distance is the big concern
here is it going to make it oh I hit my

860
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,140
here is it going to make it oh I hit my
 

861
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,340
here is it going to make it oh I hit my
head

862
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,350
head
 

863
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,669
head
well okay we had some pretty good speed

864
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:06,679
well okay we had some pretty good speed
 

865
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,049
well okay we had some pretty good speed
going there though so maybe it'll work

866
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:08,059
going there though so maybe it'll work
 

867
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,450
going there though so maybe it'll work
we got a maybe take out some of the

868
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,460
we got a maybe take out some of the
 

869
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,710
we got a maybe take out some of the
stuff let's take this away a couple

870
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
stuff let's take this away a couple
 

871
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,049
stuff let's take this away a couple
blocks okay here we go again

872
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:17,059
blocks okay here we go again
 

873
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:28,029
blocks okay here we go again
whoo what okay so we're going a little

874
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:28,039
whoo what okay so we're going a little
 

875
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,419
whoo what okay so we're going a little
bit higher than we want to um looks like

876
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:31,429
bit higher than we want to um looks like
 

877
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:33,760
bit higher than we want to um looks like
we also can't go too quickly because if

878
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:33,770
we also can't go too quickly because if
 

879
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,649
we also can't go too quickly because if
we go too quickly it seems like we shoot

880
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:35,659
we go too quickly it seems like we shoot
 

881
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,470
we go too quickly it seems like we shoot
over the launcher let's try this one

882
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
over the launcher let's try this one
 

883
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,799
over the launcher let's try this one
more time mmm Oh hit my head again

884
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:43,809
more time mmm Oh hit my head again
 

885

we'll save that launcher thing for

892
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:51,830
we'll save that launcher thing for
 

893
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,100
we'll save that launcher thing for
another time and I was watching through

894
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,110
another time and I was watching through
 

895

I picked out for today guys this is a
question that kind of comes up or a

918
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:24,440
question that kind of comes up or a
 

919
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,200
question that kind of comes up or a
suggestion that comes up quite often so

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,210
suggestion that comes up quite often so
 

921
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,299

doing any more large projects have you
 

935
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,210
doing any more large projects have you
thought about streaming them you could

936
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,220
thought about streaming them you could
 

937
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,039
thought about streaming them you could
stream the building of the project for

938
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,049
stream the building of the project for
 

939
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:46,840
stream the building of the project for
the two or three days it takes to make

940
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:46,850
the two or three days it takes to make
 

941
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,299
the two or three days it takes to make
it and afterwards upload the regular

942
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:49,309
it and afterwards upload the regular
 

943
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,080
it and afterwards upload the regular
video of the entire process okay so

944
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,090
video of the entire process okay so
 

945
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,370
video of the entire process okay so
here's the thing about that because it

946
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:54,380
here's the thing about that because it
 

947
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,720
here's the thing about that because it
is something I've thought about doing

948
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:55,730
is something I've thought about doing
 

949
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,919
is something I've thought about doing
