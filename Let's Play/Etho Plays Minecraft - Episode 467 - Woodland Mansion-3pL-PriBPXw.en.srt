got it woodland Explorer map let's check

510
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:40,269
got it woodland Explorer map let's check
 

511
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,819
got it woodland Explorer map let's check
it out oh it's at the bottom so that's

512
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:44,829
it out oh it's at the bottom so that's
 

513
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,670
it out oh it's at the bottom so that's
gonna be south I'm pretty sure right if

514
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
gonna be south I'm pretty sure right if
 

515
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,179
gonna be south I'm pretty sure right if
we're facing the north the top is north

516
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:51,189
we're facing the north the top is north
 

517
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:53,370
we're facing the north the top is north
I think and then it would be this

518
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:53,380
I think and then it would be this
 

519
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,819
I think and then it would be this
direction okay

520
00:13:58,819 --> 00:13:58,829

598
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,370
there I'm like 9,000 blocks out now so
 

599
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,340
there I'm like 9,000 blocks out now so
it seems like you have to travel the

600
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,350
it seems like you have to travel the
 

601
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,559
it seems like you have to travel the
furthest this direction ah yes we have

602
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:07,569
furthest this direction ah yes we have
 

603
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:09,540
furthest this direction ah yes we have
done it we have arrived to our

604
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,550
done it we have arrived to our
 

605
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,069
done it we have arrived to our
destination so you can see that my

606
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:11,079
destination so you can see that my
 

607
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,629
destination so you can see that my
player on the map here he's got the big

608
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
player on the map here he's got the big
 

609
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,129
player on the map here he's got the big
dot now it's the little little dot that

610
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:14,139
dot now it's the little little dot that
 

611
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,799
dot now it's the little little dot that
means we're close I see dark oak trees

612
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:16,809
means we're close I see dark oak trees
 

613
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,870
means we're close I see dark oak trees
and we are ninety seven by 65 ninety

614
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:21,880
and we are ninety seven by 65 ninety
 

615
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,920
and we are ninety seven by 65 ninety
seven hundred by

616
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:22,930
seven hundred by
 

617
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,340
seven hundred by
6500 blocks away so I think this is the

618
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,350
6500 blocks away so I think this is the
 

619
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,750
6500 blocks away so I think this is the
closest one right they did be the

620
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:27,760
closest one right they did be the
 

621
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,389
closest one right they did be the
closest one I'm pretty sure so these are

622
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
closest one I'm pretty sure so these are
 

623
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,880
closest one I'm pretty sure so these are
spread out quite a bit in the world it

624
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:32,890
spread out quite a bit in the world it
 

625
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,180
spread out quite a bit in the world it
seems and take your guesses is it gonna

626
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,190
seems and take your guesses is it gonna
 

627
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,579
seems and take your guesses is it gonna
be underground or is it gonna be

628
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:37,589
be underground or is it gonna be
 

629
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,050
be underground or is it gonna be
above-ground I'm gonna say underground

630
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,060
above-ground I'm gonna say underground
 

631
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,690
above-ground I'm gonna say underground
I think the amplified might mess with it

632
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:42,700
I think the amplified might mess with it
 

633
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,960
I think the amplified might mess with it
a little bit we'll see or it might just

634
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:45,970
