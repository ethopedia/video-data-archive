with it

180
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
with it
 

181
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,710

i'm still trying to work out all my
 

191
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,270
i'm still trying to work out all my
volume levels since this update

192
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
volume levels since this update
 

193
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,270
volume levels since this update
uh because that all changed

194
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280

 

195
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,070

gold farm a lot

202
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
gold farm a lot
 

203
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,830
gold farm a lot
uh since last episode just off camera

204
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
uh since last episode just off camera
 

205
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,510
uh since last episode just off camera
kind of repetitive

206
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
kind of repetitive
 

207
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,469
kind of repetitive
boring stuff here but there's a big part

208
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
boring stuff here but there's a big part
 

209
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,189
boring stuff here but there's a big part
of it done

210
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
of it done
 

211
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,030
of it done
now which i'm about to show you

212
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040

 

213
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,710

let's go up and also since we spawned a

214
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
let's go up and also since we spawned a
 

215
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,830
let's go up and also since we spawned a
bunch of zombie pigmen

216
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
bunch of zombie pigmen
 

217
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,510
bunch of zombie pigmen
we're going to be able to see why it's

218
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
we're going to be able to see why it's
 

219
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,230
we're going to be able to see why it's
not yielding so much gold

220
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
not yielding so much gold
 

221
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,830
not yielding so much gold
at the moment there is quite a bit of

222
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
at the moment there is quite a bit of
 

223
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,430
at the moment there is quite a bit of
gold around like

224
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
gold around like
 

225
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,629
gold around like
uh pigment are falling and and uh

226
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
uh pigment are falling and and uh
 

227
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,270
uh pigment are falling and and uh
dying on the ground here you can see i

228
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
dying on the ground here you can see i
 

229
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,870
dying on the ground here you can see i
lowered all the nether racks so that the

230
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
lowered all the nether racks so that the
 

231
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,670
lowered all the nether racks so that the
and far fall enough

232
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
and far fall enough
 

233
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,550
and far fall enough
did i say far fall enough fall far

234
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
did i say far fall enough fall far
 

235
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,909
did i say far fall enough fall far
enough

236
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
enough
 

237
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,430
enough
um to die so we got a few drops in the

238
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
um to die so we got a few drops in the
 

239
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,909
um to die so we got a few drops in the
little amount of time we were up there

240
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
little amount of time we were up there
 

241
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,469
little amount of time we were up there
but if we go up this is the thing i've

242
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
but if we go up this is the thing i've
 

243
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,670
but if we go up this is the thing i've
been working on by the way this

244
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
been working on by the way this
 

245
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,350
been working on by the way this
giant square you're seeing

246
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
giant square you're seeing
 

247
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,550
giant square you're seeing
uh but first before these guys

248
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
uh but first before these guys
 

249
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,830
uh but first before these guys
actually there's not as many here as i

250
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
actually there's not as many here as i
 

251
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,189
actually there's not as many here as i
thought there would be

252
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199

 

253
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,029

but basically the problem with the gold

254
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
but basically the problem with the gold
 

255
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,629
but basically the problem with the gold
farm at the moment is i got all these

256
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
farm at the moment is i got all these
 

257
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,469
farm at the moment is i got all these
spawning spaces close to it where

258
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
spawning spaces close to it where
 

259
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,790
spawning spaces close to it where
they're still

260
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
they're still
 

261
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,390
they're still
gathering instead of spawning in

262
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
gathering instead of spawning in
 

263
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,070
gathering instead of spawning in
my trap here they're spawning on the

264
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
my trap here they're spawning on the
 

265
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,430
my trap here they're spawning on the
outside

266
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
outside
 

267
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,710
outside
and i have to make it so that absolutely

268
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
and i have to make it so that absolutely
 

269
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,710
and i have to make it so that absolutely
none of them spawn on the outside here

270
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
none of them spawn on the outside here
 

271
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,189
none of them spawn on the outside here
for it to work the way i want because

272
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199

 

273
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,909

ouch because currently if one of them

274
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
ouch because currently if one of them
 

275
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,749
ouch because currently if one of them
spawns on the outside then i gotta wait

276
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
spawns on the outside then i gotta wait
 

277
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,430
spawns on the outside then i gotta wait
like

278
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
like
 

279
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,430
like
over 30 seconds usually for them to

280
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
over 30 seconds usually for them to
 

281
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,629
over 30 seconds usually for them to
despawn

282
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
despawn
 

283
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,230
despawn
and you can see there's a lot of guys in

284
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
and you can see there's a lot of guys in
 

285
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,150
and you can see there's a lot of guys in
here which tells me i still have some

286
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
here which tells me i still have some
 

287
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,150
here which tells me i still have some
spawning spaces

288
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
spawning spaces
 

289
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,189
spawning spaces
i have to deal with

290
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199

 

291
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,790

but this is the thing i've been building

292
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
but this is the thing i've been building
 

293
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,790
but this is the thing i've been building
this cage all around it

294
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
this cage all around it
 

295
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,790
this cage all around it
to protect it from gas we want to

296
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
to protect it from gas we want to
 

297
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,469
to protect it from gas we want to
protect our pistons and our

298
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
protect our pistons and our
 

299
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,790
protect our pistons and our
string and our our redstone you can see

300
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
string and our our redstone you can see
 

301
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,150
string and our our redstone you can see
there's a piston missing there

302
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
there's a piston missing there
 

303
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,110
there's a piston missing there
because the gas shot it um i should have

304
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
because the gas shot it um i should have
 

305
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,510
because the gas shot it um i should have
built this a long time ago though

306
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
built this a long time ago though
 

307
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,870
built this a long time ago though
hey guy

308
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
hey guy
 

309
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,749
hey guy
and i didn't want just like a a plain

310
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
and i didn't want just like a a plain
 

311
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,790
and i didn't want just like a a plain
plain old like

312
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
plain old like
 

313
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,749
plain old like
solid stone brick wall or solid iron

314
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
solid stone brick wall or solid iron
 

315
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,510
solid stone brick wall or solid iron
bars or something i wanted

316
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
bars or something i wanted
 

317
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,990
bars or something i wanted
uh to put a pattern into it if i could

318
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
uh to put a pattern into it if i could
 

319
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,390
uh to put a pattern into it if i could
so this is what i came up with it's like

320
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
so this is what i came up with it's like
 

321
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,150
so this is what i came up with it's like
this is the center over here and then it

322
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
this is the center over here and then it
 

323
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,469
this is the center over here and then it
does this zigzag

324
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
does this zigzag
 

325
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,150
does this zigzag
sort of thing i think it's pretty cool i

326
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
sort of thing i think it's pretty cool i
 

327
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,749
sort of thing i think it's pretty cool i
like it

328
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
like it
 

329
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,230
like it
very big though it i i had to dismantle

330
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
very big though it i i had to dismantle
 

331
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,670
very big though it i i had to dismantle
that beacon up on top of the ceiling

332
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
that beacon up on top of the ceiling
 

333
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,629
that beacon up on top of the ceiling
there to

334
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
there to
 

335
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,110
there to
get enough iron to finish this and i

336
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
get enough iron to finish this and i
 

337
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,950
get enough iron to finish this and i
think i still missed a few spots

338
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
think i still missed a few spots
 

339
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,110
think i still missed a few spots
somewhere too

340
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
somewhere too
 

341
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,629
somewhere too
um but yeah then all the zombie pigmen

342
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
um but yeah then all the zombie pigmen
 

343
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,710
um but yeah then all the zombie pigmen
they fall down these little holes here

344
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
they fall down these little holes here
 

345
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,710
they fall down these little holes here
and we gotta set up some collection

346
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
and we gotta set up some collection
 

347
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,710
and we gotta set up some collection
system below to pick up the gold

348
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
system below to pick up the gold
 

349
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,309
system below to pick up the gold
uh they drop and that is about where

350
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
uh they drop and that is about where
 

351
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,909
uh they drop and that is about where
we're at with the gold farm

352
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
we're at with the gold farm
 

353
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,029
we're at with the gold farm
currently so it's coming along

354
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
currently so it's coming along
 

355
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,230
currently so it's coming along
we will get it done um

356
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
we will get it done um
 

357
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,589
we will get it done um

i kind of want to mess around with
 

361
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,390
i kind of want to mess around with
beds in the nether just to see if i can

362
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
beds in the nether just to see if i can
 

363
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,150
beds in the nether just to see if i can
somehow clear land quicker

364
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
somehow clear land quicker
 

365
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,830
somehow clear land quicker
with that than i can with my pick

366
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840

 

367
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,990

because

368
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
because
 

369
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,350
because
do i dare risk throwing ender pearl oh i

370
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
do i dare risk throwing ender pearl oh i
 

371
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,309
do i dare risk throwing ender pearl oh i
almost hit one

372
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
almost hit one
 

373
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,830
almost hit one
i almost did because currently like it

374
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
i almost did because currently like it
 

375
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,869
i almost did because currently like it
goes quick

376
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
goes quick
 

377
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,629
goes quick
but it uses up my tools very quickly um

378
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
but it uses up my tools very quickly um
 

379
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,070
but it uses up my tools very quickly um
i could use tnt but it's kind of

380
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
i could use tnt but it's kind of
 

381
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,830
i could use tnt but it's kind of
wasteful i kind of want to try just use

382
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
wasteful i kind of want to try just use
 

383
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,070
wasteful i kind of want to try just use
beds

384
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080

 

385
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,830

yeah let's try let's have some fun here

386
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
yeah let's try let's have some fun here
 

387
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,270
yeah let's try let's have some fun here
i don't know if this is going to work

388
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
i don't know if this is going to work
 

389
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,390
i don't know if this is going to work
too well i think i've tried

390
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
too well i think i've tried
 

391
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,550
too well i think i've tried
in the past uh clearing another rack

392
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
in the past uh clearing another rack
 

393
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,309
in the past uh clearing another rack
with beds but

394
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
with beds but
 

395
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,430
with beds but
it was like too slow

396
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
it was like too slow
 

397
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,830
it was like too slow
or something i don't know i am going to

398
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
or something i don't know i am going to
 

399
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,270
or something i don't know i am going to
stash some stuff here

400
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
stash some stuff here
 

401
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,029
stash some stuff here
i went for some wool and i got a regen

402
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
i went for some wool and i got a regen
 

403
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,110
i went for some wool and i got a regen
potion here i think if i could stay

404
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
potion here i think if i could stay
 

405
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,790
potion here i think if i could stay
healed

406
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
healed
 

407
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,710
healed
and if i made enough beds and kept them

408
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
and if i made enough beds and kept them
 

409
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,909
and if i made enough beds and kept them
in my inventory

410
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
in my inventory
 

411
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,110
in my inventory
it should work pretty quickly

412
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
it should work pretty quickly
 

413
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,589
it should work pretty quickly
i would think i'm i'm worried i'm gonna

414
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
i would think i'm i'm worried i'm gonna
 

415
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,949
i would think i'm i'm worried i'm gonna
blow up here i'm not sure if i can even

416
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
blow up here i'm not sure if i can even
 

417
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,870
blow up here i'm not sure if i can even
even take the hit

418
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
even take the hit
 

419
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,350
even take the hit
um yeah we'll make a bunch of beds

420
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
um yeah we'll make a bunch of beds
 

421
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,509
um yeah we'll make a bunch of beds
i think you can recover them

422
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519

 

423
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,509

and i definitely want to keep my armor

424
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
and i definitely want to keep my armor
 

425
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,070
and i definitely want to keep my armor
on because otherwise i'll for sure die

426
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
on because otherwise i'll for sure die
 

427
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,470
on because otherwise i'll for sure die
and i went and i got a blast protection

428
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
and i went and i got a blast protection
 

429
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,350
and i went and i got a blast protection
for helmet

430
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
for helmet
 

431
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,269
for helmet
and i have blast protection pants um

432
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
and i have blast protection pants um
 

433
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,790
and i have blast protection pants um
level four on both of them so i should

434
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
level four on both of them so i should
 

435
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,550
level four on both of them so i should
be pretty much maxed out on blast

436
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
be pretty much maxed out on blast
 

437
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,470
be pretty much maxed out on blast
protection with that

438
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
protection with that
 

439
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,269
protection with that
so this is like my best chance of

440
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
so this is like my best chance of
 

441
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,070
so this is like my best chance of
surviving a

442
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
surviving a
 

443
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,630
surviving a
bed unless i set up my beacon with

444
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
bed unless i set up my beacon with
 

445
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,790
bed unless i set up my beacon with
resistance on too that would be ideal

446
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800

 

447
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,430

oh please live don't lose all my stuff

448
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440

 

449
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,230

okay those guys didn't get mad i think

450
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
okay those guys didn't get mad i think
 

451
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,070
okay those guys didn't get mad i think
the bed was gone though

452
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
the bed was gone though
 

453
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,870
the bed was gone though
um the worst thing about is it makes a

454
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
um the worst thing about is it makes a
 

455
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,310
um the worst thing about is it makes a
little fire

456
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320

 

457
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,710

yeah fire resistance is a must if we use

458
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
yeah fire resistance is a must if we use
 

459
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,389
yeah fire resistance is a must if we use
regen as we do it though

460
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399

 

461
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,310

and i got a string farm so getting wool

462
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
and i got a string farm so getting wool
 

463
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,150
and i got a string farm so getting wool
for beds

464
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
for beds
 

465
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,710
for beds
isn't a terrible idea i definitely need

466
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
isn't a terrible idea i definitely need
 

467
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,990
isn't a terrible idea i definitely need
a fire resist though

468
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
a fire resist though
 

469
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,990
a fire resist though
holy smokes

470
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
holy smokes
 

471
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,829
holy smokes
does seem to clear a lot of space and i

472
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
does seem to clear a lot of space and i
 

473
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,230
does seem to clear a lot of space and i
can do it quick

474
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240

 

475
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,070

yeah yeah this might actually be a good

476
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
yeah yeah this might actually be a good
 

477
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,389
yeah yeah this might actually be a good
good way of doing it okay we're gonna

478
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
good way of doing it okay we're gonna
 

479
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,829
good way of doing it okay we're gonna
try it again this time i'm really

480
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
try it again this time i'm really
 

481
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,590
try it again this time i'm really
pushing for efficiency i want to see if

482
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
pushing for efficiency i want to see if
 

483
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,870
pushing for efficiency i want to see if
i can clear

484
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
i can clear
 

485
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,030
i can clear
a big portion of this chunk in a little

486
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
a big portion of this chunk in a little
 

487
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,590
a big portion of this chunk in a little
amount of time so

488
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
amount of time so
 

489
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,710
amount of time so
all that guy's going to make this

490
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
all that guy's going to make this
 

491
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,670
all that guy's going to make this
annoying i don't have any arrows i left

492
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
annoying i don't have any arrows i left
 

493
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,590
annoying i don't have any arrows i left
them in the chest

494
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
them in the chest
 

495
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,829
them in the chest
uh so we're doing fire resistance this

496
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
uh so we're doing fire resistance this
 

497
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,030
uh so we're doing fire resistance this
time and

498
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
time and
 

499
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,230
time and
even regen i got tons of beds made

500
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
even regen i got tons of beds made
 

501
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,829
even regen i got tons of beds made
ready to go so we should just be able to

502
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
ready to go so we should just be able to
 

503
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,670
ready to go so we should just be able to
hammer this out real quick

504
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
hammer this out real quick
 

505
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,670
hammer this out real quick
oh sometimes the bed does drop i saw it

506
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
oh sometimes the bed does drop i saw it
 

507
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,350
oh sometimes the bed does drop i saw it
dropped that time

508
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360

 

509
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,710

695
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,470

uh hopefully we get it here though

696

come on come on come on no

698
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
come on come on come on no
 

699
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,110

darn it try again

700
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120

 

701
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,870

um these boots are actually

702
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
um these boots are actually
 

703
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,150
um these boots are actually
really old and they cost like 34 levels

704
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
really old and they cost like 34 levels
 

705
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,590
really old and they cost like 34 levels
to repair now so i should probably

706
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
to repair now so i should probably
 

707
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,949
to repair now so i should probably
name them

708
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959

 

709
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,790

i'm not giving up till i get this i

710
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
i'm not giving up till i get this i
 

711
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,389
i'm not giving up till i get this i
think it's sea of enchantment or

712
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
think it's sea of enchantment or
 

713
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,829
think it's sea of enchantment or
something

714
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
something
 

715
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,269
something
unbreaking three there three that's a

716
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
unbreaking three there three that's a
 

717
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,430
unbreaking three there three that's a
good rod

718
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
good rod
 

719
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,870
good rod
but it's not quite what i was looking

720
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
but it's not quite what i was looking
 

721
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,829
but it's not quite what i was looking
for

722
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839

 

723
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,269

come on come on come on

724
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279

 

725
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,269

all right

726
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
all right
 

727
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,310
all right
all right we're almost out of experience

728
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320

 

729
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,509

okay and last chance

730
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519

 

731
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,189

luck of the sea that's what it's called

732
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
luck of the sea that's what it's called
 

733
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,629
luck of the sea that's what it's called
and we got lure three

734
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
and we got lure three
 

735
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,069
and we got lure three
so you can get them both on one rod

736
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
so you can get them both on one rod
 

737
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,389
so you can get them both on one rod
i wonder how much it would cost to rip

738
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
i wonder how much it would cost to rip
 

739
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,350
i wonder how much it would cost to rip
to put them together

740
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
to put them together
 

741
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,310
to put them together
too expensive too expensive ah

742
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
too expensive too expensive ah
 

743
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,790
too expensive too expensive ah
darn it what if we just do do i have any

744
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
darn it what if we just do do i have any
 

745
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,629
darn it what if we just do do i have any
unbreaking books here

746
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639

 

747
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,230

i kind of would like to have a rod with

748
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
i kind of would like to have a rod with
 

749
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,710
i kind of would like to have a rod with
all three on if it's possible

750
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720

 

751
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,910

nope i do have one back at my main base

752
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
nope i do have one back at my main base
 

753
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,230
nope i do have one back at my main base
so

754
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
so
 

755
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,470
so
the man cave let's see how many blaze

756
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
the man cave let's see how many blaze
 

757
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,230
the man cave let's see how many blaze
rods we got from this

758
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240

 

759
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,749

well i'm gonna be um

well i'm gonna be um
 

761
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,230
well i'm gonna be um
smelting lots of stuff it looks like

762
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240

 

763
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,509

that's a lot of blazer rods one two

764
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
that's a lot of blazer rods one two
 

765
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,749
that's a lot of blazer rods one two
three four five six seven eight

766
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
three four five six seven eight

771
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,870

okay so we're going to do one more big

772
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
okay so we're going to do one more big
 

773
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,230
okay so we're going to do one more big
batch of blazes here

774
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
batch of blazes here
 

775
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,230
batch of blazes here
we got like 340 in there at the moment

776
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
we got like 340 in there at the moment
 

777
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,429
we got like 340 in there at the moment
we're gonna do an experiment too people

778
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
we're gonna do an experiment too people
 

779
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,510
we're gonna do an experiment too people
always tell me to name

780

always tell me to name
 

781
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,429
always tell me to name
my tools and stuff so that when i repair

782
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
my tools and stuff so that when i repair
 

783
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,429
my tools and stuff so that when i repair
them it's cheaper which is something i

784
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
them it's cheaper which is something i
 

785
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,069
them it's cheaper which is something i
almost

786
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
almost
 

787
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,990
almost
never do i'm kind of curious

788
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
never do i'm kind of curious
 

789
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,830
never do i'm kind of curious
i've never really experimented with it

790
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
i've never really experimented with it
 

791
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,270
i've never really experimented with it
either though

792
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
either though
 

793
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,430
either though
so i could be wasting tons of levels who

794
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
so i could be wasting tons of levels who
 

795
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,630
so i could be wasting tons of levels who
knows

796
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
knows
 

797
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,669
knows
uh i kind of don't think i am though

798
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
uh i kind of don't think i am though
 

799
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,630
uh i kind of don't think i am though
we'll see here um so these boots i think

800
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
we'll see here um so these boots i think
 

801
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,430
we'll see here um so these boots i think
i've repaired them close to 10 times now

802
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
i've repaired them close to 10 times now
 

803
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,310
i've repaired them close to 10 times now
i believe they only costed about 18

804
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
i believe they only costed about 18
 

805
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,230
i believe they only costed about 18
levels the first time i repaired them

806
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
levels the first time i repaired them
 

807
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,150
levels the first time i repaired them
don't quote me on that though let's just

808
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
don't quote me on that though let's just
 

809
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,830
don't quote me on that though let's just
say early or low

810
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
say early or low
 

811
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,870
say early or low
low 20s now to repair them

812
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
low 20s now to repair them
 

813
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,950
low 20s now to repair them
costs 34.

814
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
costs 34.
 

815
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,990
costs 34.
so even if we do it this way yeah it

816
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
so even if we do it this way yeah it
 

817
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,669
so even if we do it this way yeah it
costs more if we do it that way so that

818
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
costs more if we do it that way so that
 

819
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,510
costs more if we do it that way so that
this is the way to do it this is uh this

820
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
this is the way to do it this is uh this
 

821
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,310
this is the way to do it this is uh this
is like

822
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
is like
 

823
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,630
is like
always the way to do it if you're

824
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
always the way to do it if you're
 

825
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,510
always the way to do it if you're
repairing a

826
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
repairing a
 

827
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,789
repairing a
diamond pick just make an unenchanted

828
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
diamond pick just make an unenchanted
 

829
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,390
diamond pick just make an unenchanted
diamond pitch and use that to repair it

830
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
diamond pitch and use that to repair it
 

831
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,150
diamond pitch and use that to repair it
instead of using the diamonds

832
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
instead of using the diamonds
 

833
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,789
instead of using the diamonds
directly i find usually works best

834
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
directly i find usually works best
 

835
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,430
directly i find usually works best
but yeah it costs like 34 levels now to

836
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
but yeah it costs like 34 levels now to
 

837
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,710
but yeah it costs like 34 levels now to
do it so we're going to try name it

838
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
do it so we're going to try name it
 

839
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,230
do it so we're going to try name it
how much is that going to cost 37 okay

840
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
how much is that going to cost 37 okay
 

841
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,669
how much is that going to cost 37 okay
let's get 37 levels off these fools

842
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
let's get 37 levels off these fools
 

843
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,510
let's get 37 levels off these fools
uh activate the crusher

844
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520

 

845
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,950

there's a lot in there

846
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960

would try to set up like a minecart
system instead of the

874
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
system instead of the
 

875
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,750
system instead of the
conveyor belt down there because you can

876
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
conveyor belt down there because you can
 

877
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,270
conveyor belt down there because you can

and move blazes that way instead

884
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640

 

885
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,909

would i say 37

886
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919

 

887
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,950

i should do it

888
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960

a lot of xp just to name it

890
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
a lot of xp just to name it
 

891
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,029
a lot of xp just to name it
just to name it that doesn't even repair

892
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
just to name it that doesn't even repair
 

893
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,350
just to name it that doesn't even repair
it what i'm wondering is how much it's

894
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
it what i'm wondering is how much it's
 

895
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,029
it what i'm wondering is how much it's
gonna cost to repair it after we've

896
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
gonna cost to repair it after we've
 

897
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,070
gonna cost to repair it after we've
named it

898
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
named it
 

899
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,549
named it
uh we'll call these the vintage beefs

900
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559

 

901
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,789

i don't know how to spell vintage beef

902
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799

 

903
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,710

i think that's it right vintage beefs

904
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720

 

905
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,230

now let's go beefers

906
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240

 

907
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,470

okay so now to repair it

908
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
okay so now to repair it
 

909
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,029
okay so now to repair it
it's down to 27 so it's seven levels

910
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
it's down to 27 so it's seven levels
 

911
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,950
it's down to 27 so it's seven levels
cheaper but every time i repair it from

912
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
cheaper but every time i repair it from
 

913
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,710
cheaper but every time i repair it from
here it's gonna increase

914
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
here it's gonna increase
 

915
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,070
here it's gonna increase
so i think if you're gonna repair stuff

916
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
so i think if you're gonna repair stuff
 

917
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,870
so i think if you're gonna repair stuff
don't

918
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
don't
 

919
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,669
don't
name it right away only rename it if

920
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
name it right away only rename it if
 

921
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,110
name it right away only rename it if
you've repaired it like

922
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
you've repaired it like
 

923
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,149
you've repaired it like
five times or more i'm guessing is the

924
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
five times or more i'm guessing is the
 

925
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,590
five times or more i'm guessing is the
trick

926
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
trick
 

927
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,029
trick
then it starts to become cheaper again

928
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
then it starts to become cheaper again
 

929
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,029
then it starts to become cheaper again
