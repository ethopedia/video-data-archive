21
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,870
was i gonna go shulker box hunting or
was i prepared to stick it out and wait

22
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
was i prepared to stick it out and wait
 

23
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,750
was i prepared to stick it out and wait
for the update to come out and then i

24
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
for the update to come out and then i
 

25
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,950
for the update to come out and then i
could get them easily and just farm them

26
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
could get them easily and just farm them
 

27
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,229
could get them easily and just farm them
ultimately i chose the lazy option and

ultimately i chose the lazy option and
 

29
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,590

00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
uh okay let's go through one of these
 

57
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,189
uh okay let's go through one of these
portals actually no wait first

58
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
portals actually no wait first
 

59
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,950
portals actually no wait first
first everybody let me tell you just in

60
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
first everybody let me tell you just in
 

61
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,990
first everybody let me tell you just in
case you don't know the story

62

case you don't know the story
 

63
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,390
case you don't know the story
right over here is the wall so this is

64
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
right over here is the wall so this is
 

65
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,109
right over here is the wall so this is
our end

66
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
our end
 

67
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,910
our end
mapped out the way i've been doing this

68
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
mapped out the way i've been doing this
 

69
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,190
mapped out the way i've been doing this
is every time i go

70
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
is every time i go
 

71
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,109
is every time i go
in city rating you can see the purple

72
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
in city rating you can see the purple
 

73
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,230
in city rating you can see the purple
dots over there

74
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
dots over there
 

75
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,469
dots over there
i've mapped out the ends just so that i

76
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
i've mapped out the ends just so that i
 

77
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,390
i've mapped out the ends just so that i
don't accidentally cover the same area

78
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
don't accidentally cover the same area
 

79
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,550
don't accidentally cover the same area
twice because that is very frustrating

80
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
twice because that is very frustrating
 

81
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,270
twice because that is very frustrating
if you're

82
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
if you're
 

83
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,429
if you're
looking for end fortresses and then you

84
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
looking for end fortresses and then you
 

85
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,350
looking for end fortresses and then you
find one and you're so excited and

86
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
find one and you're so excited and
 

87
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,789
find one and you're so excited and
then it's like oh i've been to this one

88
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
then it's like oh i've been to this one
 

89
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,510
then it's like oh i've been to this one
already so each of these is about two

90
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
already so each of these is about two
 

91
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,109
already so each of these is about two
thousand by two thousand and you can see

92
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
thousand by two thousand and you can see
 

93
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,390
thousand by two thousand and you can see
i actually haven't done

94
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
i actually haven't done
 

95
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,429
i actually haven't done
too much uh rating honestly for uh

96
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
too much uh rating honestly for uh
 

97
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,990
too much uh rating honestly for uh
how much i play in the world here and uh

98
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
how much i play in the world here and uh
 

99
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,670
how much i play in the world here and uh
you know you would expect more but i

100
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
you know you would expect more but i
 

101

really like doing it too much part of
 

105
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,590

enjoy the end fortress rating it's the

110
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
enjoy the end fortress rating it's the
 

111
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,590
enjoy the end fortress rating it's the
flying around trying to find them part i

112
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
flying around trying to find them part i
 

113
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,990
flying around trying to find them part i
don't really

114
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
don't really
 

115
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,149
don't really
care for though and that's like you

116
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
care for though and that's like you
 

117
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,590
care for though and that's like you
spend at least three times the

118
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
spend at least three times the
 

119
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,870
spend at least three times the
the amount of time looking for the

120
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
the amount of time looking for the
 

121
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,950
the amount of time looking for the
fortress and actually reading it i find

122
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
fortress and actually reading it i find
 

123
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,149
fortress and actually reading it i find
which isn't the most exciting thing uh

124
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
which isn't the most exciting thing uh
 

125
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,310
which isn't the most exciting thing uh
but yeah we found a new one over here

126
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
but yeah we found a new one over here
 

127
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,630
but yeah we found a new one over here
it's got guys inside what we're gonna

128
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
it's got guys inside what we're gonna
 

129
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,669
it's got guys inside what we're gonna
try to do today

130
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
try to do today
 

131
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,750
try to do today
is uh play around with the whole farming

132
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
is uh play around with the whole farming
 

133
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,710
is uh play around with the whole farming
thing

134
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
thing
 

135
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,390
thing
so i got him to hit himself there but he

136
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
so i got him to hit himself there but he
 

137
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,550
so i got him to hit himself there but he
did not duplicate i don't quite know how

138
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
did not duplicate i don't quite know how
 

139
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,309
did not duplicate i don't quite know how
this mechanic works

140
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
this mechanic works
 

141
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,589
this mechanic works
but apparently if you can get them to

142
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
but apparently if you can get them to
 

143
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,350
but apparently if you can get them to
shoot themselves they have a chance of

144
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
shoot themselves they have a chance of
 

145
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,750
shoot themselves they have a chance of
like

146
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
like
 

147
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,869
like
duplicating and then they teleport so

148
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
duplicating and then they teleport so
 

149
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,550
duplicating and then they teleport so
what we gotta do is get them to

150
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
what we gotta do is get them to
 

151
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,630
what we gotta do is get them to
shoot themselves oh it just happened

152
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
shoot themselves oh it just happened
 

153
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,630
shoot themselves oh it just happened
yeah shoot themselves when they're

154
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
yeah shoot themselves when they're
 

155
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,830
yeah shoot themselves when they're
when they're opened up like that if

156
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
when they're opened up like that if
 

157
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,110
when they're opened up like that if
they're closed i don't think it can

158
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
they're closed i don't think it can
 

159
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,070
they're closed i don't think it can
happen

160
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
happen
 

161
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,990
happen
okay so this is going to be a little bit

162
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
okay so this is going to be a little bit
 

163
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,270
okay so this is going to be a little bit
tricky actually

164
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
tricky actually
 

165
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,229
tricky actually
it seems like there's four conditions

166
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
it seems like there's four conditions
 

167
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,589
it seems like there's four conditions
that have to be met for this

168
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
that have to be met for this
 

169
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,589
that have to be met for this
so one of them the lid has to be open as

170
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
so one of them the lid has to be open as
 

171
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,190
so one of them the lid has to be open as
we discovered already

172
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
we discovered already
 

173
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,509
we discovered already
the other one is if they are at less

174
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
the other one is if they are at less
 

175
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,990
the other one is if they are at less
than half their health there's a 25

176
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
than half their health there's a 25
 

177
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,910
than half their health there's a 25
chance it's just gonna fail so you want

178
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
chance it's just gonna fail so you want
 

179
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,070
chance it's just gonna fail so you want
them to be at full life

180
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
them to be at full life
 

181
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,270
them to be at full life
otherwise they'll teleport without

182
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
otherwise they'll teleport without
 

183
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,750
otherwise they'll teleport without
creating a new one third one is they'll

184
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
creating a new one third one is they'll
 

185
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,149
creating a new one third one is they'll
they have to teleport within a 17 by 17

186
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
they have to teleport within a 17 by 17
 

187
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,949
they have to teleport within a 17 by 17
by 17

188
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
by 17
 

189
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,070
by 17
area and if that fails uh four times

190
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
area and if that fails uh four times
 

191
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,070
area and if that fails uh four times
i believe then uh it just doesn't happen

192
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
i believe then uh it just doesn't happen
 

193
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,350
i believe then uh it just doesn't happen
what if we do this uh and the final one

194
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
what if we do this uh and the final one
 

195
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,309
what if we do this uh and the final one
is each shulker box within like an eight

196
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
is each shulker box within like an eight
 

197
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,430
is each shulker box within like an eight
block area lowers the chances by

198
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
block area lowers the chances by
 

199
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,270
block area lowers the chances by
20 for each one so if you have five

200
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
20 for each one so if you have five
 

201
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,869
20 for each one so if you have five
shulker boxes within eight blocks of

202
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
shulker boxes within eight blocks of
 

203
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,910
shulker boxes within eight blocks of
each other

204
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
each other
 

205
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,110
each other
it doesn't create any new ones putting

206
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
it doesn't create any new ones putting
 

207
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,789
it doesn't create any new ones putting
them in boats seems like it might be a

208
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
them in boats seems like it might be a
 

209
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,030
them in boats seems like it might be a
good idea i'm just like in the thinking

210
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
good idea i'm just like in the thinking
 

211
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,309
good idea i'm just like in the thinking
phase right now how are we gonna build

212
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
phase right now how are we gonna build
 

213
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,190
phase right now how are we gonna build
our farm let's

214
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
our farm let's
 

215
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,270
our farm let's
do a little bit of experimenting and i

216
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
do a little bit of experimenting and i
 

217
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,789
do a little bit of experimenting and i
decided let's actually just hop into a

218
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
decided let's actually just hop into a
 

219
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,149
decided let's actually just hop into a
creative world here because it'll make

220
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
creative world here because it'll make
 

221
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,830
creative world here because it'll make
it so much easier to test because

222
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
it so much easier to test because
 

223
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,110
it so much easier to test because
shulkers are

224
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
shulkers are
 

225
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,350
shulkers are
very difficult to control in survival as

226
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
very difficult to control in survival as
 

227
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,710
very difficult to control in survival as
you can see they're not affected by

228
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
you can see they're not affected by
 

229
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,869
you can see they're not affected by
slime blocks my idea here was maybe

230
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
slime blocks my idea here was maybe
 

231
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,869
slime blocks my idea here was maybe
let's put a snow golem

232
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
let's put a snow golem
 

233
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,229
let's put a snow golem
to shoot at the guy and

234
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
to shoot at the guy and
 

235
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,070
to shoot at the guy and
if this is extended the snow golem can't

236
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
if this is extended the snow golem can't
 

237
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,990
if this is extended the snow golem can't
see him right chalker can't see the snow

238
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
see him right chalker can't see the snow
 

239
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,550
see him right chalker can't see the snow
golem

240
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
golem
 

241
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,830
golem
but then when we retract it

242
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
but then when we retract it
 

243
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,070
but then when we retract it
i thought we would get him to shoot him

244
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
i thought we would get him to shoot him
 

245
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,830
i thought we would get him to shoot him
and then like slime block the

246
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
and then like slime block the
 

247
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,149
and then like slime block the
projectile into the shulker get him to

248
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
projectile into the shulker get him to
 

249
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,229
projectile into the shulker get him to
shoot himself that way

250
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
shoot himself that way
 

251
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,350
shoot himself that way
but it seems like the shulker shot

252
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
but it seems like the shulker shot
 

253
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,789
but it seems like the shulker shot
doesn't bounce off the slime block it

254
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
doesn't bounce off the slime block it
 

255
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,390
doesn't bounce off the slime block it
just uh

256
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
just uh
 

257
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,229
just uh
it just breaks it so that's that's a

258
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
it just breaks it so that's that's a
 

259
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,469
it just breaks it so that's that's a
no-go idea okay so i just discovered

260
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
no-go idea okay so i just discovered
 

261
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,670
no-go idea okay so i just discovered
another important thing here

262
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
another important thing here
 

263
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,909
another important thing here
shulker boxes must be able to open

264
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
shulker boxes must be able to open
 

265
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,069
shulker boxes must be able to open
without ramming into another shulker

266
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
without ramming into another shulker
 

267
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,990
without ramming into another shulker
um so if we do this and they are both

268
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
um so if we do this and they are both
 

269
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,230
um so if we do this and they are both
opening sideways that is fine nothing

270
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
opening sideways that is fine nothing
 

271
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,189
opening sideways that is fine nothing
wrong with that

272
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
wrong with that
 

273
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,350
wrong with that
if we have a guy going upwards opening

274
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
if we have a guy going upwards opening
 

275
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,310
if we have a guy going upwards opening
upwards like that

276
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
upwards like that
 

277
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,749
upwards like that
and the other guy above him

278
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759

 

279
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,990

oh wait i guess if there's a guy above

280
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
oh wait i guess if there's a guy above
 

281
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,310
oh wait i guess if there's a guy above
him he'll prefer to attach to the side

282
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
him he'll prefer to attach to the side
 

283
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,150
him he'll prefer to attach to the side
but if there's no option if he must

284
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
but if there's no option if he must
 

285
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,350
but if there's no option if he must
attach downwards

286
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
attach downwards
 

287
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,550
attach downwards
then he teleports water test

288
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
then he teleports water test
 

289
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,390
then he teleports water test
they don't like water lava tests

290
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
they don't like water lava tests
 

291
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,950
they don't like water lava tests
hey oh no never mind magma test

292
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
hey oh no never mind magma test
 

293
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,629
hey oh no never mind magma test
oh they're okay with magma now i get

294
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
oh they're okay with magma now i get
 

295
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,230
oh they're okay with magma now i get
this a lot where people want to see the

296
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
this a lot where people want to see the
 

297
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,150
this a lot where people want to see the
behind the scenes like how do you come

298
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
behind the scenes like how do you come
 

299
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,670
behind the scenes like how do you come
up with your farm ideas how do you come

300
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
up with your farm ideas how do you come
 

301
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,430
up with your farm ideas how do you come
up with your redstone contraptions

302
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
up with your redstone contraptions
 

303
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,870
up with your redstone contraptions
and most of it is this little bunch of

304
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
and most of it is this little bunch of
 

305
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,550
and most of it is this little bunch of
trial and error testing things out and

306
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
trial and error testing things out and
 

307
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,990
trial and error testing things out and
then once you understand all the

308
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
then once you understand all the
 

309
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,670
then once you understand all the
mechanics to how something works you can

310
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
mechanics to how something works you can
 

311
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,990
mechanics to how something works you can
start

312
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
start
 

313
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,270
start
formulating a plan they do not like with

314
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
formulating a plan they do not like with
 

315
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,909
formulating a plan they do not like with
the roses

316
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
the roses
 

317
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,749
the roses
uh-huh so we're learning things here oh

318
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
uh-huh so we're learning things here oh
 

319
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,909
uh-huh so we're learning things here oh
darn it i thought maybe we could use the

320
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
darn it i thought maybe we could use the
 

321
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,150
darn it i thought maybe we could use the
water to get him to shoot himself

322
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
water to get him to shoot himself
 

323
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,990
water to get him to shoot himself
okay so we got some weird stuff going on

324
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
okay so we got some weird stuff going on
 

325
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,909
okay so we got some weird stuff going on
here water for sure does

326
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
here water for sure does
 

327
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,350
here water for sure does
move the projectiles we got a bubble

328
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
move the projectiles we got a bubble
 

329
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,870
move the projectiles we got a bubble
column in front of us and when the

330
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
column in front of us and when the
 

331
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,469
column in front of us and when the
projectile goes into that it gets

332
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
projectile goes into that it gets
 

333
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,909
projectile goes into that it gets
launched upwards

334
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
launched upwards
 

335
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,510
launched upwards
i was trying to figure out a way we

336
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
i was trying to figure out a way we
 

337
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,430
i was trying to figure out a way we
could get the shulker to see us without

338
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
could get the shulker to see us without
 

339
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,870
could get the shulker to see us without
actually being able to shoot us so i

340
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
actually being able to shoot us so i
 

341
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,950
actually being able to shoot us so i
thought yes walls put some walls in

342
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
thought yes walls put some walls in
 

343
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,749
thought yes walls put some walls in
front of him

344
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
front of him
 

345
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,189
front of him
he'll be able to see us through that but

346
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
he'll be able to see us through that but
 

347
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,870
he'll be able to see us through that but
his projectile won't be able to hit us

348
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
his projectile won't be able to hit us
 

349
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,909
his projectile won't be able to hit us
right

350
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
right
 

351
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,189
right
well funny thing about these projectiles

352
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
well funny thing about these projectiles
 

353
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,029
well funny thing about these projectiles
is normally they move block to block

354
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
is normally they move block to block
 

355
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,870
is normally they move block to block
but then sometimes they have like a

356
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
but then sometimes they have like a
 

357
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,550
but then sometimes they have like a
super precision mode

358
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
super precision mode
 

359
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,710
super precision mode
they go into and they can actually sneak

360
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
they go into and they can actually sneak
 

361
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,029
they go into and they can actually sneak
through things like that

362
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
through things like that
 

363
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,390
through things like that
oh he got him and he got him

364
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
oh he got him and he got him
 

365
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,510
oh he got him and he got him
it did not work at all

366
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520

 

367
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,350

oh man we might be getting somewhere

368
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
oh man we might be getting somewhere
 

369
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,790
oh man we might be getting somewhere
with this so check it out we got a trap

370
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
with this so check it out we got a trap
 

371
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,150
with this so check it out we got a trap
door and from the snow going which we

372
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
door and from the snow going which we
 

373
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,909
door and from the snow going which we
can turn on and off with redstone to

374
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
can turn on and off with redstone to
 

375
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,070
can turn on and off with redstone to
turn our farm on and off

376
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
turn our farm on and off
 

377
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,150
turn our farm on and off
and we got enchanting table there it's

378
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
and we got enchanting table there it's
 

379
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,830
and we got enchanting table there it's
just short enough where he can still hit

380
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
just short enough where he can still hit
 

381
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,830
just short enough where he can still hit
the shulker

382
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
the shulker
 

383
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,510
the shulker
and then the only open side for the

384
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
and then the only open side for the
 

385
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,390
and then the only open side for the
shulker to shoot is behind himself

386
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
shulker to shoot is behind himself
 

387
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,390
shulker to shoot is behind himself
and if it travels at least two blocks he

388
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
and if it travels at least two blocks he
 

389
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,870
and if it travels at least two blocks he
can hit himself

390
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
can hit himself
 

391
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,550
can hit himself
so as the projectile tries to go back to

392
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
so as the projectile tries to go back to
 

393
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,390
so as the projectile tries to go back to
the snowglobe he hits himself

394
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
the snowglobe he hits himself
 

395
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,070
the snowglobe he hits himself
and you see the snow golems focused on

396
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
and you see the snow golems focused on
 

397
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,590
and you see the snow golems focused on
this guy that's the one that actually

398
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
this guy that's the one that actually
 

399
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,430
this guy that's the one that actually
was there before

400
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
was there before
 

401
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,790
was there before
so this new guy has full health again

402
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
so this new guy has full health again
 

403
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,670
so this new guy has full health again
and he reacquires a target on that guy a

404
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
and he reacquires a target on that guy a
 

405
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,790
and he reacquires a target on that guy a
new one

406
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
new one
 

407
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,469
new one
and we can have some way of killing the

408
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
and we can have some way of killing the
 

409
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,830
and we can have some way of killing the
guys that teleport out

410
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
guys that teleport out
 

411
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,950
guys that teleport out
outside the farm the only

412
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
outside the farm the only
 

413
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,390
outside the farm the only
issue there's a few of them

414
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
issue there's a few of them
 

415
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,870
issue there's a few of them
uh if the shocker hits himself too many

416
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
uh if the shocker hits himself too many
 

417
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,629
uh if the shocker hits himself too many
times without actually duplicating

418
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
times without actually duplicating
 

419
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,950
times without actually duplicating
i think he can kill himself still no

420
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
i think he can kill himself still no
 

421
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,550
i think he can kill himself still no
yeah that's what i was afraid of so we

422
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
yeah that's what i was afraid of so we
 

423
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,469
yeah that's what i was afraid of so we
might need a healing station to keep the

424
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
might need a healing station to keep the
 

425
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,150
might need a healing station to keep the
guy topped off if he fails too many

426
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
guy topped off if he fails too many
 

427
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,710
guy topped off if he fails too many
times

428
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
times
 

429
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,189
times
oh snappers okay it looks like we might

430
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
oh snappers okay it looks like we might
 

431
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,270
oh snappers okay it looks like we might
actually have something that works here

432
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
actually have something that works here
 

433
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,950
actually have something that works here
believe it or not so i've been doing

434
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
believe it or not so i've been doing
 

435
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,629
believe it or not so i've been doing
some tweaking with this i did add a

436
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
some tweaking with this i did add a
 

437
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,550
some tweaking with this i did add a
healing station to it so that's running

438
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
healing station to it so that's running
 

439
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:16,870
healing station to it so that's running
at

440
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
at
 

441
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,990
at
five snowballs at the moment basically

442
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
five snowballs at the moment basically
 

443
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,749
five snowballs at the moment basically
we're gonna need some auto brewer

444
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
we're gonna need some auto brewer
 

445
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,110
we're gonna need some auto brewer
to keep this thing filled up with

446
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
to keep this thing filled up with
 

447
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,589
to keep this thing filled up with
instant health have to run it pretty

448
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
instant health have to run it pretty
 

449
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,390
instant health have to run it pretty
quickly though

450
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
quickly though
 

451
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,510
quickly though
because this shulker does so much damage

452
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
because this shulker does so much damage
 

453
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,749
because this shulker does so much damage
to

454
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
to
 

455
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,309
to
itself um regen potions weren't able to

456
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
itself um regen potions weren't able to
 

457
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,029
itself um regen potions weren't able to
keep up

458
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
keep up
 

459
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,270
keep up
past the instant health or regen too

460
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
past the instant health or regen too
 

461
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,390
past the instant health or regen too
maybe would work

462
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
maybe would work
 

463
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,510
maybe would work
but uh not just regular regen

464
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
but uh not just regular regen
 

465
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,350
but uh not just regular regen
so we flip up the trap door there got

466
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
so we flip up the trap door there got
 

467
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,950
so we flip up the trap door there got
rid of the enchanting table now this the

468
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
rid of the enchanting table now this the
 

469
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,629
rid of the enchanting table now this the
snow golem can seem a lot easier

470
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
snow golem can seem a lot easier
 

471
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,830
snow golem can seem a lot easier
shoots a lot faster and

472
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
shoots a lot faster and
 

473
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,510
shoots a lot faster and
after the guy teleports out there's like

474
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
after the guy teleports out there's like
 

475
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,950
after the guy teleports out there's like
a five seconds before he

476
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
a five seconds before he
 

477
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,390
a five seconds before he
acquires a new target again he's looking

478
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
acquires a new target again he's looking
 

479
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,070
acquires a new target again he's looking
at that guy over there and then he

480
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
at that guy over there and then he
 

481
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,309
at that guy over there and then he
switches to the new guy

482
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
switches to the new guy
 

483
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,550
switches to the new guy
uh-huh we'll need some way of dealing

484
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
uh-huh we'll need some way of dealing
 

485
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,990
uh-huh we'll need some way of dealing
with the guys that teleport outside of

486
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
with the guys that teleport outside of
 

487
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,430
with the guys that teleport outside of
there some way of killing them or maybe

488
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
there some way of killing them or maybe
 

489
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,790
there some way of killing them or maybe
i'll just run around doing it i don't

490
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
i'll just run around doing it i don't
 

491
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,070
i'll just run around doing it i don't
know yet

492
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
know yet
 

493
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,830
know yet
but uh yeah it's working pretty good i

494
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
but uh yeah it's working pretty good i
 

495
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,350
but uh yeah it's working pretty good i
think it's a foolproof system now

496
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
think it's a foolproof system now
 

497
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,070
think it's a foolproof system now
because if

498
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
because if
 

499
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,909
because if
his health can't go below half there's

500
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
his health can't go below half there's
 

501
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,830
his health can't go below half there's
no way for him to teleport out of there

502
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
no way for him to teleport out of there
 

503
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,350
no way for him to teleport out of there
there's no way for him to kill himself

504
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360

 

505
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,790

so i don't think it'll mess up right

506
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
so i don't think it'll mess up right
 

507
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,589
so i don't think it'll mess up right
please oh and you see that so there is

508
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
please oh and you see that so there is
 

509
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,749
please oh and you see that so there is
sometimes where the shot will actually

510
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
sometimes where the shot will actually
 

511
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,469
sometimes where the shot will actually
go through the shulker which is kind of

512
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
go through the shulker which is kind of
 

513
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,149
go through the shulker which is kind of
weird so we have this bubble column as a

514
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
weird so we have this bubble column as a
 

515
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,070
weird so we have this bubble column as a
safety so there's no way for

516
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
safety so there's no way for
 

517
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,269
safety so there's no way for
him to actually hit the snow golem

518
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
him to actually hit the snow golem
 

519
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,469
him to actually hit the snow golem
because it'll like launch it up to the

520
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
because it'll like launch it up to the
 

521
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,149
because it'll like launch it up to the
roof and then it pops it cool so i think

522
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
roof and then it pops it cool so i think
 

523
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,990
roof and then it pops it cool so i think
we got our duplicator figured out now we

524
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
we got our duplicator figured out now we
 

525
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,870
we got our duplicator figured out now we
move on to

526
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
move on to
 

527
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,750
move on to
the collection and killing now option a

528
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
the collection and killing now option a
 

529
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,030
the collection and killing now option a
we can just run around killing them

530
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
we can just run around killing them
 

531
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,470
we can just run around killing them
ourselves which is what we might end up

532
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
ourselves which is what we might end up
 

533
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,430
ourselves which is what we might end up
doing

534
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
doing
 

535
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,310
doing
but uh it would be nice to come up with

536
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
but uh it would be nice to come up with
 

537
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,230
but uh it would be nice to come up with
some automatic methods right so i

538
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
some automatic methods right so i
 

539
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,310
some automatic methods right so i
noticed one thing here if you have a

540
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
noticed one thing here if you have a
 

541
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,630
noticed one thing here if you have a
minecart under a tripwire uh the

542
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
minecart under a tripwire uh the
 

543
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,550
minecart under a tripwire uh the
tripwire doesn't detect that

544
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
tripwire doesn't detect that
 

545
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,190
tripwire doesn't detect that
but it will detect a shulker box in the

546
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
but it will detect a shulker box in the
 

547
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,990
but it will detect a shulker box in the
minecart

548
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
minecart
 

549
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,110
minecart
so maybe we use that for something

550
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
so maybe we use that for something
 

551
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,350
so maybe we use that for something
one idea like this will bounce back and

552
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
one idea like this will bounce back and
 

553
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,190
one idea like this will bounce back and
forth right and then when a shocker

554
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
forth right and then when a shocker
 

555
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,430
forth right and then when a shocker
comes within a block of the track guess

556
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
comes within a block of the track guess
 

557
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,870
comes within a block of the track guess
what

558
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
what
 

559
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,110
what
we can detect that and then uh send them

560
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
we can detect that and then uh send them
 

561
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,910
we can detect that and then uh send them
off somewhere

562
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
off somewhere
 

563
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,590
off somewhere
another option is we can set up a bunch

564
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
another option is we can set up a bunch
 

565
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,630
another option is we can set up a bunch
of nether portals and they'll

566
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
of nether portals and they'll
 

567
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,829
of nether portals and they'll
automatically teleport

568
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
automatically teleport
 

569
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,750
automatically teleport
into the portal and end up in one spot

570
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
into the portal and end up in one spot
 

571
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,430
into the portal and end up in one spot
in the nether which i think is what a

572
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
in the nether which i think is what a
 

573
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,710
in the nether which i think is what a
lot of people have been doing but i kind

574
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
lot of people have been doing but i kind
 

575
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,070
lot of people have been doing but i kind
of want to keep this all within one

576
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
of want to keep this all within one
 

577
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,750
of want to keep this all within one
dimension if possible

578
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
dimension if possible
 

579
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,430
dimension if possible
so we might just do something like this

580
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
so we might just do something like this
 

581
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,670
so we might just do something like this
have the tracks two blocks apart from

582
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
have the tracks two blocks apart from
 

583
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,190
have the tracks two blocks apart from
each other

584
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
each other
 

585
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,949
each other
and then as the minecart goes here it's

586
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
and then as the minecart goes here it's
 

587
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,509
and then as the minecart goes here it's
going to pick up the closest one to it

588
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
going to pick up the closest one to it
 

589
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,630
going to pick up the closest one to it
and then i had an idea

590
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
and then i had an idea
 

591
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,790
and then i had an idea
of a way we can kill them then so this

592
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
of a way we can kill them then so this
 

593
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,710
of a way we can kill them then so this
will collect them all together

594
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
will collect them all together
 

595
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,630
will collect them all together
and so shockers will teleport out of uh

596
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
and so shockers will teleport out of uh
 

597
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,710
and so shockers will teleport out of uh
water right but if they're in a minecart

598
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
water right but if they're in a minecart
 

599
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,150
water right but if they're in a minecart
they're not able to

600
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
they're not able to
 

601
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,150
they're not able to
haha so we can actually suffocate them

602
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
haha so we can actually suffocate them
 

603
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,190
haha so we can actually suffocate them
this way

604
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
this way
 

605
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,670
this way
and then after enough suffocation

606
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
and then after enough suffocation
 

607
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,870
and then after enough suffocation
they'll die

608
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
they'll die
 

609
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,230
they'll die
their shelter shells will float up to

610
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
their shelter shells will float up to
 

611
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,350
their shelter shells will float up to
the top of the water

612
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360

 

613
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,389

makes a cool sound looks awesome

614
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
makes a cool sound looks awesome
 

615
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,389
makes a cool sound looks awesome
it's probably my favorite thing about it

616
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
it's probably my favorite thing about it
 

617
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,750
it's probably my favorite thing about it
uh and the minecarts will

618
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
uh and the minecarts will
 

619
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,509
uh and the minecarts will
slowly sink down so we can maybe use a

620
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
slowly sink down so we can maybe use a
 

621
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,269
slowly sink down so we can maybe use a
tripwire to detect when uh

622
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
tripwire to detect when uh
 

623
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,550
tripwire to detect when uh
they're all gone or something when

624
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
they're all gone or something when
 

625
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,269
they're all gone or something when
they're all dead and then

626
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
they're all dead and then
 

627
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,870
they're all dead and then
trigger this so this is a trick you can

628
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
trigger this so this is a trick you can
 

629
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,870
trigger this so this is a trick you can
do with mine carts they will actually

630
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
do with mine carts they will actually
 

631
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,310
do with mine carts they will actually
teleport through a block

632
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
teleport through a block
 

633
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,829
teleport through a block
through a half slab so if we

634
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
through a half slab so if we
 

635
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,269
through a half slab so if we
switch this over they'll actually

636
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
switch this over they'll actually
 

637
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,509
switch this over they'll actually
teleport through that and then ram them

638
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
teleport through that and then ram them
 

639
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,110
teleport through that and then ram them
into a cactus and send them back to the

640
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
into a cactus and send them back to the
 

641
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,389
into a cactus and send them back to the
start or something

642
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
start or something
 

643
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,910
start or something
the main issue with these shulkers is

644
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
the main issue with these shulkers is
 

645
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,910
the main issue with these shulkers is
they're very difficult to kill i think

646
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
they're very difficult to kill i think
 

647
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,670
they're very difficult to kill i think
the water is the only thing i found that

648
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
the water is the only thing i found that
 

649
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,790
the water is the only thing i found that
works

650
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
works
 

651
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,470
works
i thought this might work because he's

652
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
i thought this might work because he's
 

653
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,550
i thought this might work because he's
kind of touching the lava right

654
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
kind of touching the lava right
 

655
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,630
kind of touching the lava right
but uh nope yeah i always thought magma

656
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
but uh nope yeah i always thought magma
 

657
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,150
but uh nope yeah i always thought magma
cubes were the hardest mob to kill in

658
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
cubes were the hardest mob to kill in
 

659
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,030
cubes were the hardest mob to kill in
the game but i think

660
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
the game but i think
 

661
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,350
the game but i think
actually it's shulkers because like you

662
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
actually it's shulkers because like you
 

663
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,710
actually it's shulkers because like you
can't suffocate them

664
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
can't suffocate them
 

665
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,190
can't suffocate them
you can't even handle these guys i've

666
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
you can't even handle these guys i've
 

667
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,509
you can't even handle these guys i've
tried the drip stone that didn't work

668
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
tried the drip stone that didn't work
 

669
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,670
tried the drip stone that didn't work
it's like they're indestructible they

670
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
it's like they're indestructible they
 

671
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,030
it's like they're indestructible they
don't take fall damage what are you

672
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
don't take fall damage what are you
 

673
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,230
don't take fall damage what are you
supposed to do

674
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
supposed to do
 

675
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,990
supposed to do
uh tnt probably the other best option

676
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
uh tnt probably the other best option
 

677
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,550
uh tnt probably the other best option
but they are extremely tanky like that's

678
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
but they are extremely tanky like that's
 

679
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,389
but they are extremely tanky like that's
a pretty small area it covers

680
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
a pretty small area it covers
 

681
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,910
a pretty small area it covers
anyways let's get back to the let's play

682
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
anyways let's get back to the let's play
 

683
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,829
anyways let's get back to the let's play
world now so we've done our research we

684
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
world now so we've done our research we
 

685
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,670
world now so we've done our research we
know what will work what won't work

686
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
know what will work what won't work
 

687
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,829
know what will work what won't work
and kind of figured out the main pieces

688
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
and kind of figured out the main pieces
 

689
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,870
and kind of figured out the main pieces
to making

690
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
to making
 

691
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,949
to making
a farm that'll actually function right

692
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
a farm that'll actually function right
 

693
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,030
a farm that'll actually function right
now we did not actually build the farm i

694
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
now we did not actually build the farm i
 

695
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,389
now we did not actually build the farm i
didn't build it and test it out or

696
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
didn't build it and test it out or
 

697
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,069
didn't build it and test it out or
anything and usually i don't like to do

698
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
anything and usually i don't like to do
 

699
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,670
anything and usually i don't like to do
that i don't like to

700
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
that i don't like to
 

701
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,590
that i don't like to
pre-build stuff in creative and like

702
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
pre-build stuff in creative and like
 

703
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,269
pre-build stuff in creative and like
know exactly how it works i like to do

704
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
know exactly how it works i like to do
 

705
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,790
know exactly how it works i like to do
that in the episodes just because i

706
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
that in the episodes just because i
 

707
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,990
that in the episodes just because i
think it makes

708
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
think it makes
 

709
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,750
think it makes
you know things a bit more exciting i

710
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
you know things a bit more exciting i
 

711
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,150
you know things a bit more exciting i
gotta figure stuff out as we go still

712
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
gotta figure stuff out as we go still
 

713
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,310
gotta figure stuff out as we go still
i don't know the full picture just yet

714
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
i don't know the full picture just yet
 

715
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,990
i don't know the full picture just yet
and stuff can go wrong sometimes the

716
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
and stuff can go wrong sometimes the
 

717
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,829
and stuff can go wrong sometimes the
stuff i build in the let's play episodes

718
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
stuff i build in the let's play episodes
 

719
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,430
stuff i build in the let's play episodes
don't work as good as they could if i

720
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
don't work as good as they could if i
 

721
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,389
don't work as good as they could if i
actually

722
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
actually
 

723
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,430
actually
took time to refine the idea right but

724
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
took time to refine the idea right but
 

725
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,350
took time to refine the idea right but
overall i think it's just better that

726
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
overall i think it's just better that
 

727
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,269
overall i think it's just better that
way so

728
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
way so
 

729
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,350
way so
we could for example let's start

730
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
we could for example let's start
 

731
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,389
we could for example let's start
figuring this out

732
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
figuring this out
 

733
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,310
figuring this out
we could haul a shulker all the way to

734
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
we could haul a shulker all the way to
 

735
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,910
we could haul a shulker all the way to
the overworld and that would probably be

736
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
the overworld and that would probably be
 

737
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,949
the overworld and that would probably be
the nicest thing

738
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
the nicest thing
 

739
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,590
the nicest thing
but from a practical standpoint like if

740
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
but from a practical standpoint like if
 

741
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,949
but from a practical standpoint like if
someone else wants to

742
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
someone else wants to
 

743
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,629
someone else wants to
make a shulker farm i think what i want

744
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
make a shulker farm i think what i want
 

745
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,190
make a shulker farm i think what i want
to do with this one is

746
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
to do with this one is
 

747
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,870
to do with this one is
just set it up right here like the most

748
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
just set it up right here like the most
 

749
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,550
just set it up right here like the most
practical thing is we got the chalkers

750
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
practical thing is we got the chalkers
 

751
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,069
practical thing is we got the chalkers
here already

752
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
here already
 

753
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,710
here already
we got the end ship right it's a away

754
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
we got the end ship right it's a away
 

755
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,910
we got the end ship right it's a away
from the land we don't have to worry

756
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
from the land we don't have to worry
 

757
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,269
from the land we don't have to worry
about them teleporting

758
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
about them teleporting
 

759
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,629
about them teleporting
outside of the area here

760
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
outside of the area here
 

761
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,910
outside of the area here
this is gonna be a problem uh

762
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
this is gonna be a problem uh
 

763
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,509
this is gonna be a problem uh
we kind of got everything we need right

764
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
we kind of got everything we need right
 

765
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,030
we kind of got everything we need right
here so let's build it

766
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
here so let's build it
 

767
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,269
here so let's build it
right here you know so i'm gonna start

768
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
right here you know so i'm gonna start
 

769
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,350
right here you know so i'm gonna start
bulldozing this and setting up our snow

770
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
bulldozing this and setting up our snow
 

771
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,710
bulldozing this and setting up our snow
golem

772
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
golem
 

773
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,110
golem
i'm gonna get rid of that guy right

774
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
i'm gonna get rid of that guy right
 

775
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,230
i'm gonna get rid of that guy right
there yeah

776
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
there yeah
 

777
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,829
there yeah
i don't think we need him we got two

778
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
i don't think we need him we got two
 

779
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,990
i don't think we need him we got two
guys downstairs okay this might be the

780
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
guys downstairs okay this might be the
 

781
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,670
guys downstairs okay this might be the
toughest part we're gonna try

782
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
toughest part we're gonna try
 

783
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,949
toughest part we're gonna try
transfer them where we want them to be

784
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
transfer them where we want them to be
 

785
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,389
transfer them where we want them to be
i'm gonna break them out of the boat

786
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
i'm gonna break them out of the boat
 

787
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,710
i'm gonna break them out of the boat
and they're right next to each other so

788
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
and they're right next to each other so
 

789
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,829
and they're right next to each other so
i'm gonna get one of them to move

790
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
i'm gonna get one of them to move
 

791
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,870
i'm gonna get one of them to move
and then we know he'll attach to

792
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
and then we know he'll attach to
 

793
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,629
and then we know he'll attach to
a side of a block so then we're free to

794
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
a side of a block so then we're free to
 

795
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,509
a side of a block so then we're free to
break that and it'll stick to the side

796
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
break that and it'll stick to the side
 

797
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,030
break that and it'll stick to the side
i want him sitting on the dispenser

798
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
i want him sitting on the dispenser
 

799
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,790
i want him sitting on the dispenser
we're gonna heal him with

800
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
we're gonna heal him with
 

801
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,790
we're gonna heal him with
and then we're free to break that okay

802
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
and then we're free to break that okay
 

803
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,150
and then we're free to break that okay
and now we're just gonna keep him

804
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
and now we're just gonna keep him
 

805
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,470
and now we're just gonna keep him
enclosed so that he stops shooting me

806
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
enclosed so that he stops shooting me
 

807
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,110
enclosed so that he stops shooting me
while i

808
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
while i
 

809
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,949
while i
build the rest of the farm here awesome

810
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
build the rest of the farm here awesome
 

811
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,470
build the rest of the farm here awesome
okay so check it out we got most of the

812
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
okay so check it out we got most of the
 

813
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,590
okay so check it out we got most of the
boat bulldozed now

814
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
boat bulldozed now
 

815
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,670
boat bulldozed now
and uh just been using the bottom of it

816
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
and uh just been using the bottom of it
 

817
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,590
and uh just been using the bottom of it
as a platform as i've been building the

818
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
as a platform as i've been building the
 

819
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,110
as a platform as i've been building the
main unit here so this is the most

820
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
main unit here so this is the most
 

821
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,629
main unit here so this is the most
important part of the farm

822
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
important part of the farm
 

823
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,069
important part of the farm
you really don't want to mess this up so

824
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
you really don't want to mess this up so
 

825
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,230
you really don't want to mess this up so
i built it exactly like we built it in

826
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
i built it exactly like we built it in
 

827
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,350
i built it exactly like we built it in
creative

828
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
creative
 

829
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,470
creative
piece to peace uh we got some trap doors

830
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
piece to peace uh we got some trap doors
 

831
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,310
piece to peace uh we got some trap doors
where the snow golem is that's because

832
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
where the snow golem is that's because
 

833
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,990
where the snow golem is that's because
it is possible for the shulker to

834
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
it is possible for the shulker to
 

835
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,990
it is possible for the shulker to
teleport where the snowglobe is

836
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
teleport where the snowglobe is
 

837
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,189
teleport where the snowglobe is
and then uh creates a bit of a problem

838
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
and then uh creates a bit of a problem
 

839
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,110
and then uh creates a bit of a problem
but you know what i realized uh we got a

840
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
but you know what i realized uh we got a
 

841
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,030
but you know what i realized uh we got a
bit of a flaw here actually because

842
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
bit of a flaw here actually because
 

843
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,110
bit of a flaw here actually because
we got to make sure every single surface

844
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
we got to make sure every single surface
 

845
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,030
we got to make sure every single surface
is a teleport proof that's going to be

846
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
is a teleport proof that's going to be
 

847
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,310
is a teleport proof that's going to be
the really annoying thing about this

848
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
the really annoying thing about this
 

849
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,269
the really annoying thing about this
farm

850
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
farm
 

851
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,949
farm
so it's possible the shocker could

852
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
so it's possible the shocker could
 

853
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,629
so it's possible the shocker could
teleport like right over there

854
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
teleport like right over there
 

855
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,389
teleport like right over there
above itself and then not be in the

856
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
above itself and then not be in the
 

857
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,790
above itself and then not be in the
right position or

858
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
right position or
 

859
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,870
right position or
uh i think you could teleport along the

860
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
uh i think you could teleport along the
 

861
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,470
uh i think you could teleport along the
face of that as well

862
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
face of that as well
 

863
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,230
face of that as well
so we want to prevent that from

864
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
so we want to prevent that from
 

865
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,829
so we want to prevent that from
happening we got to be careful as we do

866
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
happening we got to be careful as we do
 

867
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,590
happening we got to be careful as we do
this that he doesn't uh

868
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
this that he doesn't uh
 

869
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,670
this that he doesn't uh
start shooting at us or shooting himself

870
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
start shooting at us or shooting himself
 

871
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,590
start shooting at us or shooting himself
and i'm gonna put some buttons in there

872
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
and i'm gonna put some buttons in there
 

873
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,110
and i'm gonna put some buttons in there
so now he can't teleport

874
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
so now he can't teleport
 

875
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,350
so now he can't teleport
in that space at all and we're gonna put

876
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
in that space at all and we're gonna put
 

877
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,030
in that space at all and we're gonna put
one above them as well but first

878
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
one above them as well but first
 

879
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,990
one above them as well but first
actually just to be safe here i did do a

880
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
actually just to be safe here i did do a
 

881
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,590
actually just to be safe here i did do a
trip back to the base and grab some

882
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
trip back to the base and grab some
 

883
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,870
trip back to the base and grab some
potions and stuff

884
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
potions and stuff
 

885
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,870
potions and stuff
hopefully he that reached him i don't

886
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
hopefully he that reached him i don't
 

887
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,150
hopefully he that reached him i don't
know if it did

888
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
know if it did
 

889
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,150
know if it did
um i just want to make sure if he does

890
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
um i just want to make sure if he does
 

891
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,269
um i just want to make sure if he does
shoot himself i think he's getting low

892
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
shoot himself i think he's getting low
 

893
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,870
shoot himself i think he's getting low
that he doesn't kill himself because uh

894
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
that he doesn't kill himself because uh
 

895
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,389
that he doesn't kill himself because uh
it's gonna be very difficult to get a

896
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
it's gonna be very difficult to get a
 

897
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,670
it's gonna be very difficult to get a
new guy in that spot

898
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
new guy in that spot
 

899
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,110
new guy in that spot
and this isn't gonna look the best but

900
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
and this isn't gonna look the best but
 

901
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,870
and this isn't gonna look the best but
we also gotta make sure we

902
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
we also gotta make sure we
 

903
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,629
we also gotta make sure we
buttonize the outside here or make it so

904
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
buttonize the outside here or make it so
 

905
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,710
buttonize the outside here or make it so
they can't teleport to the glass on the

906
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
they can't teleport to the glass on the
 

907
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,110
they can't teleport to the glass on the
outside of the unit because

908
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
outside of the unit because
 

909
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,629
outside of the unit because
again they check eight blocks around

910
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
again they check eight blocks around
 

911
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,990
again they check eight blocks around
themselves that there's any shockers and

912
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
themselves that there's any shockers and
 

913
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,430
themselves that there's any shockers and
if they're sitting on the glass out here

914
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
if they're sitting on the glass out here
 

915
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,790
if they're sitting on the glass out here
it's going to lower the rates of our

916
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
it's going to lower the rates of our
 

917
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,590
it's going to lower the rates of our
farm

918
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
farm
 

919
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,150
farm
so we gotta teleport proof everything

920
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
so we gotta teleport proof everything
 

921
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,870
so we gotta teleport proof everything
here

922
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
here
 

923
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,710
here
and put some trapdoors on the bottom

924
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
and put some trapdoors on the bottom
 

925
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,750
and put some trapdoors on the bottom
layer just so i can still walk

926
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760

 

927
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,790

no don't shoot him

928
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
no don't shoot him
 

929
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,710
no don't shoot him
no stop it the farm's not ready

930
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
no stop it the farm's not ready
 

931
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,949
no stop it the farm's not ready
oh no this is so stressful i was trying

932
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
oh no this is so stressful i was trying
 

933
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,629
oh no this is so stressful i was trying
to add an on off switch for the the

934
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
to add an on off switch for the the
 

935
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,470
to add an on off switch for the the
hopper clock below we got a hopper clock

936
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
hopper clock below we got a hopper clock
 

937
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,829
hopper clock below we got a hopper clock
running down here

938
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
running down here
 

939
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,670
running down here
they group frenzy it seems like when

940
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
they group frenzy it seems like when
 

941
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,670
they group frenzy it seems like when
they when they hit a target

942
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
they when they hit a target
 

943
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,350
they when they hit a target
all the shulkers in the area seem to go

944
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
all the shulkers in the area seem to go
 

945
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,590
all the shulkers in the area seem to go
for that target oh man yeah this is

946
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
for that target oh man yeah this is
 

947
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,069
for that target oh man yeah this is
tricky

948
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
tricky
 

949
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,310
tricky
i guess uh we can't use moving redstone

950
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
i guess uh we can't use moving redstone
 

951
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,110
i guess uh we can't use moving redstone
for

952
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
for
 

953
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,470
for
our farm at all i was going to send the

954
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
our farm at all i was going to send the
 

955
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,269
our farm at all i was going to send the
signal down to the hopper clock here

956
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
signal down to the hopper clock here
 

957
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,110
signal down to the hopper clock here
to turn the healing station on and off

958
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
to turn the healing station on and off
 

959
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,389
to turn the healing station on and off
but uh

960
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
but uh
 

961
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,150
but uh
if you think about it i can protect it

962
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
if you think about it i can protect it
 

963
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,910
if you think about it i can protect it
right now i put end rods all around it

964
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
right now i put end rods all around it
 

965
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,749
right now i put end rods all around it
nothing can teleport onto the block

966
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
nothing can teleport onto the block
 

967
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,310
nothing can teleport onto the block
or underneath it but once that retracts

968
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
or underneath it but once that retracts
 

969
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,829
or underneath it but once that retracts
there's going to be one spot where they

970
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
there's going to be one spot where they
 

971
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,030
there's going to be one spot where they
can teleport

972
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
can teleport
 

973
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,430
can teleport
on the bottom of the redstone block and

974
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
on the bottom of the redstone block and
 

975
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,269
on the bottom of the redstone block and
there's nothing i can do about that

976
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
there's nothing i can do about that
 

977
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,350
there's nothing i can do about that
so we just we just can't use moving

978
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
so we just we just can't use moving
 

979
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,389
so we just we just can't use moving
redstone

980
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
redstone
 

981
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,829
redstone
we gotta think of something else here

982
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
we gotta think of something else here
 

983
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,670
we gotta think of something else here
yeah so the trapdoor that lets the

984
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
yeah so the trapdoor that lets the
 

985
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,269
yeah so the trapdoor that lets the
snowglobe shoot the shulker is right

986
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
snowglobe shoot the shulker is right
 

987
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,710
snowglobe shoot the shulker is right
underneath that purple block we gotta

988
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
underneath that purple block we gotta
 

989
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,269
underneath that purple block we gotta
keep that powered when the farm is off

990
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
keep that powered when the farm is off
 

991
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,189
keep that powered when the farm is off
so we got a redstone torch there just

992
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
so we got a redstone torch there just
 

993
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,670
so we got a redstone torch there just
for now and then it staircases down to

994
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
for now and then it staircases down to
 

995
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,949
for now and then it staircases down to
the hopper clock

996
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
the hopper clock
 

997
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,550
the hopper clock
keeps that powered so it's not running

998
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
keeps that powered so it's not running
 

999
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,790
keeps that powered so it's not running
wasting potions when the farm

1000
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
wasting potions when the farm
 

1001
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,829
wasting potions when the farm
is off right so once that line gets

1002
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
is off right so once that line gets
 

1003
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,629
is off right so once that line gets
unpowered the farm turns on basically

1004
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
unpowered the farm turns on basically
 

1005
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,910
unpowered the farm turns on basically
now this is the stinky part

1006
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
now this is the stinky part
 

1007
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,949
now this is the stinky part
i should have just killed all the

1008
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
i should have just killed all the
 

1009
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,790
i should have just killed all the
shockers and left that one because these

1010
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
shockers and left that one because these
 

1011
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,910
shockers and left that one because these
guys

1012
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920

platform with this guy

1102
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
platform with this guy
 

1103
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,190
platform with this guy
and uh now all the stray shelters should

1104
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
and uh now all the stray shelters should
 

1105
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,630
and uh now all the stray shelters should
be off of the boat there

1106
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
be off of the boat there
 

1107
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,710
be off of the boat there
cool so i think we got this main unit

1108
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
cool so i think we got this main unit
 

1109
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,470
cool so i think we got this main unit
finished this is what it's looking like

1110
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
finished this is what it's looking like
 

1111
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,909
finished this is what it's looking like
it's a bit uh pimply a little bit measly

1112
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
it's a bit uh pimply a little bit measly
 

1113
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,909
it's a bit uh pimply a little bit measly
but i think it should work fine we got

1114
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
but i think it should work fine we got
 

1115
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,430
but i think it should work fine we got
the hopper clock down below there i put

1116
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
the hopper clock down below there i put
 

1117
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,510
the hopper clock down below there i put
slabs underneath it so nothing can

1118
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
slabs underneath it so nothing can
 

1119
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,669
slabs underneath it so nothing can
teleport on the bottom of anything we've

1120
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
teleport on the bottom of anything we've
 

1121
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,789
teleport on the bottom of anything we've
built here

1122
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
built here
 

1123
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,230
built here
you can see even underneath here we got

1124
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
you can see even underneath here we got
 

1125
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,230
you can see even underneath here we got
buttons and stuff and rods

1126
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
buttons and stuff and rods
 

1127
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,950
buttons and stuff and rods
uh just so that every single surface is

1128
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
uh just so that every single surface is
 

1129
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,630
uh just so that every single surface is
covered and there's nowhere for them to

1130
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
covered and there's nowhere for them to
 

1131
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,470
covered and there's nowhere for them to
teleport wait a second missed one

1132
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
teleport wait a second missed one
 

1133
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,950
teleport wait a second missed one
uh so now the main thing that can

1134
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:44,960
uh so now the main thing that can
 

1135
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,590
uh so now the main thing that can
probably

1136
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
probably
 

1137
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,350
probably
wreck our farm is if it runs out of

1138
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
wreck our farm is if it runs out of
 

1139
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,270
wreck our farm is if it runs out of
potions while it's running

1140
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
potions while it's running
 

1141
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,710
potions while it's running
uh then this guy will stop getting

1142
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
uh then this guy will stop getting
 

1143
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,150
uh then this guy will stop getting
healed and he's gonna either kill

1144
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
healed and he's gonna either kill
 

1145
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,070
healed and he's gonna either kill
himself or teleport out of there

1146
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
himself or teleport out of there
 

1147
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,029
himself or teleport out of there
so we're adding a lock so when this

1148
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
so we're adding a lock so when this
 

1149
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,510
so we're adding a lock so when this
hopper runs out of potions

1150
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
hopper runs out of potions
 

1151
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,390
hopper runs out of potions
this torch turns on and then we're going

1152
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
this torch turns on and then we're going
 

1153
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,230
this torch turns on and then we're going
to send the signal to our on off switch

1154
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
to send the signal to our on off switch
 

1155
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,630
to send the signal to our on off switch
for the farm here

1156
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
for the farm here
 

1157
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,070
for the farm here
and that'll keep the farm shut down

1158
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
and that'll keep the farm shut down
 

1159
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,150
and that'll keep the farm shut down
okay so now we gotta figure out how and

1160
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
okay so now we gotta figure out how and
 

1161
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,990
okay so now we gotta figure out how and
where we're gonna build our platform for

1162
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
where we're gonna build our platform for
 

1163
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,510
where we're gonna build our platform for
these guys to teleport to

1164
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
these guys to teleport to
 

1165
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,110
these guys to teleport to
and according to the minecraft wiki like

1166
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
and according to the minecraft wiki like
 

1167
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,110
and according to the minecraft wiki like
we said before they check an eight block

1168
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
we said before they check an eight block
 

1169
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,390
we said before they check an eight block
area around them

1170
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
area around them
 

1171
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,029
area around them
when they duplicate and every shulker in

1172
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
when they duplicate and every shulker in
 

1173
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,029
when they duplicate and every shulker in
that area lowers the chance of it

1174
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
that area lowers the chance of it
 

1175
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,070
that area lowers the chance of it
happening

1176
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
happening
 

1177
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,310
happening
by twenty percent which is a big deal

1178
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
by twenty percent which is a big deal
 

1179
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,230
by twenty percent which is a big deal
that means we want this guy to teleport

1180
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
that means we want this guy to teleport
 

1181
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,549
that means we want this guy to teleport
outside of that eight block range

1182
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
outside of that eight block range
 

1183
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,070
outside of that eight block range
it's also why we're buttoning everything

1184
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
it's also why we're buttoning everything
 

1185
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,310
it's also why we're buttoning everything
so no shulkers will be within that eight

1186
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
so no shulkers will be within that eight
 

1187
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,510
so no shulkers will be within that eight
block range

1188
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
block range
 

1189
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,110
block range
so he's there one block two blocks

1190
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
so he's there one block two blocks
 

1191
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,590
so he's there one block two blocks
three blocks i think this is four five

1192
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
three blocks i think this is four five
 

1193
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,470
three blocks i think this is four five
six seven

1194
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
six seven
 

1195
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,029
six seven
eight one more for good measure i don't

1196
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
eight one more for good measure i don't
 

1197
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,390
eight one more for good measure i don't
know

1198
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
know
 

1199
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,950
know
i think over here is where we want our

1200
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
i think over here is where we want our
 

1201
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,750
i think over here is where we want our
platform

1202
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
platform
 

1203
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,190
platform
if i didn't misunderstand anything here

1204
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
if i didn't misunderstand anything here
 

1205
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,669
if i didn't misunderstand anything here
and they can teleport up to 17 blocks if

1206
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
and they can teleport up to 17 blocks if
 

1207
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,549
and they can teleport up to 17 blocks if
i understand right

1208
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
i understand right
 

1209
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,669
i understand right
so we might need to build multiple

1210
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
so we might need to build multiple
 

1211
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,029
so we might need to build multiple
platforms as the other thing so when

1212
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
platforms as the other thing so when
 

1213
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,029
platforms as the other thing so when
they teleport they try four times if

1214
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
they teleport they try four times if
 

1215
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,149
they teleport they try four times if
they don't find a spot

1216
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
they don't find a spot
 

1217
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,270
they don't find a spot
it fails which means the more

1218
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
it fails which means the more
 

1219
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,950
it fails which means the more
area they have to teleport to the more

1220
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
area they have to teleport to the more
 

1221
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,710
area they have to teleport to the more
likely it will succeed

1222
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720
likely it will succeed
 

1223
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,310
likely it will succeed
and the more likely when the shulker

1224
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
and the more likely when the shulker
 

1225
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,630
and the more likely when the shulker
shoots himself he'll duplicate and the

1226
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
shoots himself he'll duplicate and the
 

1227
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,510
shoots himself he'll duplicate and the
farm will run

1228
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
farm will run
 

1229
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,390
farm will run
faster so i don't know if one platform

1230
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
faster so i don't know if one platform
 

1231
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,230
faster so i don't know if one platform
is enough to make this run at

1232
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
is enough to make this run at
 

1233
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,549
is enough to make this run at
the optimal rate i don't know if we're

1234
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
the optimal rate i don't know if we're
 

1235
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,070
the optimal rate i don't know if we're
even going to aim for the optimal rate

1236
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
even going to aim for the optimal rate
 

1237
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,350
even going to aim for the optimal rate
because it's a single player

1238
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
because it's a single player
 

1239
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,110
because it's a single player
and i don't really care about getting

1240
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
and i don't really care about getting
 

1241
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,029
and i don't really care about getting
thousands of shulkers

1242
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
thousands of shulkers
 

1243
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,950
thousands of shulkers
i just need a few stacks you know oh

1244
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
i just need a few stacks you know oh
 

1245
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,950
i just need a few stacks you know oh
snap okay my reading comprehension

1246
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
snap okay my reading comprehension
 

1247
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,470
snap okay my reading comprehension
skills might not be the best i was like

1248
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
skills might not be the best i was like
 

1249
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,750
skills might not be the best i was like
laying out the platform here and it's

1250
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
laying out the platform here and it's
 

1251
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,190
laying out the platform here and it's
like there's no way

1252
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
like there's no way
 

1253
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,789
like there's no way
they can teleport this big of an area

1254
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
they can teleport this big of an area
 

1255
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,110
they can teleport this big of an area
right this is a 17 block radius

1256
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
right this is a 17 block radius
 

1257
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,789
right this is a 17 block radius
so i double check the wiki and it says

1258
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
so i double check the wiki and it says
 

1259
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,190
so i double check the wiki and it says
it's 17 by 17 by 17

1260
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
it's 17 by 17 by 17
 

1261
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,470
it's 17 by 17 by 17
centered on the shop here

1262
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
centered on the shop here
 

1263
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,549
centered on the shop here
which means diameter uh in other words

1264
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
which means diameter uh in other words
 

1265
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,669
which means diameter uh in other words
i don't know if they're even gonna be

1266
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
i don't know if they're even gonna be
 

1267
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,870
i don't know if they're even gonna be
able to teleport that far up there

1268
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
able to teleport that far up there
 

1269
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,310
able to teleport that far up there
because that's like at the ninth block

1270
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
because that's like at the ninth block
 

1271
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,990
because that's like at the ninth block
and they might only be able to teleport

1272
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
and they might only be able to teleport
 

1273
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,870
and they might only be able to teleport
eight blocks

1274
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
eight blocks
 

1275
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,149
eight blocks
which means they'll be within range

1276
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
which means they'll be within range
 

1277
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,110
which means they'll be within range
of the 20 failure thing or whatever i

1278
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
of the 20 failure thing or whatever i
 

1279
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,590
of the 20 failure thing or whatever i
don't know

1280
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
don't know
 

1281
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,110
don't know
we just got to try this out and see what

1282
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
we just got to try this out and see what
 

1283
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,549
we just got to try this out and see what
happens because i'm at the point where

1284
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
happens because i'm at the point where
 

1285
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,190
happens because i'm at the point where
i'm not quite sure on a couple things

1286
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
i'm not quite sure on a couple things
 

1287
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,190
i'm not quite sure on a couple things
now this is where the farm is very

1288
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
now this is where the farm is very
 

1289
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,230
now this is where the farm is very
likely to break first time testing it

1290
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
likely to break first time testing it
 

1291
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,470
likely to break first time testing it
we can only run it for a couple seconds

1292
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
we can only run it for a couple seconds
 

1293
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,830
we can only run it for a couple seconds
here and we're gonna run out of potions

1294
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
here and we're gonna run out of potions
 

1295
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,510
here and we're gonna run out of potions
but we'll see

1296
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
but we'll see
 

1297
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,510
but we'll see
what happens with this

1298
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520

 

1299
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,909

oh man please don't die please don't die

1300
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919

 

1301
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,070

see if anybody's appearing up here

1302
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080

 

1303
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,950

not looking good oh no

1304
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960

 

1305
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,830

all right i think we should shut it down

1306
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
all right i think we should shut it down
 

1307
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,710
all right i think we should shut it down
yeah i think we got to build the

1308
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
yeah i think we got to build the
 

1309
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,909
yeah i think we got to build the
platform closer

1310
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919

 

1311
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,270

shut her down now he's going to keep

1312
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
shut her down now he's going to keep
 

1313
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,789
shut her down now he's going to keep
shooting for a bit i think hopefully

1314
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
shooting for a bit i think hopefully
 

1315
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,070
shooting for a bit i think hopefully
he's got enough health where he doesn't

1316
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
he's got enough health where he doesn't
 

1317
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,669
he's got enough health where he doesn't
kill himself

1318
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
kill himself
 

1319
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,830

he can't get him there now he gave up
 

1325
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,990
he can't get him there now he gave up
okay good

1326
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000

so we didn't get anybody
 

1329
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,350
so we didn't get anybody
right yeah nobody up here test number

1330
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
right yeah nobody up here test number
 

1331
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,110
right yeah nobody up here test number
two all right so we lowered the platform

1332
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
two all right so we lowered the platform
 

1333
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,029
two all right so we lowered the platform
here by block we filled it out this is

1334
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,039
here by block we filled it out this is
 

1335
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,190
here by block we filled it out this is
the full 17 by 17 area

1336
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
the full 17 by 17 area
 

1337
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,430
the full 17 by 17 area
and it should be on the very edge of the

1338
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
and it should be on the very edge of the
 

1339
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,230
and it should be on the very edge of the
17

1340
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
17
 

1341
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,270
17
cuboid target we need to reach here so

1342
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
cuboid target we need to reach here so
 

1343
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,870
cuboid target we need to reach here so
they should be able to teleport up there

1344
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
they should be able to teleport up there
 

1345
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,990
they should be able to teleport up there
now

1346
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
now
 

1347
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,230
now
uh we got a couple things to check out

1348
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
uh we got a couple things to check out
 

1349
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,830
uh we got a couple things to check out
first just to make sure that actually

1350
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
first just to make sure that actually
 

1351
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,270
first just to make sure that actually
happens

1352
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
happens
 

1353
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,350
happens
check if this guy somehow can still kill

1354
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
check if this guy somehow can still kill
 

1355
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,950
check if this guy somehow can still kill
himself

1356
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
himself
 

1357
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,190
himself
we gotta check if uh oh i heard a

1358
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
we gotta check if uh oh i heard a
 

1359
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,710
we gotta check if uh oh i heard a
teleport

1360
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
teleport
 

1361
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,710
teleport
we gotta check if more than five guys

1362
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
we gotta check if more than five guys
 

1363
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,549
we gotta check if more than five guys
can spawn up here

1364
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559
can spawn up here
 

1365
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,070
can spawn up here
or if they're preventing more from

1366
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
or if they're preventing more from
 

1367
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,149
or if they're preventing more from
spawning

1368
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
spawning
 

1369
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,549
spawning
we gotta see the rates of this so far we

1370
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
we gotta see the rates of this so far we
 

1371
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,710
we gotta see the rates of this so far we
only got one

1372
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
only got one
 

1373
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,310
only got one
so this guy's gonna be aiming at the

1374
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
so this guy's gonna be aiming at the
 

1375
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,149
so this guy's gonna be aiming at the
snow golem actually which is interesting

1376
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
snow golem actually which is interesting
 

1377
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,669
snow golem actually which is interesting
now i think you switched targets to me

1378
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
now i think you switched targets to me
 

1379
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,390
now i think you switched targets to me
yep

1380
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
yep
 

1381
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,430
yep
move uh up these shots though we're at

1382
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
move uh up these shots though we're at
 

1383
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,789
move uh up these shots though we're at
the snow going

1384
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799

 

1385
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,669

did he die is he still there you still

1386
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
did he die is he still there you still
 

1387
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,149
did he die is he still there you still
alive

1388
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
alive
 

1389
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,230
alive
okay that's good oh yeah we gotta double

1390
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
okay that's good oh yeah we gotta double
 

1391
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,590
okay that's good oh yeah we gotta double
check that the farm will actually shut

1392
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
check that the farm will actually shut
 

1393
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,870
check that the farm will actually shut
down when it runs out of potions because

1394
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
down when it runs out of potions because
 

1395
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,590
down when it runs out of potions because
oh we got another one okay still got a

1396
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
oh we got another one okay still got a
 

1397
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,270
oh we got another one okay still got a
few left there but yeah the rates

1398
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
few left there but yeah the rates
 

1399
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,950
few left there but yeah the rates
aren't the greatest we might need more

1400
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
aren't the greatest we might need more
 

1401
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,270
aren't the greatest we might need more
platforms to increase the area

1402
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
platforms to increase the area
 

1403
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,630
platforms to increase the area
okay he's still shooting now he's

1404
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
okay he's still shooting now he's
 

1405
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,270

1407
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,789
stopped okay he's good he's good
so we got to build an auto brewer here

1408
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
so we got to build an auto brewer here
 

1409
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,310
so we got to build an auto brewer here
yeah it's out of potions

1410
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
yeah it's out of potions
 

1411
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,830
yeah it's out of potions
i think we should test that just a

1412
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:33,840
i think we should test that just a
 

1413
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,990
i think we should test that just a
little bit longer before we commit on

1414
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
little bit longer before we commit on
 

1415
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,430
little bit longer before we commit on
how we're gonna do the platform and the

1416
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
how we're gonna do the platform and the
 

1417
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,350
how we're gonna do the platform and the
auto brewer and all that stuff so

1418
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
auto brewer and all that stuff so
 

1419
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,029
auto brewer and all that stuff so
we got the lab running right now and

1420
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
we got the lab running right now and
 

1421
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,549
we got the lab running right now and
we're gonna just do one more manual

1422
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
we're gonna just do one more manual
 

1423
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,190
we're gonna just do one more manual
refill

1424
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
refill
 

1425
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,710
refill
and good stuff all right so we got this

1426
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
and good stuff all right so we got this
 

1427
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,230
and good stuff all right so we got this
topped off with potions we can run it

1428
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
topped off with potions we can run it
 

1429
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,350
topped off with potions we can run it
for a bit longer

1430
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
for a bit longer
 

1431
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,750
for a bit longer
and see how things go here but i want to

1432
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
and see how things go here but i want to
 

1433
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,190
and see how things go here but i want to
try one more thing here

1434
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
try one more thing here
 

1435
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,029
try one more thing here
so i gotta admit i didn't know shocker

1436
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
so i gotta admit i didn't know shocker
 

1437
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,350
so i gotta admit i didn't know shocker
frenzy was a thing before today even

frenzy was a thing before today even
 

1439
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,750
frenzy was a thing before today even
that's new to me uh i'm wondering if

1440
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
that's new to me uh i'm wondering if
 

1441
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,269
that's new to me uh i'm wondering if
those guys are far enough away where

1442

see the shocker he's gonna be
standing right here when it's opened he

1502
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
standing right here when it's opened he
 

1503
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,750
standing right here when it's opened he
should be able to peek through that i

1504
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
should be able to peek through that i
 

1505

okay i'm gonna put a block above the
 

1511
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,149
okay i'm gonna put a block above the
trap door that's gonna be our new on off

though i'm surprised this guy hasn't

1520
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
though i'm surprised this guy hasn't
 

1521
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,110
though i'm surprised this guy hasn't
had any problems like he hasn't

1522
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
had any problems like he hasn't
 

1523
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,110
had any problems like he hasn't
teleported out of there he hasn't died

1524
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
teleported out of there he hasn't died
 

1525
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,789
teleported out of there he hasn't died
i built it near the fortress here

1526
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
i built it near the fortress here
 

1527
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,870
i built it near the fortress here
because i i wanted some backups nearby

1528
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
because i i wanted some backups nearby
 

1529
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,630
because i i wanted some backups nearby
because i thought for sure

1530
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
because i thought for sure
 

1531
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,070
because i thought for sure
like if anything was to go wrong it

1532
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
like if anything was to go wrong it
 

1533
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,470
like if anything was to go wrong it
would be that guy disappearing on us

1534
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
would be that guy disappearing on us
 

1535
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,350
would be that guy disappearing on us
which might still happen we'll see but

1536
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
which might still happen we'll see but
 

1537
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,190
which might still happen we'll see but
essentially what we've done here

1538
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
essentially what we've done here
 

1539
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,990
essentially what we've done here
oh i thought he had to just teleport

1540
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
oh i thought he had to just teleport
 

1541
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,630
oh i thought he had to just teleport
he's fine

1542
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
he's fine
 

1543
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,310
he's fine
he duplicated what we've done is we've

1544
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,320
he duplicated what we've done is we've
 

1545
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,549
he duplicated what we've done is we've
narrowed the gap there where the bullet

1546
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559
narrowed the gap there where the bullet
 

1547
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,390
narrowed the gap there where the bullet
can actually squeeze through

1548
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
can actually squeeze through
 

1549
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,310
can actually squeeze through
so now it should be nearly impossible

1550
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
so now it should be nearly impossible
 

1551
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,510
so now it should be nearly impossible
right

1552
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520
right
 

1553
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,510
right
like it's really it's really launching

1554
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
like it's really it's really launching
 

1555
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,269
like it's really it's really launching
up now not even close to getting through

1556
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
up now not even close to getting through
 

1557
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,750
up now not even close to getting through
that

1558
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760

 

1559
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,110

how are we doing oh we got another

1560
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
how are we doing oh we got another
 

1561
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,029
how are we doing oh we got another
duplication so we got probably four or

1562
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
duplication so we got probably four or
 

1563
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,750
duplication so we got probably four or
five guys up there now

1564
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
five guys up there now
 

1565
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,350
five guys up there now
i'm trying to see if we can get past the

1566
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
i'm trying to see if we can get past the
 

1567
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,669
i'm trying to see if we can get past the
five point first five the limit

1568
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679

 

1569
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,390

oh he didn't make another one wait a

1570
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
oh he didn't make another one wait a
 

1571
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,830
oh he didn't make another one wait a
second

1572
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
second
 

1573
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,870
second
i thought we were at the cap there

1574
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880

 

1575
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,310

oh it's still going

1576
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320

 

1577

1601
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,070
leave him for a second
no and the golem died what

1602
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080

 

1603
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,029

oh no this is not working guys so i'm

1604
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
oh no this is not working guys so i'm
 

1605
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,149
oh no this is not working guys so i'm
guessing what happened there

1606
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:00,159
guessing what happened there
 

1607
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,230
guessing what happened there
is the farm ran out of potions and then

1608
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
is the farm ran out of potions and then
 

1609
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,470
is the farm ran out of potions and then
it like went into shutdown

1610
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,480
it like went into shutdown
 

1611
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,230
it like went into shutdown
but he kept shooting like two or three

1612
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,240
but he kept shooting like two or three
 

1613
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,149
but he kept shooting like two or three
more times after it was shut down like

1614
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
more times after it was shut down like
 

1615
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,590
more times after it was shut down like
like they do it takes like five seconds

1616
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:09,600
like they do it takes like five seconds
 

1617
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,269
like they do it takes like five seconds
for them to stop shooting

1618
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
for them to stop shooting
 

1619
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,870
for them to stop shooting
probably hit himself every single time

1620
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
probably hit himself every single time
 

1621
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,990
probably hit himself every single time
and then just got unlucky with it

1622
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,000
and then just got unlucky with it
 

1623
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,269
and then just got unlucky with it
uh and he he probably teleported up here

1624
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
uh and he he probably teleported up here
 

1625
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,350
uh and he he probably teleported up here
or something i don't know

1626
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
or something i don't know
 

1627
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,750
or something i don't know
that's my guess here's my plan so i've

1628
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
that's my guess here's my plan so i've
 

1629
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,269
that's my guess here's my plan so i've
got slabs underneath here

1630
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
got slabs underneath here
 

1631
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,789
got slabs underneath here
slabs above

1632
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799

 

1633
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,389

what happens when we try to get him out

1634
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
what happens when we try to get him out
 

1635
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,909
what happens when we try to get him out
of the boat now it's too far from the

1636
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
of the boat now it's too far from the
 

1637
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,669
of the boat now it's too far from the
teleport up here

1638
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:33,679
teleport up here

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
what oh he teleported to the shocker and
 

1703
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,310
what oh he teleported to the shocker and
i think he went up to the top there

1704
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
i think he went up to the top there
 

1705
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,750
i think he went up to the top there
all right we had a bit of a hiccup there

1706
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
all right we had a bit of a hiccup there
 

1707
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,590
all right we had a bit of a hiccup there
but we got the guy back inside and it

1708
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
but we got the guy back inside and it
 

1709
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,149
but we got the guy back inside and it
wasn't

1710
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:16,159
wasn't
 

1711
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,750
wasn't
actually all that difficult so as long

1712
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
actually all that difficult so as long
 

1713
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,350
actually all that difficult so as long
as we just like

1714
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
as we just like
 

1715
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,269
as we just like
bring a shocker down here and like break

1716
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
bring a shocker down here and like break
 

1717
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,350
bring a shocker down here and like break
them out of a boat or a mine cart

1718
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
them out of a boat or a mine cart
 

1719
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,389
them out of a boat or a mine cart
then uh they'll be forced to go in there

1720
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
then uh they'll be forced to go in there
 

1721
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,590
then uh they'll be forced to go in there
so that's not too too big of an issue uh

1722
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
so that's not too too big of an issue uh
 

1723
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,190
so that's not too too big of an issue uh
we're gonna move on with this

1724
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
we're gonna move on with this
 

1725
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,830
we're gonna move on with this
i haven't given up don't worry uh i

1726
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
i haven't given up don't worry uh i
 

1727
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,909
i haven't given up don't worry uh i
don't know how to solve the golem

1728
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
don't know how to solve the golem
 

1729
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,430
don't know how to solve the golem
dying problem i don't know what's

1730
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
dying problem i don't know what's
 

1731
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,190
dying problem i don't know what's
causing it exactly we just gotta run the

1732
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
causing it exactly we just gotta run the
 

1733
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,070
causing it exactly we just gotta run the
farm longer to

1734
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
farm longer to
 

1735
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,310
farm longer to
see which means we should really need

1736
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
see which means we should really need
 

1737
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,990
see which means we should really need
that auto brewer set up

1738
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
that auto brewer set up
 

1739
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,549
that auto brewer set up
and stuff uh but what i'm working on

1740
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:46,559
and stuff uh but what i'm working on
 

1741
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,029
and stuff uh but what i'm working on
right now

1742
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:47,039
right now
 

1743
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,950
right now
is the collection system so i think this

1744
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
is the collection system so i think this
 

1745
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,430
is the collection system so i think this
is how we're gonna do the track

1746
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440
is how we're gonna do the track
 

1747
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,950
is how we're gonna do the track
let's run it like this and basically

1748
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
let's run it like this and basically
 

1749
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,269
let's run it like this and basically
we'll send a minecart down here it'll go

1750
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:57,279
we'll send a minecart down here it'll go
 

1751
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,870
we'll send a minecart down here it'll go
zip around

1752
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,880
zip around
 

1753
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,389
zip around
and be able to pick up from all these

1754
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
and be able to pick up from all these
 

1755
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,990
and be able to pick up from all these
squares i think

1756
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
squares i think
 

1757
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,750
squares i think
and then it will exit over here and

1758
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
and then it will exit over here and
 

1759
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,510
and then it will exit over here and
either go down a layer if we want to add

1760
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
either go down a layer if we want to add
 

1761
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,710
either go down a layer if we want to add
more layers

1762
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
more layers
 

1763
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,190
more layers
or it's gonna go into our water killing

1764
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
or it's gonna go into our water killing
 

1765
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,870
or it's gonna go into our water killing
chamber probably

1766
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
chamber probably
 

1767
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,950
chamber probably
uh what i'm trying to decide is do i

1768
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
uh what i'm trying to decide is do i
 

1769
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,789
uh what i'm trying to decide is do i
want to

1770
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
want to
 

1771
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,470
want to
cover this because i don't like them

1772
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
cover this because i don't like them
 

1773
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,909
cover this because i don't like them
shooting at me

1774
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:17,919
shooting at me
 

1775
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,630
shooting at me
it's not that fun uh we might like go up

1776
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
it's not that fun uh we might like go up
 

1777
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,029
it's not that fun uh we might like go up
like

1778
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
like
 

1779
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,510
like
that and maybe a slab on top like that

1780
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,520
that and maybe a slab on top like that
 

1781
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,149
that and maybe a slab on top like that
and like do a 17x17 they won't be able

1782
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:28,159
and like do a 17x17 they won't be able
 

1783
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,269
and like do a 17x17 they won't be able
to teleport

1784
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
to teleport
 

1785
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,789
to teleport
under this or above it and then

1786
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
under this or above it and then
 

1787
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,630
under this or above it and then
we could maybe have trapped doors on the

1788
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
we could maybe have trapped doors on the
 

1789
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,909
we could maybe have trapped doors on the
side here i don't want them to be able

1790
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
side here i don't want them to be able
 

1791
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,149
side here i don't want them to be able
to stick to anything right so we gotta

1792
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
to stick to anything right so we gotta
 

1793
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,669
to stick to anything right so we gotta
build out of stuff they can't stick to

1794
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
build out of stuff they can't stick to
 

1795
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,310
build out of stuff they can't stick to
so we might do something like yeah like

1796
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
so we might do something like yeah like
 

1797
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,789
so we might do something like yeah like
this

1798
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
this
 

1799
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,630
this
that would have to go up three blocks i

1800
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:46,640
that would have to go up three blocks i
 

1801
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,990
that would have to go up three blocks i
guess

1802
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
guess
 

1803
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,470
guess
and then this will meet up with it here

1804
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480

 

1805
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,470

uh-huh okay i think this is a good

1806
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
uh-huh okay i think this is a good
 

1807
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,830
uh-huh okay i think this is a good
improvement so they shouldn't be able to

1808
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:55,840
improvement so they shouldn't be able to
 

1809
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,509
improvement so they shouldn't be able to
shoot out of here randomly anymore like

1810
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:57,519
shoot out of here randomly anymore like
 

1811
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,789
shoot out of here randomly anymore like
they were before

1812
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
they were before
 

1813
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,070
they were before
uh they were always trying to hit the

1814
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,080
uh they were always trying to hit the
 

1815
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,750
uh they were always trying to hit the
snow golem after they would teleport and

1816
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
snow golem after they would teleport and
 

1817
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,190
snow golem after they would teleport and
the shots were just like flying

1818
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
the shots were just like flying
 

1819
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,470
the shots were just like flying
everywhere all right we got our

1820
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
everywhere all right we got our
 

1821
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,830
everywhere all right we got our
collection system set up

1822
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
collection system set up
 

1823
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,630
collection system set up
next comes the killing system for

1824
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
next comes the killing system for
 

1825
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,149
next comes the killing system for
getting rid of the shulkers collecting

1826
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
getting rid of the shulkers collecting
 

1827
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,269
getting rid of the shulkers collecting
their drops

1828
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
their drops
 

1829
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,029
their drops
and i think i got a great idea now

1830
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
and i think i got a great idea now
 

1831
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,110
and i think i got a great idea now
actually i thought about it some more

1832
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
actually i thought about it some more
 

1833
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,190
actually i thought about it some more
we're gonna call this the conveyor of

1834
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
we're gonna call this the conveyor of
 

1835
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,269
we're gonna call this the conveyor of
death

1836
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
death
 

1837
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,950
death
i think this is a really clever idea

1838
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:20,960
i think this is a really clever idea
 

1839
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,870
i think this is a really clever idea
actually so instead of doing a vertical

1840
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
actually so instead of doing a vertical
 

1841
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,950
actually so instead of doing a vertical
water column that we drown them in and

1842
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
water column that we drown them in and
 

1843
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,310
water column that we drown them in and
like having to

1844
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
like having to
 

1845
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,830
like having to
bring them up and then drop them down

1846
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840
bring them up and then drop them down
 

1847
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,909
bring them up and then drop them down
into the water and like have redstone to

1848
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
into the water and like have redstone to
 

1849
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,389
into the water and like have redstone to
control the timings on everything and

1850
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
control the timings on everything and
 

1851
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,110
control the timings on everything and
all that stuff i came up with an idea

1852
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
all that stuff i came up with an idea
 

1853
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,590
all that stuff i came up with an idea
here that

1854
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,600
here that
 

1855
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,190
here that
should be fully automatic doesn't

1856
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
should be fully automatic doesn't
 

1857
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,630
should be fully automatic doesn't
require redstone

1858
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
require redstone
 

1859
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,509
require redstone
takes very little space it's horizontal

1860
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:41,519
takes very little space it's horizontal
 

1861
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,789
takes very little space it's horizontal
instead of vertical

1862
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,799
instead of vertical
 

1863
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,110
instead of vertical
and just basically better in every way

1864
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
and just basically better in every way
 

1865
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,430
and just basically better in every way
so that's the plan i'm gonna put up a

1866
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
so that's the plan i'm gonna put up a
 

1867
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,789
so that's the plan i'm gonna put up a
glass wall here

1868
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:50,799
glass wall here
 

1869
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,789
glass wall here
actually we probably need more hoppers

1870
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
actually we probably need more hoppers
 

1871
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,310
actually we probably need more hoppers
so the idea is we're gonna have hoppers

1872
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
so the idea is we're gonna have hoppers
 

1873
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,110
so the idea is we're gonna have hoppers
under all these slabs

1874
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
under all these slabs
 

1875
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,710
under all these slabs
where did we leave off right over there

1876
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
where did we leave off right over there
 

1877
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,190
where did we leave off right over there
yeah then we will

1878
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
yeah then we will
 

1879
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,870
yeah then we will
careful i don't accidentally drop myself

1880
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
careful i don't accidentally drop myself
 

1881
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,230
careful i don't accidentally drop myself
down there

1882
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,240
down there
 

1883
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,350
down there
and we'll have like a big chain of

1884
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,360
and we'll have like a big chain of
 

1885
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,190
and we'll have like a big chain of
hoppers going along the whole thing here

1886
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,200
hoppers going along the whole thing here
 

1887
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,549
hoppers going along the whole thing here
so those hoppers are going to pick up

1888
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
so those hoppers are going to pick up
 

1889
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,389
so those hoppers are going to pick up
the shocker shells that drop and we're

1890
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399
the shocker shells that drop and we're
 

1891
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,750
the shocker shells that drop and we're
going to have a nice window here for

1892
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
going to have a nice window here for
 

1893
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,590
going to have a nice window here for
viewing the action

1894
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
viewing the action
 

1895
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,070
viewing the action
what we'll do is set up uh what are we

1896
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
what we'll do is set up uh what are we
 

1897
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,710
what we'll do is set up uh what are we
gonna do here we're gonna get a sign

1898
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
gonna do here we're gonna get a sign
 

1899
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,750
gonna do here we're gonna get a sign
just to stop the water over at the end

1900
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
just to stop the water over at the end
 

1901
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,070
just to stop the water over at the end
we'll have one water source down here

1902
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
we'll have one water source down here
 

1903
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,630
we'll have one water source down here
this is gonna travel i think five blocks

1904
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
this is gonna travel i think five blocks
 

1905
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,470
this is gonna travel i think five blocks
yeah and then we'll have one more at

1906
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
yeah and then we'll have one more at
 

1907
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,070
yeah and then we'll have one more at
this end

1908
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
this end
 

1909
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,110
this end
this should go eight yeah i'll overlap

1910
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,120
this should go eight yeah i'll overlap
 

1911
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,710
this should go eight yeah i'll overlap
the other one there

1912
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
the other one there
 

1913
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,230
the other one there
and i think i want one more slab

1914
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
and i think i want one more slab
 

1915
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,549
and i think i want one more slab
here all right here it comes and it

1916
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:40,559
here all right here it comes and it
 

1917
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,430
here all right here it comes and it
falls down

1918
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
falls down
 

1919
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,430
falls down
and it's going to glide along the water

1920
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
and it's going to glide along the water
 

1921
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,110
and it's going to glide along the water
very slowly

1922
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
very slowly
 

1923
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,710
very slowly
and i time this in creative it's going

1924
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
and i time this in creative it's going
 

1925
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,789
and i time this in creative it's going
to be just enough time where a shulker

1926
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
to be just enough time where a shulker
 

1927
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,230
to be just enough time where a shulker
at full life

1928
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,240
at full life
 

1929
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,909
at full life
will drown by the time it gets the end

1930
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
will drown by the time it gets the end
 

1931
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,830
will drown by the time it gets the end
of the conveyor of death here

1932
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
of the conveyor of death here
 

1933
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,269
of the conveyor of death here
and it kind of self regulates the

1934
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
and it kind of self regulates the
 

1935
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,950
and it kind of self regulates the
timings on the mine carts and everything

1936
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
timings on the mine carts and everything
 

1937
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,149
timings on the mine carts and everything
we're gonna have a bunch of mine carts

1938
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
we're gonna have a bunch of mine carts
 

1939
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,669
we're gonna have a bunch of mine carts
going through here

1940
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
going through here
 

1941
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,350
going through here
shelters will die they'll drop their

1942
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,360
shelters will die they'll drop their
 

1943
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,230
shelters will die they'll drop their
shells hoppers will pick them up

1944
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
shells hoppers will pick them up
 

1945
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,669
shells hoppers will pick them up
and then when it gets to the very end it

1946
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
and then when it gets to the very end it
 

1947
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,590
and then when it gets to the very end it
just continues on its cycle

1948
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
just continues on its cycle
 

1949
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,909
just continues on its cycle
and picks up the next chalkers that

1950
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:09,919
and picks up the next chalkers that
 

1951
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,750
and picks up the next chalkers that
might spawn in the room there

1952
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
might spawn in the room there
 

1953
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,789
might spawn in the room there
right does this work please

1954
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:14,799
right does this work please
 

1955
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,070
right does this work please
there's a hopper at the very bottom

1956
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
there's a hopper at the very bottom
 

1957
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,070
there's a hopper at the very bottom
there too yeah it's gonna go and

1958
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
there too yeah it's gonna go and
 

1959
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,590
there too yeah it's gonna go and
pick up another one if there are any if

1960
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
pick up another one if there are any if
 

1961
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,430
pick up another one if there are any if
there aren't it doesn't matter it'll do

1962
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
there aren't it doesn't matter it'll do
 

1963
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,470
there aren't it doesn't matter it'll do
the cycle anyway

1964
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
the cycle anyway
 

1965
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,789
the cycle anyway
so unfortunately i have spent a ton of

1966
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
so unfortunately i have spent a ton of
 

1967
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,070
so unfortunately i have spent a ton of
time on this and we're running out of

1968
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
time on this and we're running out of
 

1969
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,830
time on this and we're running out of
time in the episode so we need to think

1970
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:27,840
time in the episode so we need to think
 

1971
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,149
time in the episode so we need to think
about

1972
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
about
 

1973
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,630
about
wrapping up for today which means we

1974
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
wrapping up for today which means we
 

1975
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,990
wrapping up for today which means we
probably can't get around to making the

1976
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,000
probably can't get around to making the
 

1977
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,070
probably can't get around to making the
auto brew of this episode

1978
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
auto brew of this episode
 

1979
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,750
auto brew of this episode
but i did go for another load to fill

1980
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
but i did go for another load to fill
 

1981
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,430
but i did go for another load to fill
this up we can test it out one more time

1982
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440
this up we can test it out one more time
 

1983
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,190
this up we can test it out one more time
here i got a couple more on me if we

1984
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
here i got a couple more on me if we
 

1985
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,669
here i got a couple more on me if we
need

1986
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
need
 

1987
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,230
need
if we need more um i'm gonna put just

1988
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
if we need more um i'm gonna put just
 

1989
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,909
if we need more um i'm gonna put just
four items in that hopper clock that

1990
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:43,919
four items in that hopper clock that
 

1991
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,909
four items in that hopper clock that
means the guy will heal faster

1992
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:45,919
means the guy will heal faster
 

1993
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,070
means the guy will heal faster
hopefully that solves him teleporting

1994
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,080
hopefully that solves him teleporting
 

1995
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,269
hopefully that solves him teleporting
out of their issue

1996
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:49,279
out of their issue
 

1997
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,430
out of their issue
can't figure out the snow golem one just

1998
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
can't figure out the snow golem one just
 

1999
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,310
can't figure out the snow golem one just
yet

2000
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,320
yet
 

2001
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,230
yet
um and we want to test all this other

2002
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,240
um and we want to test all this other
 

2003
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,830
um and we want to test all this other
stuff we've built so let's get it

2004
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:55,840
stuff we've built so let's get it
 

2005
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,350
stuff we've built so let's get it
running

2006
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
running
 

2007
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,350
running
and hopefully things go smoothly here

2008
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360

 

2009
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,710

like i don't get how he could shoot the

2010
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:02,720
like i don't get how he could shoot the
 

2011
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,470
like i don't get how he could shoot the
snow golem right

2012
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
snow golem right
 

2013
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,869
snow golem right
am i crazy should be impossible

2014
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:08,879

 

2015
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,389

but he did it somehow

2016
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:12,399

 

2017
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,030

okay he's in himself good stuff good

2018
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
okay he's in himself good stuff good
 

2019
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,869
okay he's in himself good stuff good
stuff

2020
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:16,879
stuff
 

2021
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,869
stuff
and again we might need more layers i'm

2022
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
and again we might need more layers i'm
 

2023
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,869
and again we might need more layers i'm
not sure

2024
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879

 

2025
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,629

because he hasn't created a single guy

2026
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
because he hasn't created a single guy
 

2027
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,990
because he hasn't created a single guy
yet i don't think let's go up there and

2028
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,000
yet i don't think let's go up there and
 

2029
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,349
yet i don't think let's go up there and
just check

2030
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:27,359
just check
 

2031
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,710
just check
what's going on so i think this is going

2032
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:28,720
what's going on so i think this is going
 

2033
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,869
what's going on so i think this is going
to be our spot where we are oh there's a

2034
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
to be our spot where we are oh there's a
 

2035
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,069
to be our spot where we are oh there's a
guy in there okay

2036
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:32,079
guy in there okay
 

2037
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,710
guy in there okay
you should get picked up yeah you got

2038
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720

awesome awesome okay and here he comes
 

2043
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,589
awesome awesome okay and here he comes
and now we can watch him suffer

2044
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
and now we can watch him suffer
 

2045
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,669
and now we can watch him suffer
uh he's not shooting i wasn't sure if he

2046
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
uh he's not shooting i wasn't sure if he
 

2047
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,869
uh he's not shooting i wasn't sure if he
was gonna shoot or not when he was in

2048
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
was gonna shoot or not when he was in
 

2049
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,990
was gonna shoot or not when he was in
there it looks like he stopped

2050
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
there it looks like he stopped
 

2051
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,909
there it looks like he stopped
shooting that's good

2052
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
shooting that's good
 

2053
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,349
shooting that's good
any more guys in there oh yeah here it

2054
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
any more guys in there oh yeah here it
 

2055
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,230
any more guys in there oh yeah here it
goes so he's starting to take

2056
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
goes so he's starting to take
 

2057
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,910
goes so he's starting to take
suffocation damage so it takes quite a

2058
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
suffocation damage so it takes quite a
 

2059
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,030
suffocation damage so it takes quite a
bit of time like he's got to be in the

2060
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
bit of time like he's got to be in the
 

2061
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,390
bit of time like he's got to be in the
water a long time

2062
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,400
water a long time
 

2063
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,589
water a long time
and if we tried to do that with a

2064
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:01,599
and if we tried to do that with a
 

2065
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,670
and if we tried to do that with a
vertical column of water

2066
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:03,680
vertical column of water
 

2067
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,430
vertical column of water
we would need like hundreds of blocks

2068
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
we would need like hundreds of blocks
 

2069
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,710
we would need like hundreds of blocks
probably of

2070
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
probably of
 

2071
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,750
probably of
vertical water so he died there

2072
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
vertical water so he died there
 

2073
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,750
vertical water so he died there
and i don't think he dropped any shells

2074
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
and i don't think he dropped any shells
 

2075
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,270
and i don't think he dropped any shells
unfortunately
