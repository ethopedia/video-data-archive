Ito welcome back did you guys see last
episode where we built the end reporter

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,190
episode where we built the end reporter
 

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,109
episode where we built the end reporter
teleporter crazy machine in Minecraft

8
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:20,119
teleporter crazy machine in Minecraft
 

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,240
teleporter crazy machine in Minecraft
that's what you see over here well today

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,250
that's what you see over here well today
 

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,009
that's what you see over here well today
I just finished building a hexadecimal

12
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:27,019
I just finished building a hexadecimal
 

13
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:33,590
I just finished building a hexadecimal
decoder in Minecraft yeah and I started

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
decoder in Minecraft yeah and I started
 

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,100
decoder in Minecraft yeah and I started
wondering it's like guys what happened

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,110
wondering it's like guys what happened
 

17
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,479
wondering it's like guys what happened
what happened you remember minecraft

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:38,489
what happened you remember minecraft
 

19
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,299
what happened you remember minecraft
when we just tried to survive our first

20
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:41,309
when we just tried to survive our first
 

21
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,069
when we just tried to survive our first
night tune and when we were building

22
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:43,079
night tune and when we were building
 

23
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,410
night tune and when we were building
dirt houses and all that stuff now look

24
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:45,420
dirt houses and all that stuff now look
 

25
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,049
dirt houses and all that stuff now look
at the things we do it's insane the

26
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:48,059
at the things we do it's insane the
 

27
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,490
at the things we do it's insane the
difference so so yeah I built this over

28
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:52,500
difference so so yeah I built this over
 

29
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,779
difference so so yeah I built this over
here pretty happy with how this turned

30
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:53,789
here pretty happy with how this turned
 

31
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,470
here pretty happy with how this turned
out you might remember we were going to

32
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480
out you might remember we were going to
 

33
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,590
out you might remember we were going to
do an 8 lever code system for the items

34
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
do an 8 lever code system for the items
 

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,189
do an 8 lever code system for the items
in the Nexus but many of you in the

36
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
in the Nexus but many of you in the
 

37
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,859
in the Nexus but many of you in the
comments pressured me you were like yo

38
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:06,869
comments pressured me you were like yo
 

39
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,080
comments pressured me you were like yo
you got to use a hexadecimal system it's

40
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,090
you got to use a hexadecimal system it's
 

41
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,420
you got to use a hexadecimal system it's
gonna be better it's simpler

42
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,430
gonna be better it's simpler
 

43
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,120
gonna be better it's simpler
not not easier to set up but simpler in

44
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,130
not not easier to set up but simpler in
 

45
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,999
not not easier to set up but simpler in
the end of things and I resisted I was

46
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:17,009
the end of things and I resisted I was
 

47
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,999
the end of things and I resisted I was
like no I'm not gonna do that not gonna

48
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:20,009
like no I'm not gonna do that not gonna
 

49
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,330
like no I'm not gonna do that not gonna
do it my way is better and I was being a

50
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,340
do it my way is better and I was being a
 

51
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,249
do it my way is better and I was being a
little bit stubborn about it but I did

52
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:25,259
little bit stubborn about it but I did
 

53
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,310
little bit stubborn about it but I did
finally crack down and just decided to

54
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
finally crack down and just decided to
 

55
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,890
finally crack down and just decided to
do it here tried to figure it out so you

56
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:30,900
do it here tried to figure it out so you
 

57
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,420
do it here tried to figure it out so you
might not realize this guys but I

58
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,430
might not realize this guys but I
 

59
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,710
might not realize this guys but I
actually didn't know how to build a

60
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720
actually didn't know how to build a
 

61
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,190
actually didn't know how to build a
hexadecimal decoder shocking right I

62
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
hexadecimal decoder shocking right I
 

63
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
hexadecimal decoder shocking right I
know I sometimes appeared to know what

64
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,570
know I sometimes appeared to know what
 

65
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,389
know I sometimes appeared to know what
I'm doing in this game all the time but

66
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
I'm doing in this game all the time but
 

67
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,730
I'm doing in this game all the time but
I got to figure this stuff out and I was

68
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:46,740
I got to figure this stuff out and I was
 

69
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,889
I got to figure this stuff out and I was
not too excited to try learn how to make

70
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:48,899
not too excited to try learn how to make
 

71
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,499
not too excited to try learn how to make
a hexadecimal decoder just saying that

72
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:51,509
a hexadecimal decoder just saying that
 

73
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,770
a hexadecimal decoder just saying that
saying those words it's like let's go do

74
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:54,780
saying those words it's like let's go do
 

75
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,980
saying those words it's like let's go do
something else but thanks thanks to you

76
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,990
something else but thanks thanks to you
 

77
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,590
something else but thanks thanks to you
guys as support and all your ideas and

78
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,600
guys as support and all your ideas and
 

79
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,870
guys as support and all your ideas and
all that and especially to Josh white he

80
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
all that and especially to Josh white he
 

81
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,060
all that and especially to Josh white he
made a video for me specifically showing

82
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,070
made a video for me specifically showing
 

83
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,600
made a video for me specifically showing
me how to set it up and how hexadecimal

84
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:08,610
me how to set it up and how hexadecimal
 

85
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,910
me how to set it up and how hexadecimal
decoders work and especially what was

86
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
decoders work and especially what was
 

87
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,000
decoders work and especially what was
helpful for me is he laid it out like

88
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,010
helpful for me is he laid it out like
 

89
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,920
helpful for me is he laid it out like
she showed me the pattern it creates

90
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:15,930
she showed me the pattern it creates
 

91
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,610
she showed me the pattern it creates
when when you do it so if you're not

92
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:19,620
when when you do it so if you're not
 

93
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,800
when when you do it so if you're not
familiar with a hexadecimal it's

94
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:21,810
familiar with a hexadecimal it's
 

95
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,229
familiar with a hexadecimal it's
basically a numbering system from what I

96
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
basically a numbering system from what I
 

97
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,990
basically a numbering system from what I
understand I'm a programmer I should

98
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,000
understand I'm a programmer I should
 

99
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,640
understand I'm a programmer I should
know exactly but I don't it so it goes

100
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:31,650
know exactly but I don't it so it goes
 

101
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,710
know exactly but I don't it so it goes
from zero one two three four five six

102
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:33,720
from zero one two three four five six
 

103
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,440
from zero one two three four five six
seven eight nine and then instead of ten

104
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,450
seven eight nine and then instead of ten
 

105
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,839
seven eight nine and then instead of ten
it goes a a is 10 B is 11 C is 12 D is

106
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:41,849
it goes a a is 10 B is 11 C is 12 D is
 

107
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:45,589
it goes a a is 10 B is 11 C is 12 D is
13 is 14 F is 15 so there's 16 different

108
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
13 is 14 F is 15 so there's 16 different
 

109
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,130
13 is 14 F is 15 so there's 16 different
numbers and each of these numbers

110
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,140
numbers and each of these numbers
 

111
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,319
numbers and each of these numbers
corresponds with the binary as you see

112
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,329
corresponds with the binary as you see
 

113
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:55,009
corresponds with the binary as you see
below so zero is zero zero zero zero if

114
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:55,019
below so zero is zero zero zero zero if
 

115
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,440
below so zero is zero zero zero zero if
we take seven it's zero one one one

116
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,450
we take seven it's zero one one one
 

117
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,180
we take seven it's zero one one one
and it basically translates one button

118
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,190
and it basically translates one button
 

119
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,539
and it basically translates one button
press can get converted into four four

120
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:08,549
press can get converted into four four
 

121
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:10,819
press can get converted into four four
of the levers we had before basically so

122
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:10,829
of the levers we had before basically so
 

123
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,839
of the levers we had before basically so
in other words instead of entering a

124
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:14,849
in other words instead of entering a
 

125
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,809
in other words instead of entering a
code like no threes something like this

126
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:19,819
code like no threes something like this
 

127
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,390
code like no threes something like this
to request an item from our Nexus here

128
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,400
to request an item from our Nexus here
 

129
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,949
to request an item from our Nexus here
now our codes are going to look like

130
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
now our codes are going to look like
 

131
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,190
now our codes are going to look like
something like this instead just two

132
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,200
something like this instead just two
 

133
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,449
something like this instead just two
digits and like if we say torches had

134
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:32,459
digits and like if we say torches had
 

135
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,690
digits and like if we say torches had
the code seven B to request that item

136
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:35,700
the code seven B to request that item
 

137
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,390
the code seven B to request that item
you got the signs up here seven is in

138
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
you got the signs up here seven is in
 

139
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,629
you got the signs up here seven is in
the bottom right on this one and then we

140
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:41,639
the bottom right on this one and then we
 

141
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,800
the bottom right on this one and then we
would press B which is over here so if

142
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:45,810
would press B which is over here so if
 

143
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,089
would press B which is over here so if
we press that it's going to select

144
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:47,099
we press that it's going to select
 

145
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,870
we press that it's going to select
torches and then we pull the lever we

146
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:50,880
torches and then we pull the lever we
 

147
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,420
torches and then we pull the lever we
get torches so quite a bit simpler

148
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,430
get torches so quite a bit simpler
 

149
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,180
get torches so quite a bit simpler
easier to remember it's just a little

150
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,190
easier to remember it's just a little
 

151
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,860
easier to remember it's just a little
bit tricky to set this all up but I'm

152
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:57,870
bit tricky to set this all up but I'm
 

153
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,589
bit tricky to set this all up but I'm
pretty happy with how it resulted and it

154
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
pretty happy with how it resulted and it
 

155
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,800
pretty happy with how it resulted and it
all works it's all good the only problem

156
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:05,810
all works it's all good the only problem
 

157
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,360
all works it's all good the only problem
we're getting really close to the other

158
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,370
we're getting really close to the other
 

159
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,689
we're getting really close to the other
wiring in the nexus and i think i have

160
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:11,699
wiring in the nexus and i think i have
 

161
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,039
wiring in the nexus and i think i have
to move all this all the logic and stuff

162
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:16,049
to move all this all the logic and stuff
 

163
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,620
to move all this all the logic and stuff
is figured out now in the nexus the only

164
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,630
is figured out now in the nexus the only
 

165
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,960
is figured out now in the nexus the only
problem is we got to connect all these

166
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:20,970
problem is we got to connect all these
 

167
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,430
problem is we got to connect all these
loose wires you see how they're not

168
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:22,440
loose wires you see how they're not
 

169
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,500
loose wires you see how they're not
connected to anything we're going to

170
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:24,510
connected to anything we're going to
 

171
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,500
connected to anything we're going to
hook them all together and there's no

172
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,510
hook them all together and there's no
 

173
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,210
hook them all together and there's no
bundled cable or anything like that in

174
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,220
bundled cable or anything like that in
 

175
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,070
bundled cable or anything like that in
Minecraft so it's going to be tricky

176
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,080

 

177
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,230

running all the wires and I don't know

178
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
running all the wires and I don't know
 

179
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
running all the wires and I don't know
exactly how to do it just yet and I'm

180
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,010
exactly how to do it just yet and I'm
 

181
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,990
exactly how to do it just yet and I'm
not doing it today but yes things are

182
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
not doing it today but yes things are
 

183
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,960
not doing it today but yes things are
looking up with this this idea so I've

184
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:44,970
looking up with this this idea so I've
 

185
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,360
looking up with this this idea so I've
also had quite a bit of feedback with

186
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,370
also had quite a bit of feedback with
 

187
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,790
also had quite a bit of feedback with
from you guys about how we should keep

188
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:49,800
from you guys about how we should keep
 

189
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
from you guys about how we should keep
track of the codes how we should

190
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,210
track of the codes how we should
 

191
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,740
track of the codes how we should
memorize them and we looked into the

192
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:54,750
memorize them and we looked into the
 

193
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,410
memorize them and we looked into the
book option before of storing all the

194
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:57,420
book option before of storing all the
 

195
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,110
book option before of storing all the
codes in a book then I talked about that

196
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,120
codes in a book then I talked about that
 

197
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,600
codes in a book then I talked about that
map idea not all of you were too happy

198
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:02,610
map idea not all of you were too happy
 

199
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,250
map idea not all of you were too happy
about that so I don't think we're going

200
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,260
about that so I don't think we're going
 

201
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,780
about that so I don't think we're going
to do it even though it's probably the

202
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:05,790
to do it even though it's probably the
 

203
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,620
to do it even though it's probably the
best method where we would set up some

204
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:09,630
best method where we would set up some
 

205
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,420
best method where we would set up some
Maps and have the codes visible just by

206
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,430
Maps and have the codes visible just by
 

207
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,210
Maps and have the codes visible just by
looking at them here instead what we're

208
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,220
looking at them here instead what we're
 

209
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,520
looking at them here instead what we're
probably going to end up doing we can

210
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:19,530
probably going to end up doing we can
 

211
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,440
probably going to end up doing we can
store all the codes in six double chests

212
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,450
store all the codes in six double chests
 

213
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,630
store all the codes in six double chests
like so we would have the chest maybe

214
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:26,640
like so we would have the chest maybe
 

215
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,540
like so we would have the chest maybe
over here and we would put each of the

216
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:29,550
over here and we would put each of the
 

217
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,610
over here and we would put each of the
items in these and then what we'll have

218
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:31,620
items in these and then what we'll have
 

219
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,240
items in these and then what we'll have
to do so again if torches add the code

220
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,250
to do so again if torches add the code
 

221
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,140
to do so again if torches add the code
seven B in order to memorize that what

222
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,150
seven B in order to memorize that what
 

223
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,170
seven B in order to memorize that what
I'll probably do is go to a handle name

224
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,180
I'll probably do is go to a handle name
 

225
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,990
I'll probably do is go to a handle name
a torch seven B oh there goes anvil darn

226
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
a torch seven B oh there goes anvil darn
 

227
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,410
a torch seven B oh there goes anvil darn
it and then all 256 unique items are

228
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:51,420
it and then all 256 unique items are
 

229
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,880
it and then all 256 unique items are
going to be in these chests down here

230
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:52,890
going to be in these chests down here
 

231
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,210
going to be in these chests down here
and if I need to look up a code what I

232
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,220
and if I need to look up a code what I
 

233
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,340
and if I need to look up a code what I
would do is just hover over it with the

234
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,350
would do is just hover over it with the
 

235
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,440
would do is just hover over it with the
mouse you'll say seven B and just seven

236
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,450
mouse you'll say seven B and just seven
 

237
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,740
mouse you'll say seven B and just seven
B uh-huh so that's kind of the method

238
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:06,750
B uh-huh so that's kind of the method
 

239
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,510
B uh-huh so that's kind of the method
we're going to go with with the Nexus

240
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,520
we're going to go with with the Nexus
 

241
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,310
we're going to go with with the Nexus
hopefully it all works out but I got to

242
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,320
hopefully it all works out but I got to
 

243
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,950
hopefully it all works out but I got to
figure out how to run all the wire now

244
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:11,960
figure out how to run all the wire now
 

245
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,220
figure out how to run all the wire now
and I'm not looking forward to it

246
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,230
and I'm not looking forward to it
 

247
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,990
and I'm not looking forward to it
once that's done though we are basically

248
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
once that's done though we are basically
 

249
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,300
once that's done though we are basically
done with all the crazy redstone part of

250
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,310
done with all the crazy redstone part of
 

251
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,750
done with all the crazy redstone part of
this alright guys so let's take a moment

252
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:23,760
this alright guys so let's take a moment
 

253
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,040
this alright guys so let's take a moment
here I want to talk to you about the end

254
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,050
here I want to talk to you about the end
 

255
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,800
here I want to talk to you about the end
reporter a little bit more today as well

256
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:26,810
reporter a little bit more today as well
 

257
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,570
reporter a little bit more today as well
you informed me in the comments

258
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:29,580
you informed me in the comments
 

259
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,310
you informed me in the comments
something I didn't realize there's

260
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,320
something I didn't realize there's
 

261
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,230
something I didn't realize there's
actually a way to make this work over a

262
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,240
actually a way to make this work over a
 

263
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,440
actually a way to make this work over a
long distance there's a trick to loading

264
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,450
long distance there's a trick to loading
 

265
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,150
long distance there's a trick to loading
chunks I didn't know about if you have

266
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,160
chunks I didn't know about if you have
 

267
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,340
chunks I didn't know about if you have
I don't know if we have enough space if

268
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,350
I don't know if we have enough space if
 

269
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,340
I don't know if we have enough space if
you send redstone to a 5x5 area of

270
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,350
you send redstone to a 5x5 area of
 

271
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,270
you send redstone to a 5x5 area of
chunks that torch is in the way look I'm

272
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,280
chunks that torch is in the way look I'm
 

273
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,860
chunks that torch is in the way look I'm
just going to lay it out a little bit

274
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:51,870
just going to lay it out a little bit
 

275
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,700
just going to lay it out a little bit
here we're going to be missing a corner

276
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:54,710
here we're going to be missing a corner
 

277
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,430
here we're going to be missing a corner
yeah if we for example sent a redstone

278
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:58,440
yeah if we for example sent a redstone
 

279
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,710
yeah if we for example sent a redstone
signal to the amplified base thousands

280
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
signal to the amplified base thousands
 

281
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,350
signal to the amplified base thousands
of blocks away and then we loaded a 5x5

282
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
of blocks away and then we loaded a 5x5
 

283
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,780
of blocks away and then we loaded a 5x5
area of chunks the one in the very

284
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:05,790
area of chunks the one in the very
 

285
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,810
area of chunks the one in the very
middle will process entities so if

286
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:08,820
middle will process entities so if
 

287
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,450
middle will process entities so if
that's where the end reporter is we can

288
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,460
that's where the end reporter is we can
 

289
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,720
that's where the end reporter is we can
actually teleport to it it is the theory

290
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:14,730
actually teleport to it it is the theory
 

291
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,190
actually teleport to it it is the theory
anyway I'm going to try set that up

292
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,200
anyway I'm going to try set that up
 

293
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,900
anyway I'm going to try set that up
sometime soon I don't have enough

294
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:17,910
sometime soon I don't have enough
 

295
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,700
sometime soon I don't have enough
redstone to do it today but hopefully we

296
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,710
redstone to do it today but hopefully we
 

297
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,010
redstone to do it today but hopefully we
can get that working and try it out so

298
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,020
can get that working and try it out so
 

299
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,720
can get that working and try it out so
that's pretty cool the other thing that

300
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:26,730
that's pretty cool the other thing that
 

301
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,260
that's pretty cool the other thing that
was suggested is let's change the way we

302
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,270
was suggested is let's change the way we
 

303
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,200
was suggested is let's change the way we
do this instead of disabling the clock

304
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,210
do this instead of disabling the clock
 

305
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,350
do this instead of disabling the clock
to activate this let's shut this off

306
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,360
to activate this let's shut this off
 

307
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,470
to activate this let's shut this off
right now - yeah we're going to put some

308
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,480
right now - yeah we're going to put some
 

309
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,560
right now - yeah we're going to put some
slime blocks behind here and they're

310
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,570
slime blocks behind here and they're
 

311
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,160
slime blocks behind here and they're
going to bump oops darn it

312
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,170
going to bump oops darn it
 

313
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,840
going to bump oops darn it
they're going to bump the enderpearl out

314
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:47,850
they're going to bump the enderpearl out
 

315
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,360
they're going to bump the enderpearl out
of the water stream and that way when we

316
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,370
of the water stream and that way when we
 

317
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,920
of the water stream and that way when we
teleport we're not going to be in the

318
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:51,930
teleport we're not going to be in the
 

319
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,630
teleport we're not going to be in the
water we're going to be on ground which

320
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:53,640
water we're going to be on ground which
 

321
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,840
water we're going to be on ground which
would be a little bit nicer I think so

322
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:56,850
would be a little bit nicer I think so
 

323
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,820
would be a little bit nicer I think so
we'll set it up like this basically the

324
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:58,830
we'll set it up like this basically the
 

325
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,280
we'll set it up like this basically the
ender pearl bounces three blocks up oops

326
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,290
ender pearl bounces three blocks up oops
 

327
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,050
ender pearl bounces three blocks up oops
so we'll have sticky pistons up to three

328
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,060
so we'll have sticky pistons up to three
 

329
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,370
so we'll have sticky pistons up to three
blocks actually we only need one of

330
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:07,380
blocks actually we only need one of
 

331
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,730
blocks actually we only need one of
these right yeah that's right we don't

332
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:10,740
these right yeah that's right we don't
 

333
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,950
these right yeah that's right we don't
need all one for each of these because

334
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
need all one for each of these because
 

335
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,770
need all one for each of these because
sticky pistons stick to themselves

336
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:14,780
sticky pistons stick to themselves
 

337
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,970
sticky pistons stick to themselves
all right so we'll go up like this and

338
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:18,980
all right so we'll go up like this and
 

339
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,670
all right so we'll go up like this and
then up here we're going to need a

340
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680
then up here we're going to need a
 

341
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,710
then up here we're going to need a
furnace or something they don't stick to

342
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
furnace or something they don't stick to
 

343
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,070
furnace or something they don't stick to
and since the water gets blocked off we

344
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
and since the water gets blocked off we
 

345
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,570
and since the water gets blocked off we
want to try prevent it from flowing

346
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:29,580
want to try prevent it from flowing
 

347
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,760
want to try prevent it from flowing
everywhere so maybe we'll just put some

348
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,770
everywhere so maybe we'll just put some
 

349
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,969
everywhere so maybe we'll just put some
blocks around around here - like this oh

350
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:36,979
blocks around around here - like this oh
 

351
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,209
blocks around around here - like this oh
man

352
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:38,219
man
 

353
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,480
man
okay so instead of sending the signal to

354
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,490
okay so instead of sending the signal to
 

355
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,770
okay so instead of sending the signal to
the clock here we're going to leave the

356
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:42,780
the clock here we're going to leave the
 

357
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,270
the clock here we're going to leave the
clock running all the time and we'll

358
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,280
clock running all the time and we'll
 

359
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,830
clock running all the time and we'll
just send it to this piston and it

360
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:45,840
just send it to this piston and it
 

361
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,750
just send it to this piston and it
should push the ender pearl out of the

362
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
should push the ender pearl out of the
 

363
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,370
should push the ender pearl out of the
water kind of like this oops

364
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,380
water kind of like this oops
 

365
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,940
water kind of like this oops
oh wait a second Oh what's it sticking

366
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:56,950
oh wait a second Oh what's it sticking
 

367
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:05,850
oh wait a second Oh what's it sticking
to wait why doesn't that work okay

368
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:05,860
to wait why doesn't that work okay
 

369
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,000
to wait why doesn't that work okay
that's fine over there that's a furnace

370
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,010
that's fine over there that's a furnace
 

371
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:16,280
that's fine over there that's a furnace
up there why can't I move this guy's

372
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,290

 

373
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,440

that's a furnace oh it's sticking on the

374
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,450
that's a furnace oh it's sticking on the
 

375
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,390
that's a furnace oh it's sticking on the
carpet oh snap that's kind of bad I like

376
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,400
carpet oh snap that's kind of bad I like
 

377
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,570
carpet oh snap that's kind of bad I like
the way the carpet looked yeah it's

378
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:27,580
the way the carpet looked yeah it's
 

379
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,380
the way the carpet looked yeah it's
going to do that yeah so check this out

380
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,390
going to do that yeah so check this out
 

381
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,420
going to do that yeah so check this out
with the slime block pushers it's quite

382
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,430
with the slime block pushers it's quite
 

383
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,550
with the slime block pushers it's quite
a bit smoother let's go back to the man

384
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:35,560
a bit smoother let's go back to the man
 

385
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,600
a bit smoother let's go back to the man
cave so you end up on the ground like

386
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,610
cave so you end up on the ground like
 

387
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,700
cave so you end up on the ground like
this and if you put something in front

388
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:41,710
this and if you put something in front
 

389
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,330
this and if you put something in front
that the Ender Pro can run into you end

390
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:45,340
that the Ender Pro can run into you end
 

391
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,040
that the Ender Pro can run into you end
up right by the water so you can reset

392
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,050
up right by the water so you can reset
 

393
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,810
up right by the water so you can reset
it a little bit easier - oops I am

394
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:51,820
it a little bit easier - oops I am
 

395
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,300
it a little bit easier - oops I am
having a little bit of issues with this

396
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,310
having a little bit of issues with this
 

397
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,400
having a little bit of issues with this
thing still it's a little bit tricky to

398
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,410
thing still it's a little bit tricky to
 

399
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,880
thing still it's a little bit tricky to
set the enter Pro sometimes it sometimes

400
00:09:59,880 --> 00:09:59,890
set the enter Pro sometimes it sometimes
 

401
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,400
set the enter Pro sometimes it sometimes
it hits the slime block still and also

402
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,410
it hits the slime block still and also
 

403
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,590
it hits the slime block still and also
when I go through another portal or a

404
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:04,600
when I go through another portal or a
 

405
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,720
when I go through another portal or a
bed it doesn't always happens but

406
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:06,730
bed it doesn't always happens but
 

407
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,830
bed it doesn't always happens but
sometimes I say go through a bed I'm in

408
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:10,840
sometimes I say go through a bed I'm in
 

409
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,470
sometimes I say go through a bed I'm in
slept in a bed sometimes when I do that

410
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:13,480
slept in a bed sometimes when I do that
 

411
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,150
slept in a bed sometimes when I do that
I'll just randomly teleport to one of

412
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,160
I'll just randomly teleport to one of
 

413
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I'll just randomly teleport to one of
these and I don't know why exactly that

414
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,170
these and I don't know why exactly that
 

415
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,750
these and I don't know why exactly that
happens oh yeah see it's not perfect

416
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
happens oh yeah see it's not perfect
 

417
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,590
happens oh yeah see it's not perfect
every time oh you stupid little guy did

418
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
every time oh you stupid little guy did
 

419
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,180
every time oh you stupid little guy did
you mess that up for me but it's like

420
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,190
you mess that up for me but it's like
 

421
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,210
you mess that up for me but it's like
maybe 70% of the time when you throw the

422
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:33,220
maybe 70% of the time when you throw the
 

423
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,500
maybe 70% of the time when you throw the
ender pearl it works Oh

424
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,510

 

425
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,400

Oh sometimes Egan's get stuck at the

426
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,410
Oh sometimes Egan's get stuck at the
 

427
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,930
Oh sometimes Egan's get stuck at the
very bottom what's she doing over there

428
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:48,940

 

429
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,699

so I tell you what guys lately we've

so I tell you what guys lately we've
 

431
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,040
so I tell you what guys lately we've
been doing a lot of technical stuff in

432
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,050
been doing a lot of technical stuff in
 

433
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,319
been doing a lot of technical stuff in
our let's play here and I've already

434
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:56,329
our let's play here and I've already
 

435
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,710
our let's play here and I've already
built a hexadecimal decoder today so

436
00:10:59,710 --> 00:10:59,720
built a hexadecimal decoder today so
 

437
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,780
built a hexadecimal decoder today so
maybe for the rest of the episode we'll

438
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:01,790
maybe for the rest of the episode we'll
 

439
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,710
maybe for the rest of the episode we'll
we'll do some building how's that sound

440
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
we'll do some building how's that sound
 

441
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,019
we'll do some building how's that sound
gotta get that variety hungry

442
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:08,029
gotta get that variety hungry
 

443
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,829
gotta get that variety hungry

new feature okay so we're going to do

458
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:36,260
new feature okay so we're going to do
 

459
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,180
new feature okay so we're going to do
some building around our man cave here

460
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,190
some building around our man cave here
 

461
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,120
some building around our man cave here
and I thought maybe we would hit up this

462
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,130
and I thought maybe we would hit up this
 

463
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,840
and I thought maybe we would hit up this
area over here ah we don't really go

464
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:46,850
area over here ah we don't really go
 

465
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,990
area over here ah we don't really go
over here too often but we sort of

466
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
over here too often but we sort of
 

467
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,509
over here too often but we sort of
expanded out this way just not very very

468
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:52,519
expanded out this way just not very very
 

469
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,309
expanded out this way just not very very
much so far first off there's like a

470
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:57,319
much so far first off there's like a
 

471
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:58,900
much so far first off there's like a
little bridge here I started building

472
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:58,910
little bridge here I started building
 

473
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,430
little bridge here I started building

oak running along the side here we're
 

587
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,329
oak running along the side here we're
going to change it up compared to some

588

because for this area we used oak as a

592
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,190
because for this area we used oak as a
 

593
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,040
because for this area we used oak as a
border all along I'm going to switch it

594
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,050
border all along I'm going to switch it
 

595
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,600
border all along I'm going to switch it
over to dark oak just so there's some

596
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,610
over to dark oak just so there's some
 

597
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,530
over to dark oak just so there's some
variation and maybe we will connect it

598
00:14:59,530 --> 00:14:59,540
variation and maybe we will connect it
 

599
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,490
variation and maybe we will connect it
to the ceiling in places like so now

600
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:03,500
to the ceiling in places like so now
 

601
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,540
to the ceiling in places like so now

we could either make it go right next to
 

605
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,100
we could either make it go right next to
this or we might try to keep that border

606
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,110

 

607
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,749

631
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,990
showing I do want to keep this visible

632
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,000
as well though because we have this rail
 

633
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,059
as well though because we have this rail
cart system and when this is running you

634
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:01,069
cart system and when this is running you
 

635
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:02,199
cart system and when this is running you
can see the minecart running around

636
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:02,209
can see the minecart running around
 

637
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,790
can see the minecart running around
which looks pretty cool

638
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:03,800
which looks pretty cool
 

639
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,350
which looks pretty cool
and from up here we could watch it but

640
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,360
and from up here we could watch it but
 

641
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,559
and from up here we could watch it but
these long straights straightaways like

642
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:11,569
these long straights straightaways like
 

643
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:13,540
these long straights straightaways like
this aren't so good we almost need to

644
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:13,550
this aren't so good we almost need to
 

645
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,439
this aren't so good we almost need to
put like an obstacle here into the

646
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:17,449
put like an obstacle here into the
 

647
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,629
put like an obstacle here into the
middle and then have it have the walkway

648
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:19,639
middle and then have it have the walkway
 

649
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,769
middle and then have it have the walkway
go around it somehow let go this way

650
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:22,779
go around it somehow let go this way
 

651
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:29,700
go around it somehow let go this way
just to break it up a bit

652
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:29,710

 

653
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,050

okay we're going to do it like this we

654
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,060
okay we're going to do it like this we
 

655
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,090
okay we're going to do it like this we
got Oakwood running between the pillars

656
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,100
got Oakwood running between the pillars
 

657
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,490
got Oakwood running between the pillars
like so and then spruce wood beside that

658
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:38,500
like so and then spruce wood beside that
 

659
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,770
like so and then spruce wood beside that
and I think that looks pretty cool I put

660
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:41,780
and I think that looks pretty cool I put
 

661
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,500
and I think that looks pretty cool I put
jungle leaves in up here we can hide

662
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:44,510
jungle leaves in up here we can hide
 

663
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,460
jungle leaves in up here we can hide
lighting behind the jungle leaves us to

664
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,470
lighting behind the jungle leaves us to
 

665
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,750
lighting behind the jungle leaves us to
see if that works or not because without

666
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:49,760
see if that works or not because without
 

667
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,150
see if that works or not because without
these torches it's going to be pretty

668
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
these torches it's going to be pretty
 

669
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,640
these torches it's going to be pretty
dark in here

670
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:53,650
dark in here
 

671
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,230
dark in here
and we want to get rid of all the

672
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
and we want to get rid of all the
 

673
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,110
and we want to get rid of all the
torches that's our goal all right what

674
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
torches that's our goal all right what
 

675
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,780
torches that's our goal all right what
if we put one up here is that going to

676
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:01,790
if we put one up here is that going to
 

677
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,710
if we put one up here is that going to
light it up enough let's see let's check

678
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:05,720
light it up enough let's see let's check
 

679
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,490
light it up enough let's see let's check
our lighting I know it doesn't really

680
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:09,500
our lighting I know it doesn't really
 

681
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,750
our lighting I know it doesn't really
look like it does it gets up too we

682
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
look like it does it gets up too we
 

683
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,490
look like it does it gets up too we
would have to have them like all along I

684
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:15,500
would have to have them like all along I
 

685
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,280
would have to have them like all along I
think see skylights or block light is it

686
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,290
think see skylights or block light is it
 

687
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,740
think see skylights or block light is it
nine that's what we need it at ten nine

688
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:23,750
nine that's what we need it at ten nine
 

689
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:32,890
nine that's what we need it at ten nine
eight seven now we probably have to have

690
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:32,900
eight seven now we probably have to have
 

691
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,930
eight seven now we probably have to have
lighting down below can't just get away

692
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:34,940
lighting down below can't just get away
 

693
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,810
lighting down below can't just get away
with roof lighting all right um the

694
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:37,820
with roof lighting all right um the
 

695
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,460
with roof lighting all right um the
other thing though maybe at this one

696
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,470
other thing though maybe at this one
 

697
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,100
other thing though maybe at this one
over here to break it up I'm just going

698
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,110
over here to break it up I'm just going
 

699
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,510
over here to break it up I'm just going
to put a wall over here a stone wall

700
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:48,520
to put a wall over here a stone wall
 

701
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,430
to put a wall over here a stone wall
like so to make it look like the end and

702
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
like so to make it look like the end and
 

703
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,290
like so to make it look like the end and
then we will make a passageway going

704
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,300
then we will make a passageway going
 

705
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,440
then we will make a passageway going
this way and that's where we'll probably

706
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,450
this way and that's where we'll probably
 

707
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,450
this way and that's where we'll probably
change it up quite a bit they'll be a

708
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:01,460
change it up quite a bit they'll be a
 

709
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,000
change it up quite a bit they'll be a
big room here or something and then

710
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,010
big room here or something and then
 

711
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,830
big room here or something and then
somewhere in there it's going to go to

712
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
somewhere in there it's going to go to
 

713
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,680
somewhere in there it's going to go to
the left again and if we keep going this

714
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:08,690
the left again and if we keep going this
 

715
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,680
the left again and if we keep going this
way eventually we will hit the village

716
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:10,690
way eventually we will hit the village
 

717
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,000
way eventually we will hit the village
underground village further down in the

718
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,010
underground village further down in the
 

719
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,960
underground village further down in the
man cave so we'll connect to it there

720
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:15,970
man cave so we'll connect to it there
 

721
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,190
man cave so we'll connect to it there
yeah okay I think this is pretty good

722
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,200
yeah okay I think this is pretty good
 

723
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,830
yeah okay I think this is pretty good
for right now I got to refine it a bit

724
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:20,840
for right now I got to refine it a bit
 

725
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,140
for right now I got to refine it a bit
more but we'll have decorations on the

726
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,150
more but we'll have decorations on the
 

727
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,890
more but we'll have decorations on the
right some flowers and bushes whatever I

728

right some flowers and bushes whatever I
 

729
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,600
right some flowers and bushes whatever I
think of later and probably over here -

730
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:30,610
think of later and probably over here -
 

731
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,780
think of later and probably over here -

I can make one so I'm gonna go check
these out I got two coordinates and

794
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840
these out I got two coordinates and
 

795
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,880
these out I got two coordinates and
they're about a thousand blocks away

796
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:00,890
they're about a thousand blocks away
 

797
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,340
they're about a thousand blocks away
from here and we'll see if we can find a

798
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,350
from here and we'll see if we can find a
 

799
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,130
from here and we'll see if we can find a
witch hut or not so I got a little bit

they're gonna die if I take them out I

818
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,180
they're gonna die if I take them out I
 

819
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,730
they're gonna die if I take them out I
can probably risk losing a mule because

820
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:30,740
can probably risk losing a mule because
 

821
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,980
can probably risk losing a mule because
I have to but still I don't know these

horse stables aren't really doing their

824
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:37,400
horse stables aren't really doing their
 

825
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,690
horse stables aren't really doing their
thing they're more for trying to figure

826
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:43,700
thing they're more for trying to figure
 

827
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
thing they're more for trying to figure
out which is which they're more for

828

here I wonder if these guys are tamed
 

839
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,810
here I wonder if these guys are tamed
have I been out this way I'm not sure

840
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:04,820
have I been out this way I'm not sure
 

841

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
probably slow as molasses though yeah
 

851
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,780

can you jump at least no you can't

852
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:26,790
can you jump at least no you can't
 

853
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:32,180

oh well today we've hit the amplified

854
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,190
oh well today we've hit the amplified
 

855
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,880
oh well today we've hit the amplified
border over here the coordinates I got

856
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:34,890
border over here the coordinates I got
 

857
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,820
border over here the coordinates I got
were 1100 and 500 just a little bit over

858
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:40,830
were 1100 and 500 just a little bit over
 

859
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,799
were 1100 and 500 just a little bit over
this way it is not a swap biome over

860
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:42,809
this way it is not a swap biome over
 

861
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,090
this way it is not a swap biome over
here so either I've been trolled or I

862
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,100
here so either I've been trolled or I
 

863

generated this world before the terrain

864
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:50,549
generated this world before the terrain
 

865
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,610
generated this world before the terrain
change which is probably what happened

866
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:52,620
change which is probably what happened
 

867
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,830
change which is probably what happened
so right in this spot

868
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:54,840
so right in this spot
 

869
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,360
so right in this spot
there's probably actually a witch

870
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,370
there's probably actually a witch
 

871
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,000
there's probably actually a witch
spawning area but there's no Hut because

872
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,010
spawning area but there's no Hut because
 

873
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,289

my world was generated before witch hats

874
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:02,299
my world was generated before witch hats
 

875
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:09,320
my world was generated before witch hats
came out a lot of it hmm so this first

876
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,330
came out a lot of it hmm so this first
 

877
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,730
came out a lot of it hmm so this first
one doesn't look like we're gonna be

878
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:10,740
one doesn't look like we're gonna be
 

879
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,380
one doesn't look like we're gonna be
able to find the spot whoa oh man this

880
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,390
able to find the spot whoa oh man this
 

881
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,539
able to find the spot whoa oh man this
one might actually be here we gotta go

882
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:17,549
one might actually be here we gotta go
 

883
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:23,419
one might actually be here we gotta go
250 negative about 1,300 so we're pretty

884
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:23,429
250 negative about 1,300 so we're pretty
 

885
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,100
250 negative about 1,300 so we're pretty
close and there is a swamp here oh I did

886
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,110
close and there is a swamp here oh I did
 

887
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,120
close and there is a swamp here oh I did
the auto jump trick look at that day

888
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,130
the auto jump trick look at that day
 

889
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,440
the auto jump trick look at that day
6000 we made it

890
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,450
6000 we made it
 

891
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,940
6000 we made it
can't believe 6000 days in my world here

892
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:36,950
can't believe 6000 days in my world here
 

893
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,110
can't believe 6000 days in my world here
yeah we're generating your terrain here

894
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
yeah we're generating your terrain here
 

895
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,549
yeah we're generating your terrain here
it's legend like crazy uh 30 blocks this

896
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:43,559
it's legend like crazy uh 30 blocks this
 

897
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:49,159
it's legend like crazy uh 30 blocks this
way mmm I don't see which Hut's should

898
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:49,169
way mmm I don't see which Hut's should
 

899
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:55,460
way mmm I don't see which Hut's should
be right around here darn I don't think

900
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:55,470
be right around here darn I don't think
 

901
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,169
be right around here darn I don't think
there is one

902
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:56,179
there is one
 

903
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:58,970
there is one
again this was generated just before

904
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:58,980
again this was generated just before
 

905
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,450
again this was generated just before
they came out probably and it's on the

906
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:02,460
they came out probably and it's on the
 

907
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,299
they came out probably and it's on the
amplified border again so in order to

908
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:05,309
amplified border again so in order to
 

909
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:05,629
amplified border again so in order to
find

910
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:05,639
find
 

911
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,949
find
which hat we're gonna have to find it in

912
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:06,959
which hat we're gonna have to find it in
 

913
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:11,389
which hat we're gonna have to find it in
amplified terrain probably and I have

914
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:11,399
amplified terrain probably and I have
 

915
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:13,549
amplified terrain probably and I have
explored a lot of amplified terrain and

916
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:13,559
explored a lot of amplified terrain and
 

917
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,549
explored a lot of amplified terrain and
I have never well I found one swamp I

918
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
I have never well I found one swamp I
 

919
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,489
I have never well I found one swamp I
think one swamp in all the terrain I've

920
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:19,499
think one swamp in all the terrain I've
 

921
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:25,369
think one swamp in all the terrain I've
explored and it didn't have one yeah so

922
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:25,379
explored and it didn't have one yeah so
 

923
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,279
explored and it didn't have one yeah so
might not be able to make a witch farm

924
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:27,289
might not be able to make a witch farm
 

925
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,389
might not be able to make a witch farm
unless you guys give me coordinates

926
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:29,399
unless you guys give me coordinates
 

927
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:33,739
unless you guys give me coordinates
again let's see yeah it doesn't look

928
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:33,749
again let's see yeah it doesn't look
 

929
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:38,239
again let's see yeah it doesn't look
like it's nope it's a bus guys it's a

930
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:38,249
like it's nope it's a bus guys it's a
 

931
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:41,659
like it's nope it's a bus guys it's a
bust okay well it is possible guys I

932
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:41,669
bust okay well it is possible guys I
 

933
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,699
bust okay well it is possible guys I
might have found a witch hut in the past

934
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:43,709
might have found a witch hut in the past
 

935
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:46,369
might have found a witch hut in the past
and I just don't remember it or I never

936
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:46,379
and I just don't remember it or I never
 

937
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:49,249
and I just don't remember it or I never
noticed it so if you guys remember me

938
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:49,259
noticed it so if you guys remember me
 

939
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,569
noticed it so if you guys remember me
finding one or if you know where there

940
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:50,579
finding one or if you know where there
 

941
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,579
finding one or if you know where there
is one let me know in the comments and

942
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:52,589
is one let me know in the comments and
 

943
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:56,899
is one let me know in the comments and
I'll try find it in the future but here

944
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:56,909
I'll try find it in the future but here
 

945
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,639
I'll try find it in the future but here
is the comment for today's episode it

946
00:23:58,639 --> 00:23:58,649
is the comment for today's episode it
 

947
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,099
is the comment for today's episode it
says hey etho there is a way to create

948
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:01,109
says hey etho there is a way to create
 

949
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,440
says hey etho there is a way to create
an instantaneous redstone but it

950
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,450
an instantaneous redstone but it
 

951
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,959
an instantaneous redstone but it
requires a lot of slime you can attach a

952
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:05,969
requires a lot of slime you can attach a
 

953
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:08,389
requires a lot of slime you can attach a
redstone block to the ends to the end of

954
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:08,399
redstone block to the ends to the end of
 

955
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,339
redstone block to the ends to the end of
a long chain of slime blocks attached to

956
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:10,349
a long chain of slime blocks attached to
 

957
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,499
a long chain of slime blocks attached to
a sticky piston the redstone block

958
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:12,509
a sticky piston the redstone block
 

959
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:13,879
a sticky piston the redstone block
powers the next piston without a

960
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:13,889
powers the next piston without a
 

961
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:16,190
powers the next piston without a
repeater delay effectively it all

962
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,200
repeater delay effectively it all
 

963
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,769
repeater delay effectively it all
happens within a couple game ticks dr.

964
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:18,779
happens within a couple game ticks dr.
 

965
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,810
happens within a couple game ticks dr.
m77 has a video on it you could use this

966
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:20,820
m77 has a video on it you could use this
 

967
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,819
m77 has a video on it you could use this
to make the button to the next end

968
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:22,829
to make the button to the next end
 

969
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,879
to make the button to the next end
reporter quicker yeah I thought about

970
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:25,889
reporter quicker yeah I thought about
 

971
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:30,379
reporter quicker yeah I thought about
using instant wire the problem is while

972
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:30,389
using instant wire the problem is while
 

973
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:34,219
using instant wire the problem is while
one it costs a little bit more to the

974
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:34,229
one it costs a little bit more to the
 

975
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:35,989
one it costs a little bit more to the
biggest time-consuming part of this is

976
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:35,999
biggest time-consuming part of this is
 

977
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,639
biggest time-consuming part of this is
digging these tunnels for the redstone

978
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:37,649
digging these tunnels for the redstone
 

979
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:41,449
digging these tunnels for the redstone
wire and if we have to put pistons in

980
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:41,459
wire and if we have to put pistons in
 

981
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:42,829
wire and if we have to put pistons in
here we can't walk through this anymore

982
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:42,839
here we can't walk through this anymore
 

983
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,180
here we can't walk through this anymore
so we have to either make the tunnel

984
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,190
so we have to either make the tunnel
 

985
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,829
so we have to either make the tunnel
wider or it'll just take a little bit

986
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:48,839
wider or it'll just take a little bit
 

987
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:51,469
wider or it'll just take a little bit
longer to set up as is my concern and

988
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:51,479
longer to set up as is my concern and
 

989
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:54,560
longer to set up as is my concern and
also I'm not sure I'm curious about this

990
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:54,570
also I'm not sure I'm curious about this
 

991
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,619
also I'm not sure I'm curious about this
if you do instant wire and you're

992
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:57,629
if you do instant wire and you're
 

993
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,739
if you do instant wire and you're
loading chunks does it actually make it

994
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:00,749
loading chunks does it actually make it
 

995
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,259
loading chunks does it actually make it
faster because it the game still has to

996
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:03,269
faster because it the game still has to
 

997
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,589
faster because it the game still has to
load those chunks which takes time and

998
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:05,599
load those chunks which takes time and
 

999
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,940
load those chunks which takes time and
the way I'm doing it with the redstone

1000
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:07,950
the way I'm doing it with the redstone
 

1001
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,060
the way I'm doing it with the redstone
it's loading a chunk every tenth of a

1002
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,070
it's loading a chunk every tenth of a
 

1003
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,949
it's loading a chunk every tenth of a
second which is pretty quick I don't

1004
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:12,959
second which is pretty quick I don't
 

1005
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,329
second which is pretty quick I don't
even know if the game could keep up with

1006
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:14,339
even know if the game could keep up with
 

1007
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:19,160
even know if the game could keep up with
that but yeah kind of interesting

1008
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,170
that but yeah kind of interesting
 

1009
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,380
that but yeah kind of interesting
anyway I did want to point something out

1010
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,390
anyway I did want to point something out
 

1011
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,210
anyway I did want to point something out
because I didn't really explain this too

1012
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:23,220
because I didn't really explain this too
 

1013
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,090
because I didn't really explain this too
well the whole reason we were building

1014
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,100
well the whole reason we were building
 

1015
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,190
well the whole reason we were building
this area over here by the way or why

1016
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,200
this area over here by the way or why
 

1017
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,750
this area over here by the way or why
we're working on it is because we've

1018
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
we're working on it is because we've
 

1019
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,780
we're working on it is because we've
we've run low on areas of expansion in

1020
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:32,790
we've run low on areas of expansion in
 

1021
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,220
we've run low on areas of expansion in
the man cave so if we want to add more

1022
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,230
the man cave so if we want to add more
 

1023
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,080
the man cave so if we want to add more
rooms we don't really have a spot to do

1024
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,090
rooms we don't really have a spot to do
 

1025
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,090
rooms we don't really have a spot to do
it anymore

1026
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,100
it anymore
 

1027
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,910
it anymore
until today anyway so I've added on here

1028
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:39,920
until today anyway so I've added on here
 

1029
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,350
until today anyway so I've added on here
we didn't build this way if we want

1030
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,360
we didn't build this way if we want
 

1031
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,600
we didn't build this way if we want
ideally I would have liked if there was

1032
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:44,610
ideally I would have liked if there was
 

1033
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,430
ideally I would have liked if there was
a cave here but there there doesn't seem

1034
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,440
a cave here but there there doesn't seem
 

1035
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,090
a cave here but there there doesn't seem
to be one maybe we'll run into one soon

1036
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,100
to be one maybe we'll run into one soon
 

1037
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,370
to be one maybe we'll run into one soon
because I tried to follow the shape of

1038
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:52,380
because I tried to follow the shape of
 

1039
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,610
because I tried to follow the shape of
the caves with this project anyways guys

1040
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:55,620
the caves with this project anyways guys
 

1041
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,710
the caves with this project anyways guys
I think that's going to do it for

1042
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:57,720
I think that's going to do it for
 

1043
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,660
I think that's going to do it for
today's episode I hope you enjoyed it

1044

today's episode I hope you enjoyed it
 

1045
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,910
today's episode I hope you enjoyed it
hope you have a wonderful day and I'll

1046
