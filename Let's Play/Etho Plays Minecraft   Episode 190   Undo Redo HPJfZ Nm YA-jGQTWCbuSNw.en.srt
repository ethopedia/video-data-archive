00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,670
blaze farm you know i kind of forgot
about this place i thought i would check

12
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
about this place i thought i would check
 

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,390
about this place i thought i would check
it out

14
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
it out
 

15
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,750
it out
because i couldn't remember where i left

16
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
because i couldn't remember where i left
 

17
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,429
because i couldn't remember where i left
off on it

18
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
off on it
 

19
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,950
off on it
and yeah it's like almost done i

20
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
and yeah it's like almost done i
 

21

and yeah it's like almost done i
forgot i built this thing the killing

22
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
forgot i built this thing the killing
 

23
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,630
forgot i built this thing the killing
chamber and we got

24
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
chamber and we got
 

25
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,150
chamber and we got
a light switch and everything

26
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
a light switch and everything
 

27
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,590
a light switch and everything
uh but i do remember i i stopped working

28
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
uh but i do remember i i stopped working
 

29
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,950
uh but i do remember i i stopped working
on it because i was

30
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
on it because i was
 

31
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,069
on it because i was
frustrated i couldn't couldn't figure

32
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
frustrated i couldn't couldn't figure
 

33
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,030
frustrated i couldn't couldn't figure
out what to do and

34
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
out what to do and
 

35
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,229
out what to do and
i came here today and it's like what was

36
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
i came here today and it's like what was
 

37
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,350
i came here today and it's like what was
the problem it's so

38
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
the problem it's so
 

39
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,830
the problem it's so
so simple all i have to do

40
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840

 

41
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,029

getting jammed here why didn't i just

42
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
getting jammed here why didn't i just
 

43
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,270
getting jammed here why didn't i just
move this conveyor belt up one block so

44
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
move this conveyor belt up one block so
 

45
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,430
move this conveyor belt up one block so
that

46
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
that
 

47
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,349
that
um instead of them being pushed that way

48
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
um instead of them being pushed that way
 

49
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,270
um instead of them being pushed that way
into the lava if they get pushed

50
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
into the lava if they get pushed
 

51
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,190
into the lava if they get pushed
from this side and this side into lava

52
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
from this side and this side into lava
 

53
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,310
from this side and this side into lava
that way the two don't

54
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
that way the two don't
 

55
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,590
that way the two don't
join together it'll

56
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
join together it'll
 

57
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,149
join together it'll
it'll work just fine i don't know don't

58
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
it'll work just fine i don't know don't
 

59
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,670
it'll work just fine i don't know don't
know what i was thinking so

60
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
know what i was thinking so
 

61
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,190
know what i was thinking so
what i have to do is the hole

62
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
what i have to do is the hole
 

63
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,830
what i have to do is the hole
is right there i need to change it to

64
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
is right there i need to change it to
 

65
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,030
is right there i need to change it to
that one

66
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
that one
 

67
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,149
that one
right there um and then

68
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
right there um and then
 

69
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,630
right there um and then
that'll make the soldier moved up one

70
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
that'll make the soldier moved up one
 

71
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,630
that'll make the soldier moved up one
block so that they

72
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
block so that they
 

73
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,390
block so that they
join with this lava properly

74
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400

 

75
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,350

i don't know you know as i as i keep

76
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
i don't know you know as i as i keep
 

77
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,550
i don't know you know as i as i keep
playing this game i feel like i'm

78
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
playing this game i feel like i'm
 

79
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,830
playing this game i feel like i'm
getting better at it and

80
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
getting better at it and
 

81
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,510
getting better at it and
stuff just becomes clearer but

82
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
stuff just becomes clearer but
 

83
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,510
stuff just becomes clearer but
yes this looks like an easy fix i don't

84
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
yes this looks like an easy fix i don't
 

85
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,990
yes this looks like an easy fix i don't
know what the trouble was

86
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
know what the trouble was
 

87
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,630
know what the trouble was
so i'll work on that and hopefully i'm

88
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
so i'll work on that and hopefully i'm
 

89
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,069
so i'll work on that and hopefully i'm
not overlooking something that was the

90
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
not overlooking something that was the
 

91
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,429
not overlooking something that was the
main problem

92
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
main problem
 

93
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,510
main problem
i'm pretty sure

94
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520

 

95
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,990

yeah all right get to work

96
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
yeah all right get to work
 

97
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,229
yeah all right get to work
oh man you know this project

98
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
oh man you know this project
 

99
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,510
oh man you know this project
i'm starting to remember why i got

100
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
i'm starting to remember why i got
 

101
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,670
i'm starting to remember why i got
frustrated with it because it's like

102
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
frustrated with it because it's like
 

103
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,710
frustrated with it because it's like
nothing wants to work ever

104
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720

 

105
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,110

even when it seems like it should uh i

106
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
even when it seems like it should uh i
 

107
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,550
even when it seems like it should uh i
did kind of just fix

108
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
did kind of just fix
 

109
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,190
did kind of just fix
one of the problems i was having like i

110
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
one of the problems i was having like i
 

111
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,070
one of the problems i was having like i
made the changes

112
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
made the changes
 

113
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,270
made the changes
and the problem is when this piston goes

114
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
and the problem is when this piston goes
 

115
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,309
and the problem is when this piston goes
off

116
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
off
 

117
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,910
off
it pushes them into the lava but it

118
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
it pushes them into the lava but it
 

119
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,750
it pushes them into the lava but it
usually pushes them a little bit beyond

120
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
usually pushes them a little bit beyond
 

121
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,430
usually pushes them a little bit beyond
that so they don't actually swim

122
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
that so they don't actually swim
 

123
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,509
that so they don't actually swim
up they'll they'll go on to that

124
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
up they'll they'll go on to that
 

125
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,190
up they'll they'll go on to that
pressure plate so they'll

126
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
pressure plate so they'll
 

127
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,110
pressure plate so they'll
get pushed through to the other side and

128
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
get pushed through to the other side and
 

129
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,350
get pushed through to the other side and
that just

130
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
that just
 

131
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,949
that just
breaks everything like you kind of just

132
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
breaks everything like you kind of just
 

133
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,670
breaks everything like you kind of just
thought there um

134
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
thought there um
 

135
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,509
thought there um
i helped to make that a lot

136
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
i helped to make that a lot
 

137
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,030
i helped to make that a lot
better by putting a fence you can't see

138
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
better by putting a fence you can't see
 

139
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,630
better by putting a fence you can't see
it but there's a fence underneath that

140
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
it but there's a fence underneath that
 

141
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,430
it but there's a fence underneath that
lava which

142
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
lava which
 

143
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,790
lava which
brings them up half a block and i also

144
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
brings them up half a block and i also
 

145
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,910
brings them up half a block and i also
have

146
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
have
 

147
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,750
have
upside down half slab there so they can

148
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
upside down half slab there so they can
 

149
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,830
upside down half slab there so they can
actually go on to the fence

150
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
actually go on to the fence
 

151
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,589
actually go on to the fence
otherwise uh it would stop them

152
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
otherwise uh it would stop them
 

153
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,589
otherwise uh it would stop them
and that just gets them off the pressure

154
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
and that just gets them off the pressure
 

155
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,309
and that just gets them off the pressure
plates so that

156
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
plates so that
 

157
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,229
plates so that
if they don't go up the lava they won't

158
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
if they don't go up the lava they won't
 

159
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,750
if they don't go up the lava they won't
be on the other pressure plate on the

160
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
be on the other pressure plate on the
 

161
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,830
be on the other pressure plate on the
other side at least

162
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840

 

163
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,750

and then when a blaze comes by he can

164
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
and then when a blaze comes by he can
 

165
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,830
and then when a blaze comes by he can
correct them

166
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
correct them
 

167
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,830
correct them
usually sometimes they'll wander off the

168
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
usually sometimes they'll wander off the
 

169
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,550
usually sometimes they'll wander off the
fence onto the pressure plate anyway

170
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
fence onto the pressure plate anyway
 

171
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,470
fence onto the pressure plate anyway
but then the huge problem i'm having is

172
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
but then the huge problem i'm having is
 

173
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,509
but then the huge problem i'm having is
over here now because i've changed

174
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
over here now because i've changed
 

175
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,550
over here now because i've changed
change this all around and i can't i can

176
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
change this all around and i can't i can
 

177
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,070
change this all around and i can't i can
only put one pressure plate down

178
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
only put one pressure plate down
 

179
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,789
only put one pressure plate down
now otherwise it will activate these

180
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
now otherwise it will activate these
 

181
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,149
now otherwise it will activate these
conveyor belt

182
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
conveyor belt
 

183
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,869
conveyor belt
pistons and

184
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879

 

185
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,949

yeah so i i'm kind of fed up with this

186
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
yeah so i i'm kind of fed up with this
 

187
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,309
yeah so i i'm kind of fed up with this
um what i'm gonna do

188
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
um what i'm gonna do
 

189
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,670
um what i'm gonna do
and if this doesn't work i'm gonna be

190
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
and if this doesn't work i'm gonna be
 

191
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,149
and if this doesn't work i'm gonna be
really fed up i'm just gonna

192
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
really fed up i'm just gonna
 

193
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,910
really fed up i'm just gonna
get rid of this whole conveyor belt well

194
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
get rid of this whole conveyor belt well
 

195
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,589
get rid of this whole conveyor belt well
not get rid of it but you did the whole

196
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
not get rid of it but you did the whole
 

197
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,589
not get rid of it but you did the whole
pressure plate deal with it

198
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
pressure plate deal with it
 

199
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,910
pressure plate deal with it
and just took up a clock hook up a

200
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
and just took up a clock hook up a
 

201
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,750
and just took up a clock hook up a
monostable circuits

202
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
monostable circuits
 

203
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,469
monostable circuits
have it fire regularly and that way i

204
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
have it fire regularly and that way i
 

205
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,469
have it fire regularly and that way i
can control

206
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
can control
 

207
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,230
can control
their movement a little bit better

208
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
their movement a little bit better
 

209
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,070
their movement a little bit better
instead of leaving it up to them

210
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080

 

211
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,550

and yeah that way they shouldn't get

212
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
and yeah that way they shouldn't get
 

213
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,870
and yeah that way they shouldn't get
stuck in blocks either because

214
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
stuck in blocks either because
 

215
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,670
stuck in blocks either because
uh the blocks will only extend for like

216
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
uh the blocks will only extend for like
 

217
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,590
uh the blocks will only extend for like
two ticks and then pull back

218
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
two ticks and then pull back
 

219
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,189
two ticks and then pull back
um yeah because

220
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
um yeah because
 

221
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,110
um yeah because
that's what happens the block extends

222
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
that's what happens the block extends
 

223
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,590
that's what happens the block extends
and then they just substitute to death

224
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
and then they just substitute to death
 

225
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,670
and then they just substitute to death
if there's a problem and there are lots

226
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
if there's a problem and there are lots
 

227
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,790
if there's a problem and there are lots
of problems

228
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
of problems
 

229
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,390
of problems
so i'll work on it some more

230
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400

 

231
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,150

okay we got a few levels from the blaze

232
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
okay we got a few levels from the blaze
 

233
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,830
okay we got a few levels from the blaze
let's see what we get here

234
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
let's see what we get here
 

235
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,430
let's see what we get here
amazing i love it

236
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440

 

237
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,469

yeah so you can see i got the

238
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
yeah so you can see i got the
 

239
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,550
yeah so you can see i got the
caterpillar ripped out there

240
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
caterpillar ripped out there
 

241
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,629
caterpillar ripped out there
and i'm about to start rebuilding it

242
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
and i'm about to start rebuilding it
 

243
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,310
and i'm about to start rebuilding it
again takes a little time to do that

244
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
again takes a little time to do that
 

245
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,150
again takes a little time to do that
every time

246
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
every time
 

247
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,670
every time
but that's okay um

248
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
but that's okay um
 

249
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,029
but that's okay um
i've been a little bit stubborn about

250
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
i've been a little bit stubborn about
 

251
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,550
i've been a little bit stubborn about
not wanting to use a clock on this

252
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
not wanting to use a clock on this
 

253
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,110
not wanting to use a clock on this
project

254
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
project
 

255
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,230
project
but i'm giving in now i'm i'm just

256
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
but i'm giving in now i'm i'm just
 

257
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,350
but i'm giving in now i'm i'm just
i'm done with being stubborn and it's

258
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
i'm done with being stubborn and it's
 

259
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,310
i'm done with being stubborn and it's
not really

260
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
not really
 

261
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,590
not really
like i don't like clocks because they

262
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
like i don't like clocks because they
 

263
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,590
like i don't like clocks because they
cause lag but i can i can hook it up to

264
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
cause lag but i can i can hook it up to
 

265
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,469
cause lag but i can i can hook it up to
this button here

266
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
this button here
 

267
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,950
this button here
the light switch so that it's not

268
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
the light switch so that it's not
 

269
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,909
the light switch so that it's not
running if

270
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
running if
 

271
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,550
running if
if the lavas down like this and blaze

272
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
if the lavas down like this and blaze
 

273
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,830
if the lavas down like this and blaze
aren't spawning

274
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
aren't spawning
 

275
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,870
aren't spawning
so

276
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
so
 

277
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,390
so
i should i should just not be as

278
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
i should i should just not be as
 

279
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,230
i should i should just not be as
stubborn and just do this

280
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
stubborn and just do this
 

281
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,909
stubborn and just do this
um this comes with a few changes and a

282
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
um this comes with a few changes and a
 

283
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,430
um this comes with a few changes and a
few benefits as well

284
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
few benefits as well
 

285
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,350
few benefits as well
like i don't need to use sticky pistons

286
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
like i don't need to use sticky pistons
 

287
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,350
like i don't need to use sticky pistons
anymore i can use the regular ones

288
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
anymore i can use the regular ones
 

289
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,749
anymore i can use the regular ones
because i couldn't use the regular ones

290
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
because i couldn't use the regular ones
 

291
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,590
because i couldn't use the regular ones
before because sometimes the blaze would

292
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
before because sometimes the blaze would
 

293
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,990
before because sometimes the blaze would
glitch

294
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
glitch
 

295
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,510
glitch
into them and then that would totally

296
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
into them and then that would totally
 

297
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,510
into them and then that would totally
jam everything up but now it doesn't

298
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
jam everything up but now it doesn't
 

299
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,830
jam everything up but now it doesn't
matter because if they do that

300
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
matter because if they do that
 

301
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,590
matter because if they do that
just wait another second or two and

302
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
just wait another second or two and
 

303
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,950
just wait another second or two and
it'll fire again and they'll

304
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
it'll fire again and they'll
 

305
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,390
it'll fire again and they'll
they'll go through type thing and

306
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
they'll go through type thing and
 

307
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,390
they'll go through type thing and
the regular pistons won't cause them

308
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
the regular pistons won't cause them
 

309
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,070
the regular pistons won't cause them
suffocation damage as they go through

310
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
suffocation damage as they go through
 

311
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,469
suffocation damage as they go through
this

312
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
this
 

313
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,350
this
this belt here so that's a huge

314
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
this belt here so that's a huge
 

315
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,550
this belt here so that's a huge
improvement

316
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
improvement
 

317
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,309
improvement
um i'm gonna have to do a little bit

318
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
um i'm gonna have to do a little bit
 

319
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,670
um i'm gonna have to do a little bit
more redstone wiring though because

320
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
more redstone wiring though because
 

321
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,189
more redstone wiring though because
we're not using pressure plates anymore

322
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
we're not using pressure plates anymore
 

323
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,550
we're not using pressure plates anymore
and this this part here

324
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560

 

325
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,749

i'm not going to have pressure plates

326
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
i'm not going to have pressure plates
 

327
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,270
i'm not going to have pressure plates
here either i'm going to hook this up to

328
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
here either i'm going to hook this up to
 

329
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,790
here either i'm going to hook this up to
the clock because this is a

330
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
the clock because this is a
 

331
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,309
the clock because this is a
a bit of a trouble zone

332
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

333
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,790

so i just have three pistons

334
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
so i just have three pistons
 

335
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,790
so i just have three pistons
these two will get activated first and

336
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
these two will get activated first and
 

337
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,189
these two will get activated first and
then that one on a delay

338
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
then that one on a delay
 

339
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,029
then that one on a delay
like this and again they're regular

340
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
like this and again they're regular
 

341
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,670
like this and again they're regular
pistons so they won't cause suffocation

342
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
pistons so they won't cause suffocation
 

343
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,990
pistons so they won't cause suffocation
if the blades don't get pushed by the

344
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
if the blades don't get pushed by the
 

345
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,749
if the blades don't get pushed by the
arms

346
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
arms
 

347
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,270
arms
and yeah so that's a little update i'll

348
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
and yeah so that's a little update i'll
 

349
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,309
and yeah so that's a little update i'll
continue working

350
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
continue working
 

351
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,309
continue working
and show you what happens

352
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319

 

353
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,309

and here's another quick update i just

354
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
and here's another quick update i just
 

355
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,430
and here's another quick update i just
finished

356
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
finished
 

357
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,950
finished
redoing the the caterpillar belt here

358
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
redoing the the caterpillar belt here
 

359
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,790
redoing the the caterpillar belt here
with the regular pistons it looks a lot

360
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
with the regular pistons it looks a lot
 

361
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,230
with the regular pistons it looks a lot
narrower now

362
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
narrower now
 

363
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,070
narrower now
but we haven't had the redstone yet

364
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
but we haven't had the redstone yet
 

365
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,670
but we haven't had the redstone yet
which i'll do next

366
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
which i'll do next
 

367
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,870
which i'll do next
and give you a run through of them

368
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
and give you a run through of them
 

369
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,990
and give you a run through of them
because we don't have the blocks in

370
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
because we don't have the blocks in
 

371
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,230
because we don't have the blocks in
front of the pistons anymore so it seems

372
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
front of the pistons anymore so it seems
 

373
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,710
front of the pistons anymore so it seems
a lot more claustrophobic hopefully it

374
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
a lot more claustrophobic hopefully it
 

375
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,150
a lot more claustrophobic hopefully it
still looks cool

376
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
still looks cool
 

377
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,550
still looks cool
we should maybe go above actually let's

378
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
we should maybe go above actually let's
 

379
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,830
we should maybe go above actually let's
get out of here

380
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
get out of here
 

381
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,510
get out of here
see what it looks like from above now

382
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520

 

383
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,150

yeah so we'll put redstone beside it

384
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
yeah so we'll put redstone beside it
 

385
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,189
yeah so we'll put redstone beside it
it's not going to be

386
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
it's not going to be
 

387
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,110
it's not going to be
extremely compact the redstone because

388
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
extremely compact the redstone because
 

389
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,469
extremely compact the redstone because
it's

390
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
it's
 

391
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,990
it's
things are a bit tricky when you do a

392
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
things are a bit tricky when you do a
 

393
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,510
things are a bit tricky when you do a
diagonal pattern like that

394
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520

 

395
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,390

yeah it's still pretty cool okay well

396
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
yeah it's still pretty cool okay well
 

397
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,990
yeah it's still pretty cool okay well
i'll do the redstone and we'll see how

398
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
i'll do the redstone and we'll see how
 

399
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,469
i'll do the redstone and we'll see how
it looks

400
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
it looks
 

401
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,510
it looks
check it out man oh you picked a bad

402
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
check it out man oh you picked a bad
 

403
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,589
check it out man oh you picked a bad
place to spawn boy

404
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599

 

405
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,790

there's one spot you picked oh

406
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
there's one spot you picked oh
 

407
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,309
there's one spot you picked oh
right in the killing machine that's not

408
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
right in the killing machine that's not
 

409
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,309
right in the killing machine that's not
where you want to start out

410
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319

 

411
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,869

oh it doesn't kill him oh now i gotta

412
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
oh it doesn't kill him oh now i gotta
 

413
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,150
oh it doesn't kill him oh now i gotta
tap him

414
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
tap him
 

415
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,790
tap him
find out wow there's

416
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
find out wow there's
 

417
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,070
find out wow there's
wait a minute wait a minute does that

418
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
wait a minute wait a minute does that
 

419
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,909
wait a minute wait a minute does that
mean they have more health than blaze

420
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
mean they have more health than blaze
 

421
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,389
mean they have more health than blaze
what the heck two hits

422
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399

 

423
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,909

i'm gonna have to look at their health

424
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
i'm gonna have to look at their health
 

425
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,350
i'm gonna have to look at their health
after this that was weird i thought he

426
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
after this that was weird i thought he
 

427
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,029
after this that was weird i thought he
would have died long ago

428
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
would have died long ago
 

429
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,350
would have died long ago
anyway i've been working on the redstone

430
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
anyway i've been working on the redstone
 

431
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,910
anyway i've been working on the redstone
it is

432
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
it is
 

433
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,070
it is
pretty straightforward um

434
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
pretty straightforward um
 

435
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,829
pretty straightforward um
got a little bit of a problem right now

436
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
got a little bit of a problem right now
 

437
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,269
got a little bit of a problem right now
which i'll

438
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
which i'll
 

439
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,509
which i'll
hopefully figure out soon so both sides

440
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
hopefully figure out soon so both sides
 

441
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,990
hopefully figure out soon so both sides
this is the pattern they're connected

442
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
this is the pattern they're connected
 

443
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,949
this is the pattern they're connected
here both the sides

444
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
here both the sides
 

445
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,350
here both the sides
excuse me this one's at 1

446
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
excuse me this one's at 1
 

447
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,350
excuse me this one's at 1
then three then there's a four

448
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
then three then there's a four
 

449
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,949
then three then there's a four
one three four one three four

450
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
one three four one three four
 

451
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,430
one three four one three four
and then the other side it goes

452
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440

 

453
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,630

uh two four four two four four two four

454
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
uh two four four two four four two four
 

455
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,949
uh two four four two four four two four
four and that just makes it so

456
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
four and that just makes it so
 

457
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,190
four and that just makes it so
uh they alternate so that one fires

458
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
uh they alternate so that one fires
 

459
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,630
uh they alternate so that one fires
first then that one then that one and

460
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
first then that one then that one and
 

461
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,949
first then that one then that one and
that one all one tick of parts

462
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
that one all one tick of parts
 

463
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,470
that one all one tick of parts
um but the problem i'm having is uh

464
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
um but the problem i'm having is uh
 

465
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,350
um but the problem i'm having is uh
nothing unpowered and i don't see where

466
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
nothing unpowered and i don't see where
 

467
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,990
nothing unpowered and i don't see where
it would be backtracking in the currents

468
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
it would be backtracking in the currents
 

469
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,630
it would be backtracking in the currents
or not yet anyway so

470
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640

 

471
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,790

powers there that goes to that block

472
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
powers there that goes to that block
 

473
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,790
powers there that goes to that block
there's no redstone near that so that's

474
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
there's no redstone near that so that's
 

475
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,870
there's no redstone near that so that's
not it

476
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
not it
 

477
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,190
not it
um same deal with that you got a

478
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
um same deal with that you got a
 

479
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,030
um same deal with that you got a
repeater next to that block so it's not

480
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
repeater next to that block so it's not
 

481
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,870
repeater next to that block so it's not
sending power

482
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
sending power
 

483
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,470
sending power
through there anywhere um

484
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480

 

485
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,470

it's going to this block but it that

486
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
it's going to this block but it that
 

487
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,829
it's going to this block but it that
should just power it further

488
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
should just power it further
 

489
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,670
should just power it further
down oh wait wait wait wait

490
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680

 

491
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,110

it's very strange

492
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120

 

493
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,710

i know it's something simple i just

494
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
i know it's something simple i just
 

495
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,230
i know it's something simple i just
can't see it

496
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
can't see it
 

497
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,310
can't see it
why would that be causing it

498
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320

 

499
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,910

because this power is not getting back

500
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
because this power is not getting back
 

501
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,829
because this power is not getting back
this way

502
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839

 

503
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,870

i don't know

504
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880

 

505
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,870

this power is not getting through these

506
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
this power is not getting through these
 

507
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,910
this power is not getting through these
two repeaters

508
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
two repeaters
 

509
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,430
two repeaters
to over here it's only getting through

510
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
to over here it's only getting through
 

511
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,790
to over here it's only getting through
here

512
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800

 

513
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,509

oh there it is right there whoops

514
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
oh there it is right there whoops
 

515
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,870
oh there it is right there whoops
you see what was going on there because

516
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
you see what was going on there because
 

517
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,389
you see what was going on there because
it's going to this repeater and then it

518
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
it's going to this repeater and then it
 

519
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,350
it's going to this repeater and then it
goes back

520
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
goes back
 

521
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,870
goes back
to the wire and then it goes back to the

522
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
to the wire and then it goes back to the
 

523
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,389
to the wire and then it goes back to the
repeater and back to the wire and

524
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
repeater and back to the wire and
 

525
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,990
repeater and back to the wire and
it does a loop so if i okay i found it

526
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
it does a loop so if i okay i found it
 

527
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,430
it does a loop so if i okay i found it
yeah so that should fix that side

528
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
yeah so that should fix that side
 

529
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,069
yeah so that should fix that side
okay so what i got to do now is hook up

530
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
okay so what i got to do now is hook up
 

531
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,350
okay so what i got to do now is hook up
a mono stable

532
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
a mono stable
 

533
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,790
a mono stable
i don't have to but i want to

534
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
i don't have to but i want to
 

535
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,069
i don't have to but i want to
and then also a clock

536
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
and then also a clock
 

537
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,750
and then also a clock
in the middle here and hook that up to

538
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
in the middle here and hook that up to
 

539
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,949
in the middle here and hook that up to
these things

540
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
these things
 

541
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,470
these things
and i'll probably be covering this

542
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
and i'll probably be covering this
 

543
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,550
and i'll probably be covering this
redstone i'm not sure with what

544
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
redstone i'm not sure with what
 

545
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,310
redstone i'm not sure with what
if i want it to be visible or not i'm

546
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
if i want it to be visible or not i'm
 

547
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,910
if i want it to be visible or not i'm
not sure because it kind of looks cool

548
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
not sure because it kind of looks cool
 

549
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,670
not sure because it kind of looks cool
it's a nice pattern going on there

550
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680

 

551
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,269

yeah so this is getting a little scary

552
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
yeah so this is getting a little scary
 

553
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,310
yeah so this is getting a little scary
um

554
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320

 

555
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,910

should be up and working now i haven't

556
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
should be up and working now i haven't
 

557
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,230
should be up and working now i haven't
tested it on the blaze yet

558
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
tested it on the blaze yet
 

559
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,509
tested it on the blaze yet
we'll do that soon but i got a clock in

560
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
we'll do that soon but i got a clock in
 

561
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,590
we'll do that soon but i got a clock in
um it is lagging the game a lot

562
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600

 

563
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,470

a lot a lot i'll probably try a few

564
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
a lot a lot i'll probably try a few
 

565
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,590
a lot a lot i'll probably try a few
things here to

566
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
things here to
 

567
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,750
things here to
decrease that i think if you put

568
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
decrease that i think if you put
 

569
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,590
decrease that i think if you put
pumpkins like glowing pumpkins under

570
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
pumpkins like glowing pumpkins under
 

571
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,110
pumpkins like glowing pumpkins under
these repeaters it might cause

572
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
these repeaters it might cause
 

573
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,750
these repeaters it might cause
less lag because it doesn't have to do a

574
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
less lag because it doesn't have to do a
 

575
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,949
less lag because it doesn't have to do a
lighting update then

576
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
lighting update then
 

577
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,990
lighting update then
because the pumpkins emit way more light

578
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
because the pumpkins emit way more light
 

579
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,110
because the pumpkins emit way more light
than the repeaters when they're powered

580
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
than the repeaters when they're powered
 

581
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,750
than the repeaters when they're powered
so i i'm hoping that'll help the leg

582
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
so i i'm hoping that'll help the leg
 

583
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,110
so i i'm hoping that'll help the leg
issue

584
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
issue
 

585
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,550
issue
um

586
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560

 

587
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,470

it's pretty cool though this is the

588
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
it's pretty cool though this is the
 

589
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,670
it's pretty cool though this is the
clock here i sort of went for a fancy

590
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
clock here i sort of went for a fancy
 

591
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,389
clock here i sort of went for a fancy
look

592
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
look
 

593
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,310
look
instead of function it could be

594
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
instead of function it could be
 

595
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,509
instead of function it could be
delayed a lot more too but i don't

596
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
delayed a lot more too but i don't
 

597
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,069
delayed a lot more too but i don't
keep it like this for now and that just

598
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
keep it like this for now and that just
 

599
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,990
keep it like this for now and that just
branches off over here which goes

600
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
branches off over here which goes
 

601
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,829
branches off over here which goes
to both sides

602
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
to both sides
 

603
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,030
to both sides
both both sets of pistons and then

604
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040

 

605
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,629

also goes to up here which is

606
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
also goes to up here which is
 

607
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:13,590
also goes to up here which is
for that stuff

608
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600

 

609
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,910

and i put in a cheaty

610
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
and i put in a cheaty
 

611
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,870
and i put in a cheaty
monostable circuit right there i don't

612
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
monostable circuit right there i don't
 

613
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,350
monostable circuit right there i don't
know if

614
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
know if
 

615
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,030
know if
many people know about that trick i just

616
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
many people know about that trick i just
 

617
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,470
many people know about that trick i just
kind of stumbled on it right now

618
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480

 

619
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,110

it's a sticky piston that goes up which

620
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
it's a sticky piston that goes up which
 

621
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,190
it's a sticky piston that goes up which
causes it to

622
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
causes it to
 

623
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,990
causes it to
really shorten the pulse here i'll try

624
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
really shorten the pulse here i'll try
 

625
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,870
really shorten the pulse here i'll try
to demonstrate it

626
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880

 

627
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,269

so without the piston

628
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279

 

629
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,310

the pulse is like this look look how

630
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
the pulse is like this look look how
 

631
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,710
the pulse is like this look look how
many repeaters are lit up it's it's ten

632
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
many repeaters are lit up it's it's ten
 

633
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,150
many repeaters are lit up it's it's ten
ticks from the button

634
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
ticks from the button
 

635
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,509
ticks from the button
so that's two and a half repeaters set

636
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
so that's two and a half repeaters set
 

637
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,870
so that's two and a half repeaters set
at four

638
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880

 

639
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,150

um do the same

640
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
um do the same
 

641
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,550
um do the same
thing with this little cheaty thing

642
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560

 

643
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,710

watch out it'll start at two and a half

644
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
watch out it'll start at two and a half
 

645
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,670
watch out it'll start at two and a half
and then it'll get

646
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
and then it'll get
 

647
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,150
and then it'll get
shortened when it goes through that

648
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160

 

649
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,430

now it's just one repeater if we lower

650
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
now it's just one repeater if we lower
 

651
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,949
now it's just one repeater if we lower
these we might be able to see exactly

652
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
these we might be able to see exactly
 

653
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,069
these we might be able to see exactly
how long it is

654
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079

 

655
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,670

get these all down to one oh now that

656
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
get these all down to one oh now that
 

657
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,269
get these all down to one oh now that
oh that might be a way i can shut it off

658
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
oh that might be a way i can shut it off
 

659
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,670
oh that might be a way i can shut it off
who knows

660
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680

 

661
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,069

um okay well i gotta set these at least

662
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
um okay well i gotta set these at least
 

663
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:53,030
um okay well i gotta set these at least
to two then

664
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040

 

665
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,350

what's gonna do now now it's fine

666
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
what's gonna do now now it's fine
 

667
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,790
what's gonna do now now it's fine
you see though it's still only one

668
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
you see though it's still only one
 

669
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,110
you see though it's still only one
repeater so it's it's a quick false

670
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120

 

671
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,990

that doesn't stay on very long so that's

672
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
that doesn't stay on very long so that's
 

673
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,829
that doesn't stay on very long so that's
a little cheaty monostable circuit the

674
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839
a little cheaty monostable circuit the
 

675
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,509
a little cheaty monostable circuit the
only thing about it it only works

676
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
only thing about it it only works
 

677
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,829
only thing about it it only works
certain directions it's a little bit

678

680
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
iffy
 

681
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,430
iffy
um wow those things are going crazy

682
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
um wow those things are going crazy
 

683
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,269
um wow those things are going crazy

which is good but when we get the blaze

686
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
which is good but when we get the blaze
 

687
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,389

we are gonna have problems for sure

690
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079

 

691
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,629

they don't need to be firing all that

692
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
they don't need to be firing all that
 

693
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,110
they don't need to be firing all that

694
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120

gotta hook up a t-flip flop

706
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
gotta hook up a t-flip flop
 

707
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,509
gotta hook up a t-flip flop
to two o'clock somehow to turn it on or

708
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
to two o'clock somehow to turn it on or
 

709
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,030
to two o'clock somehow to turn it on or
off

710
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
off
 

711
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,470
off
um let's try this out with blaze

712
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480

 

713
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,430

still working yep let's get it going

714
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440

 

715
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,550

and this is going to cause lag let's

716
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
and this is going to cause lag let's
 

717
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,150
and this is going to cause lag let's
we'll to see if they go through this

718
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
we'll to see if they go through this
 

719
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,470
we'll to see if they go through this
thing okay or not accidentally spilled

720
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
thing okay or not accidentally spilled
 

721
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,910
thing okay or not accidentally spilled
some lava there too which is

722
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
some lava there too which is
 

723
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,030
some lava there too which is
slowly disappearing

724
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040

 

725
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,829

let's head down a little lower

726
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839

 

727
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,670

big project spending lots of time on

728
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
big project spending lots of time on
 

729
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:31,670
big project spending lots of time on
this

730
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680

 

731
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,949

he didn't go

732
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959

 

733
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,990

why is he not going

734
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000

 

735
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,629

okay maybe the mono stable is not a good

736
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
okay maybe the mono stable is not a good
 

737
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,350
okay maybe the mono stable is not a good
thing

738
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
thing
 

739
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,949
thing
they're not getting pushed at all for

740
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
they're not getting pushed at all for
 

741
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,269
they're not getting pushed at all for
some reason

742
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
some reason
 

743
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,110
some reason
so we'll get rid of that

744
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120

 

745
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,670

and reset this

746
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680

 

747
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,949

oh i did it again duh

748
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
oh i did it again duh
 

749
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,150
oh i did it again duh
you gotta wait for it

750
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160

 

751
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,429

oh they're looking at us through the

752
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
oh they're looking at us through the
 

753
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:20,870
oh they're looking at us through the
pistons that's not good um

754
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880

 

755
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,350

and what the heck they're not moving at

756
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
and what the heck they're not moving at
 

757
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,309
and what the heck they're not moving at
all

758
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319

 

759
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,990

i gotta increase the delay between

760
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
i gotta increase the delay between
 

761
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,110
i gotta increase the delay between
pistons maybe

762
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
pistons maybe
 

763
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,630
pistons maybe
could be because they're tracking us

764
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
could be because they're tracking us
 

765
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,710
could be because they're tracking us
okay i'm gonna

766
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
okay i'm gonna
 

767
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,950
okay i'm gonna
i'm gonna leave the area and retry this

768
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960

 

769
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,270

let them despawn

770
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280

 

771
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,510

okay let's try it again uh we're gonna

772
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
okay let's try it again uh we're gonna
 

773
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,750
okay let's try it again uh we're gonna
stay up here this time

774
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
stay up here this time
 

775
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,110
stay up here this time
so that they can't see us and then later

776
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
so that they can't see us and then later
 

777
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,950
so that they can't see us and then later
we'll put blocks around the pistons once

778
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
we'll put blocks around the pistons once
 

779
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,470
we'll put blocks around the pistons once
we're sure this is gonna work

780
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
we're sure this is gonna work
 

781
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,230
we're sure this is gonna work
i'm a little worried because i just

782
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
i'm a little worried because i just
 

783
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,750
i'm a little worried because i just
spent a lot of time on this

784
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
spent a lot of time on this
 

785
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,710
spent a lot of time on this
and if it doesn't work i'm gonna be out

786
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
and if it doesn't work i'm gonna be out
 

787
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,190
and if it doesn't work i'm gonna be out
of ideas again

788
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200

 

789
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,630

i don't know why it wouldn't work they

790
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
i don't know why it wouldn't work they
 

791
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,110
i don't know why it wouldn't work they
should move

792
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120

 

793
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:25,510

what is it doing

794
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520

 

795
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,029

wait is that one going before

796
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039

 

797
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,390

it's almost like i got the timing wrong

798
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400

 

799
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,310

i think that's what it is

800
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320

 

801
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,150

pretty sure that piston fired before

802
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
pretty sure that piston fired before
 

803
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,750
pretty sure that piston fired before
that one

804
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760

 

805
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,710

huh i bet you that's what it is okay i

806
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
huh i bet you that's what it is okay i
 

807
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,549
huh i bet you that's what it is okay i
think i see the problem

808
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
think i see the problem
 

809
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,470
think i see the problem
i spot another problem there's a piston

810
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
i spot another problem there's a piston
 

811
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,990
i spot another problem there's a piston
missing here apparently

812
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
missing here apparently
 

813
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,350
missing here apparently
supposed to be one right there

814
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360

 

815
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,270

yeah i'm pretty sure that was a problem

816
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
yeah i'm pretty sure that was a problem
 

817
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,870
yeah i'm pretty sure that was a problem
i haven't tried it yet like with the

818
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
i haven't tried it yet like with the
 

819
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,029
i haven't tried it yet like with the
blaze but it looks like it's firing

820
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
blaze but it looks like it's firing
 

821
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,870
blaze but it looks like it's firing
a lot better now that i've added an

822
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
a lot better now that i've added an
 

823
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,029
a lot better now that i've added an
extra piston that was

824
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
extra piston that was
 

825
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,789
extra piston that was
that was what was throwing the timing

826
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
that was what was throwing the timing
 

827
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,789
that was what was throwing the timing
out too because that adds an extra two

828
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
out too because that adds an extra two
 

829
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,870
out too because that adds an extra two
ticks to that side

830
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
ticks to that side
 

831
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,350
ticks to that side
um and you can tell it looks a lot

832
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
um and you can tell it looks a lot
 

833
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,990
um and you can tell it looks a lot
better now

834
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
better now
 

835
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,669
better now
when it's going let's get the clock

836
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
when it's going let's get the clock
 

837
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,029
when it's going let's get the clock
going

838
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
going
 

839
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,070
going
let's hop up oh i can't

840
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
let's hop up oh i can't
 

841
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,870
let's hop up oh i can't
um put a little extra glass there

842
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
um put a little extra glass there
 

843
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,350
um put a little extra glass there
look at this this looks a lot better now

844
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360

 

845
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,230

yeah you can tell that's right now and

846
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
yeah you can tell that's right now and
 

847
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,750
yeah you can tell that's right now and
that's also why they were getting stuck

848
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
that's also why they were getting stuck
 

849
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,110
that's also why they were getting stuck
right at the drop there because there

850
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
right at the drop there because there
 

851
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,710
right at the drop there because there
was no piston for him

852
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
was no piston for him
 

853
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,310
was no piston for him
so let's get the blaze going and i'm

854
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
so let's get the blaze going and i'm
 

855
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,549
so let's get the blaze going and i'm
pretty sure it'll work this time

856
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559

 

857
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,310

we can only hope

858
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320

 

859
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,350

so much so much lag though i don't like

860
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
so much so much lag though i don't like
 

861
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,190
so much so much lag though i don't like
that

862
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
that
 

863
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,909
that
but only when this is running

864
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919

 

865
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,590

which is probably when i'll be aft

866
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
which is probably when i'll be aft
 

867
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,950
which is probably when i'll be aft
anyway so it won't really annoy me but

868
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960

 

869
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,270

i'm gonna try the extra lighting and see

870
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
i'm gonna try the extra lighting and see
 

871
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,390
i'm gonna try the extra lighting and see
if that helps

872
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
if that helps
 

873
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,070
if that helps
okay there we go yay

874
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080

 

875
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,190

what's wrong with him he's going on his

876
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
what's wrong with him he's going on his
 

877
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,470
what's wrong with him he's going on his
own okay

878
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480

 

879
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,789

um

880
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799

 

881
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,870

they seem to be seem to be having

882
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
they seem to be seem to be having
 

883
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,830
they seem to be seem to be having
trouble getting up there

884
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840

 

885
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,430

uh

886
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440

 

887
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,789

it would help if i sync the two together

888
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
it would help if i sync the two together
 

889
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,870
it would help if i sync the two together
which i may do i just like the the oh

890
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
which i may do i just like the the oh
 

891
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,110
which i may do i just like the the oh
timer thing that looks cool you can't

892
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
timer thing that looks cool you can't
 

893
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,390
timer thing that looks cool you can't
really sink them

894
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
really sink them
 

895
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,549
really sink them
well tougher to sink them

896
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
well tougher to sink them
 

897
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,630
well tougher to sink them
doing it that way

898
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
doing it that way
 

899
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,470
doing it that way
um they're getting there though

900
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
um they're getting there though
 

901
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,909
um they're getting there though
the thing is if it misfires now it

902
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
the thing is if it misfires now it
 

903
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,110
the thing is if it misfires now it
doesn't really matter because they don't

904
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
doesn't really matter because they don't
 

905
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,789
doesn't really matter because they don't
take damage from it

906
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799

 

907
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,029

i may also put back the fence in the

908
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
i may also put back the fence in the
 

909
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,310
i may also put back the fence in the
half slab trick

910
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320

 

911
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,029

although i don't know if that would help

912
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039

 

913
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,990

yeah yeah it should actually um

914
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000

 

915
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,830

okay let's go down see if they're still

916
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
okay let's go down see if they're still
 

917
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,190
okay let's go down see if they're still
tracking us

918
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
tracking us
 

919
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,950
tracking us
through the pistons now that we've got

920
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
through the pistons now that we've got
 

921
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,990
through the pistons now that we've got
that extra glass

922
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000

 

923
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,909

i think when the arm moves here that's

924
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
i think when the arm moves here that's
 

925
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:04,149
i think when the arm moves here that's
when they can see you

926
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159

 

927
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:14,549

frames are not doing down to 27 now

928
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559

 

929
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,590

and i do not have particles on yeah

930
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
and i do not have particles on yeah
 

931
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:25,190
and i do not have particles on yeah
they're really getting jammed there now

932
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200

 

933
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,750

okay well i'll watch it for a bit

934
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760

 

935
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,110

they're not getting jammed in there at

936
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,120
they're not getting jammed in there at
 

937
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,789
they're not getting jammed in there at
all

938
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799

 

939
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,230

all right

940
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240

 

941
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,510

yeah you know what this thing's doing

942
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
yeah you know what this thing's doing
 

943
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,510
yeah you know what this thing's doing
pretty good i i'm impressed i thought it

944
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
pretty good i i'm impressed i thought it
 

945
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,710
pretty good i i'm impressed i thought it
would have been a lot

946
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
would have been a lot
 

947
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,590
would have been a lot
a lot worse at this point we're at over

948
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,600
a lot worse at this point we're at over
 

949
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,870
a lot worse at this point we're at over
200 blaze

950
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
200 blaze
 

951
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,909
200 blaze
at like 220 there plus there's a few

952
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
at like 220 there plus there's a few
 

953
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,710
at like 220 there plus there's a few
more down

954
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
more down
 

955
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,230
more down
and uh recording my frame rates at about

956
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
and uh recording my frame rates at about
 

957
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,590
and uh recording my frame rates at about
10 to 15

958
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
10 to 15
 

959
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,270
10 to 15
and when i'm not recording it's it's

960
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
and when i'm not recording it's it's
 

961
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,190
and when i'm not recording it's it's
over 30 so

962
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
over 30 so
 

963
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,110
over 30 so
that's definitely tolerable at this

964
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
that's definitely tolerable at this
 

965
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,350
that's definitely tolerable at this
point and i would probably

966
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
point and i would probably
 

967
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,470
point and i would probably
not want to go over 250 anyway

968
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
not want to go over 250 anyway
 

969
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,909
not want to go over 250 anyway
because you like you can do two harvests

970
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
because you like you can do two harvests
 

971
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,750
because you like you can do two harvests
and be level 50

972
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
and be level 50
 

973
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,909
and be level 50
if you if you get them at that point

974
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
if you if you get them at that point
 

975
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,830
if you if you get them at that point
which is what i would probably do

976
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
which is what i would probably do
 

977
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,390
which is what i would probably do
so should work should work out fine

978
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
so should work should work out fine
 

979
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,909
so should work should work out fine
that's what i'm trying to say

980
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
that's what i'm trying to say
 

981
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,710
that's what i'm trying to say
um i want to hook up a dispenser with

982
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
um i want to hook up a dispenser with
 

983
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,630
um i want to hook up a dispenser with
poison potions

984
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
poison potions
 

985
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,549
poison potions
and bring some splash potions here too

986
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
and bring some splash potions here too
 

987
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,870
and bring some splash potions here too
because that'll be a lot simpler

988
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
because that'll be a lot simpler
 

989
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,430
because that'll be a lot simpler
um i'm going to attempt this while

990
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
um i'm going to attempt this while
 

991
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,350
um i'm going to attempt this while
recording i hope but

992
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
recording i hope but
 

993
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,470
recording i hope but
you know what no i'm going to

994
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
you know what no i'm going to
 

995
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,430
you know what no i'm going to
well i can't it's going to say it's

996
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
well i can't it's going to say it's
 

997
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,830
well i can't it's going to say it's
going to make a backup but i can't

998
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
going to make a backup but i can't
 

999
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,149
going to make a backup but i can't
um

1000
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159

 

1001
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,630

oh i probably shouldn't do that i'm just

1002
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
oh i probably shouldn't do that i'm just
 

1003
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,230
oh i probably shouldn't do that i'm just
worried i'm gonna freeze and then i'm

1004
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
worried i'm gonna freeze and then i'm
 

1005
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,310
worried i'm gonna freeze and then i'm
gonna lose my world again

1006
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320

 

1007
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,510

see how many die

1008
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520

 

1009
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,870

there's a few dying oh that's not bad at

1010
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
there's a few dying oh that's not bad at
 

1011
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,549
there's a few dying oh that's not bad at
all that we only lost like four or five

1012
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
all that we only lost like four or five
 

1013
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,310
all that we only lost like four or five
and that's from them going down the cone

1014
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
and that's from them going down the cone
 

1015
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,630
and that's from them going down the cone
not from our conveyor belt

1016
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
not from our conveyor belt
 

1017
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,750
not from our conveyor belt
so excellent uh

1018
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
so excellent uh
 

1019
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,430
so excellent uh
hitting them like this though it takes a

1020
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
hitting them like this though it takes a
 

1021
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,950
hitting them like this though it takes a
