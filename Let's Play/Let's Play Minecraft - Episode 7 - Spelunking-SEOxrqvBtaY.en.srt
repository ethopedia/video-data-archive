00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:27,449
comments about the road system someone
 

19
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,389
comments about the road system someone
pointed out that if these if an empty

20
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
pointed out that if these if an empty

boat passes over these pressure plates

22
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:35,540
boat passes over these pressure plates
 

23
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,000
boat passes over these pressure plates
it's not going to detect it and send the

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,010
it's not going to detect it and send the
 

25
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,990
it's not going to detect it and send the
boat back to make up for it and then

26
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
boat back to make up for it and then
 

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,100
boat back to make up for it and then
some other people said that even if it

28
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,110
some other people said that even if it
 

29
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,160
some other people said that even if it
was to detect it somehow it would just

30
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,170
was to detect it somehow it would just
 

31
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,410
was to detect it somehow it would just
cause an infinite loop with the boats so

32
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,420
cause an infinite loop with the boats so
 

33
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,750
cause an infinite loop with the boats so
I would like to thank you guys for

34
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760

I would like to thank you guys for
pointing that out to me I have I didn't

36
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:55,620
pointing that out to me I have I didn't
 

37
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,260
pointing that out to me I have I didn't
think about those things and I don't

38
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,270
think about those things and I don't
 

39
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,369
think about those things and I don't
think there's any solution to that

40
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:01,379
think there's any solution to that
 

41
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,679
think there's any solution to that
problem although it's not really a

42
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:06,689
problem although it's not really a
 

43
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,109
problem although it's not really a
problem because I think even if lots of

44
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
problem because I think even if lots of
 

45
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,420
problem because I think even if lots of
extra what is a problem but even if

46
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,430
extra what is a problem but even if
 

47
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,719
extra what is a problem but even if
extra boats did pile up they would go

48
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:20,729
extra boats did pile up they would go
 

49
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,539
extra boats did pile up they would go
down in the stream and then they would

50
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:23,549
down in the stream and then they would
 

51
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,940
down in the stream and then they would
start piling up the shaft and you would

52
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:25,950
start piling up the shaft and you would
 

53
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,920
start piling up the shaft and you would
have a huge buffer before it causes any

54
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:27,930
have a huge buffer before it causes any
 

55
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,410
have a huge buffer before it causes any
actual problems

56
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:31,420

 

57
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,300

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,630
assuming of course that water source is

133
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,560
so yeah what we're going to do is we're
just going to go to this island here and

134
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:37,570
just going to go to this island here and
 

135
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,120
just going to go to this island here and
I don't know for sure but I'm guessing

136
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,130
I don't know for sure but I'm guessing
 

137
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,850
I don't know for sure but I'm guessing
we're going to find a cave system

138
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:42,860
we're going to find a cave system
 

139
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:49,600
we're going to find a cave system
somewhere hopefully and there's a

140
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:49,610
somewhere hopefully and there's a
 

141
00:04:49,610 --> 00:05:06,850
somewhere hopefully and there's a
creeper of course so we're just going to

142
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:06,860
creeper of course so we're just going to
 

143
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,990
creeper of course so we're just going to
explore this island until we find that

144
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,000
explore this island until we find that
 

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,380
explore this island until we find that
cave system this is already looking like

146
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,390
cave system this is already looking like
 

147
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,990
cave system this is already looking like

plan since I'm probably never going to
 

373
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,230
plan since I'm probably never going to
go mining like that ever again because

374
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,240
go mining like that ever again because
 

375
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,310
go mining like that ever again because
it doesn't work well on hard

levels above bedrock and I'm going to
 

395
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,520
levels above bedrock and I'm going to
mine out a huge room underneath it and

396
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:51,530
mine out a huge room underneath it and
 

397
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,270
mine out a huge room underneath it and
it's going to work as a mob catcher so

00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,280
it's going to work as a mob catcher so
 

399
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,480
it's going to work as a mob catcher so
I'll work on that slowly over time as I

400
00:22:59,480 --> 00:22:59,490
I'll work on that slowly over time as I
 

401
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,070
I'll work on that slowly over time as I
need resources I'll clear out the room

and at the same time I'll be building a
 

405
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,560
and at the same time I'll be building a
mob catcher so that should work out good

406
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:08,570
mob catcher so that should work out good
 

407
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,830
mob catcher so that should work out good
and just going to be using ladders to

408

426
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:52,950
can see I'm pretty deep now and I got
 

427
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,540

and I know what you're thinking and no

432
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:05,610
and I know what you're thinking and no
 

433

I'm not an idiot the reason why you

434
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:11,159
I'm not an idiot the reason why you
 

435
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,740
I'm not an idiot the reason why you
shouldn't dig straight down ever is

436
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:12,750
shouldn't dig straight down ever is
 

437
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,370
shouldn't dig straight down ever is
because you will fall in lava but as

438
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:16,380
because you will fall in lava but as
 

439
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,070
because you will fall in lava but as
long as you dig like sometimes you don't

440
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,080
long as you dig like sometimes you don't
 

441
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,419
long as you dig like sometimes you don't
think the block you're standing on

442
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:20,429
think the block you're standing on
 

443
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:24,230
think the block you're standing on
you'll be fine and that's what I've been

444
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
you'll be fine and that's what I've been
 

445
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,049
you'll be fine and that's what I've been
doing and that looks like there is a

446
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:30,059
doing and that looks like there is a
 

447
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:35,990
doing and that looks like there is a
huge lake under there which is good

448
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
huge lake under there which is good
 

449
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,610
huge lake under there which is good
actually because I need lava but just do

450
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:43,620
actually because I need lava but just do
 

451
00:24:43,620 --> 00:25:00,350
actually because I need lava but just do
max nice and I think this is level eight

452
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:00,360
max nice and I think this is level eight
 

453
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:11,680
max nice and I think this is level eight
or something where you'll find lava so

454
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:11,690

 

455
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,710

this is probably the level I'll make the

456
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:15,720
this is probably the level I'll make the
 

457
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:23,240
this is probably the level I'll make the
mob trap can't quite see which way I am

458
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,250
mob trap can't quite see which way I am
 

459
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:30,379
mob trap can't quite see which way I am
so speed going what I'm going to do is

460
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:30,389
so speed going what I'm going to do is
 

461
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:34,039
so speed going what I'm going to do is
I'm going to put ladders up here and get

462
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:34,049
I'm going to put ladders up here and get
 

463
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:40,159
I'm going to put ladders up here and get
a base settled I hope have enough enough

464
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:40,169
a base settled I hope have enough enough
 

465
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:50,729
a base settled I hope have enough enough
sticks I don't think I do

466
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:50,739

 

467
00:25:50,739 --> 00:26:02,170

this is not going to be good

468
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:02,180

 

469
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:20,080

come on make it make it 5 4 3 2 1 ah now

470
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,090

 

471
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:31,070

yeah that works too okay so I'm going to

472
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,080
yeah that works too okay so I'm going to
 

473
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,490
yeah that works too okay so I'm going to
mark which way I need to go with a torch

474
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:33,500
mark which way I need to go with a torch
 

475
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:42,380
mark which way I need to go with a torch
so that I can see it down there and make

476
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,390
so that I can see it down there and make
 

477
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,700
so that I can see it down there and make
a little building around this so I don't

478
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:43,710
a little building around this so I don't
 

479
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:49,550
a little building around this so I don't
fall down it for some reason not for

480
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:49,560
fall down it for some reason not for
 

481
00:26:49,560 --> 00:27:08,950
fall down it for some reason not for
some reason out of stupidity all right

482
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960

 

483
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,390

and and that's where I'm gonna end the

486
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:19,650
and and that's where I'm gonna end the
 

487
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,640
and and that's where I'm gonna end the
video so we got a mind started Fiverr
