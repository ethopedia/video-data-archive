months ago abouts
I was looking up what people's favorite

164
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:50,460
I was looking up what people's favorite
 

165
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,500
I was looking up what people's favorite
colors statistically you know turns out

166
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,510
colors statistically you know turns out
 

167
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,140
colors statistically you know turns out
the majority of people there was a site

168
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,150
the majority of people there was a site
 

169
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,880
the majority of people there was a site
that had information like people were

170
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:58,890
that had information like people were
 

171
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,600
that had information like people were
voting based on their age and gender for

172
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,610
voting based on their age and gender for
 

173
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,200
voting based on their age and gender for
males like 60% of people prefer blue and

174
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,210
males like 60% of people prefer blue and
 

175
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,510
males like 60% of people prefer blue and
like for females like 40 or so prefer

176
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:08,520
like for females like 40 or so prefer
 

177
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,420
like for females like 40 or so prefer
blue as their favorite color so the vast

178
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:11,430
blue as their favorite color so the vast
 

179
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,220
blue as their favorite color so the vast
majority of people like blue as their

180
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,230
majority of people like blue as their
 

181
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,140
majority of people like blue as their
favorite color so I thought for this

182
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,150
favorite color so I thought for this
 

183
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,870
favorite color so I thought for this
path let's make it blue and people will

184
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:17,880
path let's make it blue and people will
 

185
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,190
path let's make it blue and people will
like it statistically at least and so I

186
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,200
like it statistically at least and so I
 

187
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,050
like it statistically at least and so I
got that coming out here and actually

188
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,060
got that coming out here and actually
 

189
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,520
got that coming out here and actually
I've been using that rule for a lot of

190
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,530
I've been using that rule for a lot of
 

191
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,170
I've been using that rule for a lot of
things in Minecraft

192
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,180
things in Minecraft
 

193
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,490
things in Minecraft
well it's not a rule it's just

194
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:28,500
well it's not a rule it's just
 

195
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,560
well it's not a rule it's just
statistics that I thought were

196
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:30,570
statistics that I thought were
 

197
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,030
statistics that I thought were
interesting

198
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,040
interesting
 

199
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,610
interesting
so this this area here this is a bit

200
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:34,620
so this this area here this is a bit
 

201
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,080
so this this area here this is a bit
further away from the islands and I need

202
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,090
further away from the islands and I need
 

203
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,909
further away from the islands and I need
to make it but it lines up pretty nice

204
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
to make it but it lines up pretty nice
 

205
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,650
to make it but it lines up pretty nice
in this spot is 100 X and 300 Zed so a

206
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:42,660
in this spot is 100 X and 300 Zed so a
 

207
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,700
in this spot is 100 X and 300 Zed so a
nice bounce number that I'll be able to

208
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,710
nice bounce number that I'll be able to
 

209
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,080
nice bounce number that I'll be able to
work off of easily as we're building

210
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,090
work off of easily as we're building
 

211
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,490
work off of easily as we're building
this today and I have like I put I put

212
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:52,500
this today and I have like I put I put
 

213
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,590
this today and I have like I put I put
many hours into this is designing this

214
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:54,600
many hours into this is designing this
 

215
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,499
many hours into this is designing this
but also many hours into gathering the

216
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:57,509
but also many hours into gathering the
 

217
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:59,480
but also many hours into gathering the
materials need to build it today and I

218
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,490
materials need to build it today and I
 

219
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,390
materials need to build it today and I
think I got everything we need here good

220
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
think I got everything we need here good
 

221
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,189
think I got everything we need here good
to go so let's get to it enter the ender

222
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
to go so let's get to it enter the ender
 

223
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,379
to go so let's get to it enter the ender
ender 2.0 first thing we're gonna be

224
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:09,389
ender 2.0 first thing we're gonna be
 

225
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,400
ender 2.0 first thing we're gonna be
building is the room down below where we

226
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,410
building is the room down below where we
 

227
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,550
building is the room down below where we
have like our enchanting table and vil

228
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
have like our enchanting table and vil
 

229
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,339
have like our enchanting table and vil
chests that kind of stuff then above

230
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:19,349
chests that kind of stuff then above
 

231
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,050
chests that kind of stuff then above
that is where the Enderman are actually

232
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,060
that is where the Enderman are actually
 

233
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,230
that is where the Enderman are actually
gonna land and then above that way up in

234
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
gonna land and then above that way up in
 

235
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,120
gonna land and then above that way up in
the sky is gonna be all the spawning

236
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,130
the sky is gonna be all the spawning
 

237
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,249
the sky is gonna be all the spawning
pads that they fall down off we're gonna

238
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:28,259
pads that they fall down off we're gonna
 

239
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,350
pads that they fall down off we're gonna
do a piston pusher setup so a couple

240
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
do a piston pusher setup so a couple
 

241
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,180
do a piston pusher setup so a couple
things if you are trying to follow what

242
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,190
things if you are trying to follow what
 

243
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,589
things if you are trying to follow what
I'm doing here and you're building your

244
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:36,599
I'm doing here and you're building your
 

245
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,439
I'm doing here and you're building your
own Enderman farm keep in mind you want

246
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:39,449
own Enderman farm keep in mind you want
 

247
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,439
own Enderman farm keep in mind you want
to build your spawning pads and that at

248
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:42,449
to build your spawning pads and that at
 

249
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,260
to build your spawning pads and that at
least 128 blocks away from the main

250
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,270
least 128 blocks away from the main
 

251
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,110
least 128 blocks away from the main
island over there so you want your path

252
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
island over there so you want your path
 

253
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,040
island over there so you want your path
to come out that far

254
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,050
to come out that far
 

255
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,890
to come out that far
so that's Enderman won't be spawning on

256
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:51,900
so that's Enderman won't be spawning on
 

257
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,600
so that's Enderman won't be spawning on
the island and instead they all spawn

258
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:53,610
the island and instead they all spawn
 

259
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,629
the island and instead they all spawn
inside your trap that you build and also

260
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
inside your trap that you build and also
 

261
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,460
inside your trap that you build and also
you want to build it as low as possible

262
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:58,470
you want to build it as low as possible
 

263
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,620
you want to build it as low as possible
if you look at my y-coordinate here I

264
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:00,630
if you look at my y-coordinate here I
 

265
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,149
if you look at my y-coordinate here I
met my feet are at y1 because the lower

266
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:05,159
met my feet are at y1 because the lower
 

267
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,980
met my feet are at y1 because the lower
you build your farm the better the

268
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:06,990
you build your farm the better the
 

269
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,200
you build your farm the better the
spawning rates are gonna be minecraft

270
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,210
spawning rates are gonna be minecraft
 

271
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,500
spawning rates are gonna be minecraft
that checks a 17 by 17 chunk area

272
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:12,510
that checks a 17 by 17 chunk area
 

273
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,279
that checks a 17 by 17 chunk area
centered on your player and every 16

274
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,289
centered on your player and every 16
 

275
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,339
centered on your player and every 16
blocks you build up is another 16 blocks

276
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:19,349
blocks you build up is another 16 blocks
 

277
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,899
blocks you build up is another 16 blocks
vertically that gets checked every time

278
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:20,909
vertically that gets checked every time
 

279
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:24,580
vertically that gets checked every time
it tries to place an internment so I

280
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:24,590
it tries to place an internment so I
 

281
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,860
it tries to place an internment so I
think if I just build 16 blocks up here

282
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:27,870
think if I just build 16 blocks up here
 

283
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,990
think if I just build 16 blocks up here
my spawn rates get cut in half because

284
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
my spawn rates get cut in half because
 

285
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,689
my spawn rates get cut in half because
there's twice as much space vertically

286
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:32,699
there's twice as much space vertically
 

287
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,690
there's twice as much space vertically
it needs to check so try to keep it as

288
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:35,700
it needs to check so try to keep it as
 

289
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,100
it needs to check so try to keep it as
low as you can the way I got down here

290
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,110
low as you can the way I got down here
 

291
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,219
low as you can the way I got down here
is by propelling down water and then

292
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:40,229
is by propelling down water and then
 

293
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:40,670
is by propelling down water and then
placing

294
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:40,680
placing
 

295
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,390
placing
blocks on my way down and I got to do

296
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
blocks on my way down and I got to do
 

297
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,620
blocks on my way down and I got to do
that again here and I'm probably gonna

298
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:45,630
that again here and I'm probably gonna
 

299
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,210
that again here and I'm probably gonna
die so let's let's get our stuff in the

300
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:50,220
die so let's let's get our stuff in the
 

301
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,420
die so let's let's get our stuff in the
chest and I'll show you how this works

302
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:52,430
chest and I'll show you how this works
 

303
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,590
chest and I'll show you how this works
I'm gonna keep a few hundred pearls on

304
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm gonna keep a few hundred pearls on
 

305
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,010
I'm gonna keep a few hundred pearls on
me just in case I can save myself

306
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,020
me just in case I can save myself
 

307
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,460
me just in case I can save myself
get this stuff off I have a bit of

308
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,470
get this stuff off I have a bit of
 

309
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,320
get this stuff off I have a bit of
trouble here who's trying to build the

310
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,330
trouble here who's trying to build the
 

311
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,060
trouble here who's trying to build the
foundation for our Enderman farm here

312
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,070
foundation for our Enderman farm here
 

313
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,140
foundation for our Enderman farm here
we're gonna build it out of quartz

314
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,150
we're gonna build it out of quartz
 

315
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,300
we're gonna build it out of quartz
because quartz is pretty nice I like it

316
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,310
because quartz is pretty nice I like it
 

317
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,879
because quartz is pretty nice I like it
stands out really really well in the end

318
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:10,889
stands out really really well in the end
 

319
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,689
stands out really really well in the end
as well I wanted to have these these

320
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:14,699
as well I wanted to have these these
 

321
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,659
as well I wanted to have these these
quartz pillars like down here though

322
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:16,669
quartz pillars like down here though
 

323
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,390
quartz pillars like down here though
turns out you can't really do that this

324
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
turns out you can't really do that this
 

325
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,999
turns out you can't really do that this
is just a regular piston I can't I can't

326
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:23,009
is just a regular piston I can't I can't
 

327
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,999
is just a regular piston I can't I can't
push the quartz block down anyway and if

328
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:26,009
push the quartz block down anyway and if
 

329
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,560
push the quartz block down anyway and if
I try to place it on the side of this

330
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:27,570
I try to place it on the side of this
 

331
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,589
I try to place it on the side of this
block here it's gonna be facing the

332
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:30,599
block here it's gonna be facing the
 

333
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,820
block here it's gonna be facing the
wrong way so this is an interesting

334
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:31,830
wrong way so this is an interesting
 

335
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:39,520
wrong way so this is an interesting
challenge here I'll just show you this -

336
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,530
challenge here I'll just show you this -
 

337
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,629
challenge here I'll just show you this -
like the piston is working it's just

338
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:41,639
like the piston is working it's just
 

339
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,050
like the piston is working it's just
won't push it down that last block there

340
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,060
won't push it down that last block there
 

341
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,560
won't push it down that last block there
for some reason that is in the game so

342
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:48,570
for some reason that is in the game so
 

343
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,899
for some reason that is in the game so
we got a water propelling on I guess

344
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:50,909
we got a water propelling on I guess
 

345
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,360
we got a water propelling on I guess
I'll get some quartz blocks this is my

346
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,370
I'll get some quartz blocks this is my
 

347
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,520
I'll get some quartz blocks this is my
first real challenge due to this grabs

348
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:58,530
first real challenge due to this grabs
 

349
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,159
first real challenge due to this grabs
free I'll try to do one and if I can do

350
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:01,169
free I'll try to do one and if I can do
 

351
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,230
free I'll try to do one and if I can do
it I'll do them all this way another

352
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
it I'll do them all this way another
 

353
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,969
it I'll do them all this way another
idea I have is maybe use this sticky

354
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:04,979
idea I have is maybe use this sticky
 

355
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,149
idea I have is maybe use this sticky
piston and send it a one tick false and

356
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:08,159
piston and send it a one tick false and
 

357
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,710
piston and send it a one tick false and
maybe a little little let me push that

358
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:09,720
maybe a little little let me push that
 

359
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,580
maybe a little little let me push that
and leave the block behind oh yeah yeah

360
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:13,590
and leave the block behind oh yeah yeah
 

361
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,670
and leave the block behind oh yeah yeah
you can see we're right at the the

362
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:16,680
you can see we're right at the the
 

363
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,570
you can see we're right at the the
bottom here this is very dangerous

364
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:19,580
bottom here this is very dangerous
 

365
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,040
bottom here this is very dangerous
well well that would have been okay

366
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,050
well well that would have been okay
 

367
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,890
well well that would have been okay
actually I can't jump in this I have to

368
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:24,900
actually I can't jump in this I have to
 

369
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,950
actually I can't jump in this I have to
walk off okay if I jumped I would have

370
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:27,960
walk off okay if I jumped I would have
 

371
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,450
walk off okay if I jumped I would have
fell through and then I gotta place it

372
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:29,460
fell through and then I gotta place it
 

373
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,839
fell through and then I gotta place it
like that okay and that is how you do it

374
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:32,849
like that okay and that is how you do it
 

375
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,850
like that okay and that is how you do it
I got to do that for each of these fun

376
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:34,860
I got to do that for each of these fun
 

377
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,769
I got to do that for each of these fun
stuff so I will be right back this is

378
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:39,779
stuff so I will be right back this is
 

379
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,420
stuff so I will be right back this is
really getting my adrenaline pumped up

380
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:41,430
really getting my adrenaline pumped up
 

381
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,850
really getting my adrenaline pumped up
doing this over and over constantly

382
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:43,860
doing this over and over constantly
 

383
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,650
doing this over and over constantly
facing near-death experiences okay come

384
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:48,660
facing near-death experiences okay come
 

385
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,300
facing near-death experiences okay come
on come on so far I've done them all

386
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,310
on come on so far I've done them all
 

387
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,160
on come on so far I've done them all
without dying no which is great and that

388
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,170
without dying no which is great and that
 

389
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,330
without dying no which is great and that
is the last one

390
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:55,340
is the last one
 

391
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,960
is the last one
so let's read gear up here my main

392
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,970
so let's read gear up here my main
 

393
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,180
so let's read gear up here my main
concern today is I'm gonna fall into the

394
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,190
concern today is I'm gonna fall into the
 

395
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,600
concern today is I'm gonna fall into the
void with all my courts or redstone or

396
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:04,610
void with all my courts or redstone or
 

397
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,870
void with all my courts or redstone or
Pistons or something and won't be able

398
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:07,880
Pistons or something and won't be able
 

399
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,700
Pistons or something and won't be able
to finish today or something like that

400
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:09,710
to finish today or something like that
 

401
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,320
to finish today or something like that
but I'm gonna be very careful even if I

402
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,330
but I'm gonna be very careful even if I
 

403
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,670
but I'm gonna be very careful even if I
fall off with nothing though it's a long

404
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
fall off with nothing though it's a long
 

405
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,850
fall off with nothing though it's a long
walk back here which is kind of painful

406
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:17,860
walk back here which is kind of painful
 

407
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,830
walk back here which is kind of painful
so the next thing we're gonna do is get

408
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:20,840
so the next thing we're gonna do is get
 

409
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,150
so the next thing we're gonna do is get
our style on let's get some more let's

410
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,160
our style on let's get some more let's
 

411
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,460
our style on let's get some more let's
get the court soda yes and we're gonna

412
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,470
get the court soda yes and we're gonna
 

413
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,000
get the court soda yes and we're gonna
have a blue seem for reasons I've

414
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,010
have a blue seem for reasons I've
 

415
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,180
have a blue seem for reasons I've
explained already let's do let's just do

416
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,190
explained already let's do let's just do
 

417
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,440
explained already let's do let's just do
a stack lovin any blue stained glass I'm

418
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,450
a stack lovin any blue stained glass I'm
 

419
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,090
a stack lovin any blue stained glass I'm
still in the older snapshot though so

420
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,100
still in the older snapshot though so
 

421
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,520
still in the older snapshot though so
the borders are more defined and the

422
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,530
the borders are more defined and the
 

423
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,670
the borders are more defined and the
glasses and s-trans parents hopefully

424
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
glasses and s-trans parents hopefully
 

425
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,160
glasses and s-trans parents hopefully
it'll look good in the nick snapshot too

426
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,170
it'll look good in the nick snapshot too
 

427
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,290
it'll look good in the nick snapshot too
I haven't updated yet cuz my track

428
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:50,300
I haven't updated yet cuz my track
 

429
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,660
I haven't updated yet cuz my track
hasn't updated and it's just a pain to

430
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:52,670
hasn't updated and it's just a pain to
 

431
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,720
hasn't updated and it's just a pain to
switch between the two what else do we

432
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:55,730
switch between the two what else do we
 

433
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,640
switch between the two what else do we
need I need trial court's where is it

434
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:57,650
need I need trial court's where is it
 

435
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,260
need I need trial court's where is it
there it is chiseled and we will do more

436
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,270
there it is chiseled and we will do more
 

437
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,990
there it is chiseled and we will do more
pillars all right

438
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,000
pillars all right
 

439
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,580
pillars all right
no we want stairs that's what we want

440
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:06,590
no we want stairs that's what we want
 

441
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:13,030
no we want stairs that's what we want
okay and as I do this maybe I will talk

442
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
okay and as I do this maybe I will talk
 

443
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,160
okay and as I do this maybe I will talk
about the history of Enderman farms a

444
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,170
about the history of Enderman farms a
 

445
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,960
about the history of Enderman farms a
little bit and what we plan to do

446
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:16,970
little bit and what we plan to do
 

447
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,320
little bit and what we plan to do
different today so back when I made my

448
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,330
different today so back when I made my
 

449
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,710
different today so back when I made my
original ender ender I remember looking

450
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:23,720
original ender ender I remember looking
 

451
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,750
original ender ender I remember looking
on YouTube for examples of how people

452
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
on YouTube for examples of how people
 

453
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,060
on YouTube for examples of how people
were building Edmond firms at that time

454
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,070
were building Edmond firms at that time
 

455
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,880
were building Edmond firms at that time
and the majority of people were like

456
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:30,890
and the majority of people were like
 

457
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,760
and the majority of people were like
flooding their entire in the island or

458
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:33,770
flooding their entire in the island or
 

459
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,370
flooding their entire in the island or
or lighting it all up with torches and

460
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:36,380
or lighting it all up with torches and
 

461
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,620
or lighting it all up with torches and
then building these funnel traps similar

462
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:38,630
then building these funnel traps similar
 

463
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,000
then building these funnel traps similar
to my blaze farm and that was that was

464
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,010
to my blaze farm and that was that was
 

465
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,500
to my blaze farm and that was that was
the norm at the time so I had the idea

466
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,510
the norm at the time so I had the idea
 

467
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,140
the norm at the time so I had the idea
back then to build far away from the

468
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,150
back then to build far away from the
 

469
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,330
back then to build far away from the
island - I got it yes to easily get

470
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:52,340
island - I got it yes to easily get
 

471
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,750
island - I got it yes to easily get
knacks bond rates and then also the

472
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
knacks bond rates and then also the
 

473
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,870
knacks bond rates and then also the
piston pusher method to get them down to

474
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
piston pusher method to get them down to
 

475
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,710
piston pusher method to get them down to
one house which turned out really well

476
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
one house which turned out really well
 

477
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,110
one house which turned out really well
and I wasn't even trying to make an XP

then you can stack spawning pads on top
 

505
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,910
then you can stack spawning pads on top
of each other vertically so that was a

506
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:42,920
of each other vertically so that was a
 

507
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,230
of each other vertically so that was a
huge improvement and then also tripwires

508
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,240
huge improvement and then also tripwires
 

509
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,640
huge improvement and then also tripwires
and that came out in the game and other

and that came out in the game and other
 

511
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,030
and that came out in the game and other

and with my other design I actually did
 

657
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,019
and with my other design I actually did
it again darn it I put this here just

on top and then ladders to go up here to

676
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,230
on top and then ladders to go up here to
 

677
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:51,220
on top and then ladders to go up here to
the next level and let's see here

678
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,230
the next level and let's see here
 

679
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,139
the next level and let's see here
this is stuff to remember I believe we

680
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:56,149
this is stuff to remember I believe we
 

681
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,380
this is stuff to remember I believe we
want to have quartz blocks around the

682
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,390
want to have quartz blocks around the
 

683
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,470
want to have quartz blocks around the
glowstone on the next level it's very

684
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
glowstone on the next level it's very
 

685
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,840
glowstone on the next level it's very
important with this design or this trick

686
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:04,850
important with this design or this trick
 

687
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,120
important with this design or this trick
we're going to be doing that it's only

688
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,130
we're going to be doing that it's only
 

689
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,710
we're going to be doing that it's only
two blocks high the ceiling here

690
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
two blocks high the ceiling here
 

691
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,510
two blocks high the ceiling here
it just works better and also the room

692
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:10,520
it just works better and also the room
 

693
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,660
it just works better and also the room
dimensions are really important so this

694
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:13,670
dimensions are really important so this
 

695
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,150
dimensions are really important so this
the actual building I'm doing here is a

696
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
the actual building I'm doing here is a
 

697
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,590
the actual building I'm doing here is a
13 by 13 square from here to here those

698
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
13 by 13 square from here to here those
 

699
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,510
13 by 13 square from here to here those
only 11 by 11 so that's important to

700
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
only 11 by 11 so that's important to
 

701
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,819
only 11 by 11 so that's important to
keep in mind because I'm going to be

702
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:27,829
keep in mind because I'm going to be
 

703
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,190
keep in mind because I'm going to be
putting TNT in the very center and when

704
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:30,200
putting TNT in the very center and when
 

705
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,919
putting TNT in the very center and when
it explodes the farthest they can reach

706
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:32,929
it explodes the farthest they can reach
 

707
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,900
it explodes the farthest they can reach
the Enderman is up to here if you go one

708
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:34,910
the Enderman is up to here if you go one
 

709
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,110
the Enderman is up to here if you go one
block further the TNT won't hit them so

710
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,120
block further the TNT won't hit them so
 

711
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,990
block further the TNT won't hit them so
that is very important and then maybe

712
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
that is very important and then maybe
 

713
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,520
that is very important and then maybe
I'll do a few more things off-camera

714
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:45,530
I'll do a few more things off-camera
 

715
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,359
I'll do a few more things off-camera
here just to speed this along

716

just need some finishing touches which
we can do on camera real quick here but

724
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:57,409
we can do on camera real quick here but
 

725
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:02,859
we can do on camera real quick here but
this is the grand reveal

a pure white build a crafting table
 

795
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,259
a pure white build a crafting table
looks really out of place so I like to

796
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:35,269
looks really out of place so I like to
 

797
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,919
looks really out of place so I like to
hide it underneath chests if I can

798
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:37,929
hide it underneath chests if I can
 

799
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,299
hide it underneath chests if I can
although putting the anvil on top

800
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:40,309
although putting the anvil on top
 

801
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,560
although putting the anvil on top
doesn't make sense either

802
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:41,570
doesn't make sense either
 

803
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,119
doesn't make sense either
I would like to have the anvil on the

804
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,129
I would like to have the anvil on the
 

805
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,369
I would like to have the anvil on the
bottom and the chest on top but I've had

806
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:45,379
bottom and the chest on top but I've had
 

807
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,710
bottom and the chest on top but I've had
it in quartz pillars here for the top

808
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:47,720
it in quartz pillars here for the top
 

809
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,799
it in quartz pillars here for the top
layer let's go take a look up there

810
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:49,809
layer let's go take a look up there
 

811
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,940
layer let's go take a look up there
so I wouldn't have been able to open the

812
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:51,950
so I wouldn't have been able to open the
 

813
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,099
so I wouldn't have been able to open the
chest so got the middle and I like how

814
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:57,109
chest so got the middle and I like how
 

815
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:00,590
chest so got the middle and I like how
the top layer looks especially

816
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,600
the top layer looks especially
 

817
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,810
the top layer looks especially
these areas here are where the Enderman

818
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:02,820
these areas here are where the Enderman
 

819
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,370
these areas here are where the Enderman
are gonna be falling so the spawning

820
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:04,380
are gonna be falling so the spawning
 

821
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,629
are gonna be falling so the spawning
pads go right above you'll notice it's a

822
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:08,639
pads go right above you'll notice it's a
 

823
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:12,529
pads go right above you'll notice it's a
split spawning system that was one of

824
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:12,539
split spawning system that was one of
 

825
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,149
split spawning system that was one of
the key features I thought would be

826
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
the key features I thought would be
 

827
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,220
the key features I thought would be
great for Minecraft entities more than

828
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,230
great for Minecraft entities more than
 

829
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,139
great for Minecraft entities more than
one person wanted to use the Enderman

830
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:18,149
one person wanted to use the Enderman

one person wanted to use the Enderman
farm you could have one person on this

832
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
farm you could have one person on this
 

833
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,460
farm you could have one person on this
side one person on this side and should

834

835
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,399
side one person on this side and should
be able to keep up pretty well but in

836
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:25,409
be able to keep up pretty well but in
 

837
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:27,289

single-player doesn't really matter too

838
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:27,299
single-player doesn't really matter too
 

839
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,539
single-player doesn't really matter too
much now let's see what else do we got

840
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:32,549
much now let's see what else do we got
 

841
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:36,169
much now let's see what else do we got
to do here let's take a lie guess we're

842
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:36,179
to do here let's take a lie guess we're
 

843
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,940
to do here let's take a lie guess we're
gonna be going up in a second anyway so

844
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:37,950
gonna be going up in a second anyway so
 

845
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,529
gonna be going up in a second anyway so
this middle part this is really

846
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:39,539
this middle part this is really
 

847
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,960
this middle part this is really
important is there anything else I

848
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:41,970
important is there anything else I
 

849
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,840
important is there anything else I
forgot to do we are going to put a

850
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:44,850
forgot to do we are going to put a
 

851
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,529
forgot to do we are going to put a
ladder right here this is gonna hold

852
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:48,539
ladder right here this is gonna hold
 

853
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,539
ladder right here this is gonna hold
water up and it also leaves an opening

854
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:50,549
water up and it also leaves an opening
 

855
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:54,320
water up and it also leaves an opening
for XP orbs to fall down on us you could

856
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,330
for XP orbs to fall down on us you could
 

857
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,360
for XP orbs to fall down on us you could
probably use a trap door too but iron

858
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,370
probably use a trap door too but iron
 

859
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,430
probably use a trap door too but iron
bars do not work I'm guessing glass

860
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:58,440
bars do not work I'm guessing glass
 

861
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,720

panes don't work and yeah so pretty much

862
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:02,730
panes don't work and yeah so pretty much
 

863
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,710

limited to trap door or ladder here you

864
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
limited to trap door or ladder here you
 

865
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,110
limited to trap door or ladder here you
don't want to use a sign because we're

866
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
don't want to use a sign because we're
 

867
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,379
don't want to use a sign because we're
gonna have TNT above here and a TNT can

868
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:12,389
gonna have TNT above here and a TNT can
 

869
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,749
gonna have TNT above here and a TNT can
fall through if there's a sign there but

870
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:14,759
fall through if there's a sign there but
 

871
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,960
fall through if there's a sign there but
the ladder makes the space just a little

872
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:17,970
the ladder makes the space just a little
 

873
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,379
the ladder makes the space just a little
bit bigger than what TNT can fit through

874
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:20,389
bit bigger than what TNT can fit through
 

875
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:24,039
bit bigger than what TNT can fit through
and get this going

876
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,049
and get this going
 

877
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,970
and get this going
pressure plates to hold the water in

878
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:25,980

place did I bring the water I did that's

880
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:28,529
place did I bring the water I did that's
 

881
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,470
place did I bring the water I did that's
gonna go on top here we're building the

882
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
gonna go on top here we're building the
 

883
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,799
gonna go on top here we're building the
blast chamber right now I think let's do

884
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:36,809
blast chamber right now I think let's do
 

885
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:39,110
blast chamber right now I think let's do
it like this on the back side we will

886
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
it like this on the back side we will
 

887
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,389
it like this on the back side we will
have a ladder this is what we're gonna

888
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:41,399
have a ladder this is what we're gonna
 

889
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,129
have a ladder this is what we're gonna
use to refill the TNT as we use it not

890
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:46,139
use to refill the TNT as we use it not
 

891
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,289
use to refill the TNT as we use it not
exactly sure how how high up I want this

892
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:48,299
exactly sure how how high up I want this
 

893
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,690
exactly sure how how high up I want this
to go I'll probably figure that out

894
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:53,700
to go I'll probably figure that out
 

895
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,499
to go I'll probably figure that out
off-camera let's just go up aways though

896
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:56,509
off-camera let's just go up aways though
 

897
00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:00,980
off-camera let's just go up aways though
whoa oh I missed darn it

898
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:00,990
whoa oh I missed darn it
 

899
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,440
whoa oh I missed darn it
so we'll have a wave getting up to the

900
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,450
so we'll have a wave getting up to the
 

901
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,029
so we'll have a wave getting up to the
top from the back here I should put a

902
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
top from the back here I should put a
 

903
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,899
top from the back here I should put a
torch on the top - just for now I'll put

904
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:08,909
torch on the top - just for now I'll put
 

905
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:10,580
torch on the top - just for now I'll put
glass at the very top when this is all

906
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:10,590
glass at the very top when this is all
 

907
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,040
glass at the very top when this is all
done and I figure out what height I want

908
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,050
done and I figure out what height I want
 

909
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,610
done and I figure out what height I want
but let's see let's go down here and

910
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:18,620
but let's see let's go down here and
 

911
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,530
but let's see let's go down here and
just look at this pattern I did it with

912
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:20,540
just look at this pattern I did it with
 

913
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,650
just look at this pattern I did it with
a glass I want to copy it so it goes

914
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:23,660
a glass I want to copy it so it goes
 

915
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,090
a glass I want to copy it so it goes

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,020
blue okay so that's dude
 

919
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,290
blue okay so that's dude
downward facing arrows and we'll start

920
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:35,300
downward facing arrows and we'll start
 

921
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:42,960
downward facing arrows and we'll start
with whites I suppose and I guess blue

922
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:42,970
with whites I suppose and I guess blue
 

923
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,990
with whites I suppose and I guess blue
weight will go up like that that's and

924
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,000
weight will go up like that that's and
 

925
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,720
weight will go up like that that's and
then next will be cyan or light light

926
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:49,730
then next will be cyan or light light
 

927
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,400
then next will be cyan or light light
blue I guess I didn't you sign with this

928
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,410
blue I guess I didn't you sign with this
 

929
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,960
blue I guess I didn't you sign with this
oh this is gonna be tedious to build oh

930
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:55,970
oh this is gonna be tedious to build oh
 

931
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,430
oh this is gonna be tedious to build oh
my goodness

932
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
my goodness

the main I got a really hustle today cuz

934
00:22:59,770 --> 00:22:59,780
the main I got a really hustle today cuz

the main time-consuming part of all this

936
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,030
the main time-consuming part of all this
 

937
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,640
the main time-consuming part of all this
is going to be building the spawning

938
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:03,650
is going to be building the spawning
 

939
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,480
is going to be building the spawning
pads that is by far the biggest volume

940
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,490
pads that is by far the biggest volume
 

941
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,030
pads that is by far the biggest volume
of blocks I got a place okay so next to

942
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,040
of blocks I got a place okay so next to
 

943
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,400
of blocks I got a place okay so next to
be blue white and what we're doing is

944
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,410
be blue white and what we're doing is
 

945
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,960
be blue white and what we're doing is
we're making a tube that we're gonna

946
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:19,970
we're making a tube that we're gonna
 

947
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,090
we're making a tube that we're gonna
fill up with TNT all the way up to the

948
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,100
fill up with TNT all the way up to the
 

949
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,520
fill up with TNT all the way up to the
top there and this is gonna be like our

950
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:24,530
top there and this is gonna be like our
 

951
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,690
top there and this is gonna be like our
TNT reserve and I'm gonna stand down

952
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:28,700
TNT reserve and I'm gonna stand down
 

953
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,000
TNT reserve and I'm gonna stand down
below there and shoot up with a flame

954
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,010
below there and shoot up with a flame
 

955
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,870
below there and shoot up with a flame
bow and that will will mark the TNT as

956
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
bow and that will will mark the TNT as
 

957
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,470
bow and that will will mark the TNT as
mine so when it kills the Enderman oops

958
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
mine so when it kills the Enderman oops
 

959
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,140
mine so when it kills the Enderman oops
it's gonna register as my kill and I

960
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,150
it's gonna register as my kill and I
 

961
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,700
it's gonna register as my kill and I
will get XP orbs from it you could also

962
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:45,710
will get XP orbs from it you could also
 

963
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,820
will get XP orbs from it you could also
just have place for one TNT in a tube or

964
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:48,830
just have place for one TNT in a tube or
 

965
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,380
just have place for one TNT in a tube or
something if you just want to use a

966
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:50,390
something if you just want to use a
 

967
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,790
something if you just want to use a
flint and steel yeah you get the idea so

968
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:54,800
flint and steel yeah you get the idea so
 

969
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,940
flint and steel yeah you get the idea so
the other thing we got to do these are

970
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:57,950
the other thing we got to do these are
 

971
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:04,150
the other thing we got to do these are
11 blocks wide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

972
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,160
11 blocks wide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
 

973
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,330
11 blocks wide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so it is a

974
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:10,340
and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so it is a
 

975
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,520
and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so it is a
square but it's 11 living long and

976
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,530
square but it's 11 living long and
 

977
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,830
square but it's 11 living long and
there'll be Pistons like over here at

978
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
there'll be Pistons like over here at
 

979
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,780
there'll be Pistons like over here at
the spawning pads and also over here

980
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:19,790
the spawning pads and also over here
 

981
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,740
the spawning pads and also over here
that push them together in the middle

982
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:22,750
that push them together in the middle
 

983
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,260
that push them together in the middle
well I got the burps excuse me

984
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,270
well I got the burps excuse me
 

985
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,430
well I got the burps excuse me
so that's going

986
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
so that's going
 

987
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,519
so that's going
b22 spawning spaces for each of these so

988
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:30,529
b22 spawning spaces for each of these so
 

989
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:34,690
b22 spawning spaces for each of these so
44 total so each layer of Pistons I put

990
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:34,700
44 total so each layer of Pistons I put
 

991
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,230
44 total so each layer of Pistons I put
is going to be 44 spawning spaces and in

992
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
is going to be 44 spawning spaces and in
 

993
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,980
is going to be 44 spawning spaces and in
total I'm gonna make at least 16 layers

994
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:41,990
total I'm gonna make at least 16 layers
 

995
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,029
total I'm gonna make at least 16 layers
I think seems to give good rates but

996
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:46,039
I think seems to give good rates but
 

997
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,769
I think seems to give good rates but
maybe more maybe less

998
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:47,779
maybe more maybe less
 

999
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,860
maybe more maybe less
I might not be able to do it all today

1000
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:50,870
I might not be able to do it all today
 

1001
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,830
I might not be able to do it all today

quickly quickly just show you how to do
 

1019
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,190
quickly quickly just show you how to do
these rings real quick okay so two

1020
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
these rings real quick okay so two
 

1021
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,440
these rings real quick okay so two
blocks up is where I'm gonna start mine

1022
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,450
blocks up is where I'm gonna start mine
 

1023
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,960
blocks up is where I'm gonna start mine
and that's gonna follow the outline of

1024
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:31,970
and that's gonna follow the outline of
 

1025
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,749
and that's gonna follow the outline of
this I have speed potion know right and

1026
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:37,759
this I have speed potion know right and
 

1027
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,360
this I have speed potion know right and
you might have noticed my XP is down it

1028
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,370
you might have noticed my XP is down it
 

1029
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,029
you might have noticed my XP is down it
too I did die but it was on purpose I

1030
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039

we're gonna follow with this this is
 

1041
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:04,269
we're gonna follow with this this is
gonna take a while I got to get some

1042
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:04,279
gonna take a while I got to get some
 

1043
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,220
gonna take a while I got to get some
speed potion so I can do this quicker

1044
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,230

 

1045
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,289

okay and then the next ring on the other

1046
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:11,299
okay and then the next ring on the other
 

1047
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:14,019
okay and then the next ring on the other
side is gonna be five blocks spacing

1048
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:14,029
side is gonna be five blocks spacing
 

1049
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:17,860
side is gonna be five blocks spacing
apart so three four five and then on the

1050
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:17,870
apart so three four five and then on the
 

1051
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,129
apart so three four five and then on the
sixth one is where the next one starts

1052
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:20,139
sixth one is where the next one starts
 

1053
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,180
sixth one is where the next one starts
although you can just look down below

1054
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,190
although you can just look down below
 

1055
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,350
although you can just look down below
and I'm gonna have these rings I'm using

1056
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,360
and I'm gonna have these rings I'm using
 

1057
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,549
and I'm gonna have these rings I'm using
this stone I would like to use the

1058
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:27,559
this stone I would like to use the
 

1059
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,700
this stone I would like to use the
quartz actually but I did it again darn

1060
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:30,710
quartz actually but I did it again darn
 

1061
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,340
quartz actually but I did it again darn
it

1062
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,350

 

1063
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,799

quartz is just way too expensive so I'm

1064
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:35,809
quartz is just way too expensive so I'm
 

1065
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:38,799
quartz is just way too expensive so I'm
just gonna use stone and I'm gonna go up

1066
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:38,809
just gonna use stone and I'm gonna go up
 

1067
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:41,260
just gonna use stone and I'm gonna go up
to about y49

1068
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,270
to about y49
 

1069
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,380
to about y49
so I will be back in a bit when I do

1070
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,390
so I will be back in a bit when I do
 

1071
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,600
so I will be back in a bit when I do
that and we will continue on on the

1072
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:46,610
that and we will continue on on the
 

1073
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,510
that and we will continue on on the
spawning pads or something man okay so

1074
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
spawning pads or something man okay so
 

1075
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,460
spawning pads or something man okay so
jump forward a few hours and I've gotten

1076
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:54,470
jump forward a few hours and I've gotten
 

1077
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,760
jump forward a few hours and I've gotten
a lot done here I decided to do one half

1078
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:57,770
a lot done here I decided to do one half
 

1079
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,740
a lot done here I decided to do one half
pretty much all off camera I'm just

pretty much all off camera I'm just
 

1081
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,660
pretty much all off camera I'm just
gonna show you how I do the spawning

pads and that real quick it is 4 a.m.

1084
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,070
pads and that real quick it is 4 a.m.
 

1085
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,460
pads and that real quick it is 4 a.m.

so we are not finishing this today but

1088
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,130
so we are not finishing this today but
 

1089
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,340
so we are not finishing this today but
we should be able to test it at least it

1090
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,350
we should be able to test it at least it
 

1091
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,110
we should be able to test it at least it
just won't be as quick as if I was to

1092
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,120
just won't be as quick as if I was to
 

1093
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,250
just won't be as quick as if I was to
get all the spawning pads done so if the

1094
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:18,260
get all the spawning pads done so if the
 

1095
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,690
get all the spawning pads done so if the
Enderman seem like they're spawning so

1096
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:19,700
Enderman seem like they're spawning so
 

1097
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,760
Enderman seem like they're spawning so
don't worry once I get it all finished

1098
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:21,770
don't worry once I get it all finished
 

1099
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,200
don't worry once I get it all finished
it will be just fantastic but yeah they

1100
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,210
it will be just fantastic but yeah they
 

1101
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,480
it will be just fantastic but yeah they
fall down and they all gather into these

1102
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:28,490
fall down and they all gather into these
 

1103
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,610
fall down and they all gather into these
side things when the other side's done

1104
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:30,620
side things when the other side's done
 

1105
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,800
side things when the other side's done
they will gather here and I can still

1106
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:32,810
they will gather here and I can still
 

1107
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,090
they will gather here and I can still
use it like a regular Enderman fern not

1108
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,100
use it like a regular Enderman fern not
 

1109
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,210
use it like a regular Enderman fern not
a problem and like I said you can get

1110
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,220
a problem and like I said you can get
 

1111
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,400
a problem and like I said you can get
two people going in here if we had them

1112
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,410
two people going in here if we had them
 

1113
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,210
two people going in here if we had them
fallen on the other side that's good

1114
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:46,220
fallen on the other side that's good
 

1115
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,560
fallen on the other side that's good
let's head on up to start on the other

1116
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,570
let's head on up to start on the other
 

1117
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,900
let's head on up to start on the other
side so those rings that we just

1118
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:52,910
side so those rings that we just
 

1119
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,200
side so those rings that we just
installed are to keep them from flying

1120
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,210
installed are to keep them from flying
 

1121
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,960
installed are to keep them from flying
out of where I want them to drop because

1122
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:58,970
out of where I want them to drop because
 

1123
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,390
out of where I want them to drop because
if they bump each other in midair they

1124
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:01,400
if they bump each other in midair they
 

1125
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,190
if they bump each other in midair they
they'll knock each other all over the

1126
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
they'll knock each other all over the
 

1127
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:10,720
they'll knock each other all over the
place so above the ring going all the

1128
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,730
place so above the ring going all the
 

1129
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,250
place so above the ring going all the
way down all right go back up okay so

1130
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:15,260
way down all right go back up okay so
 

1131
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,650
way down all right go back up okay so
above the Rings I have stopped these at

1132
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:19,660
above the Rings I have stopped these at
 

1133
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:26,830
above the Rings I have stopped these at
Y 44 43.5 this is the top one and of

1134
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:26,840
Y 44 43.5 this is the top one and of
 

1135
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,570
Y 44 43.5 this is the top one and of
course that all depends on how you do

1136
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:28,580
course that all depends on how you do
 

1137
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,940

the room below but you need the Enderman

1138
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:30,950
the room below but you need the Enderman
 

1139
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,810
the room below but you need the Enderman
to fall I believe 43 blocks get them

1140
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:34,820
to fall I believe 43 blocks get them
 

1141
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,250
to fall I believe 43 blocks get them
down to a one-hit kill so to reset the

1142
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:39,260
down to a one-hit kill so to reset the
 

1143
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,140
down to a one-hit kill so to reset the
fall damage we are setting up I'm using

1144
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,150
fall damage we are setting up I'm using
 

1145
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,270
fall damage we are setting up I'm using
this as my guide trying to anyway I

1146
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:46,280
this as my guide trying to anyway I
 

1147
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,190
this as my guide trying to anyway I
think I went up that much so Y 46 then

1148
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
think I went up that much so Y 46 then
 

1149
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,740
think I went up that much so Y 46 then
we do a ring out of just regular bricks

1150
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:53,750
we do a ring out of just regular bricks
 

1151
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,430
we do a ring out of just regular bricks
and this is

1152
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:54,440
and this is
 

1153
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,700
and this is
be our vines over here let's go quickly

1154
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:00,710
be our vines over here let's go quickly
 

1155
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,269
be our vines over here let's go quickly
quickly

1156
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
quickly
 

1157
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,409
quickly
ah man I am beat

1158
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:05,419
ah man I am beat
 

1159
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:09,700
ah man I am beat
this is a huge project oh I really wish

1160
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:09,710
this is a huge project oh I really wish
 

1161
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,080
this is a huge project oh I really wish
I had a helper that could do the other

1162
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,090
I had a helper that could do the other
 

1163
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,999
I had a helper that could do the other
side while I did this cuz wow this is so

1164
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:16,009
side while I did this cuz wow this is so
 

1165
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:18,340
side while I did this cuz wow this is so
many blocks that even go up quite as

1166
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,350
many blocks that even go up quite as
 

1167
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,590
many blocks that even go up quite as
high as I want it to be I think it only

1168
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:20,600
high as I want it to be I think it only
 

1169
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,769
high as I want it to be I think it only
goes about about up to why 100 I wanted

1170
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:23,779
goes about about up to why 100 I wanted
 

1171
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,820
goes about about up to why 100 I wanted
to go to think what why 120 is where

1172
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:27,830
to go to think what why 120 is where
 

1173
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,539
to go to think what why 120 is where
I'll stop and just see how that works

1174
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:30,549
I'll stop and just see how that works
 

1175
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:35,529
I'll stop and just see how that works
but we're gonna build why she oh I

1176
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:35,539
but we're gonna build why she oh I
 

1177
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,649
but we're gonna build why she oh I
didn't grab I was gonna use wood buttons

1178
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:38,659
didn't grab I was gonna use wood buttons
 

1179
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,119
didn't grab I was gonna use wood buttons
but it just doesn't really matter does

1180
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,129
but it just doesn't really matter does
 

1181
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:43,389
but it just doesn't really matter does
it so we will make a bunch of buttons

1182
00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:43,399
it so we will make a bunch of buttons
 

1183
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,539
it so we will make a bunch of buttons
and we're gonna use these at the bottom

1184
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:46,549
and we're gonna use these at the bottom
 

1185
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:50,769
and we're gonna use these at the bottom
of here and this prevents your Pistons

1186
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:50,779
of here and this prevents your Pistons
 

1187
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:52,330
of here and this prevents your Pistons
going this prevents the vines from

1188
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:52,340
going this prevents the vines from
 

1189
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,399
going this prevents the vines from
drawing down lower than this points down

1190
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:57,409
drawing down lower than this points down
 

1191
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:05,540
drawing down lower than this points down
both sides and let's go back up higher

1192
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:05,550

 

1193
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,799

this is gonna be really cool when it's

1196
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:10,669
this is gonna be really cool when it's
 

1197
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:15,419
this is gonna be really cool when it's
all done I tell you really really cool

1198
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:15,429

 

1199
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:23,230

have tools for days okay so I just

1200
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,240
have tools for days okay so I just
 

1201
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,249
have tools for days okay so I just
skipped ahead a little bit here oh

1202
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:26,259
skipped ahead a little bit here oh
 

1203
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,190
skipped ahead a little bit here oh
what's he doing I might need to adjust

1204
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,200
what's he doing I might need to adjust
 

1205
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,769
what's he doing I might need to adjust
the vines a little bit that they they

1206
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:32,779
the vines a little bit that they they
 

1207
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:36,759
the vines a little bit that they they
work but sometimes the inner men do

1208
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:36,769
work but sometimes the inner men do
 

1209
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,110
work but sometimes the inner men do
strange things I'm not sure if they

1210
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,120
strange things I'm not sure if they
 

1211
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,149
strange things I'm not sure if they
should really be doing some of the

1212
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,159
should really be doing some of the
 

1213
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,129
should really be doing some of the
strange things they're doing but anyway

1214
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:42,139
strange things they're doing but anyway
 

1215
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:45,310
strange things they're doing but anyway
this is our vine wall and of course all

1216
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,320
this is our vine wall and of course all
 

1217
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,169
this is our vine wall and of course all
places you see if I don't put the block

1218
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:47,179
places you see if I don't put the block
 

1219
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,700
places you see if I don't put the block
here this is gonna be three blocks tall

1220
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,710
here this is gonna be three blocks tall
 

1221
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,279
here this is gonna be three blocks tall
and they can spawn on that so we want to

1222
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:51,289
and they can spawn on that so we want to
 

1223
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:52,869
and they can spawn on that so we want to
make sure there's absolutely no place

1224
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:52,879
make sure there's absolutely no place
 

1225
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:55,869
make sure there's absolutely no place
outside of the trap where Enderman can

1226
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:55,879
outside of the trap where Enderman can
 

1227
00:30:55,879 --> 00:31:03,659
outside of the trap where Enderman can
spawn or teleport to if possible okay so

1228
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:03,669
spawn or teleport to if possible okay so
 

1229
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:06,190
spawn or teleport to if possible okay so
don't think I have enough fines to

1230
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,200
don't think I have enough fines to
 

1231
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,310
don't think I have enough fines to
totally fill this all so we'll just put

1232
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
totally fill this all so we'll just put
 

1233
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,290
totally fill this all so we'll just put
the top and then go down to the buttons

1234
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:12,300
the top and then go down to the buttons
 

1235
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:20,490
the top and then go down to the buttons
like so do it on both sides yeah we want

1236
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:20,500
like so do it on both sides yeah we want
 

1237
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,960
like so do it on both sides yeah we want
them to go down to about that point

1238
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:21,970
them to go down to about that point
 

1239
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,670
them to go down to about that point
there you don't have enough vines I find

1240
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:26,680
there you don't have enough vines I find
 

1241
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,650
there you don't have enough vines I find
the Enderman will just fall right

1242
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:28,660
the Enderman will just fall right
 

1243
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,380
the Enderman will just fall right
through them and bypass the block and it

1244
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,390
through them and bypass the block and it
 

1245
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,130
through them and bypass the block and it
won't reset their fall damage all right

1246
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:35,140
won't reset their fall damage all right
 

1247
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,920
won't reset their fall damage all right
hopefully that all grows I think it will

1248
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:36,930
hopefully that all grows I think it will
 

1249
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,450
hopefully that all grows I think it will
now we are going to begin on the

1250
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:39,460
now we are going to begin on the
 

1251
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,100
now we are going to begin on the
spawning pads and this ladder here is

1252
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,110
spawning pads and this ladder here is
 

1253
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,910
spawning pads and this ladder here is
just temporary

1254
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:41,920
just temporary
 

1255
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,510
just temporary
just his way of getting up and down so

1256
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:45,520
just his way of getting up and down so
 

1257
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,860
just his way of getting up and down so
I've done quite a few of these already

1258
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:46,870
I've done quite a few of these already
 

1259
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,200
I've done quite a few of these already
and I have a pretty good pattern joy I

1260
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,210
and I have a pretty good pattern joy I
 

1261
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,360
and I have a pretty good pattern joy I
think let's see let's see if I can

1262
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,370
think let's see let's see if I can
 

1263
00:31:54,370 --> 00:32:00,660
think let's see let's see if I can
remember it go up like so pistons are

1264
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:00,670
remember it go up like so pistons are
 

1265
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:08,040
remember it go up like so pistons are
here those are really loud and we'll do

1266
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,050
here those are really loud and we'll do
 

1267
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,060
here those are really loud and we'll do
a wall all along so this is 11 Pistons

1268
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,070
a wall all along so this is 11 Pistons
 

1269
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,810
a wall all along so this is 11 Pistons
per side and there's four sides per

1270
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:15,820
per side and there's four sides per
 

1271
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,260
per side and there's four sides per
layer all in all I think it's about 700

1272
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,270
layer all in all I think it's about 700
 

1273
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,850
layer all in all I think it's about 700
to 800 Pistons total if we do 16 layers

1274
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:23,860
to 800 Pistons total if we do 16 layers
 

1275
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:35,040
to 800 Pistons total if we do 16 layers
which is quite a bit actually okay and

1276
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,050
which is quite a bit actually okay and
 

1277
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:38,430
which is quite a bit actually okay and
next thing we will do we're gonna put

1278
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:38,440
next thing we will do we're gonna put
 

1279
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,170
next thing we will do we're gonna put
some blocks here some half slabs just

1280
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:40,180
some blocks here some half slabs just
 

1281
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,050
some blocks here some half slabs just
this filler so again Enderman can't go

1282
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,060
this filler so again Enderman can't go
 

1283
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,680
this filler so again Enderman can't go
where we don't want them to get four

1284
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:46,690
where we don't want them to get four
 

1285
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,640
where we don't want them to get four
blocks go in there do the same on this

1286
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:50,650
blocks go in there do the same on this
 

1287
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:57,140
blocks go in there do the same on this
side all right and let's go up ourselves

1288
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,150

 

1289
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,280

now what I've been doing is I've just

1290
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,290
now what I've been doing is I've just
 

1291
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,210
now what I've been doing is I've just
covered those up with blocks hop on I'll

1292
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,220
covered those up with blocks hop on I'll
 

1293
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,280
covered those up with blocks hop on I'll
place one out there and there break

1294
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,290
place one out there and there break
 

1295
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,120
place one out there and there break
those and this is just a thing for the

1296
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,130
those and this is just a thing for the
 

1297
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:14,190
those and this is just a thing for the
tripwire hooks put one over there one

1298
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,200
tripwire hooks put one over there one
 

1299
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,070
tripwire hooks put one over there one
over there and then usually I

1300
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
over there and then usually I
 

1301
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,530
over there and then usually I
I run across as I place the blocks over

1302
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:20,540
I run across as I place the blocks over
 

1303
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,580
I run across as I place the blocks over
the Pistons go over to the other side do

1304
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:24,590
the Pistons go over to the other side do
 

1305
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:29,800
the Pistons go over to the other side do
the same thing I haven't fallen yet I am

1306
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:29,810
the same thing I haven't fallen yet I am
 

1307
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,000
the same thing I haven't fallen yet I am
surprised I'm usually a lot more

1308
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,010
surprised I'm usually a lot more
 

1309
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,400
surprised I'm usually a lot more
careless and I have been that I have oh

1310
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,410
careless and I have been that I have oh
 

1311
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,010
careless and I have been that I have oh
hi I'm tired then I have been today

1312
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,020
hi I'm tired then I have been today
 

1313
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,620
hi I'm tired then I have been today
because I have not I I do not want to

1314
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:44,630
because I have not I I do not want to
 

1315
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,040
because I have not I I do not want to
lose my stuff while I'm building this

1316
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,050
lose my stuff while I'm building this
 

1317
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,710
lose my stuff while I'm building this
absolutely not alright and then we're

1318
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
absolutely not alright and then we're
 

1319
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,080
absolutely not alright and then we're
gonna go four blocks over top like so

1320
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,090
gonna go four blocks over top like so
 

1321
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,560
gonna go four blocks over top like so
this is the next spawning pad this ring

1322
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:56,570
this is the next spawning pad this ring
 

1323
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,480
this is the next spawning pad this ring
we're doing right now so there's quite a

1324
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:01,490
we're doing right now so there's quite a
 

1325
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,890
we're doing right now so there's quite a
bit to each of these layers this is a

1326
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:02,900
bit to each of these layers this is a
 

1327
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:10,230
bit to each of these layers this is a
big build all right but I think that's

1328
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
big build all right but I think that's
 

1329
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,030
big build all right but I think that's
about as simple loops I'm not even doing

1330
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
about as simple loops I'm not even doing
 

1331
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,650
about as simple loops I'm not even doing
this right oh man I'm gonna look at this

1332
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:17,660
this right oh man I'm gonna look at this
 

1333
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,840
this right oh man I'm gonna look at this
video tomorrow I'm gonna be like what am

1334
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:19,850
video tomorrow I'm gonna be like what am
 

1335
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,030
video tomorrow I'm gonna be like what am
I talking about what am I saying

1336
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,040

 

1337
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,659

delirious alright so then we gotta send

1338
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:28,669
delirious alright so then we gotta send
 

1339
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:32,320
delirious alright so then we gotta send
power that's normal by the way that

1340
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,330
power that's normal by the way that
 

1341
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,030
power that's normal by the way that
that's spamming thing that's just a

1342
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,040
that's spamming thing that's just a
 

1343
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,780
that's spamming thing that's just a
addition I added which we will look at

1344
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:37,790
addition I added which we will look at
 

1345
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,730
addition I added which we will look at
in just a second here oh yeah and of

1346
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:39,740
in just a second here oh yeah and of
 

1347
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,960
in just a second here oh yeah and of
course make make sure there's no

1348
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:43,970
course make make sure there's no
 

1349
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,580
course make make sure there's no
spawning spaces so we gotta cover

1350
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:45,590
spawning spaces so we gotta cover
 

1351
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,370
spawning spaces so we gotta cover
everything with half slabs if it's a

1352
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:48,380
everything with half slabs if it's a
 

1353
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:53,650
everything with half slabs if it's a
full block on pretty much it why on the

1354
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:53,660
full block on pretty much it why on the
 

1355
00:34:53,660 --> 00:35:02,500
full block on pretty much it why on the
other side like so and so one of these

1356
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,510
other side like so and so one of these
 

1357
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,660
other side like so and so one of these
sides I've been making special not this

1358
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:04,670
sides I've been making special not this
 

1359
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:10,480
sides I've been making special not this
one the one away from our walkway yeah

1360
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:10,490
one the one away from our walkway yeah
 

1361
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,510
one the one away from our walkway yeah
you see this this extra gizmo stuff over

1362
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,520
you see this this extra gizmo stuff over
 

1363
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,000
you see this this extra gizmo stuff over
here insects or redstone what I've been

1364
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,010
here insects or redstone what I've been
 

1365
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,990
here insects or redstone what I've been
doing place on the half slabs there go

1366
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
doing place on the half slabs there go
 

1367
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,320
doing place on the half slabs there go
down this is optional you don't need to

1368
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,330
down this is optional you don't need to
 

1369
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,860
down this is optional you don't need to
do this if you don't want to but

1370
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:26,870
do this if you don't want to but
 

1371
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,630
do this if you don't want to but
basically I've been adding in one of

1372
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
basically I've been adding in one of
 

1373
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,870
basically I've been adding in one of
these to each of them

1374
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
these to each of them
 

1375
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,230
these to each of them
with the comparator turn to subtraction

1376
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,240
with the comparator turn to subtraction
 

1377
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,980
with the comparator turn to subtraction
and repeater set at 1 and what this does

1378
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:38,990
and repeater set at 1 and what this does
 

1379
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,870
and repeater set at 1 and what this does
is sometimes with pistons when they push

1380
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:43,880
is sometimes with pistons when they push
 

1381
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,380
is sometimes with pistons when they push
an enderman or any mob period the mob

1382
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:47,390
an enderman or any mob period the mob
 

1383
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,210
an enderman or any mob period the mob
will get the glitched inside the piston

1384
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,220
will get the glitched inside the piston
 

1385
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,540
will get the glitched inside the piston
head and it won't retract because the

1386
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:52,550
head and it won't retract because the
 

1387
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,089
head and it won't retract because the
piston is extended and Enderman will get

1388
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:55,099
piston is extended and Enderman will get
 

1389
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:56,560
piston is extended and Enderman will get
stuck in the string that we're gonna put

1390
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:56,570
stuck in the string that we're gonna put
 

1391
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,829
stuck in the string that we're gonna put
over there so what this does is it makes

1392
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
over there so what this does is it makes
 

1393
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,260
over there so what this does is it makes
a clock so that if they're in that

1394
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,270
a clock so that if they're in that
 

1395
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,260
a clock so that if they're in that
string it just keeps spamming the piston

1396
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,270
string it just keeps spamming the piston
 

1397
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,820
string it just keeps spamming the piston
until it actually pushes them out and

1398
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:06,830
until it actually pushes them out and
 

1399
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,620
until it actually pushes them out and
from my tests that does seem to work

1400
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:10,630
from my tests that does seem to work
 

1401
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,120
from my tests that does seem to work
pretty good occasionally it sometimes

1402
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,130
pretty good occasionally it sometimes
 

1403
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,550
pretty good occasionally it sometimes
takes two or three tries but otherwise

1404
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:15,560
takes two or three tries but otherwise
 

1405
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,730
takes two or three tries but otherwise
if they get stuck in the piston heads

1406
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:17,740
if they get stuck in the piston heads
 

1407
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,040
if they get stuck in the piston heads
the Enderman need to de-spawn on their

1408
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,050
the Enderman need to de-spawn on their
 

1409
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,220
the Enderman need to de-spawn on their
own and that can take 30 seconds or so

1410
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:24,230
own and that can take 30 seconds or so
 

1411
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,609
own and that can take 30 seconds or so
where that spawning pet is not being

1412
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:26,619
where that spawning pet is not being
 

1413
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:29,800
where that spawning pet is not being
used to its full potential so I think

1414
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:29,810
used to its full potential so I think
 

1415
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,470
used to its full potential so I think
this is a good addition if you're

1416
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:31,480
this is a good addition if you're
 

1417
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,030
this is a good addition if you're
willing to do that this extra little

1418
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,040
willing to do that this extra little
 

1419
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,170
willing to do that this extra little
step here otherwise again just connects

1420
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:37,180
step here otherwise again just connects
 

1421
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,190
step here otherwise again just connects
directly like that

1422
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,200

 

1423
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,420

alright and you only need to do this on

1424
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,430
alright and you only need to do this on
 

1425
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:57,280
alright and you only need to do this on
one of the sides not on both yeah okay

1426
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,290
one of the sides not on both yeah okay
 

1427
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,089
one of the sides not on both yeah okay
so that's the gist of the layers and I'm

1428
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:01,099
so that's the gist of the layers and I'm
 

1429
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:04,660
so that's the gist of the layers and I'm
doing 16 of those on each side so it

1430
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:04,670
doing 16 of those on each side so it
 

1431
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,390
doing 16 of those on each side so it
does take quite a while I'm just gonna

1432
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
does take quite a while I'm just gonna
 

1433
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,589
does take quite a while I'm just gonna
tap this one off right now with the

1434
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:08,599
tap this one off right now with the
 

1435
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,630
tap this one off right now with the
torch I'll come back to it later but we

1436
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
torch I'll come back to it later but we
 

1437
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,780
torch I'll come back to it later but we
are not gonna be getting that far today

1438
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:13,790
are not gonna be getting that far today
 

1439
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,990
are not gonna be getting that far today
of course also got to do the string

1440
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,000
of course also got to do the string
 

1441
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:26,290
of course also got to do the string
which I forgot to do so it's connected

1442
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:26,300
which I forgot to do so it's connected
 

1443
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,630
which I forgot to do so it's connected
now when I jump I see if I jump here

1444
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:30,640
now when I jump I see if I jump here
 

1445
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,740
now when I jump I see if I jump here
what kind of chances do I have a

1446
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:32,750
what kind of chances do I have a
 

1447
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:40,420
what kind of chances do I have a
surviving wishing me

1448
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:40,430

 

1449
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,579

that little extra dismal thing I did

1450
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:42,589
that little extra dismal thing I did
 

1451
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:45,789
that little extra dismal thing I did
also makes these retract wicker after

1452
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:45,799
also makes these retract wicker after
 

1453
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:47,380
also makes these retract wicker after
they push an Enderman instead of it

1454
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,390
they push an Enderman instead of it
 

1455
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,589
they push an Enderman instead of it
taking a full second or whatever is

1456
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:50,599
taking a full second or whatever is
 

1457
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,750
taking a full second or whatever is
normally it's a little bit quicker and

1458
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:54,760

 

1459
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,789

yeah so that's about it so we are gonna

1460
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:57,799
yeah so that's about it so we are gonna
 

1461
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:59,530
yeah so that's about it so we are gonna
head down there and actually testing

1462
00:37:59,530 --> 00:37:59,540
head down there and actually testing
 

1463
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,890
head down there and actually testing
test this thing out with what we got set

1464
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:02,900
test this thing out with what we got set
 

1465
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,839
test this thing out with what we got set
up today which is a lot actually it

1466
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:06,849
up today which is a lot actually it
 

1467
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,980
up today which is a lot actually it
probably only need another two or three

1468
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:08,990
probably only need another two or three
 

1469
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,430
probably only need another two or three
hours to finish this up at most I would

1470
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:12,440
hours to finish this up at most I would
 

1471
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,420
hours to finish this up at most I would
think alright everyone so we are going

1472
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:19,430
think alright everyone so we are going
 

1473
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,520
think alright everyone so we are going
to try this thing out today after all

1474
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:21,530
to try this thing out today after all
 

1475
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,059
to try this thing out today after all
it's not finished it will be about twice

1476
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:25,069
it's not finished it will be about twice
 

1477
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,559
it's not finished it will be about twice
as quick when it's all finished the

1478
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:26,569
as quick when it's all finished the
 

1479
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:28,930
as quick when it's all finished the
spawning rates and all that but we can

1480
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:28,940
spawning rates and all that but we can
 

1481
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,980
spawning rates and all that but we can
we can see it in action not a problem

1482
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:34,990

 

1483
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,480

and also I'll have to do something about

1484
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,490
and also I'll have to do something about
 

1485
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,109
and also I'll have to do something about
the path I'll cover it with water

1486
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:40,119
the path I'll cover it with water
 

1487
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,059
the path I'll cover it with water
probably make it too high or something

1488
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:43,069
probably make it too high or something
 

1489
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:45,490
probably make it too high or something
and put water above 32 blocks away from

1490
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:45,500
and put water above 32 blocks away from
 

1491
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,390
and put water above 32 blocks away from
my main building there and might need to

1492
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:49,400
my main building there and might need to
 

1493
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,390
my main building there and might need to
also shield a few other places cuz he

1494
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,400
also shield a few other places cuz he
 

1495
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,650
also shield a few other places cuz he
and see Enderman are walking around

1496
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:53,660
and see Enderman are walking around
 

1497
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,789
and see Enderman are walking around
where I don't want them to be so the way

1498
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:57,799
where I don't want them to be so the way
 

1499
00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:00,240
where I don't want them to be so the way
we are going to do the TNG thing I

1500
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,250
we are going to do the TNG thing I
 

1501
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:06,400

brought a flame bow and some arrows and

1502
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,410
brought a flame bow and some arrows and
 

1503
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,690
brought a flame bow and some arrows and
hopefully I don't die with these I'm

1504

hopefully I don't die with these I'm
gonna put them away actually so the way

1506
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:11,839
gonna put them away actually so the way
 

1507
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,470
gonna put them away actually so the way
to stock this thing up by the way and

1508
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
to stock this thing up by the way and
 

1509
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,030
to stock this thing up by the way and
I'm gonna use a trap door for it

1510
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,040
I'm gonna use a trap door for it
 

1511
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,359
I'm gonna use a trap door for it
place one one TNT there to begin with

1512
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:19,369
place one one TNT there to begin with
 

1513
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:21,640
place one one TNT there to begin with
it's very important do you build this

1514
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:21,650
it's very important do you build this
 

1515
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,010
it's very important do you build this
the way I told you to otherwise your

1516
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,020
the way I told you to otherwise your
 

1517

1521
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,559
you're gonna be very sad from my testing
what am I supposed to do this isn't

1522
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:38,569
what am I supposed to do this isn't
 

1523
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:41,020
what am I supposed to do this isn't
supposed to be there how does that work

1524
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,030
supposed to be there how does that work
 

1525
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,180
supposed to be there how does that work
I think that's fine yeah I think that's

1526
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,190
I think that's fine yeah I think that's
 

1527
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,559
I think that's fine yeah I think that's
fine

1529
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:48,379

this is how I plan on filling it it's

1530
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:48,389
this is how I plan on filling it it's
 

1531
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:50,959
this is how I plan on filling it it's
not a big deal gonna even enderpearl

1532
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:50,969
not a big deal gonna even enderpearl
 

1533
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:54,139
not a big deal gonna even enderpearl
down to it but in all my tests I think I

1534
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:54,149
down to it but in all my tests I think I
 

1535
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:55,549
down to it but in all my tests I think I
tried this about a hundred times I

1536
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:55,559
tried this about a hundred times I
 

1537
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,469
tried this about a hundred times I
didn't have the TNT blow up anything on

1538
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:57,479
didn't have the TNT blow up anything on
 

1539
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:02,029
didn't have the TNT blow up anything on
me so I hope hopefully got everything

1540
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:02,039
me so I hope hopefully got everything
 

1541
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,059
me so I hope hopefully got everything
set up right otherwise I'm gonna be very

1542

set up right otherwise I'm gonna be very
 

1543
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,659
set up right otherwise I'm gonna be very
sad oh and he took one see that's the

1544

sad oh and he took one see that's the
 

1545
00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:11,029
sad oh and he took one see that's the
thing that's why you don't want them

1546
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:11,039
thing that's why you don't want them
 

1547
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,249
thing that's why you don't want them
outside of those barriers because they

1548
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:13,259
outside of those barriers because they
 

1549
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:16,009
outside of those barriers because they
steal your TNT if they can get to that

1550
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:16,019
steal your TNT if they can get to that
 

1551
