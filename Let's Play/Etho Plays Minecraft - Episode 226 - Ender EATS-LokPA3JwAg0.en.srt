they can definitely reach Jay so we'll

186
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,020
they can definitely reach Jay so we'll
 

187
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,659
they can definitely reach Jay so we'll
have to make this go out at least one

188
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:18,669
have to make this go out at least one
 

189
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:25,350
have to make this go out at least one
more and we might set up like or just

190
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
more and we might set up like or just
 

191
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,420
more and we might set up like or just
put water floating water above us so

192
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,430
put water floating water above us so
 

193
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,150
put water floating water above us so
they can't teleports into the box with

194
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
they can't teleports into the box with
 

195
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,810
they can't teleports into the box with
us seems I can't pick up the XP through

196
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:33,820
us seems I can't pick up the XP through
 

197
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,529
us seems I can't pick up the XP through
it though which is good oh maybe not

198
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:36,539
it though which is good oh maybe not
 

199
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,570
it though which is good oh maybe not
well what we could do is just put in

200
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:39,580
well what we could do is just put in
 

201
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,409
well what we could do is just put in
another or a regular fence in here and I

202
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:43,419
another or a regular fence in here and I
 

203
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:49,070
another or a regular fence in here and I
should be able to fit through the crack

204
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,080

 

205
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,970

when I pick too many

206
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:54,980

 

207
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,070

ah it's so scary I should make it back

208
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,080
ah it's so scary I should make it back
 

209
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,110
ah it's so scary I should make it back
up before it I don't want to lose my

210
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
up before it I don't want to lose my
 

211
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,750
up before it I don't want to lose my
items so far seems okay it's gotta be

212
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:07,760
items so far seems okay it's gotta be
 

213
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,890
items so far seems okay it's gotta be
really careful not to get close to him

214
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:10,900
really careful not to get close to him
 

215
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,970
really careful not to get close to him
yeah I'm going to make a backup and I'm

216
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:12,980
yeah I'm going to make a backup and I'm
 

217
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,760
yeah I'm going to make a backup and I'm
going to experiment with the food

218
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:14,770
going to experiment with the food
 

219
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,780
going to experiment with the food
experiment with it a little bit and see

220
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:16,790
experiment with it a little bit and see
 

221
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,610
experiment with it a little bit and see
if they ever teleport in with me or if

222
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:18,620
if they ever teleport in with me or if
 

223
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,210
if they ever teleport in with me or if
I'm too close to allow them to do that

224
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,220

 

225
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,800

well it seems yes they were able to

226
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:26,810
well it seems yes they were able to
 

227
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,080
well it seems yes they were able to
teleport in with me and give me lots of

228
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,090
teleport in with me and give me lots of
 

229
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,110
teleport in with me and give me lots of
hugs so some sort of ceiling was needed

230
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,120
hugs so some sort of ceiling was needed
 

231
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,530
hugs so some sort of ceiling was needed
and I came up with this started making a

232
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:35,540
and I came up with this started making a
 

233
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,220
and I came up with this started making a
tunnel which will go up to this killing

234
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,230
tunnel which will go up to this killing
 

235
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,010
tunnel which will go up to this killing
area it's two-and-a-half high so they

236
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,020
area it's two-and-a-half high so they
 

237
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,830
area it's two-and-a-half high so they
can't teleport in with me as I stand

238
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:44,840
can't teleport in with me as I stand
 

239
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,670
can't teleport in with me as I stand
here and it works pretty good

240
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680

 

241
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,500

the fence isn't there anymore I didn't

242
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:51,510
the fence isn't there anymore I didn't
 

243
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,180
the fence isn't there anymore I didn't
like the fence because xb going to get

244
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,190
like the fence because xb going to get
 

245
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,980
like the fence because xb going to get
to you and you can't just walk out

246
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:54,990
to you and you can't just walk out
 

247
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,810
to you and you can't just walk out
whenever you choose so yeah this tunnel

248
00:07:59,810 --> 00:07:59,820
whenever you choose so yeah this tunnel
 

249
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,780
whenever you choose so yeah this tunnel
goes 32 blocks just out a teleport range

250
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:02,790
goes 32 blocks just out a teleport range
 

251
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,990
goes 32 blocks just out a teleport range
so it's two and a half blocks high in

252
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
so it's two and a half blocks high in
 

253
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
so it's two and a half blocks high in
here it's all made of glass so they

254
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,010
here it's all made of glass so they
 

255
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,490
here it's all made of glass so they
can't spawn well they won't have enough

256
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,500
can't spawn well they won't have enough
 

257
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,150
can't spawn well they won't have enough
space to anyway can't come in here

258
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
space to anyway can't come in here
 

259
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,340
space to anyway can't come in here
they tend to on top we have to put water

260
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,350
they tend to on top we have to put water
 

261
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,840
they tend to on top we have to put water
above prevent that I tried making this

262
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:20,850
above prevent that I tried making this
 

263
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,939
above prevent that I tried making this
with ice I thought it would look cool it

264
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:25,949
with ice I thought it would look cool it
 

265
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,310
with ice I thought it would look cool it
looked okay but it was way too blue you

266
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,320
looked okay but it was way too blue you
 

267
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,990
looked okay but it was way too blue you
couldn't really see through it like you

268
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
couldn't really see through it like you
 

269
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,290
couldn't really see through it like you
can with a glass so I switch to glass

270
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:32,300
can with a glass so I switch to glass
 

271
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,850
can with a glass so I switch to glass
looks really white which I don't really

272
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:34,860
looks really white which I don't really
 

273
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,690
looks really white which I don't really
like either I'm kind of hoping Mojang

274
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:38,700
like either I'm kind of hoping Mojang
 

275
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,149
like either I'm kind of hoping Mojang
will eventually update the the glass Tex

276
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:41,159
will eventually update the the glass Tex
 

277
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,690
will eventually update the the glass Tex
texture to make it more visible get rid

278
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,700
texture to make it more visible get rid
 

279
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,170
texture to make it more visible get rid
of the streaks maybe or introduce alpha

280
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,180
of the streaks maybe or introduce alpha
 

281
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,740
of the streaks maybe or introduce alpha
transparency somehow um yeah we got to

282
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:54,750
transparency somehow um yeah we got to
 

283
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,949
transparency somehow um yeah we got to
put water on top let's do an enchantment

284
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:57,959
put water on top let's do an enchantment
 

285
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:04,250
put water on top let's do an enchantment
before we die I don't get

286
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,260
before we die I don't get
 

287
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,570
before we die I don't get
so I brought a whole bunch of ice here

288
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:07,580
so I brought a whole bunch of ice here
 

289
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,810
so I brought a whole bunch of ice here
let's get to it

290
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:10,820
let's get to it
 

291
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,610
let's get to it
okay well I'm on top of the tunnel here

292
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:13,620
okay well I'm on top of the tunnel here
 

293
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,650
okay well I'm on top of the tunnel here
I'm trying to set it up in such a way

294
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:15,660
I'm trying to set it up in such a way
 

295
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,130
I'm trying to set it up in such a way
that there won't be any flowing water if

296
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,140
that there won't be any flowing water if
 

297
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:25,310
that there won't be any flowing water if
possible which might not be possible

298
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,320
possible which might not be possible
 

299
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
possible which might not be possible
I'm not sure for some reason I think it

300
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,090
I'm not sure for some reason I think it
 

301
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,810
I'm not sure for some reason I think it
can be done but I'm probably really

302
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:29,820
can be done but I'm probably really
 

303
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,420
can be done but I'm probably really
wrong on next all right so I filled in

304
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,430
wrong on next all right so I filled in
 

305
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,240
wrong on next all right so I filled in
all this stuff with there was a error

306
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,250
all this stuff with there was a error
 

307
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,310
all this stuff with there was a error
where the soil is so I have to remove

308
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
where the soil is so I have to remove
 

309
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,070
where the soil is so I have to remove
that eventually but I think the first

310
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,080
that eventually but I think the first
 

311
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,030
that eventually but I think the first
step is to go along the top fill it in

312
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
step is to go along the top fill it in
 

313
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,740
step is to go along the top fill it in
solid because we want water everywhere

314
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:50,750
solid because we want water everywhere
 

315
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,390
solid because we want water everywhere
the goal is to make it so that won't be

316
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:53,400
the goal is to make it so that won't be
 

317
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,190
the goal is to make it so that won't be
flowing over the sides which is a tough

318
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
flowing over the sides which is a tough
 

319
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:04,310

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,450
yeah
okay we'll probably need more of this oh

336
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:32,460
okay we'll probably need more of this oh
 

337
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,370
okay we'll probably need more of this oh
you jerk I hate when they do that ah

338
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,380
you jerk I hate when they do that ah
 

339

you jerk I hate when they do that ah
I've a fk'd before come back and then

340
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:41,460
I've a fk'd before come back and then
 

341
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,100
I've a fk'd before come back and then
you have this Enderman just mad at you

342
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,110
you have this Enderman just mad at you
 

343
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,770
you have this Enderman just mad at you
step standing in front because they

344
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:45,780
step standing in front because they
 

345
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,320
step standing in front because they
happen to walk right in front of where

346
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,330
happen to walk right in front of where
 

347
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,770
happen to walk right in front of where
you were you had your cursor pointing

348
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:51,780
you were you had your cursor pointing
 

349
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,690
you were you had your cursor pointing
and then when they do that they just

350
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:53,700
and then when they do that they just
 

351
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,860
and then when they do that they just
freeze and are angry okay it's a look oh

352
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,870
freeze and are angry okay it's a look oh
 

353
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,130
freeze and are angry okay it's a look oh
yeah so there's going to be a two man

354
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,140
yeah so there's going to be a two man
 

355
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,340
yeah so there's going to be a two man
going to be a tube that goes up to the

356
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,350
going to be a tube that goes up to the
 

357
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,560
going to be a tube that goes up to the
platform above I think over there inside

358
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:15,570
platform above I think over there inside
 

359
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,910
platform above I think over there inside
I'm going to build the platform up a

360
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm going to build the platform up a
 

361
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,550
I'm going to build the platform up a
higher

362
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
higher
 

363
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:27,050
higher
where the eats roads going to be okay so

364
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,060
where the eats roads going to be okay so
 

365
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,620
where the eats roads going to be okay so
this is all solid um maybe we'll put

366
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:30,630
this is all solid um maybe we'll put
 

367
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,670
this is all solid um maybe we'll put
some more over there so first up I got

368
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:34,680
some more over there so first up I got
 

369
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,420
some more over there so first up I got
to break everything above its soil I

370
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,430
to break everything above its soil I
 

371
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,780
to break everything above its soil I
think oops just dripped out like that

372
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:41,790
think oops just dripped out like that
 

373
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,080
think oops just dripped out like that
for now okay have to do this in the

374
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,090
for now okay have to do this in the
 

375
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,240
for now okay have to do this in the
right order or it won't work

376
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,250

 

377
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,740

okay and then I got to remove the soil

378
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:54,750
okay and then I got to remove the soil
 

379
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,590
okay and then I got to remove the soil
and place I swear it is so I'll do that

380
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
and place I swear it is so I'll do that
 

381
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,990
and place I swear it is so I'll do that
off camera then I'll break it all

382
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000

 

383
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,370

okay maybe before we do the whole thing

384
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:04,380
okay maybe before we do the whole thing
 

385
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,840
okay maybe before we do the whole thing
out I'm just going to try it out see if

386
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,850
out I'm just going to try it out see if
 

387
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,000
out I'm just going to try it out see if
it works or not so I put dirt all along

388
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,010
it works or not so I put dirt all along
 

389
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,840
it works or not so I put dirt all along
here this will probably prevent the

390
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:11,850
here this will probably prevent the
 

391
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,150
here this will probably prevent the
water from flowing to the left it will

392
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
water from flowing to the left it will
 

393
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
water from flowing to the left it will
flow to the right because there is a the

394
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:15,930
flow to the right because there is a the
 

395
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,640
flow to the right because there is a the
drop one block drop here which is closer

396
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:19,650
drop one block drop here which is closer
 

397
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:28,780
drop one block drop here which is closer
so nope that didn't work

398
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:28,790

 

399
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:38,050

that's what if we make it wider

400
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:38,060

 

401
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,350

nope can't be done because the water is

402
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:42,360
nope can't be done because the water is
 

403
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:52,759
nope can't be done because the water is
there okay let's try this set we'll get

404
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:52,769
there okay let's try this set we'll get
 

405
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:56,689
there okay let's try this set we'll get
rid of this water we just placed we will

406
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:56,699
rid of this water we just placed we will
 

407
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:00,910
rid of this water we just placed we will
have the flowing water sound

408
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:00,920

 

409
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:10,730

unfortunately okay I never did place any

410
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:10,740
unfortunately okay I never did place any
 

411
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,150
unfortunately okay I never did place any
at the bottom I don't think I need to

412
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,160
at the bottom I don't think I need to
 

413
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,829
at the bottom I don't think I need to
add a fill to the rights and then we can

414
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
add a fill to the rights and then we can
 

415
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,749
add a fill to the rights and then we can
remove this okay well I guess that's

416
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:20,759
remove this okay well I guess that's
 

417
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,340
remove this okay well I guess that's
what we'll do

418
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,350

 

419
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,199

it's going to get so far but I have come

420
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:27,209
it's going to get so far but I have come
 

421
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,059
it's going to get so far but I have come
across a little bit of a challenge up

422
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:29,069
across a little bit of a challenge up
 

423
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:34,790
across a little bit of a challenge up
ahead here I'm always worried I'm going

424
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
ahead here I'm always worried I'm going
 

425
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,049
ahead here I'm always worried I'm going
to look at one of these guys I'm not

426
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:36,059
to look at one of these guys I'm not
 

427
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,840
to look at one of these guys I'm not
really like they'll does knocked me off

428
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:38,850
really like they'll does knocked me off
 

429
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:46,150
really like they'll does knocked me off
I'm not in a good spot Wow

430
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160

 

431
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,220

yeah so the challenge is this corner

432
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,230
yeah so the challenge is this corner
 

433
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,049
yeah so the challenge is this corner
right here if I try to break or even if

434
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:54,059
right here if I try to break or even if
 

435
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,269
right here if I try to break or even if
like even if I extend this out

436
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:56,279
like even if I extend this out
 

437
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,889
like even if I extend this out
the water is still going to flow over

438
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:57,899
the water is still going to flow over
 

439
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,129
the water is still going to flow over
this way because like we saw before we

440
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:01,139
this way because like we saw before we
 

441
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,410
this way because like we saw before we
have water blocks here so I don't know

442
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:06,420
have water blocks here so I don't know
 

443
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,470
have water blocks here so I don't know
if how I can fix this I definitely have

444
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:09,480
if how I can fix this I definitely have
 

445
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,240
if how I can fix this I definitely have
to get rid of those so now the water has

446
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,250
to get rid of those so now the water has
 

447
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,150
to get rid of those so now the water has
to travel two blocks to get down so we

448
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,160
to travel two blocks to get down so we
 

449
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,900
to travel two blocks to get down so we
need to make this go out more than two

450
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:20,910
need to make this go out more than two
 

451
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:28,549
need to make this go out more than two
blocks so it doesn't flow this way it's

452
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:28,559
blocks so it doesn't flow this way it's
 

453
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,730
blocks so it doesn't flow this way it's
like a little puzzle man

454
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:31,740

 

455
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,460

so it'll feel like that hi I think

456
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:34,470
so it'll feel like that hi I think
 

457
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,990
so it'll feel like that hi I think
though when I break this one it's going

458
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
though when I break this one it's going
 

459
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,910
though when I break this one it's going
to create a source block here and then

460
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
to create a source block here and then
 

461
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,510
to create a source block here and then
it's going to flow this way oh good it

462
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:41,520
it's going to flow this way oh good it
 

463
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,350
it's going to flow this way oh good it
didn't that simplifies it a lot oh why

464
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,360
didn't that simplifies it a lot oh why
 

465
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,030
didn't that simplifies it a lot oh why
to do it on that one and not the other

466
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,040
to do it on that one and not the other
 

467
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,540
to do it on that one and not the other
one

468
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:52,550

 

469
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,370

dang it

470
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:54,380
dang it
 

471
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,750
dang it
I'll have to watch it I wonder what was

472
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:56,760
I'll have to watch it I wonder what was
 

473
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,370
I'll have to watch it I wonder what was
different about that yeah basically it's

474
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:01,380
different about that yeah basically it's
 

475
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,590
different about that yeah basically it's
it's creating a water block here so this

476
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
it's creating a water block here so this
 

477
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,280
it's creating a water block here so this
this water won't flow that way and it's

478
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,290
this water won't flow that way and it's
 

479
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,070
this water won't flow that way and it's
it goes over here it's now I'm going to

480
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,080
it goes over here it's now I'm going to
 

481
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,500
it goes over here it's now I'm going to
try melt it so that doesn't cause an

482
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,510
try melt it so that doesn't cause an
 

483
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,250
try melt it so that doesn't cause an
update and see if if that'll work

484
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:18,260

 

485
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,050

yep that works so we were able to cover

486
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,060
yep that works so we were able to cover
 

487
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,150
yep that works so we were able to cover
the whole roof with water without it

488
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,160
the whole roof with water without it
 

489
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,650
the whole roof with water without it
spilling over which is pretty cool ah

490
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:26,660
spilling over which is pretty cool ah
 

491
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,840
spilling over which is pretty cool ah
had a few drops I had to redo a few

492
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:29,850
had a few drops I had to redo a few
 

493
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,130
had a few drops I had to redo a few
things but I did get it to work and

494
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,140
things but I did get it to work and
 

495
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:41,390
things but I did get it to work and
pretty cool so next up oh dang this

496
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,400
pretty cool so next up oh dang this
 

497
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,240
pretty cool so next up oh dang this
shovel oh good we got four I love it

498
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,250
shovel oh good we got four I love it
 

499
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,769
shovel oh good we got four I love it
when you get four when you accidentally

500
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:45,779
when you get four when you accidentally
 

501
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,710
when you get four when you accidentally
break it although you know what I should

502
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
break it although you know what I should
 

503
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
break it although you know what I should
probably change this up so it looks a

504
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:50,730
probably change this up so it looks a
 

505
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,610
probably change this up so it looks a
little different - oh well some other

506
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:55,620
little different - oh well some other
 

507
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,290
little different - oh well some other
time

508
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:56,300
time
 

509
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,250
time
so I would like to know that's a real

510
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:01,260
so I would like to know that's a real
 

511
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,949
so I would like to know that's a real
guy these guys got some pretty good

512
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
guy these guys got some pretty good
 

513
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,840
guy these guys got some pretty good
reach to them so yeah maybe we'll start

514
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:11,850
reach to them so yeah maybe we'll start
 

515
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,340
reach to them so yeah maybe we'll start
working on the platform above and the

516
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,350
working on the platform above and the
 

517
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,019
working on the platform above and the
eat throat I kind of like I really want

518
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:15,029
eat throat I kind of like I really want
 

519
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,420
eat throat I kind of like I really want
to work on the eats Road today so I'm

520
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,430
to work on the eats Road today so I'm
 

521
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:23,090
to work on the eats Road today so I'm
gonna pick up the pace here yeah you

522
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,100
gonna pick up the pace here yeah you
 

523
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,560
gonna pick up the pace here yeah you
know what I decided just to go ahead and

524
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,570
know what I decided just to go ahead and
 

525
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,690
know what I decided just to go ahead and
start working on eats roads so that's

526
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:26,700
start working on eats roads so that's
 

527
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,430
start working on eats roads so that's
what I'm going to do I'm not going to be

528
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
what I'm going to do I'm not going to be
 

529
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,220
what I'm going to do I'm not going to be
able to get it centered with this I

530
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,230
able to get it centered with this I
 

531
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,540
able to get it centered with this I
don't think because this is an even

532
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:35,550
don't think because this is an even
 

533
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,630
don't think because this is an even
number and I need an odd number for the

534
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:38,640
number and I need an odd number for the
 

535
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,110
number and I need an odd number for the
road design I'm using and like stuff

536
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,120
road design I'm using and like stuff
 

537
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,880
road design I'm using and like stuff
like the enchantments room will probably

538
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:43,890
like the enchantments room will probably
 

539
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,500
like the enchantments room will probably
end up being an odd number too

540
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,510
end up being an odd number too
 

541
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,060
end up being an odd number too
because that's just the way it is so our

542
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,070
because that's just the way it is so our
 

543
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,040
because that's just the way it is so our
platform up here is probably going to be

544
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,050
platform up here is probably going to be
 

545
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,520
platform up here is probably going to be
odd number based but I think this is

546
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:55,530
odd number based but I think this is
 

547
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,590
odd number based but I think this is
where I'm going to Center it so we're at

548
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:00,600
where I'm going to Center it so we're at
 

549
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,350
where I'm going to Center it so we're at
Y 65 that's the height of my portal to

550
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
Y 65 that's the height of my portal to
 

551
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,189
Y 65 that's the height of my portal to
get out of the end and I have it all

552
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
get out of the end and I have it all
 

553
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,660
get out of the end and I have it all
written down I'm looking for my notes

554
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:08,670
written down I'm looking for my notes
 

555
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,060
written down I'm looking for my notes
here yeah the portals at Zed negative 9

556
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,070
here yeah the portals at Zed negative 9
 

557
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:19,850
here yeah the portals at Zed negative 9
and X 73 so it's about 200 blocks away

558
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:19,860
and X 73 so it's about 200 blocks away
 

559
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:27,290
and X 73 so it's about 200 blocks away
from here the entry is at Z 0 so right

560
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,300
from here the entry is at Z 0 so right
 

561
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,350
from here the entry is at Z 0 so right
here so yeah I think right here will be

562
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
here so yeah I think right here will be
 

563
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,810
here so yeah I think right here will be
the middle of the etes road so we'll go

564
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:37,820
the middle of the etes road so we'll go
 

565
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,550
the middle of the etes road so we'll go
I'm going to use glass for the bottom of

566
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm going to use glass for the bottom of
 

567
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,710
I'm going to use glass for the bottom of
it and it's going to be three wide oh

568
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
it and it's going to be three wide oh
 

569
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,620
it and it's going to be three wide oh
man I was using my pinky like a fool you

570
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:45,630
man I was using my pinky like a fool you
 

571
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,690
man I was using my pinky like a fool you
got to use your ring finger just about

572
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,700
got to use your ring finger just about
 

573
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,600
got to use your ring finger just about
let go there yeah I'm going to run glass

574
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:53,610
let go there yeah I'm going to run glass
 

575
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,220
let go there yeah I'm going to run glass
three wide all the way up to our portal

576
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,230
three wide all the way up to our portal
 

577
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,510
three wide all the way up to our portal
and we'll probably have to go get some

578
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
and we'll probably have to go get some
 

579
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,300
and we'll probably have to go get some
more glass very very soon here oh man we

580
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,310
more glass very very soon here oh man we
 

581
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,430
more glass very very soon here oh man we
got we got glass going all the way down

582
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
got we got glass going all the way down
 

583
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,610
got we got glass going all the way down
now it's a long road the next part of

584
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:10,620
now it's a long road the next part of
 

585
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,200
now it's a long road the next part of
this is going to be putting on our walls

586
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,210
this is going to be putting on our walls
 

587
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,480
this is going to be putting on our walls
so we're going to have wall in the

588
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,490
so we're going to have wall in the
 

589
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,910
so we're going to have wall in the
middle wall on the sides and another one

590
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:22,920
middle wall on the sides and another one
 

591
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,080
middle wall on the sides and another one
on this side okay I decide these fences

592
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,090
on this side okay I decide these fences
 

593
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,820
on this side okay I decide these fences
they work pretty good I was going to use

594
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:31,830
they work pretty good I was going to use
 

595
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,550
they work pretty good I was going to use
cobblestone walls but they aren't quite

596
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:34,560
cobblestone walls but they aren't quite
 

597
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,630
cobblestone walls but they aren't quite
as visible so they're pretty much solid

598
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
as visible so they're pretty much solid
 

599
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,820
as visible so they're pretty much solid
so fences work pretty good see I got to

600
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:43,830
so fences work pretty good see I got to
 

601
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,650
so fences work pretty good see I got to
run all three of these all the way down

602
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:45,660
run all three of these all the way down
 

603
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:52,280
run all three of these all the way down
and then I'll be back again

604
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,290

 

605
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,910

ah very good very very good the next

606
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:56,920
ah very good very very good the next
 

607
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,690
ah very good very very good the next
thing is the cap in the middle we need

608
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:00,700
thing is the cap in the middle we need
 

609
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,730
thing is the cap in the middle we need
that hold the boat down I'm going to use

610
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:02,740
that hold the boat down I'm going to use
 

611
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,560
that hold the boat down I'm going to use
I think I'm going to use the light wood

612
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:07,570
I think I'm going to use the light wood
 

613
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,090
I think I'm going to use the light wood
half slabs and then we'll use the

614
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,100
half slabs and then we'll use the
 

615
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,120
half slabs and then we'll use the
regular ones and let's see where I want

616
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,130
regular ones and let's see where I want
 

617
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,450
regular ones and let's see where I want
to start this that's the middle of the

618
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,460
to start this that's the middle of the
 

619
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:27,300
to start this that's the middle of the
portal should really get rid of this I

620
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,310
portal should really get rid of this I
 

621
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,190
portal should really get rid of this I
guess we'll start here so I think I'm

622
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
guess we'll start here so I think I'm
 

623
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,210
guess we'll start here so I think I'm
going to do it like this I'm going to

624
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,220
going to do it like this I'm going to
 

625
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,830
going to do it like this I'm going to
have one layer then three then another

626
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,840
have one layer then three then another
 

627
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,340
have one layer then three then another
one then three and do that all the way

628
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,350
one then three and do that all the way
 

629
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,700
one then three and do that all the way
down just so that there's a little bit

630
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:41,710
down just so that there's a little bit
 

631
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,590
down just so that there's a little bit
of variation as you're going down here

632
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
of variation as you're going down here
 

633
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,540
of variation as you're going down here
otherwise you can't really see how quick

634

eyes so that's why I want it just a
 

641
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,260
eyes so that's why I want it just a
little bit different but yeah we should

642
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,270
little bit different but yeah we should
 

643
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,270

be just about done here so I'll go all

644
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,280
be just about done here so I'll go all
 

645
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,890
be just about done here so I'll go all
the way down alright so I got that done

646
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:07,900
the way down alright so I got that done
 

647
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
the way down alright so I got that done
now I'm going all along here and placing

648
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:09,910
now I'm going all along here and placing
 

649
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,030
now I'm going all along here and placing
signs at all these the darker ones and

650
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,040
signs at all these the darker ones and
 

651
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,620
signs at all these the darker ones and
these are just to hold the water in

652
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:16,630
these are just to hold the water in
 

653
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,190
these are just to hold the water in
place so that's it will flow correctly

654
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,200
place so that's it will flow correctly
 

655
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,940
place so that's it will flow correctly
you can use pressure plates or anything

656
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:23,950
you can use pressure plates or anything
 

657
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,310
you can use pressure plates or anything
else you can if you're if you've got a

658
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
else you can if you're if you've got a
 

659
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,110
else you can if you're if you've got a
thicker road like if it's too deep you

660
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,120
thicker road like if it's too deep you
 

661
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,450
thicker road like if it's too deep you
can just dig a hole and the water will

662
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:30,460
can just dig a hole and the water will
 

663
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,430
can just dig a hole and the water will
flow that way you don't even need to use

664
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:32,440
flow that way you don't even need to use
 

665
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,740
flow that way you don't even need to use
a block to hold it then um yeah I'm

666
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:37,750
a block to hold it then um yeah I'm
 

667
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,080
a block to hold it then um yeah I'm
gonna use signs and you know I really

668
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,090
gonna use signs and you know I really
 

669
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,970
gonna use signs and you know I really

and tamper with it
 

685
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,190
and tamper with it
but it is really cool to have still

but it is really cool to have still
 

687
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,529
but it is really cool to have still
minecarts are better in my opinion a lot

688
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:11,539
minecarts are better in my opinion a lot
 

689
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:14,380
minecarts are better in my opinion a lot
of people always wonder which is quicker

they're actually the same speed I'm

692
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:17,059
they're actually the same speed I'm
 

693
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,230
they're actually the same speed I'm
pretty sure still eight blocks per

694
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
pretty sure still eight blocks per
 

695
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,360
pretty sure still eight blocks per
second is max speed for mine carts and

696
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,370
second is max speed for mine carts and
 

697
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,640
second is max speed for mine carts and
for each road but you know it's cool to

698
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:27,650
for each road but you know it's cool to
 

699
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,560

so that's why when I have an eats Road

702
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:31,700
so that's why when I have an eats Road
 

703
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,330
so that's why when I have an eats Road

eats Road it's it's a a boat road system
I came up with a long time ago

712
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080
I came up with a long time ago

transportation system even before I

716
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:54,169
transportation system even before I
 

717
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:55,810
transportation system even before I
started my let's play I think is when I

718
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:55,820
started my let's play I think is when I
 

719
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,090
started my let's play I think is when I
came up with it and is it's basically

720
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,100
came up with it and is it's basically
 

721
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,610
came up with it and is it's basically
just a trick with boats that if it's

722
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:03,620
just a trick with boats that if it's
 

723
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,250
just a trick with boats that if it's
being held down by a block when it's in

724
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,260
being held down by a block when it's in
 

725
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,899
being held down by a block when it's in
water and it's trying to float up it

726
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:07,909
water and it's trying to float up it
 

727
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,419
water and it's trying to float up it
will move quicker for some reason and

728
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:10,429
will move quicker for some reason and
 

729
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,639
will move quicker for some reason and
they'll move on its own so you can

730
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:12,649
they'll move on its own so you can
 

731
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,740
they'll move on its own so you can
actually make tracks for the boat which

732
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:14,750
actually make tracks for the boat which
 

733
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,659
actually make tracks for the boat which
is pretty cool and then you can set up

734
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:19,669
is pretty cool and then you can set up
 

735
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:24,250
is pretty cool and then you can set up
loading stations and and departures and

736

loading stations and and departures and
 

737
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,289

actually eats Road first was inspired by

762
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:14,620
actually eats Road first was inspired by
 

763
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:20,850
actually eats Road first was inspired by
modern roads and the way I had it set up

764
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:20,860

 

765
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,650

you drive on the right side of the road

766
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:23,660
you drive on the right side of the road
 

767
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,480
you drive on the right side of the road
so that's how I'm going to set this up

768
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,490
so that's how I'm going to set this up
 

769
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,880
so that's how I'm going to set this up
so when this is broken it will go this

770
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:30,890
so when this is broken it will go this
 

771
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,370
so when this is broken it will go this
way and the other one will go the

772
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:33,380
way and the other one will go the
 

773
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,740
way and the other one will go the
opposite way so I'm going to put ice all

774
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:35,750
opposite way so I'm going to put ice all
 

775
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,220
opposite way so I'm going to put ice all
the way down and I'll get back to you

776
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,230

 

777
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,820

need to get back so let's go for our
 

783
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:59,860
need to get back so let's go for our
first test drive qu yes I'm Steve the

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,060
this to make sure it's still a blocks
 

791
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,930
this to make sure it's still a blocks
per second to I'll use as a reference

792
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:15,940
per second to I'll use as a reference
 

793
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,100
per second to I'll use as a reference
but yeah eats Road very cool all right

794
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,110
but yeah eats Road very cool all right
 

795
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,750
but yeah eats Road very cool all right
I'm going to do that one last thing and

796
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:22,760
I'm going to do that one last thing and
 

797
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,370
I'm going to do that one last thing and
then we will check it out one more time

798
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:29,380

 

799
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,080

the last thing I did with it is I put

800
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,090
the last thing I did with it is I put
 

801
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,710
the last thing I did with it is I put
these glowstone down every every section

802
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:35,720
these glowstone down every every section
 

803
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,990
these glowstone down every every section
so just to give it some more color

804
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
so just to give it some more color
 

805
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,150
so just to give it some more color
because the end is very dark and very

806
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,160
because the end is very dark and very
 

807
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,840
because the end is very dark and very
bland so we want as much color as we can

808
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:43,850
bland so we want as much color as we can
 

809
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:49,480
bland so we want as much color as we can
get whoo-hoo I did check it out it's

810
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,490
get whoo-hoo I did check it out it's
 

811
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,010
get whoo-hoo I did check it out it's
seven blocks per second exactly which

812
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,020
seven blocks per second exactly which
 

813
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,200
seven blocks per second exactly which
might be what mine carts are I would

814
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,210
might be what mine carts are I would
 

815
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:02,470
might be what mine carts are I would
have to check I'm not sure the a seven

816
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
have to check I'm not sure the a seven
 

817
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,090
have to check I'm not sure the a seven
blocks exactly just cool and I think I

818
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,100
blocks exactly just cool and I think I
 

819
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,980
blocks exactly just cool and I think I
found out trickier

820
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:08,990
found out trickier
 

821
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,050
found out trickier
well not found out it's an old trick but

822
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,060
well not found out it's an old trick but
 

823
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,400
well not found out it's an old trick but
I didn't know you could double jump

824
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,410
I didn't know you could double jump
 

825
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,400
I didn't know you could double jump
doing this or at least I think I'm

826
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,410
doing this or at least I think I'm
 

827
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,160
doing this or at least I think I'm
double jumping we'll see if we can

828
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,170
double jumping we'll see if we can
 

829
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,040
double jumping we'll see if we can
replicate it here so if I hold forward I

830
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,050
replicate it here so if I hold forward I
 

831
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,160
replicate it here so if I hold forward I
automatically jump on my own this is

832
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,170
automatically jump on my own this is
 

833
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,260
automatically jump on my own this is
something out there real this is

834
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,270
something out there real this is
 

835
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,520
something out there real this is
something I've done before but I've

836
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:27,530
something I've done before but I've
 

837
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,150
something I've done before but I've
never

838

never
we'll jump before going in yeah it is a

840

we'll jump before going in yeah it is a
 

841
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,170
we'll jump before going in yeah it is a
double jump check it out

842
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,180
double jump check it out
 

843
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:41,380
double jump check it out
that is awesome I can't get up on top

844

got two comments for today first one is
 

877
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,600
got two comments for today first one is
oh hey etho I was wondering regarding

878
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:40,610
oh hey etho I was wondering regarding
 

879
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,600
oh hey etho I was wondering regarding
the new 1.4 anvils are you going to make

880
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:43,610
the new 1.4 anvils are you going to make
 

881
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,790
the new 1.4 anvils are you going to make
a special room dedicate to all the

882
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:45,800
a special room dedicate to all the
 

883
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,640
a special room dedicate to all the
things you can do with anvils or will

884
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:48,650
things you can do with anvils or will
 

885
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,410
things you can do with anvils or will
you hide them in random places like you

886
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:50,420
you hide them in random places like you
 

887
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,990
you hide them in random places like you
did with your work benches I personally

888
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,000
did with your work benches I personally
 

889
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,280
did with your work benches I personally
think you should make a room and

890
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,290
think you should make a room and
 

891
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,010
think you should make a room and
whenever an anvil was destroyed because

892
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,020
whenever an anvil was destroyed because
 

893
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,530
whenever an anvil was destroyed because
of overuse you could make a piston belt

894
00:26:59,530 --> 00:26:59,540
of overuse you could make a piston belt
 

895
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,740
of overuse you could make a piston belt
that replaces it or something I just

896
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:02,750
that replaces it or something I just
 

897
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,540
that replaces it or something I just
thought that would be really cool

898
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:04,550
thought that would be really cool
 

899
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,250
thought that would be really cool
addition to your world and it will give

900
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:06,260
addition to your world and it will give
 

901
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,180
addition to your world and it will give
you something to do with your redstone

902
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,190
you something to do with your redstone
 

903
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,950
you something to do with your redstone
yeah you know what I'll probably have a

904
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:11,960
yeah you know what I'll probably have a
 

905
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,600
yeah you know what I'll probably have a
few animals around the world some of

906
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:13,610
few animals around the world some of
 

907
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,950
few animals around the world some of
them might just be on their own but I

908
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
them might just be on their own but I
 

909
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,770
them might just be on their own but I
might also make anvil dispensers at some

910
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:17,780
might also make anvil dispensers at some
 

911
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,970
might also make anvil dispensers at some
point too but I haven't really used

912
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:21,980
point too but I haven't really used
 

913
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,440
point too but I haven't really used
anvils yet because and I think they're

914
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:26,450
anvils yet because and I think they're
 

915
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,740
anvils yet because and I think they're
still working on them quite a bit so

916
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:29,750
still working on them quite a bit so
 

917
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,600
still working on them quite a bit so
maybe 11.4 comes out all you some more

918
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:33,610
maybe 11.4 comes out all you some more
 

919
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,789
maybe 11.4 comes out all you some more
second comment it bugs me so

920
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:37,799
second comment it bugs me so
 

921
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,499
second comment it bugs me so
so much that the beacon is off-center oh

922
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:41,509
so much that the beacon is off-center oh
 

923
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:45,440
so much that the beacon is off-center oh
it bugs me so much when people say that

924
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,450
it bugs me so much when people say that
 

925
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,899
it bugs me so much when people say that
because I've said many times that I need

926
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:47,909
because I've said many times that I need
 

927
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:49,580
because I've said many times that I need
three more beacons and then they will be

928
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:49,590
three more beacons and then they will be
 

929
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,479
three more beacons and then they will be
centered perfectly fine this wait I'll

930
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:53,489
centered perfectly fine this wait I'll
 

931
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:55,729
centered perfectly fine this wait I'll
get three more they'll be centered look

932
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:55,739
get three more they'll be centered look
 

933
00:27:55,739 --> 00:28:00,739
get three more they'll be centered look
fine okay thanks for watching
