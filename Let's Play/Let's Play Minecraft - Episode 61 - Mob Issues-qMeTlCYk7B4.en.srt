hi everybody this is etho again firstly
I want to say thank you to everybody

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:06,660
I want to say thank you to everybody
 

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,089
I want to say thank you to everybody
that gave me ideas about the wolf and

6
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:10,099
that gave me ideas about the wolf and
 

7
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,730
that gave me ideas about the wolf and
sheep shearing issue that I've been

8
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:13,740
sheep shearing issue that I've been
 

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,760
sheep shearing issue that I've been
pondering about I got a lot of good

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:16,770
pondering about I got a lot of good
 

11
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,929
pondering about I got a lot of good
information from you guys one thing you

12
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:20,939
information from you guys one thing you
 

13
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,420
information from you guys one thing you
confirm that wolves can attack sheep

14
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:23,430
confirm that wolves can attack sheep
 

15
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,210
confirm that wolves can attack sheep
through doors when I tried it it didn't

16
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,220
through doors when I tried it it didn't
 

17
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,769
through doors when I tried it it didn't
work but I guess it was because the wolf

18
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:30,779
work but I guess it was because the wolf
 

19
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,650
work but I guess it was because the wolf
and the Sheep weren't held into place so

20
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:33,660
and the Sheep weren't held into place so
 

21
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,770
and the Sheep weren't held into place so
they were bumping each other apart which

22
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:36,780
they were bumping each other apart which
 

23
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,810
they were bumping each other apart which
was making it so the wolf couldn't reach

24
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:38,820
was making it so the wolf couldn't reach
 

25
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,400
was making it so the wolf couldn't reach
the sheep when I tried it but if you

26
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,410
the sheep when I tried it but if you
 

27
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,150
the sheep when I tried it but if you
hold them in place

28
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
hold them in place
 

29
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,209
hold them in place
it seems to work

30
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:47,219

 

31
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,850

you also confirm that the southwestt

32
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:49,860
you also confirm that the southwestt
 

33
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,270
you also confirm that the southwestt
trick works so you could for example

34
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
trick works so you could for example
 

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,939
trick works so you could for example
have a wolf here and the Sheep flowing

36
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:55,949
have a wolf here and the Sheep flowing
 

37
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,840
have a wolf here and the Sheep flowing
by and the wolf could attack the sheep

38
00:00:59,840 --> 00:00:59,850
by and the wolf could attack the sheep
 

39
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,219
by and the wolf could attack the sheep
through the corner I think so that's

40
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:04,229
through the corner I think so that's
 

41
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,310
through the corner I think so that's
what this is this is a little mock-up my

42
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
what this is this is a little mock-up my
 

43
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,950
what this is this is a little mock-up my
idea is I haven't tested to see if this

44
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
idea is I haven't tested to see if this
 

45
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,670
idea is I haven't tested to see if this
works or not

46
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
works or not
 

47
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,670
works or not
but you would have your stream here with

48
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,680
but you would have your stream here with
 

49
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,320
but you would have your stream here with
the Wolves if this door is opened

50
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,330
the Wolves if this door is opened
 

51
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,810
the Wolves if this door is opened
won't forget pushed inside there might

52
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:23,820
won't forget pushed inside there might
 

53
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,859
won't forget pushed inside there might
be a dead zone here that's one issue I'm

54
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:27,869
be a dead zone here that's one issue I'm
 

55
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,760
be a dead zone here that's one issue I'm
dealing with at the moment but then the

56
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:31,770
dealing with at the moment but then the
 

57
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,350
dealing with at the moment but then the
idea is you would fall down here to a

58
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
idea is you would fall down here to a
 

59
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,350
idea is you would fall down here to a
pressure plate which would close the

60
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,360
pressure plate which would close the
 

61
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,359
pressure plate which would close the
store so no more wolves could enter and

62
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:40,369
store so no more wolves could enter and
 

63
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,319
store so no more wolves could enter and
as long as he's standing on this

64
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,329
as long as he's standing on this
 

65
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,920
as long as he's standing on this
pressure plate that door stays closed

66
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:45,930
pressure plate that door stays closed
 

67
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,280
pressure plate that door stays closed
and then this stream is where the cows

68
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,290
and then this stream is where the cows
 

69
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,310
and then this stream is where the cows
and sheep would be and

70
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320

 

71
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,980

basically he'll attack the first sheep

72
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:58,990
basically he'll attack the first sheep
 

73
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,700
basically he'll attack the first sheep
that comes by because it's the first one

74
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:02,710
that comes by because it's the first one
 

75
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,770
that comes by because it's the first one
he should see there might be issues that

76
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:04,780
he should see there might be issues that
 

77
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,480
he should see there might be issues that
there's large clusters of sheep he might

78
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,490
there's large clusters of sheep he might
 

79
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,120
there's large clusters of sheep he might
not be able to keep up not really a

80
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,130
not be able to keep up not really a
 

81
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,890
not be able to keep up not really a
concern of mine and what you could do is

82
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:16,900
concern of mine and what you could do is
 

83
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,949
concern of mine and what you could do is
have a stream flowing over a sign that

84
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:19,959
have a stream flowing over a sign that
 

85
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,190
have a stream flowing over a sign that
the wool would fall down but the animals

86
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
the wool would fall down but the animals
 

87
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,759
the wool would fall down but the animals
would go over top and then further down

88
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:25,769
would go over top and then further down
 

89
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,490
would go over top and then further down
have a killing mechanism to kill the

90
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:29,500
have a killing mechanism to kill the
 

91
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,070
have a killing mechanism to kill the
cows that the leather would fall down

92
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
cows that the leather would fall down
 

93
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,449
cows that the leather would fall down
another assign thing and it would so the

94
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:39,459
another assign thing and it would so the
 

95
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,009
another assign thing and it would so the
wool and the leather would do two

96
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:41,019
wool and the leather would do two
 

97
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,350
wool and the leather would do two
separate paths and any extra sheep that

98
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
separate paths and any extra sheep that
 

99
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,990
separate paths and any extra sheep that
makes it by the wolf that aren't sheared

100
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
makes it by the wolf that aren't sheared
 

101
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,170
makes it by the wolf that aren't sheared
will also get killed by a lava things

102
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,180
will also get killed by a lava things
 

103
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,570
will also get killed by a lava things
similar to what I have up there so

104
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:54,580
similar to what I have up there so
 

105
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,420
similar to what I have up there so
that's kind of my current plan I think

106
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,430
that's kind of my current plan I think
 

107
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,130
that's kind of my current plan I think
that's the best way of doing it this

108
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,140
that's the best way of doing it this
 

109
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,140
that's the best way of doing it this
thing of them attacking through the

110
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,150
thing of them attacking through the
 

111
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,900
thing of them attacking through the
doors might work too I don't know

112
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:09,910
doors might work too I don't know
 

113
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,600
doors might work too I don't know
robot accost made a good video on this

114
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:12,610
robot accost made a good video on this
 

115
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,330
robot accost made a good video on this
I'll link it in the description it has

116
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:15,340
I'll link it in the description it has
 

117
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,699
I'll link it in the description it has
potential but it has a lot of problems

118
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:17,709
potential but it has a lot of problems
 

119
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,050
potential but it has a lot of problems
too

120
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,060
too
 

121
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,690
too
namely dealing with the cows is kind of

122
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:21,700
namely dealing with the cows is kind of
 

123
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,090
namely dealing with the cows is kind of
an issue but I'm not gonna set this up

124
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,100
an issue but I'm not gonna set this up
 

125
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,449
an issue but I'm not gonna set this up
yet you guys can go ahead if you want

126
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:30,459
yet you guys can go ahead if you want
 

127
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,569
yet you guys can go ahead if you want
and let me know if it works and if not I

128
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:33,579
and let me know if it works and if not I
 

129
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:38,699
and let me know if it works and if not I
will do it first about what we're gonna

130
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:38,709
will do it first about what we're gonna
 

131
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,190
will do it first about what we're gonna
do is we're gonna work on like I said

132
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
do is we're gonna work on like I said
 

133
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,199
do is we're gonna work on like I said
improving some of that in efficiencies

134
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,209
improving some of that in efficiencies
 

135
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,370
improving some of that in efficiencies
of that system so I get my tool belt on

136
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:47,380
of that system so I get my tool belt on
 

137
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,660
of that system so I get my tool belt on
and we're gonna do some demolition I

138
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:53,670

 

139
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,500

should probably point this out to

140
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:55,510
should probably point this out to
 

141
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,509
should probably point this out to
whether I so many of time of comments

142
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
whether I so many of time of comments
 

143
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,380
whether I so many of time of comments
but this is like I cut out look at what

144
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,390
but this is like I cut out look at what
 

145
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,390
but this is like I cut out look at what
I'm gonna do obviously this would be

146
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm gonna do obviously this would be
 

147
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,539
I'm gonna do obviously this would be
covered up otherwise the wolf would just

148
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:06,549
covered up otherwise the wolf would just
 

149
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:07,730
covered up otherwise the wolf would just
jump out

150
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:07,740
jump out
 

151
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,330
jump out
and attack the sheet so I keep that in

152
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,340
and attack the sheet so I keep that in
 

153
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,760
and attack the sheet so I keep that in
mind okay so one of the things I said I

154
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:16,770
mind okay so one of the things I said I
 

155
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,400
mind okay so one of the things I said I
wanted to do is changes for my 2x2 area

156
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,410
wanted to do is changes for my 2x2 area
 

157
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,760
wanted to do is changes for my 2x2 area
this drop here to a 1x1 because I'm

158
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,770
this drop here to a 1x1 because I'm
 

159
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,020
this drop here to a 1x1 because I'm
having issues with mobs getting stuck in

160
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,030
having issues with mobs getting stuck in
 

161
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,680
having issues with mobs getting stuck in
this area here usually it's only two but

162
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:33,690
this area here usually it's only two but

let's go up there first and map that out

192
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,490
let's go up there first and map that out
 

193
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,380
let's go up there first and map that out
how we want it so like I said before I

194
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,390
how we want it so like I said before I
 

195
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,120
how we want it so like I said before I
can't just have all the streams merge

196
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,130
can't just have all the streams merge
 

197
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,190
can't just have all the streams merge
together so that there's a one-by-one

198
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,200
together so that there's a one-by-one
 

199
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,440
together so that there's a one-by-one
opening because the mobs will just keep

200
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,450
opening because the mobs will just keep
 

201
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,180
opening because the mobs will just keep
bumping each other and they won't be

202
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,190
bumping each other and they won't be
 

203
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,570
bumping each other and they won't be
able to fall down it but I do know a

204
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:22,580
able to fall down it but I do know a
 

205
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:30,670
able to fall down it but I do know a
better way of doing it which I figured

206
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,680
better way of doing it which I figured
 

207
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,520
better way of doing it which I figured
out recently so we want it we want them

208
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,530
out recently so we want it we want them
 

209
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,260
out recently so we want it we want them
to fall down this block let's see how to

210
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,270
to fall down this block let's see how to
 

211
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:56,989
to fall down this block let's see how to
do this

212
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:56,999

 

213
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:05,469

okay I think we just need like a to drop

214
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:05,479

 

215
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:15,589

please glass there and I guess over over

216
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
please glass there and I guess over over
 

217
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,650
please glass there and I guess over over
there

218
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:19,660

 

219
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:33,059

here is some more of these signs

220
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:33,069

 

221
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:42,309

go all the way out there's another

222
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
go all the way out there's another
 

223
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:56,499
go all the way out there's another
exciting building episodes yeah oh yeah

224
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:56,509
exciting building episodes yeah oh yeah
 

225
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,869
exciting building episodes yeah oh yeah
okay I know what I'm doing here I'm

226
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
okay I know what I'm doing here I'm

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,529
okay I know what I'm doing here I'm
gonna have this covered this one too and

228
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:05,539
gonna have this covered this one too and
 

229
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:15,010
gonna have this covered this one too and
then we're gonna have a sign over over

230
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,020
then we're gonna have a sign over over
 

231
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,119
then we're gonna have a sign over over
here make an air gap my name is legging

232
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:21,129
here make an air gap my name is legging
 

233
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:31,269
here make an air gap my name is legging
and water and water yeah that's what I

234
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:31,279
and water and water yeah that's what I
 

235
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:46,900
and water and water yeah that's what I
wanted you

236
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:46,910

 

237
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,110

pretty sure that's all I want to do okay

238
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
pretty sure that's all I want to do okay
 

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,790
pretty sure that's all I want to do okay
so now we need to hold back the water

240
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
so now we need to hold back the water
 

241
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:02,620
so now we need to hold back the water
again somehow

242
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:02,630

 

243
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:10,110

what's the best way of doing this

244
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,120

 

245
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,730

alright time you need a second to think

246
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:12,740
alright time you need a second to think
 

247
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,000
alright time you need a second to think
you're okay so I think I figured it out

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,010
you're okay so I think I figured it out
 

249
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,410
you're okay so I think I figured it out
I'm gonna place a sign here yeah sign on

250
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:20,420
I'm gonna place a sign here yeah sign on
 

251
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm gonna place a sign here yeah sign on
it and a sign on that bond over and

252
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:31,690
it and a sign on that bond over and
 

253
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:39,240
it and a sign on that bond over and
another one over here good

254
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,250

 

255
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,670

so now we have a three-block opening

256
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
so now we have a three-block opening
 

257
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,999
so now we have a three-block opening
here the way this works the mob should

258
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:48,009
here the way this works the mob should
 

259
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:50,280
here the way this works the mob should
not be able to interfere with each other

260
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,290
not be able to interfere with each other
 

261
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,410
not be able to interfere with each other
they kind of will take turns falling

262
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:52,420
they kind of will take turns falling
 

263
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,329
they kind of will take turns falling
down I'm pretty sure if I was ever to

264
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:57,339
down I'm pretty sure if I was ever to
 

265
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,110
down I'm pretty sure if I was ever to
redo this passive mob system instead of

266
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
redo this passive mob system instead of
 

267
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,379
redo this passive mob system instead of
having like an even number so that it's

268
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:04,389
having like an even number so that it's
 

269
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:09,269
having like an even number so that it's
a 2x2 area I would make it an odd number

270
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
a 2x2 area I would make it an odd number
 

271
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,900
a 2x2 area I would make it an odd number
so it's a one by one opening and I would

272
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:12,910
so it's a one by one opening and I would
 

273
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,319
so it's a one by one opening and I would
make like a plus sign like this so I

274
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:16,329
make like a plus sign like this so I
 

275
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,290
make like a plus sign like this so I
would add another another one of these

276
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:19,300
would add another another one of these
 

277
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,350
would add another another one of these
drops over here and another one over

278
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,360
drops over here and another one over
 

279
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,110
drops over here and another one over
here make a plus sign is how I would do

280
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,120
here make a plus sign is how I would do
 

281
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,269
here make a plus sign is how I would do
it and I might like if I ever go ahead

282
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
it and I might like if I ever go ahead
 

283
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,749
it and I might like if I ever go ahead
and build another base with another mob

284
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:36,759
and build another base with another mob
 

285
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,059
and build another base with another mob
system I might also make it so it's one

286
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:42,069
system I might also make it so it's one
 

287
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,759
system I might also make it so it's one
y canals instead of two to see how that

288
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:44,769
y canals instead of two to see how that
 

289
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,150
y canals instead of two to see how that
works

290
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,160
works
 

291
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,949
works
and I'd problem eight the spawning pads

292
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
and I'd problem eight the spawning pads
 

293
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,160
and I'd problem eight the spawning pads
even smaller okay so let's head back

294
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,170
even smaller okay so let's head back
 

295
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:04,879
even smaller okay so let's head back
down let's finish finish this up

296
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:04,889

 

297
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:14,280

chickens

298
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,290

 

299
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,050

we'll make a new path here I think and

300
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,060
we'll make a new path here I think and
 

301
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,759
we'll make a new path here I think and
close this one up probably and we'll

302
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:23,769
close this one up probably and we'll
 

303
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:35,220
close this one up probably and we'll
make this solid glass and then we can

304
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,230
make this solid glass and then we can
 

305
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:55,019
make this solid glass and then we can
break all this and I think I have to

306
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:55,029
break all this and I think I have to
 

307
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,309
break all this and I think I have to
leave that I don't want Ward water to

308
00:11:59,309 --> 00:11:59,319
leave that I don't want Ward water to
 

309
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,230
leave that I don't want Ward water to
pour down rather Isis finna Rick Linea

310
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,240
pour down rather Isis finna Rick Linea
 

311
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:17,809
pour down rather Isis finna Rick Linea
Redstone wiring down below alright I

312
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:17,819

 

313

315
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,009

so I'm just gonna close this off for now

316
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:33,019
so I'm just gonna close this off for now
 

317
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,650
so I'm just gonna close this off for now
so I know where it is

318
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:34,660
so I know where it is
 

319
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,090

what I need it's not a one by one it's a
 

325
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,309
what I need it's not a one by one it's a
to the two white ones so I'm gonna place

326
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:57,319
to the two white ones so I'm gonna place
 

327
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:02,650
to the two white ones so I'm gonna place
glass up here yet and get rid of this

328
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:02,660
glass up here yet and get rid of this
 

329
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,590
glass up here yet and get rid of this
side place glass here

330
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
side place glass here
 

331
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,350
side place glass here
there's just a one hide app there for

332
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
there's just a one hide app there for
 

333
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,220
there's just a one hide app there for
the chickens to fit through yeah okay

334
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,230
the chickens to fit through yeah okay
 

335
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,480
the chickens to fit through yeah okay
that should be it just have to fix this

336
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,490
that should be it just have to fix this
 

337
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,249
that should be it just have to fix this
chicken separator since it got moved

338
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:24,259
chicken separator since it got moved
 

339
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:30,160
chicken separator since it got moved
over one block it's really confusing to

340
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,170
over one block it's really confusing to
 

341
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:37,960
over one block it's really confusing to
see through all this glass oh you know

342
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:37,970
see through all this glass oh you know
 

343
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,960
see through all this glass oh you know
what I think it's actually set up here

344
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:42,970

 

345
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,110

yeah okay well that was easy it's glass

346
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
yeah okay well that was easy it's glass
 

347
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,140
yeah okay well that was easy it's glass
there

348
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,150

 

349
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,240

glass here and it should be about done

350
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,250
glass here and it should be about done
 

351
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,980
glass here and it should be about done
good alright that's fixed and it's night

352
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:04,990
good alright that's fixed and it's night
 

353
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,110
good alright that's fixed and it's night
time so we might be able to see it in

354
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
time so we might be able to see it in
 

355
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,060
time so we might be able to see it in
action so I'll skip ahead and hopefully

356
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,070
action so I'll skip ahead and hopefully
 

357
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,710
action so I'll skip ahead and hopefully
I'll have a big clump of mops here and

358
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:13,720
I'll have a big clump of mops here and
 

359
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:22,860
I'll have a big clump of mops here and
we'll see if they fall down okay so this

360
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:22,870
we'll see if they fall down okay so this
 

361
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,710
we'll see if they fall down okay so this
is gonna be proof that the mop spawning

362
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:25,720
is gonna be proof that the mop spawning
 

363
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,240
is gonna be proof that the mop spawning
is still broken in beta a 1.5 - 0 1 as

you can see there is no mobs down here

366
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:37,800
you can see there is no mobs down here
 

367
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,960
you can see there is no mobs down here
there's no grass nearby there's only 1

368
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:42,970
there's no grass nearby there's only 1
 

369
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,170
there's no grass nearby there's only 1
chicken left here that hasn't be spawned

370
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,180
chicken left here that hasn't be spawned
 

371
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,910
chicken left here that hasn't be spawned
yet because he was within range of me

372
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
yet because he was within range of me
 

373
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,060
yet because he was within range of me
and there is no passive mob spawning on

374
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,070
and there is no passive mob spawning on
 

375
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:59,460
and there is no passive mob spawning on
my spawning pads so that one chicken is

376
00:14:59,460 --> 00:14:59,470
my spawning pads so that one chicken is
 

377
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,860
my spawning pads so that one chicken is
the only passive mob in my world right

378
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:01,870
the only passive mob in my world right
 

379
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:10,610
the only passive mob in my world right
now they're not spawning up here and

380
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:10,620
now they're not spawning up here and
 

381
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,560
now they're not spawning up here and
this happens with my hostile mob system

382
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:13,570
this happens with my hostile mob system
 

383
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,700
this happens with my hostile mob system
sometimes - and this is happening to a

384
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:17,710
sometimes - and this is happening to a
 

385
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,070
sometimes - and this is happening to a
lot of people actually just it almost

386
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:23,080
lot of people actually just it almost
 

387
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,770
lot of people actually just it almost
seems random but passive mobs will just

388
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:25,780
seems random but passive mobs will just
 

389
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,010
seems random but passive mobs will just
completely stop spawning or hostile mobs

390
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,020
completely stop spawning or hostile mobs
 

391
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,370
completely stop spawning or hostile mobs
will completely stop spawning and I've

392
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:32,380
will completely stop spawning and I've
 

393
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,050
will completely stop spawning and I've
had to happen with both of them at the

394
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,060
had to happen with both of them at the
 

395
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,450
had to happen with both of them at the
same time actually so I've been trying

396
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:39,460
same time actually so I've been trying
 

397
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,570
same time actually so I've been trying
to figure out how to fix it for me what

398
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:42,580
to figure out how to fix it for me what
 

399
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,260
to figure out how to fix it for me what
I found so far is I just need to leave

400
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,270
I found so far is I just need to leave
 

401
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,190
I found so far is I just need to leave
the area to leave the chunk if you look

402
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,200
the area to leave the chunk if you look
 

403
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,900
the area to leave the chunk if you look
at my coordinates

404
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:51,910
at my coordinates
 

405
00:15:51,910 --> 00:16:16,290
at my coordinates
I have a point here I'm sure you see how

406
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:16,300
I have a point here I'm sure you see how
 

407
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,190
I have a point here I'm sure you see how
X is going down to zero once I hit zero

408
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,200
X is going down to zero once I hit zero
 

409
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:28,530
X is going down to zero once I hit zero
I'm gonna be in a new chunk and so all I

410
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:28,540
I'm gonna be in a new chunk and so all I
 

411
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,020
I'm gonna be in a new chunk and so all I
need to do I think is spend some time

412
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,030
need to do I think is spend some time
 

413
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,710
need to do I think is spend some time
away from that other chunk the chunks

414
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
away from that other chunk the chunks
 

415
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:43,290
away from that other chunk the chunks
are 512 by 512 so they're pretty big but

416
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:43,300
are 512 by 512 so they're pretty big but
 

417
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,830
are 512 by 512 so they're pretty big but
if you leave it and you get passive mobs

418
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:46,840
if you leave it and you get passive mobs
 

419
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,000
if you leave it and you get passive mobs
spawning away from that chunk and D

420
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,010
spawning away from that chunk and D
 

421
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,330
spawning away from that chunk and D
spawning then it seems to work again for

422
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:54,340
spawning then it seems to work again for
 

423
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:06,929
spawning then it seems to work again for
me that's how I fix the problem just a

424
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:06,939
me that's how I fix the problem just a
 

425
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:10,530
me that's how I fix the problem just a
nice casual stroll is the officially

426
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:10,540
nice casual stroll is the officially
 

427
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:22,380
nice casual stroll is the officially
dark forest night dodging skills are

428
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,390
dark forest night dodging skills are
 

429
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,069
dark forest night dodging skills are
very good

430
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079

 

431
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,529

and we're just gonna go where there's

432
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:30,539
and we're just gonna go where there's
 

433
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:38,810
and we're just gonna go where there's
some passive mob spawning um some of you

434
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:38,820
some passive mob spawning um some of you
 

435
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,609
some passive mob spawning um some of you
guys know what the deal is with this I

436
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:40,619
guys know what the deal is with this I
 

437
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,180
guys know what the deal is with this I
did not trigger it it went off on its

438
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,190
did not trigger it it went off on its
 

439
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,310
did not trigger it it went off on its
own one day and I just came here and

440
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
own one day and I just came here and
 

441
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,700
own one day and I just came here and
there was a giant hole in the ground so

442
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:49,710
there was a giant hole in the ground so
 

443
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:56,960
there was a giant hole in the ground so
I have no idea when it happened but it

444
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:56,970
I have no idea when it happened but it
 

445
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,609
I have no idea when it happened but it
was sometime recently I think I left the

446
00:17:58,609 --> 00:17:58,619
was sometime recently I think I left the
 

447
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,419
was sometime recently I think I left the
door open and I chickened got in and set

448
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:02,429
door open and I chickened got in and set
 

449
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:09,979
door open and I chickened got in and set
off all the TNT yes I'm just going to

450
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:09,989
off all the TNT yes I'm just going to
 

451
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,389
off all the TNT yes I'm just going to
spend some time here then we'll head

452
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:11,399
spend some time here then we'll head
 

453
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,609
spend some time here then we'll head
back and we'll see if acid mobs start

454
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:13,619
back and we'll see if acid mobs start
 

455
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:22,909
back and we'll see if acid mobs start
spawning again okay we spent a little

456
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:22,919
spawning again okay we spent a little
 

457
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,149
spawning again okay we spent a little
time here so let's head back and

458
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:25,159
time here so let's head back and
 

459
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,629
time here so let's head back and
probably five minutes a bunch of passive

460
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:29,639
probably five minutes a bunch of passive
 

461
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:34,369
probably five minutes a bunch of passive
mobs spawned once I changed chunks or

462
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:34,379
mobs spawned once I changed chunks or
 

463
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,930
mobs spawned once I changed chunks or
regions are called now I guess that 512

464
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:38,940
regions are called now I guess that 512
 

465
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,399
regions are called now I guess that 512
by 512 regions so now when I head back

466
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:42,409
by 512 regions so now when I head back
 

467
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,830
by 512 regions so now when I head back
those mobs should be spawn which somehow

468
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
those mobs should be spawn which somehow
 

469
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,989
those mobs should be spawn which somehow
seems to fix the problem when they D

470
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:50,999
seems to fix the problem when they D
 

471
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:57,950
seems to fix the problem when they D
spawn so when I head back to my other

472
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:57,960
spawn so when I head back to my other
 

473
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,450
spawn so when I head back to my other
chunk or other region here my passive

474
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:02,460
chunk or other region here my passive
 

475
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,479
chunk or other region here my passive
mob system should work again it might be

476
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:05,489
mob system should work again it might be
 

477
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,369
mob system should work again it might be
a little slow though because I didn't

478
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:07,379
a little slow though because I didn't
 

479
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:17,460
a little slow though because I didn't
let too many mobs despawn

480
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:17,470

 

481
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,289

and I haven't figured out exactly what

482
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:20,299
and I haven't figured out exactly what
 

483
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,019
and I haven't figured out exactly what
causes the problem but I know a lot of

484
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:23,029
causes the problem but I know a lot of
 

485
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,609
causes the problem but I know a lot of
people are suffering from this and

486
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:26,619
people are suffering from this and
 

487
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:29,560
people are suffering from this and
people just some people have a really

488
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:29,570
people just some people have a really
 

489
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,999
people just some people have a really
hard time getting mobs to spawn again so

490
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:34,009
hard time getting mobs to spawn again so
 

491
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,419
hard time getting mobs to spawn again so
I just suggest walking around away from

492
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:37,429
I just suggest walking around away from
 

493
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:44,999
I just suggest walking around away from
your area for a while

494
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:45,009

 

495
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:50,139

any mobs yeah we have mob spawning again

496
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:50,149
any mobs yeah we have mob spawning again
 

497
00:19:50,149 --> 00:20:06,749
any mobs yeah we have mob spawning again
so it works I'll go up there to prove it

498
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:06,759

 

499
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,519

it's a really annoying problem I hope

500
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:09,529
it's a really annoying problem I hope
 

501
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:12,700
it's a really annoying problem I hope
not fixes it unless you did it

502
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:12,710
not fixes it unless you did it
 

503
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,060
not fixes it unless you did it
intentionally to make mob system stopped

504
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,070
intentionally to make mob system stopped
 

505
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,629
intentionally to make mob system stopped
working somehow but it seems like a

506
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:19,639
working somehow but it seems like a
 

507
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:24,029
working somehow but it seems like a
strange thing to do in tension

508
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:24,039

 

509
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,989

yeah we had mobs again like magic so I

510
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:28,999
yeah we had mobs again like magic so I
 

511
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:36,060
yeah we had mobs again like magic so I
just left the region when I crossed over

512
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,070

 

513
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:42,849

the zero boundary for X so I was saying

514
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:42,859
the zero boundary for X so I was saying
 

515
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,560
the zero boundary for X so I was saying
that chunk before when I should have

516
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:44,570
that chunk before when I should have
 

517
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,789
that chunk before when I should have
been saying region a region is 512 by

518
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
been saying region a region is 512 by
 

519
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,599
been saying region a region is 512 by
512 and you cross regions

520
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:52,609
512 and you cross regions
 

521
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:59,169
512 and you cross regions
every 512 blocks so if you were to walk

522
00:20:59,169 --> 00:20:59,179
every 512 blocks so if you were to walk
 

523
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:04,269
every 512 blocks so if you were to walk
this way my Zed is decreasing at 0 it

524
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:04,279
this way my Zed is decreasing at 0 it
 

525
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,060
this way my Zed is decreasing at 0 it
would be a new region and negative 512

526
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,070
would be a new region and negative 512
 

527
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,359
would be a new region and negative 512
it would be another new region and a

528
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:10,369
it would be another new region and a
 

529
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,879
it would be another new region and a
negative a thousand and 24 and you would

530
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:12,889
negative a thousand and 24 and you would
 

531
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:17,139
negative a thousand and 24 and you would
cross a new region same if same with X

532
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:17,149
cross a new region same if same with X
 

533
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:19,890
cross a new region same if same with X
so that's how you can figure out

534
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:19,900
so that's how you can figure out
 

535
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,010
so that's how you can figure out
if you're in a new region and just need

536
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,020
if you're in a new region and just need
 

537
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,750
if you're in a new region and just need
like if you want hostile mobs to start

538
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
like if you want hostile mobs to start
 

539
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,390
like if you want hostile mobs to start
working in need to spawn some hostile

540
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
working in need to spawn some hostile
 

541
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,540
working in need to spawn some hostile
mobs and then when you walk away they'll

542
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:33,550
mobs and then when you walk away they'll
 

543
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,920
mobs and then when you walk away they'll
be spawn whence they are more than 128

544
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:37,930
be spawn whence they are more than 128
 

545
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,510
be spawn whence they are more than 128
blocks away from you little pretty much

546
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
blocks away from you little pretty much
 

547
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,360
blocks away from you little pretty much
instantly despawn and that seems to

548
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,370
instantly despawn and that seems to
 

549
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,900
instantly despawn and that seems to
somehow allow them to spawn again in the

550
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:45,910
somehow allow them to spawn again in the
 

551
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,080
somehow allow them to spawn again in the
region that is broken or at least for me

552
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,090
region that is broken or at least for me
 

553
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,230
region that is broken or at least for me
that's how I did it working hopefully it

554
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,240
that's how I did it working hopefully it
 

555
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,730
that's how I did it working hopefully it
works for you guys too if you have the

556
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:56,740
works for you guys too if you have the
 

557
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,700
works for you guys too if you have the
problem it happens to me if I stay in

558
00:21:59,700 --> 00:21:59,710
problem it happens to me if I stay in
 

559
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,000
problem it happens to me if I stay in
that region for a long period of time

560
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,010
that region for a long period of time
 

561
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:09,450
that region for a long period of time
and killing lots of mobs or it might

562
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:09,460
and killing lots of mobs or it might
 

563
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,030
and killing lots of mobs or it might
because torches I don't know exactly

564
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,040
because torches I don't know exactly
 

565
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,560
because torches I don't know exactly
what causes it but I seem to know how to

566
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,570
what causes it but I seem to know how to
 

567
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,080
what causes it but I seem to know how to
fix it so that's good

568
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,090

 

569
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,940

alright so we're pretty much out of time

570
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:23,950
alright so we're pretty much out of time
 

571
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,549
alright so we're pretty much out of time
so we're gonna end the episode here I

572
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
so we're gonna end the episode here I
 

573
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,690
so we're gonna end the episode here I
didn't really get a good demonstration

574
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:27,700
didn't really get a good demonstration
 

575
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,169
didn't really get a good demonstration
of not working but it quite clearly does

576
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:31,179
of not working but it quite clearly does
 

577
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:36,450
of not working but it quite clearly does
work chickens have been separated and

578
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:36,460
work chickens have been separated and
 

579
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,730
work chickens have been separated and
see they're being losers stuck in the

580
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:38,740
see they're being losers stuck in the
 

581
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,110
see they're being losers stuck in the
door here these door junctions don't

582
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
door here these door junctions don't
 

583
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,960
door here these door junctions don't
work well for small mobs and they have

584
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:45,970
work well for small mobs and they have
 

585
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,470
work well for small mobs and they have
dead zones and I might work on fixing

586
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:49,480
dead zones and I might work on fixing
 

587
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,870
dead zones and I might work on fixing
this oh because I don't like how mobs

588
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
this oh because I don't like how mobs
 

589
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,200
this oh because I don't like how mobs
are getting stuck in the doors but yeah

590
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,210
are getting stuck in the doors but yeah
 

591
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,210
are getting stuck in the doors but yeah
you saw a large number of mobs went

592
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:03,220
you saw a large number of mobs went
 

593
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,190
you saw a large number of mobs went
through and they didn't get stuck

594
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
through and they didn't get stuck
 

595
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,390
through and they didn't get stuck
anywhere they'd get stuck up there or

596
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,400
anywhere they'd get stuck up there or
 

597
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,130
anywhere they'd get stuck up there or
down here so that was good

598
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,140
down here so that was good
 

599
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,970
down here so that was good
so it must be working but that's it for

600
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:16,980
so it must be working but that's it for
 

601
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,880
so it must be working but that's it for
today thank you for watching and I'll

602
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:19,890
today thank you for watching and I'll
 

603
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,390
