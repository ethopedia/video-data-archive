00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:17,189
probably not gonna get a finish today
 

55
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,240

this ice bar here is the perfect example

58
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,070
this ice bar here is the perfect example
 

59
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,090
this ice bar here is the perfect example
of why it's so easy to start a project

60
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,100
of why it's so easy to start a project
 

61
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,700
of why it's so easy to start a project
but so hard to finish one because whoo

62
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:28,710
but so hard to finish one because whoo
 

63
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,880
but so hard to finish one because whoo
man I tell ya

64
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:31,890
man I tell ya
 

65
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,530
man I tell ya
designing it's probably the most

66
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:33,540
designing it's probably the most
 

67
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,210
designing it's probably the most
interesting part we did some of that

68
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:35,220
interesting part we did some of that
 

69
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,249
interesting part we did some of that
together and since then I've revised it

70
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:37,259
together and since then I've revised it
 

71
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,960
together and since then I've revised it
so we'll probably spend some time

72
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:38,970
so we'll probably spend some time
 

73
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,960
so we'll probably spend some time
checking that out again today but spend

74
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:41,970
checking that out again today but spend
 

75
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,580
checking that out again today but spend
a couple hours designing the thing right

76
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:43,590
a couple hours designing the thing right
 

77
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,960
a couple hours designing the thing right
and then you got to actually build it

78
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:44,970
and then you got to actually build it
 

79
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,030
and then you got to actually build it
since you can't just build it guess what

80
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
since you can't just build it guess what
 

81
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,980
since you can't just build it guess what
you gotta clear the land in the way cuz

82
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:48,990
you gotta clear the land in the way cuz
 

83
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,139
you gotta clear the land in the way cuz
you need a flat spots right once you get

84
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:54,149
you need a flat spots right once you get
 

85
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,819
you need a flat spots right once you get
the flat spot though I only got to set

86
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:55,829
the flat spot though I only got to set
 

87
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,350
the flat spot though I only got to set
up a beacon and stuff for the speed mine

88
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
up a beacon and stuff for the speed mine
 

89
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,359
up a beacon and stuff for the speed mine
it takes a bunch of time when I see it

90
00:01:59,359 --> 00:01:59,369
it takes a bunch of time when I see it
 

91
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,700
it takes a bunch of time when I see it
the flat spot though you can't just

92
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:01,710
the flat spot though you can't just
 

93
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,749
the flat spot though you can't just
build it you got to collect the

94
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:02,759
build it you got to collect the
 

95
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,060
build it you got to collect the
resources to build it so then you got to

96
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,070
resources to build it so then you got to
 

97
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,359
resources to build it so then you got to
go gather clay and ice and make a

98
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:08,369
go gather clay and ice and make a
 

99
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,949
go gather clay and ice and make a
bajillion Despenser's you think these

bajillion Despenser's you think these
 

101
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,600
bajillion Despenser's you think these
two stacks with dispensers are gonna do

102
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:11,610
two stacks with dispensers are gonna do
 

103
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,770
two stacks with dispensers are gonna do
anything that's not even gonna put a

you got a place thousands and thousands
 

119
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,110
you got a place thousands and thousands
of blocks because you see what we got

120
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,120
of blocks because you see what we got
 

121
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,240
of blocks because you see what we got
built here we got a copy this at least

122
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,250
built here we got a copy this at least
 

123
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,240
built here we got a copy this at least
10 to 20 times I would say and this took

124
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,250
10 to 20 times I would say and this took
 

125
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,250
10 to 20 times I would say and this took
several hours to build already uh-huh

126
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,260
several hours to build already uh-huh

I went too far
 

145
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,680
I went too far
yeah I actually got a pretty good rhythm

146
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,690
yeah I actually got a pretty good rhythm
 

147
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,559

going on here now I think so I didn't

148
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:12,569
going on here now I think so I didn't
 

149
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,360
going on here now I think so I didn't
build one of these these sections I

150
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,370
build one of these these sections I
 

151
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,039
build one of these these sections I
think in 15 minutes now it's basically

152
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,049
think in 15 minutes now it's basically
 

153
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,599
think in 15 minutes now it's basically
an S sort of shape like this this is the

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:20,609
an S sort of shape like this this is the
 

155
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,339
an S sort of shape like this this is the
main thing you got to do just boop boop

156
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:22,349
main thing you got to do just boop boop
 

157
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,430
main thing you got to do just boop boop
and Boop like that's right

158
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,440
and Boop like that's right
 

159
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,670
and Boop like that's right

solid filled all the way down and then
 

161
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,530
solid filled all the way down and then
at the edges here you do something a

162
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:30,540
at the edges here you do something a
 

163
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,940
at the edges here you do something a
little different you get this built up

164
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:31,950
little different you get this built up
 

165
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,659
little different you get this built up
like this like this right then I'd put

166
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:35,669
like this like this right then I'd put
 

167
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,409
like this like this right then I'd put
some birch over here as a block that I

168
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:39,419
some birch over here as a block that I
 

169
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,509
some birch over here as a block that I
can mine with the pic that's not gonna

170
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
can mine with the pic that's not gonna
 

171
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,940
can mine with the pic that's not gonna
break quickly like if I run by with a

172
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:43,950
break quickly like if I run by with a
 

173
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,890
break quickly like if I run by with a
pic you see I I hit the clay and it just

174
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:45,900
pic you see I I hit the clay and it just
 

175
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,890
pic you see I I hit the clay and it just
pops instantly when reminding ice we

176
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:48,900
pops instantly when reminding ice we
 

177
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,089
pops instantly when reminding ice we
don't want to break the frame of our

178
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:50,099
don't want to break the frame of our
 

179
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,949
don't want to break the frame of our
farm here so using birch wood there and

180
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
farm here so using birch wood there and
 

181
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,659
farm here so using birch wood there and
then over here you fill it in four

182
00:03:59,659 --> 00:03:59,669
then over here you fill it in four
 

183
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:02,330
then over here you fill it in four
blocks deep with PAD ice I'm using all

184
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:02,340
blocks deep with PAD ice I'm using all
 

185
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,400
blocks deep with PAD ice I'm using all
the way down and then let's see where

186
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,410
the way down and then let's see where
 

187
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,650
the way down and then let's see where
does it start I think I put one more

188
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:09,660
does it start I think I put one more
 

189
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,729
does it start I think I put one more
birch log here yes

190
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:13,739
birch log here yes
 

191
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,009
birch log here yes
and then dispensers eight dispensers

192
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:18,019
and then dispensers eight dispensers
 

193
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,380
and then dispensers eight dispensers
boop-boop-boop-boop and that's one one

194
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,390
boop-boop-boop-boop and that's one one
 

195
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,240
boop-boop-boop-boop and that's one one
like tiny section I put that there as an

196
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,250
like tiny section I put that there as an
 

197
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,659
like tiny section I put that there as an
indicator I'll put one birch log here

198
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:26,669
indicator I'll put one birch log here
 

199
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,790
indicator I'll put one birch log here
and then for each and every one of these

200
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
and then for each and every one of these
 

201
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,499
and then for each and every one of these
dispensers I'm trying a trick here I'm

202
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:30,509
dispensers I'm trying a trick here I'm
 

203
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,409
dispensers I'm trying a trick here I'm
placing pistons above them and the idea

204
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:33,419
placing pistons above them and the idea
 

205
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,559
placing pistons above them and the idea
behind this is we want these dispensers

206
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:36,569
behind this is we want these dispensers
 

207
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,080
behind this is we want these dispensers
to place a bucket of water to fill to

208
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,090
to place a bucket of water to fill to
 

209
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,760
to place a bucket of water to fill to
fill the area here to turn to ice right

210
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:40,770
fill the area here to turn to ice right
 

211
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,700
fill the area here to turn to ice right
we don't want the water to freeze right

212
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:43,710
we don't want the water to freeze right
 

213
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,480
we don't want the water to freeze right
as it's being placed because if if the

214
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,490
as it's being placed because if if the
 

215
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,999
as it's being placed because if if the
dispenser places water it freezes then

216
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:50,009
dispenser places water it freezes then
 

217
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,739
dispenser places water it freezes then
when it goes to try pick up and refill

218
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:51,749
when it goes to try pick up and refill
 

219
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,570
when it goes to try pick up and refill
those buckets

220
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:52,580
those buckets
 

221
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,219
those buckets
it can't it'll shoot the empty bucket

222
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:55,229
it can't it'll shoot the empty bucket
 

223
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,679
it can't it'll shoot the empty bucket
outs because ice is in front of here we

224
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:57,689
outs because ice is in front of here we
 

225
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:58,939
outs because ice is in front of here we
don't want that to happen so we're using

226
00:04:58,939 --> 00:04:58,949
don't want that to happen so we're using
 

227
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,980
don't want that to happen so we're using
these Pistons we extend them so it's

228
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:00,990
these Pistons we extend them so it's
 

229
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,869
these Pistons we extend them so it's
like there's a block above here as long

230
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:02,879
like there's a block above here as long
 

231
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,369
like there's a block above here as long
as there's a block above there the water

232
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:04,379
as there's a block above there the water
 

233
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,290
as there's a block above there the water
can't freeze if it doesn't have access

234
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,300
can't freeze if it doesn't have access
 

235
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,159
can't freeze if it doesn't have access
to the sky so that gives the dispensers

236
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:10,169
to the sky so that gives the dispensers
 

237
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,290
to the sky so that gives the dispensers
time to place the water have it spread

238
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,300
time to place the water have it spread
 

239
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
time to place the water have it spread
and then pick it up again to refill the

240
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,310
and then pick it up again to refill the
 

241
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,709
and then pick it up again to refill the
bucket for the nest the next cycle and

242
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:17,719
bucket for the nest the next cycle and
 

243
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,689
bucket for the nest the next cycle and
hopefully that'll work out okay uh-huh

244
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:20,699
hopefully that'll work out okay uh-huh
 

245
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,610
hopefully that'll work out okay uh-huh
anyways this is kind of turning into a

246
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:22,620
anyways this is kind of turning into a
 

247
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,290
anyways this is kind of turning into a
how to build this farm instead of me

248
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,300
how to build this farm instead of me
 

249
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,879
how to build this farm instead of me
just building it which is good right

250
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:27,889
just building it which is good right
 

251
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,029
just building it which is good right
what we got to do next is fill in these

252
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:32,039
what we got to do next is fill in these
 

253
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,670
what we got to do next is fill in these
sides here well actually what I usually

254
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:34,680
sides here well actually what I usually
 

255
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,570
sides here well actually what I usually
do I guess just to show you the better

256
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:38,580
do I guess just to show you the better
 

257
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,249
do I guess just to show you the better
order of doing things so that we don't

258
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,259
order of doing things so that we don't
 

259
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,139
order of doing things so that we don't
have water spilling out into the middle

260
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:42,149
have water spilling out into the middle
 

261
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,779
have water spilling out into the middle
here I place trapdoors all above here to

262
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:44,789
here I place trapdoors all above here to
 

263
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:47,450
here I place trapdoors all above here to
hold the water in place these also act

264
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:47,460
hold the water in place these also act
 

265
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,809
hold the water in place these also act
as a seed to start ice forming on this

266
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:50,819
as a seed to start ice forming on this
 

267
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,079
as a seed to start ice forming on this
edge of the water basically that goes

268
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,089
edge of the water basically that goes
 

269
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:59,469
edge of the water basically that goes
all the way down then we have to place

270
00:05:59,469 --> 00:05:59,479
all the way down then we have to place
 

271
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,730
all the way down then we have to place
make sure there's a solid filled yeah

272
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:01,740
make sure there's a solid filled yeah
 

273
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,929
make sure there's a solid filled yeah
it's very good

274
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:02,939
it's very good
 

275
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,519
it's very good
then I place water between each of the

276
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:04,529
then I place water between each of the
 

277
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,820
then I place water between each of the
dispensers and again we got to put a

278
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:07,830
dispensers and again we got to put a
 

279
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,589
dispensers and again we got to put a
water back in each one that takes a bit

280
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:09,599
water back in each one that takes a bit
 

281
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:16,550
water back in each one that takes a bit
of time to place them all inside then

282
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
of time to place them all inside then
 

283
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,249
of time to place them all inside then
over here at each section I do another

284
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:19,259
over here at each section I do another
 

285
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,429
over here at each section I do another
four like so and one more there and

286
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:25,439
four like so and one more there and
 

287
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,339
four like so and one more there and
that's basically one section done here

288
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:27,349
that's basically one section done here
 

289
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,619
that's basically one section done here
uh-huh all right so this is what the ice

290
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:30,629
uh-huh all right so this is what the ice
 

291
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,719
uh-huh all right so this is what the ice
farm is looking like currently I would

292
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:32,729
farm is looking like currently I would
 

293
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,119
farm is looking like currently I would
say it's maybe half done if I was to

294
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:35,129
say it's maybe half done if I was to
 

295
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,730
say it's maybe half done if I was to
guess or half the size it's going to be

296
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:37,740
guess or half the size it's going to be
 

297
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,980
guess or half the size it's going to be
when it's fully fully finished here

298
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:39,990
when it's fully fully finished here
 

299
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,050
when it's fully fully finished here
but I always underestimate these things

300
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,060
but I always underestimate these things
 

301
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,270
but I always underestimate these things
so what do I know right you can see like

302
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,280
so what do I know right you can see like
 

303
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,890
so what do I know right you can see like
we originally started with five sections

304
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:45,900
we originally started with five sections
 

305
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,140
we originally started with five sections
why'd I decide to extend it up to seven

306
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,150
why'd I decide to extend it up to seven
 

307
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,540
why'd I decide to extend it up to seven
I think that's as wide as we're gonna

308
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:50,550
I think that's as wide as we're gonna
 

309
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,400
I think that's as wide as we're gonna
make it we're gonna feel like a seven by

310
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,410
make it we're gonna feel like a seven by
 

311
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,830
make it we're gonna feel like a seven by
seven chunked area with the ice firm

312
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:54,840
seven chunked area with the ice firm
 

313
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,750
seven chunked area with the ice firm
here is my plan and then I'm gonna call

314
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:56,760
here is my plan and then I'm gonna call
 

315
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,910
here is my plan and then I'm gonna call
it finished whether or not it works as I

316
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:58,920
it finished whether or not it works as I
 

317
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,510
it finished whether or not it works as I
hope it will the dream is we harvest out

318
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
hope it will the dream is we harvest out
 

319
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,490
hope it will the dream is we harvest out
a section of ice here right we go down

320
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,500
a section of ice here right we go down
 

321
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,710
a section of ice here right we go down
we step on a pressure plate at the end

322
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
we step on a pressure plate at the end
 

323
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,510
we step on a pressure plate at the end
of it which will cause it to refill with

324
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,520
of it which will cause it to refill with
 

325
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,330
of it which will cause it to refill with
water it'll start freezing again and as

326
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,340
water it'll start freezing again and as
 

327
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,950
water it'll start freezing again and as
it's freezing we go on to the next

328
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
it's freezing we go on to the next
 

329
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,290
it's freezing we go on to the next
section we zigzag our way down the farm

330
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,300
section we zigzag our way down the farm
 

331
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,380
section we zigzag our way down the farm
and hopefully by the time we travel

332
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,390
and hopefully by the time we travel
 

333
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,880
and hopefully by the time we travel
through all the sections and end up back

334
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:19,890
through all the sections and end up back
 

335
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,490
through all the sections and end up back
at the first one we want the ice to be

336
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:22,500
at the first one we want the ice to be
 

337
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,350
at the first one we want the ice to be
all frozen it or the water to be all

338
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,360
all frozen it or the water to be all
 

339
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
all frozen it or the water to be all
frozen again I always do that you know I

340
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,370
frozen again I always do that you know I
 

341
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,930
frozen again I always do that you know I
say ice frozen it's a it's a it's a

342
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:29,940
say ice frozen it's a it's a it's a
 

343
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,630
say ice frozen it's a it's a it's a
tricky mistake uh-huh so we want all the

344
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:32,640
tricky mistake uh-huh so we want all the
 

345
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,130
tricky mistake uh-huh so we want all the
water to be frozen so that when we get

346
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,140
water to be frozen so that when we get
 

347
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,750
water to be frozen so that when we get
back to the first section we can just

348
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:35,760
back to the first section we can just
 

349
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,490
back to the first section we can just
start mining again we don't have to wait

350
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:37,500
start mining again we don't have to wait
 

351
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,290
start mining again we don't have to wait
or anything that's why we're making the

352
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,300
or anything that's why we're making the
 

353
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,390
or anything that's why we're making the
farm so big so that has time to freeze

354
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,400
farm so big so that has time to freeze
 

355
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,450
farm so big so that has time to freeze
we're also really trying to make it

356
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,460
we're also really trying to make it
 

357
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,630
we're also really trying to make it
efficient at freezing which is why we're

358
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:47,640
efficient at freezing which is why we're
 

359
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,370
efficient at freezing which is why we're
using the dispensers a lot of you were

360
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,380
using the dispensers a lot of you were
 

361
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,590
using the dispensers a lot of you were
confused why don't just solid fill this

362
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:51,600
confused why don't just solid fill this
 

363
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,930
confused why don't just solid fill this
with water on the side then I don't need

364
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:53,940
with water on the side then I don't need
 

365
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,930
with water on the side then I don't need
to activate this with redstone or

366
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:56,940
to activate this with redstone or
 

367
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,280
to activate this with redstone or
anything it removes a lot of the

368
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,290
anything it removes a lot of the
 

369
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,380
anything it removes a lot of the
confusion a lot of the trouble with

370
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,390
confusion a lot of the trouble with
 

371
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,020
confusion a lot of the trouble with
building the farm if I just put solid

372
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,030
building the farm if I just put solid
 

373
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,700
building the farm if I just put solid
water here the problem with that though

374
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:04,710
water here the problem with that though
 

375
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,880
water here the problem with that though
is it won't have a seed place for the

376
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:07,890
is it won't have a seed place for the
 

377
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,790
is it won't have a seed place for the
ice to start forming as it is right now

378
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
ice to start forming as it is right now
 

379
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,640
ice to start forming as it is right now
if we fill this with water ice can start

380
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:13,650
if we fill this with water ice can start
 

381
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,560
if we fill this with water ice can start
forming next to these dispensers and

382
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:15,570
forming next to these dispensers and
 

383
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,830
forming next to these dispensers and
next to the trapdoors yeah so these are

384
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:18,840
next to the trapdoors yeah so these are
 

385
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,570
next to the trapdoors yeah so these are
all the places where the ice can start

386
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:20,580
all the places where the ice can start
 

387
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,220
all the places where the ice can start
forming originally when we fill this up

388
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,230
forming originally when we fill this up
 

389
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,470
forming originally when we fill this up
with water and then it's got to spread

390
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,480
with water and then it's got to spread
 

391
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,780
with water and then it's got to spread
to like these middle areas here and the

392
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:26,790
to like these middle areas here and the
 

393
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,230
to like these middle areas here and the
space between the dispensers so on

394
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
space between the dispensers so on
 

395
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,390
space between the dispensers so on
average I would say it would take two or

396
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:32,400
average I would say it would take two or
 

397
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,430
average I would say it would take two or
three spreads to totally fill this up of

398
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,440
three spreads to totally fill this up of
 

399
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,040
three spreads to totally fill this up of
ice while if we only have it forming

400
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,050
ice while if we only have it forming
 

401
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,320
ice while if we only have it forming
along the trapdoors on this side it's

402
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,330
along the trapdoors on this side it's
 

403
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,250
along the trapdoors on this side it's
got to travel one two three four and you

404
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,260
got to travel one two three four and you
 

405
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,990
got to travel one two three four and you
compare two to three to four it's

406
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,000
compare two to three to four it's
 

407
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,850
compare two to three to four it's
probably gonna be almost twice as quick

408
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:46,860
probably gonna be almost twice as quick
 

409
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,280
probably gonna be almost twice as quick
using the dispensers here if I was to

410
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,290
using the dispensers here if I was to
 

411
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,040
using the dispensers here if I was to
guess so that is kind of why we're doing

412
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,050
guess so that is kind of why we're doing
 

413
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,730
guess so that is kind of why we're doing
it

414
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:53,740
it
 

415
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,960
it
mmm-hmm okay so we're in a little bit of

416
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:55,970
mmm-hmm okay so we're in a little bit of
 

417
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,420
mmm-hmm okay so we're in a little bit of
a predicament here I don't know if this

418
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:58,430
a predicament here I don't know if this
 

419
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,130
a predicament here I don't know if this
has happened before but I'm having

420
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,140
has happened before but I'm having
 

421
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,840
has happened before but I'm having
trouble finding string I think I've used

422
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:01,850
trouble finding string I think I've used
 

423
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,680
trouble finding string I think I've used
that Buller or stashes I'm sure we have

424
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:05,690
that Buller or stashes I'm sure we have
 

425
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,540
that Buller or stashes I'm sure we have
more we just gotta figure out where it

426
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:07,550
more we just gotta figure out where it
 

427
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,009
more we just gotta figure out where it
is I need it for dispensers I cannot

428
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,019
is I need it for dispensers I cannot
 

429
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,590
is I need it for dispensers I cannot
find the entrance to that cheap spider

430
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,600
find the entrance to that cheap spider
 

431
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,590
find the entrance to that cheap spider
farm we build I think this will take us

432
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
farm we build I think this will take us
 

433
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,540
farm we build I think this will take us
to it though is it over here no wrong

434
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:22,550
to it though is it over here no wrong
 

435
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,060
to it though is it over here no wrong
ravine is it more oh it's over there

436
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,070
ravine is it more oh it's over there
 

437
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,449
ravine is it more oh it's over there
aha you remember this the one that works

438
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:31,459
aha you remember this the one that works
 

439
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,810
aha you remember this the one that works
with thorns it's broken by the way

440
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:33,820
with thorns it's broken by the way
 

441
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,680
with thorns it's broken by the way
because it used a piston translocator we

442
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:38,690
because it used a piston translocator we
 

443
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,460
because it used a piston translocator we
might need to fix it is there any string

444
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,470
might need to fix it is there any string
 

445
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:53,610
might need to fix it is there any string
here though that we can snag oh yes hmm

446
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:53,620

 

447
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,670

okay so I think when we press that it

448
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
okay so I think when we press that it
 

449
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,290
okay so I think when we press that it
would pull us and put us on top of the

450
00:09:59,290 --> 00:09:59,300
would pull us and put us on top of the
 

451
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,759
would pull us and put us on top of the
piston and then when we would do this

452
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:00,769
piston and then when we would do this
 

453
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:05,199
piston and then when we would do this
one it would pull us down and then we

454
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:05,209
one it would pull us down and then we
 

455
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,840
one it would pull us down and then we
get healed with an instant splash potion

456
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:07,850
get healed with an instant splash potion
 

457
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,960
get healed with an instant splash potion

yeah I think we have enough string for

464
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:19,670
yeah I think we have enough string for
 

465
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,460
yeah I think we have enough string for
today but we will need to get this

466
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,470
today but we will need to get this
 

467
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,860
today but we will need to get this
working again soon I think we got like

468
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:23,870
working again soon I think we got like
 

469
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,400
working again soon I think we got like
two double chests left that I can find

470
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,410
two double chests left that I can find
 

471
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,139
two double chests left that I can find
we could probably get rid of the piston

472
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:29,149
we could probably get rid of the piston
 

473
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,480
we could probably get rid of the piston

I ever use a shield let's check this out
 

649
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:25,840
I ever use a shield let's check this out
though okay looks a little bit funny why

650
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:25,850
though okay looks a little bit funny why
 

651
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,090
though okay looks a little bit funny why
I guess the creeper face is a different

652
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,100
I guess the creeper face is a different
 

653
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,869
I guess the creeper face is a different
size huh yeah it's not as wide that's

654
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:34,879
size huh yeah it's not as wide that's
 

655
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:41,829
size huh yeah it's not as wide that's
what's going on I think the trick with

656
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
what's going on I think the trick with
 

657
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
what's going on I think the trick with
this banner is to like chop off the

658
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,610
this banner is to like chop off the
 

659
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,780
this banner is to like chop off the
bottom of it so if we do that looks a

660
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:46,790
bottom of it so if we do that looks a
 

661
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,489
bottom of it so if we do that looks a
lot better right I kind of got a big

662
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:48,499
lot better right I kind of got a big
 

663
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:50,650
lot better right I kind of got a big
forehead but I think it's kind of cool

664
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:50,660
forehead but I think it's kind of cool
 

665
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,359
forehead but I think it's kind of cool
that way what if we chop off all right

666
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:55,369
that way what if we chop off all right
 

667
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:57,970
that way what if we chop off all right
can I not put I can't put it there oh

668
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:57,980
can I not put I can't put it there oh
 

669
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,919
can I not put I can't put it there oh
right because this is a block up here

670
00:14:59,919 --> 00:14:59,929
right because this is a block up here
 

671
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:04,350
right because this is a block up here
but not down there I think it works

672
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:04,360

 

673
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,769

whoa-ohh so back at the ice farm here is
doing more work placing down those

786
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:02,380
doing more work placing down those
 

787
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,770
doing more work placing down those
pistons getting those dispensers down

788
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:04,780
pistons getting those dispensers down
 

789
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,620
pistons getting those dispensers down
rights and then found out the design is

790
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:10,630
rights and then found out the design is
 

791
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,230
rights and then found out the design is
actually flawed it has a little mistake

792
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,240
actually flawed it has a little mistake
 

793
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,910
actually flawed it has a little mistake
in it so the way we were doing it let's

794
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:17,920
in it so the way we were doing it let's
 

795
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,510
in it so the way we were doing it let's
sleep real quick here it's nighttime I'm

796
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
sleep real quick here it's nighttime I'm
 

797
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,330
sleep real quick here it's nighttime I'm
telling you it's nighttime there we go

798
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:23,340
telling you it's nighttime there we go
 

799
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,030
telling you it's nighttime there we go
so we send two pulses to the Pistons and

800
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,040
so we send two pulses to the Pistons and
 

801
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,610
so we send two pulses to the Pistons and
dispensers here using like a wire over

802
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:29,620
dispensers here using like a wire over
 

803
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,640
dispensers here using like a wire over
here so this will power both the piston

804
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:32,650
here so this will power both the piston
 

805
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,760
here so this will power both the piston
and the dispenser below we send that two

806
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:35,770
and the dispenser below we send that two
 

807
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,830
and the dispenser below we send that two
pulses so the dispenser will place down

808
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
pulses so the dispenser will place down
 

809
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,480
pulses so the dispenser will place down
water and then pick up the water the

810
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,490
water and then pick up the water the
 

811
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,580
water and then pick up the water the
Pistons will extend or tract extend

812
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:41,590
Pistons will extend or tract extend
 

813
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,740
Pistons will extend or tract extend
retract happens very quickly but

814
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:43,750
retract happens very quickly but
 

815
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,370
retract happens very quickly but
apparently in between the two pulses

816
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:47,380
apparently in between the two pulses
 

817
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,920
apparently in between the two pulses
there's like one or two game ticks I

818
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:49,930
there's like one or two game ticks I
 

819
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,670
there's like one or two game ticks I
think we're the ice can form and if ice

820
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:53,680
think we're the ice can form and if ice
 

821
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,650
think we're the ice can form and if ice
forms during that when the dispenser

822
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:55,660
forms during that when the dispenser
 

823
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,720
forms during that when the dispenser
goes pick up the water there's gonna be

824
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:57,730
goes pick up the water there's gonna be
 

825
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,810
goes pick up the water there's gonna be
ice there and it it doesn't get it and

826
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:00,820
ice there and it it doesn't get it and
 

827
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,830
ice there and it it doesn't get it and
messes up the farm so it it can happen

828
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:04,840
messes up the farm so it it can happen
 

829
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,290
messes up the farm so it it can happen
it's extremely rare but if it can happen

830
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,300
it's extremely rare but if it can happen
 

831
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,090
it's extremely rare but if it can happen
it's going to happen so we kind of got

832
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,100
it's going to happen so we kind of got
 

833
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,760
it's going to happen so we kind of got
to fix it I thought I could do something

834
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:11,770
to fix it I thought I could do something
 

835
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,940
to fix it I thought I could do something
like this where we have two lines and

836
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:14,950
like this where we have two lines and
 

837
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,460
like this where we have two lines and
power the dispensers with this bottom

838
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:17,470
power the dispensers with this bottom
 

839
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,290
power the dispensers with this bottom
line and power the Pistons with this top

840
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,300
line and power the Pistons with this top
 

841
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,680
line and power the Pistons with this top
line make sure that they're extended all

842
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:22,690
line make sure that they're extended all
 

843
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,180
line make sure that they're extended all
the time while we're placing the

844
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,190
the time while we're placing the
 

845
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,420
the time while we're placing the
I'm picking it up but it turns out this

846
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,430
I'm picking it up but it turns out this
 

847
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,010
I'm picking it up but it turns out this
line up here can actually power the

848
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,020
line up here can actually power the
 

849
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,160
line up here can actually power the
dispensers down there I didn't think it

850
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,170
dispensers down there I didn't think it
 

851
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,170
dispensers down there I didn't think it
would be able to but it can also has an

852
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:35,180
would be able to but it can also has an
 

853
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,140
would be able to but it can also has an
issue with bud powering the Pistons so I

854
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,150
issue with bud powering the Pistons so I
 

855
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,320
issue with bud powering the Pistons so I
would have to like put slabs between

856
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,330
would have to like put slabs between
 

857
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,730
would have to like put slabs between
each of these and then there's this a

858
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:45,740
each of these and then there's this a
 

859
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,020
each of these and then there's this a
whole bunch of other issues so this

860
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,030
whole bunch of other issues so this
 

861
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,060
whole bunch of other issues so this
isn't really gonna work either here's

862
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,070
isn't really gonna work either here's
 

863
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,290
isn't really gonna work either here's
what I came up with though that I think

864
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:50,300
what I came up with though that I think
 

865
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,080
what I came up with though that I think
is going to work we're gonna have to get

866
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,090
is going to work we're gonna have to get
 

867
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,550
is going to work we're gonna have to get
rid of all the Pistons get rid of all

868
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:57,560
rid of all the Pistons get rid of all
 

869
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,670
rid of all the Pistons get rid of all
the Pistons and just move them back one

870
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:00,680
the Pistons and just move them back one
 

871
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,210
the Pistons and just move them back one
use sticky pistons instead and then we

872
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:04,220
use sticky pistons instead and then we
 

873
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,370
use sticky pistons instead and then we
power the dispensers over here this

874
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:09,380
power the dispensers over here this
 

875
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,520
power the dispensers over here this
block here

876
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:11,530
block here
 

877
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,650
block here
no this block up here what am i talking

878
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:14,660
no this block up here what am i talking
 

879
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,540
no this block up here what am i talking
about this one right here well bud power

880
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:16,550
about this one right here well bud power
 

881
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,880
about this one right here well bud power
them diagonally all right it works it's

882
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:18,890
them diagonally all right it works it's
 

883
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:24,310
them diagonally all right it works it's
all good I tried it and then pistons get

884
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
all good I tried it and then pistons get
 

885
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,540
all good I tried it and then pistons get
powered in the back here and basically

886
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:27,550
powered in the back here and basically
 

887
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,400
powered in the back here and basically
we send it to pulses the first pulse

888
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,410
we send it to pulses the first pulse
 

889
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,290
we send it to pulses the first pulse
though is only gonna be one tick so

890
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:32,300
though is only gonna be one tick so
 

891
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,820
though is only gonna be one tick so
sticky pistons will leave the block

892
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:33,830
sticky pistons will leave the block
 

893
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,100
sticky pistons will leave the block
behind if it's only one tick and then on

894
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,110
behind if it's only one tick and then on
 

895
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,130
behind if it's only one tick and then on
the second pulse it'll extend and then

896
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,140
the second pulse it'll extend and then
 

897
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,060
the second pulse it'll extend and then
pull it back so that guarantees it's

898
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,070
pull it back so that guarantees it's
 

899
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,590
pull it back so that guarantees it's
gonna be covered over here when it's

900
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:44,600
gonna be covered over here when it's
 

901
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,290
gonna be covered over here when it's
placing and picking up the water so that

902
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:47,300
placing and picking up the water so that
 

903
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,860
placing and picking up the water so that
is the plan and it's pretty much about

904
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:50,870
is the plan and it's pretty much about
 

905
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,860
is the plan and it's pretty much about
the same level of complexity I would say

906
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:53,870
the same level of complexity I would say
 

907
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,420
the same level of complexity I would say
maybe a little bit more complex than

908
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,430
maybe a little bit more complex than
 

909
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,280
maybe a little bit more complex than
that over there so I think it's gonna

910
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,290
that over there so I think it's gonna
 

911
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,860
that over there so I think it's gonna
work out okay but I got to change these

912
00:20:59,860 --> 00:20:59,870
work out okay but I got to change these
 

913
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,730
work out okay but I got to change these
all so that's gonna be a bit of a thing

914
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:03,740
all so that's gonna be a bit of a thing
 

915
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,280
all so that's gonna be a bit of a thing
this is how we we do it too by the way

916
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,290
this is how we we do it too by the way
 

917
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,560
this is how we we do it too by the way
put a block here oh I got a like a

918
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:11,570
put a block here oh I got a like a
 

919
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:19,180
put a block here oh I got a like a
spider on me oh man ah okay everything's

920
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,190
spider on me oh man ah okay everything's
 

921
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,200
spider on me oh man ah okay everything's
fine I'm still alive oh snap you guys

922
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,210
fine I'm still alive oh snap you guys
 

923
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,520
fine I'm still alive oh snap you guys
might not like this but you know what

924
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:24,530
might not like this but you know what
 

925
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,770
might not like this but you know what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna wrap up the

926
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:26,780
I'm gonna do I'm gonna wrap up the
 

927
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm gonna do I'm gonna wrap up the
episode here for today it's gonna be a

928
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,280
episode here for today it's gonna be a
 

929
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,040
episode here for today it's gonna be a
bit of a shorter one but it is the

930
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,050
bit of a shorter one but it is the
 

931
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,500
bit of a shorter one but it is the
second one of the week so maybe you guys

932
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:32,510
second one of the week so maybe you guys
 

933
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,800
second one of the week so maybe you guys
won't mind as much hopefully we'll see

934
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:34,810
won't mind as much hopefully we'll see
 

935
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,000
won't mind as much hopefully we'll see
but yeah this is actually the third day

936
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,010
but yeah this is actually the third day
 

937
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,980
but yeah this is actually the third day
I've been recording this episode

938
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:38,990
I've been recording this episode
 

939
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,620
I've been recording this episode
lots and lots of off camera building as

940
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,630
lots and lots of off camera building as
 

941
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,710
lots and lots of off camera building as
