00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,150
to another episode of the let's play
series

11
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,990
series
so lately we've been working really hard

12
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
so lately we've been working really hard
 

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,990
so lately we've been working really hard
on the world we've been tackling some

14
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
on the world we've been tackling some
 

15
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,349
on the world we've been tackling some
massive projects

16
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
massive projects
 

17
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,590
massive projects
and uh for today i thought we would slow

18
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
and uh for today i thought we would slow
 

19
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,790
and uh for today i thought we would slow
things down a bit

20
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
things down a bit
 

21
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,029
things down a bit
again i think we've got most of the

22
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
again i think we've got most of the
 

23
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,790
again i think we've got most of the
things i wanted to do off my list

24
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
things i wanted to do off my list
 

25
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,790
things i wanted to do off my list
actually except maybe the bee farm

26
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
actually except maybe the bee farm
 

27
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,070
actually except maybe the bee farm
would like to get that done before the

28
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
would like to get that done before the
 

29
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,950
would like to get that done before the
world tour but now i just want to get

30
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
world tour but now i just want to get
 

31
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,990
world tour but now i just want to get
uh oh we got two guys i didn't want two

32
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
uh oh we got two guys i didn't want two
 

33
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,350
uh oh we got two guys i didn't want two
guys

34
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
guys
 

35
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,549
guys
hey hey you over here you see me

36
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
hey hey you over here you see me
 

37
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,670
hey hey you over here you see me
yeah free free stuff here okay we got

38
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
yeah free free stuff here okay we got
 

39
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,790
yeah free free stuff here okay we got
him

40
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
him
 

41
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,869
him
hit the button and he goes down hit the

42
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
hit the button and he goes down hit the
 

43
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,990
hit the button and he goes down hit the
button they go down

44
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
button they go down
 

45
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,750
button they go down
but yeah i think our goal for today is

46
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
but yeah i think our goal for today is
 

47
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,670
but yeah i think our goal for today is
going to be to finish up some projects

48
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
going to be to finish up some projects
 

49
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,990
going to be to finish up some projects
instead of starting new ones

50
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
instead of starting new ones
 

51
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,709
instead of starting new ones
and one of those is the piglet bartering

52
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
and one of those is the piglet bartering
 

53
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,470
and one of those is the piglet bartering
we should at least get this functional

54
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480

 

55
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,830

he goes down so yeah our plan here is to

56
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
he goes down so yeah our plan here is to
 

57
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,509
he goes down so yeah our plan here is to
have four piglet chambers

58
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
have four piglet chambers
 

59
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,149
have four piglet chambers
each one with three piglens inside for a

60
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
each one with three piglens inside for a
 

61
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,190
each one with three piglens inside for a
total of twelve

62
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
total of twelve
 

63
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,750
total of twelve
we got them named so they don't despawn

64
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
we got them named so they don't despawn
 

65
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,510
we got them named so they don't despawn
and after some testing today it seemed

66
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
and after some testing today it seemed
 

67
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,070
and after some testing today it seemed
about

68
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
about
 

69
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,670
about
it seemed like a hopper could handle the

70
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
it seemed like a hopper could handle the
 

71
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,789
it seemed like a hopper could handle the
items from about 2.8 or 2.9 piglens

72
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
items from about 2.8 or 2.9 piglens
 

73
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,350
items from about 2.8 or 2.9 piglens
but we can't divide a piglen into

74
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
but we can't divide a piglen into
 

75
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,789
but we can't divide a piglen into
decimals if we do they're

76
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
decimals if we do they're
 

77
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,070
decimals if we do they're
they're dead so we're gonna go up

78
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
they're dead so we're gonna go up
 

79
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,789
they're dead so we're gonna go up
round up to three and that way our

80
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
round up to three and that way our
 

81
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,789
round up to three and that way our
hopper is gonna be backed up with items

82
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
hopper is gonna be backed up with items
 

83
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,350
hopper is gonna be backed up with items
um and we can control how many items we

84
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
um and we can control how many items we
 

85
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,830
um and we can control how many items we
get by the rate we give these guys gold

86
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
get by the rate we give these guys gold
 

87
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,590
get by the rate we give these guys gold
i think it was about three episodes ago

88
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
i think it was about three episodes ago
 

89
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,950
i think it was about three episodes ago
i've been dragging my feet a little bit

90
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
i've been dragging my feet a little bit
 

91
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,350
i've been dragging my feet a little bit
with this project but we set up a dual

92
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
with this project but we set up a dual
 

93
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,429
with this project but we set up a dual
dropper chain to deliver the items to

94
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
dropper chain to deliver the items to
 

95
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,670
dropper chain to deliver the items to
the item filters below

96
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
the item filters below
 

97
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,830
the item filters below
for all the bartering items this

98
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
for all the bartering items this
 

99
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,230
for all the bartering items this
operates at four times hopper speed

100
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
operates at four times hopper speed
 

101
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,069
operates at four times hopper speed
which is why we're setting up four

102
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
which is why we're setting up four
 

103
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,230
which is why we're setting up four
different uh piglen chambers

104
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
different uh piglen chambers
 

105
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,550
different uh piglen chambers
each one with its own hopper then we

106
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
each one with its own hopper then we
 

107
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,069
each one with its own hopper then we
combine those together

108
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
combine those together
 

109
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,429
combine those together
so these two hoppers merge into a single

110
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
so these two hoppers merge into a single
 

111
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,190
so these two hoppers merge into a single
dropper which operates at two times

112
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
dropper which operates at two times
 

113
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,630
dropper which operates at two times
hopper speed

114
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
hopper speed
 

115
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,389
hopper speed
and then there's another dropper and the

116
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
and then there's another dropper and the
 

117
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,550
and then there's another dropper and the
other side merges into this one

118
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
other side merges into this one
 

119
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,350
other side merges into this one
and then at the end here we just have a

120
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
and then at the end here we just have a
 

121
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,110
and then at the end here we just have a
observer clock which will send items

122
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
observer clock which will send items
 

123
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,589
observer clock which will send items
down the chain here to the item filters

124
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
down the chain here to the item filters
 

125
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,190
down the chain here to the item filters
okay so now that we got them all loaded

126
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
okay so now that we got them all loaded
 

127
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,790
okay so now that we got them all loaded
in we're going to add some droppers

128
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
in we're going to add some droppers
 

129
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,390
in we're going to add some droppers
above them to shoot gold

130
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
above them to shoot gold
 

131
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,550
above them to shoot gold
ingots at them and good stuff so we got

132
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
ingots at them and good stuff so we got
 

133
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,790
ingots at them and good stuff so we got
four droppers to deliver them gold

134
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
four droppers to deliver them gold
 

135
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,390
four droppers to deliver them gold
now let's say we were to give these guys

136
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
now let's say we were to give these guys
 

137
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,710
now let's say we were to give these guys
16 gold we would want to split that

138
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
16 gold we would want to split that
 

139
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,309
16 gold we would want to split that
between the four droppers so

140
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
between the four droppers so
 

141
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,630
between the four droppers so
each one would get four we got to make

142
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
each one would get four we got to make
 

143
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,830
each one would get four we got to make
some kind of splitting system now

144
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
some kind of splitting system now
 

145
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,390
some kind of splitting system now
so easy way to do that is with a hopper

146
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
so easy way to do that is with a hopper
 

147
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,190
so easy way to do that is with a hopper
minecart

148
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
minecart
 

149
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,830
minecart
uh we're gonna merge our hoppers

150
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
uh we're gonna merge our hoppers
 

151
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,589
uh we're gonna merge our hoppers
together in the center

152
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
together in the center
 

153
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,550
together in the center
these two these four here and then try

154
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
these two these four here and then try
 

155
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,309
these two these four here and then try
set up a hopper minecart

156
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
set up a hopper minecart
 

157
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,790
set up a hopper minecart
somewhere in between the four so

158
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
somewhere in between the four so
 

159
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,790
somewhere in between the four so
usually the way i like to do this is to

160
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
usually the way i like to do this is to
 

161
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,070
usually the way i like to do this is to
use end rods to

162
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
use end rods to
 

163
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,630
use end rods to
center the minecart a little bit better

164
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
center the minecart a little bit better
 

165
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,390
center the minecart a little bit better
um

166
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
um
 

167
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,910
um
this can go here then we break the rail

168
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
this can go here then we break the rail
 

169
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,589
this can go here then we break the rail
and we kind of bump it to the middle and

170
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
and we kind of bump it to the middle and
 

171
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,190
and we kind of bump it to the middle and
we could leave it like that but we could

172
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
we could leave it like that but we could
 

173
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,229
we could leave it like that but we could
also try to like

174
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
also try to like
 

175
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,670
also try to like
lock it into place with some other

176
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
lock it into place with some other
 

177
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,830
lock it into place with some other
blocks um

178
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
blocks um
 

179
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,149
blocks um
one way of doing that is with the trap

180
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
one way of doing that is with the trap
 

181
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,390
one way of doing that is with the trap
door here maybe

182
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
door here maybe
 

183
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,470
door here maybe
can't place one here now uh-huh

184
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
can't place one here now uh-huh
 

185
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,430
can't place one here now uh-huh
uh i guess we'll just do like this you

186
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
uh i guess we'll just do like this you
 

187
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,630
uh i guess we'll just do like this you
might need to change that with something

188
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
might need to change that with something
 

189
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,229
might need to change that with something
else but yeah you got the idea

190
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
else but yeah you got the idea
 

191
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,390
else but yeah you got the idea
and then if we put a chest above this

192
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
and then if we put a chest above this
 

193
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,390
and then if we put a chest above this
the hopper will pull it out of the chest

194
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
the hopper will pull it out of the chest
 

195
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,990
the hopper will pull it out of the chest
and should split it evenly

196
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000

 

197
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,830

four in each of these right yeah and it

198
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
four in each of these right yeah and it
 

199
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,830
four in each of these right yeah and it
does it pretty quickly as well

200
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
does it pretty quickly as well
 

201
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,030
does it pretty quickly as well
one that one and four on that one ah

202
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
one that one and four on that one ah
 

203
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,190
one that one and four on that one ah
that should be good that should be great

204
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
that should be good that should be great
 

205
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,869
that should be good that should be great
let's add a switch here to

206
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
let's add a switch here to
 

207
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,910
let's add a switch here to
the observer clocks maybe this will come

208
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
the observer clocks maybe this will come
 

209
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,910
the observer clocks maybe this will come
up like this and then if there's gold in

210
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
up like this and then if there's gold in
 

211
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,589
up like this and then if there's gold in
the droppers

212
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
the droppers
 

213
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,149
the droppers
we'll detect that with the comparator

214
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
we'll detect that with the comparator
 

215
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,110
we'll detect that with the comparator
and then cygnus

216
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
and then cygnus
 

217
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,869
and then cygnus
send the signal to the observer clock so

218
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
send the signal to the observer clock so
 

219
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,869
send the signal to the observer clock so
it'll start sending the items down

220
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
it'll start sending the items down
 

221
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,390
it'll start sending the items down
as long as the trading's happening then

222
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
as long as the trading's happening then
 

223
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,149
as long as the trading's happening then
when it's finished it'll stop

224
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
when it's finished it'll stop
 

225
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,070
when it's finished it'll stop
it's gonna need a bit of fine tuning i'm

226
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
it's gonna need a bit of fine tuning i'm
 

227
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,670
it's gonna need a bit of fine tuning i'm
sure but we gotta pretty close to done

228
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
sure but we gotta pretty close to done
 

229
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,149
sure but we gotta pretty close to done
actually

230
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
actually
 

231
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,190
actually
so if there's gold in this dropper we

232
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
so if there's gold in this dropper we
 

233
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,030
so if there's gold in this dropper we
added another branch off here

234
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
added another branch off here
 

235
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,990
added another branch off here
to activate a hopper clock this will run

236
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
to activate a hopper clock this will run
 

237
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,710
to activate a hopper clock this will run
right now i just have three items in it

238
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
right now i just have three items in it
 

239
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,949
right now i just have three items in it
and every time it triggers it's gonna

240
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
and every time it triggers it's gonna
 

241
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,469
and every time it triggers it's gonna
it's gonna trigger the four droppers

242
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
it's gonna trigger the four droppers
 

243
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,030
it's gonna trigger the four droppers
this redstone wraps around here

244
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
this redstone wraps around here
 

245
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,430
this redstone wraps around here
to all four of them and deliver gold so

246
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
to all four of them and deliver gold so
 

247
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,070
to all four of them and deliver gold so
as long as there's gold in the system

248
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
as long as there's gold in the system
 

249
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,310
as long as there's gold in the system
um gold gets delivered to the guys and

250
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
um gold gets delivered to the guys and
 

251
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,469
um gold gets delivered to the guys and
also the observer clock runs

252
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
also the observer clock runs
 

253
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,749
also the observer clock runs
so let's give this a try

254
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759

 

255
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,670

they should be getting gold i don't know

256
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
they should be getting gold i don't know
 

257
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,350
they should be getting gold i don't know
if they're getting it too quickly if we

258
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
if they're getting it too quickly if we
 

259
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,030
if they're getting it too quickly if we
see gold at the end of the chain here

260
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
see gold at the end of the chain here
 

261
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,310
see gold at the end of the chain here
that means they're getting the gold too

262
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
that means they're getting the gold too
 

263
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,749
that means they're getting the gold too
quickly and we'll have to add more items

264
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
quickly and we'll have to add more items
 

265
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,510
quickly and we'll have to add more items
into the hopper clock

266
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
into the hopper clock
 

267
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,030
into the hopper clock
oh there is gold at the end okay so

268
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
oh there is gold at the end okay so
 

269
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,390
oh there is gold at the end okay so
we're giving it to them quick too

270
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
we're giving it to them quick too
 

271
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,189
we're giving it to them quick too
quickly then

272
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
quickly then
 

273
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,550
quickly then
i'm just going to add another item in

274
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
i'm just going to add another item in
 

275
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,550
i'm just going to add another item in
here and see if it happens again

276
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
here and see if it happens again
 

277
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,830
here and see if it happens again
something we should keep an eye on here

278
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
something we should keep an eye on here
 

279
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,350
something we should keep an eye on here
it's probably not a big deal but a few

280
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
it's probably not a big deal but a few
 

281
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,029
it's probably not a big deal but a few
items are getting left in the dropper

282
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
items are getting left in the dropper
 

283
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,870
items are getting left in the dropper
after it shuts down

284
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
after it shuts down
 

285
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,310
after it shuts down
because each of the guys will have a

286
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
because each of the guys will have a
 

287
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,830
because each of the guys will have a
piece of gold in their hand once this

288
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
piece of gold in their hand once this
 

289
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,590
piece of gold in their hand once this
runs out of gold in here

290
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
runs out of gold in here
 

291
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,749
runs out of gold in here
so it should get cleared once we start

292
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
so it should get cleared once we start
 

293
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,510
so it should get cleared once we start
it up again though

294
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
it up again though
 

295
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,270
it up again though
all right let's oh that's not what we

296
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
all right let's oh that's not what we
 

297
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,870
all right let's oh that's not what we
want to do

298
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
want to do
 

299
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,550
want to do
it goes in here you gotta split it

300
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
it goes in here you gotta split it
 

301
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,070
it goes in here you gotta split it
yeah so this stuff should get cleared

302
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
yeah so this stuff should get cleared
 

303
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,990
yeah so this stuff should get cleared
out and you see new stuff

304
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
out and you see new stuff
 

305
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,310
out and you see new stuff
is entering now i hate to say it but

306
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
is entering now i hate to say it but
 

307
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,830
is entering now i hate to say it but
we're actually low on gold at the moment

308
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
we're actually low on gold at the moment
 

309
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,590
we're actually low on gold at the moment
we used it all uh building the gold

310
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
we used it all uh building the gold
 

311
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,029
we used it all uh building the gold
beacon last episode

312
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
beacon last episode
 

313
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,870
beacon last episode
and we don't really have a high

314
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
and we don't really have a high
 

315
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,710
and we don't really have a high
efficiency gold farm

316
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
efficiency gold farm
 

317
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,830
efficiency gold farm
like the goon farm is mostly for iron

318
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
like the goon farm is mostly for iron
 

319
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,909
like the goon farm is mostly for iron
and the one

320
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
and the one
 

321
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,270
and the one
at our nether spawn is just like an xp

322
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
at our nether spawn is just like an xp
 

323
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,670
at our nether spawn is just like an xp
farm and we get a little bit of gold

324
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
farm and we get a little bit of gold
 

325
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,430
farm and we get a little bit of gold
from both of those but uh

326
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
from both of those but uh
 

327
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,990
from both of those but uh
yeah it's not quite enough okay it looks

328
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
yeah it's not quite enough okay it looks
 

329
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,189
yeah it's not quite enough okay it looks
like there's no gold at the end this

330
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
like there's no gold at the end this
 

331

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,790
that and it's kind of annoying
so let's get a couple extra here maybe

660
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
so let's get a couple extra here maybe
 

661
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,350
so let's get a couple extra here maybe
let's just do a dropper down here

662
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
let's just do a dropper down here
 

663
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,030
let's just do a dropper down here
with the boats in then we will have our

664
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
with the boats in then we will have our
 

665
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,150
with the boats in then we will have our
hopper

666
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
hopper
 

667
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,310
hopper
we'll do a barrel let's name these as

668
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
we'll do a barrel let's name these as
 

669
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,750
we'll do a barrel let's name these as
well i got my handle ready

670
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
well i got my handle ready
 

671
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,829
well i got my handle ready
so you can name barrels and any other

672
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
so you can name barrels and any other
 

673
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,750
so you can name barrels and any other
inventory in the game you want

674
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
inventory in the game you want
 

675
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,710
inventory in the game you want
to say what's what goes inside i like

676
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
to say what's what goes inside i like
 

677
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,949
to say what's what goes inside i like
doing that a lot now actually

678
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
doing that a lot now actually
 

679
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,590
doing that a lot now actually
so now it says boats up here and then

680
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600

 

681
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,269

i guess we'll put the stone back here

682
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
i guess we'll put the stone back here
 

683
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,190
i guess we'll put the stone back here
let's put a piece of redstone here too

684
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
let's put a piece of redstone here too
 

685
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,350
let's put a piece of redstone here too
and sandstone we'll turn these into

686
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
and sandstone we'll turn these into
 

687
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,790
and sandstone we'll turn these into
buttons

688
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
buttons
 

689
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,030
buttons
like that and now when we click that it

690
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
like that and now when we click that it
 

691
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,949
like that and now when we click that it
should give us a boat

692
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
should give us a boat
 

693
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,990
should give us a boat
now there's no way of actually

694
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
now there's no way of actually
 

695
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,829
now there's no way of actually
dispensing the boat like in boat form

696
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
dispensing the boat like in boat form
 

697
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,430
dispensing the boat like in boat form
unfortunately you need water to do that

698
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
unfortunately you need water to do that
 

699
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,350
unfortunately you need water to do that
so we can't do that in the nether

700
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
so we can't do that in the nether
 

701
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,190
so we can't do that in the nether
one of our goals with our nether hub is

702
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
one of our goals with our nether hub is
 

703
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,949
one of our goals with our nether hub is
to try and make it easier to navigate

704
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
to try and make it easier to navigate
 

705
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,550
to try and make it easier to navigate
especially with the world tour coming up

706
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
especially with the world tour coming up
 

707
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,550
especially with the world tour coming up
i want you guys to be able to find stuff

708
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
i want you guys to be able to find stuff
 

709
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,230
i want you guys to be able to find stuff
so one thing we did was we set up the

710
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
so one thing we did was we set up the
 

711
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,389
so one thing we did was we set up the
lecterns now i'm wondering

712
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
lecterns now i'm wondering
 

713
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,750
lecterns now i'm wondering
we're gonna do a bit of experimenting

714
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
we're gonna do a bit of experimenting
 

715
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,670
we're gonna do a bit of experimenting
here we're gonna try out maps in the

716
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
here we're gonna try out maps in the
 

717
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,470
here we're gonna try out maps in the
nether

718
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
nether
 

719
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,550
nether
now i know you can't actually see

720
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
now i know you can't actually see
 

721
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,069
now i know you can't actually see
anything on another map

722
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
anything on another map
 

723
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,110
anything on another map
so let's just reconfirm that

724
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
so let's just reconfirm that
 

725
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,949
so let's just reconfirm that
if we make a map this is all we see even

726
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
if we make a map this is all we see even
 

727
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,710
if we make a map this is all we see even
though there's stuff built above us

728
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
though there's stuff built above us
 

729
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,269
though there's stuff built above us
right now it won't display it

730
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
right now it won't display it
 

731
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,590
right now it won't display it
all we can really see is our position on

732
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
all we can really see is our position on
 

733
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,470
all we can really see is our position on
the map

734
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
the map
 

735
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,870
the map
and as we move around we we do move

736
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
and as we move around we we do move
 

737
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,949
and as we move around we we do move
around on the map as well

738
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
around on the map as well
 

739
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,350
around on the map as well
but we won't be able to look at anything

740
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
but we won't be able to look at anything
 

741
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,110
but we won't be able to look at anything
but there is also the feature in the

742
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
but there is also the feature in the
 

743
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,470
but there is also the feature in the
game where you can make

744
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
game where you can make
 

745
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,230
game where you can make
markers and i'm wondering if that will

746
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
markers and i'm wondering if that will
 

747
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,750
markers and i'm wondering if that will
work on the nether map and if it could

748
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
work on the nether map and if it could
 

749
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,750
work on the nether map and if it could
be useful at all

750
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
be useful at all
 

751
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,470
be useful at all
so let's try nameless test one

752
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
so let's try nameless test one
 

753
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,790
so let's try nameless test one
i don't remember if the name shows up on

754
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
i don't remember if the name shows up on
 

755
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,829
i don't remember if the name shows up on
the map or if it's just the color

756
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
the map or if it's just the color
 

757
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,389
the map or if it's just the color
so then if we right click that oh it

758
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
so then if we right click that oh it
 

759
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,509
so then if we right click that oh it
does it does the

760
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
does it does the
 

761
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,230
does it does the
give the text actually okay that's great

762
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
give the text actually okay that's great
 

763
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,069
give the text actually okay that's great
so if we put a banner at each of our

764
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
so if we put a banner at each of our
 

765
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,269
so if we put a banner at each of our
nether portals

766
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
nether portals
 

767
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,910
nether portals
we can say what is there and then look

768
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
we can say what is there and then look
 

769
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,389
we can say what is there and then look
at it

770
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
at it
 

771
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,509
at it
from a map hopefully test two

772
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519

 

773
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,910

and get that over here and then click

774
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
and get that over here and then click
 

775
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,590
and get that over here and then click
that and yeah we got test stone we got

776
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
that and yeah we got test stone we got
 

777
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,790
that and yeah we got test stone we got
test two so

778
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
test two so
 

779
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,710
test two so
i guess another question is how far

780
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
i guess another question is how far
 

781
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,710
i guess another question is how far
would we want to zoom out probably

782
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
would we want to zoom out probably
 

783
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,870
would we want to zoom out probably
all the way or maybe second from the

784
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
all the way or maybe second from the
 

785
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,230
all the way or maybe second from the
last one

786
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
last one
 

787
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,389
last one
so get our paper like that

788
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
so get our paper like that
 

789
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,550
so get our paper like that
well i guess let's look at it first so

790
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
well i guess let's look at it first so
 

791
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,230
well i guess let's look at it first so
at this distance oh it does reset all

792
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
at this distance oh it does reset all
 

793
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,670
at this distance oh it does reset all
the markers if we do that too

794
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
the markers if we do that too
 

795
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,590
the markers if we do that too
i think yeah they're gone

796
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600

 

797
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,430

okay so before we go mark all our

798
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
okay so before we go mark all our
 

799
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,949
okay so before we go mark all our
portals with the banners we're also

800
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
portals with the banners we're also
 

801
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,470
portals with the banners we're also
going to farm up some netherrick because

802
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
going to farm up some netherrick because
 

803
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,949
going to farm up some netherrick because
i

804
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
i
 

805
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,829
i
think ooh that was a spooky sound i

806
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
think ooh that was a spooky sound i
 

807
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,870
think ooh that was a spooky sound i
think we're going to want to set up

808
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
think we're going to want to set up
 

809
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,790
think we're going to want to set up
loadstones for them as well

810
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
loadstones for them as well
 

811
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,189
loadstones for them as well
let's light this and then run as far as

812
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
let's light this and then run as far as
 

813
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,629
let's light this and then run as far as
we can away

814
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
we can away
 

815
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,350
we can away
i like to get close for the video you

816
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
i like to get close for the video you
 

817
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,150
i like to get close for the video you
know but it

818
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
know but it
 

819
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,090
know but it
usually kills me

820
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,100
usually kills me
 

821
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,550
usually kills me

18 18. all right and then we take
 

865
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,030

that's our first lodestones in the world
look at these things so then you can

876
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
look at these things so then you can
 

877
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,509
look at these things so then you can
take compasses and

878
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
take compasses and
 

879
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,670
take compasses and
mark the location and then it points

880
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
mark the location and then it points
 

881
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,629
mark the location and then it points
towards that

882
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639

883
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,030

lodestone okay so let's get to marking

884
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
lodestone okay so let's get to marking
 

885
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,110
lodestone okay so let's get to marking
things here so what i did is i went to

886
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
things here so what i did is i went to
 

887
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,790
things here so what i did is i went to
the four different quadrants of our

888
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
the four different quadrants of our
 

889
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,670
the four different quadrants of our
worlds

890
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
worlds
 

891
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,509
worlds
um and made four different nether maps

892
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
um and made four different nether maps
 

893
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,670
um and made four different nether maps
here all max zoomed out

894
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
here all max zoomed out
 

895
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,509
here all max zoomed out
uh each of these maps is i think about

896
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
uh each of these maps is i think about
 

897
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,990
uh each of these maps is i think about
2000 by 2000 area covers

898
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
2000 by 2000 area covers
 

899
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,230
2000 by 2000 area covers
so you can see us in the top left there

900
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
so you can see us in the top left there
 

901
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,910
so you can see us in the top left there
i named each one as well so this is

902
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
i named each one as well so this is
 

903
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,590
i named each one as well so this is
another plus plus this is

904
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
another plus plus this is
 

905
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,550
another plus plus this is
plus minus minus plus and then minus

906
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
plus minus minus plus and then minus
 

907
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,550
plus minus minus plus and then minus
minus so that's the coordinates

908
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
minus so that's the coordinates
 

909
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,069
minus so that's the coordinates
uh plus plus is positive x positive z

910
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
uh plus plus is positive x positive z
 

911
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,030
uh plus plus is positive x positive z
plus minus is positive x my negative z

912
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
plus minus is positive x my negative z
 

913
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,710
plus minus is positive x my negative z
and you kind of get the idea that way

914
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
and you kind of get the idea that way
 

915
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,350
and you kind of get the idea that way
so now we got a little kit put together

916
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
so now we got a little kit put together
 

917
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,069
so now we got a little kit put together
here

918
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
here
 

919
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,470
here
for each portal like our nether hub

920
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
for each portal like our nether hub
 

921
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,269
for each portal like our nether hub
portal here

we're going to mark it with a lodestone
 

925
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,910
we're going to mark it with a lodestone
gotta get a compass and we got to get a

935
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,670
we'll use a purple one for this we uh
have to name the banner

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
have to name the banner
 

937
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,509
have to name the banner
if we want the text to show up so this

all right and then we gotta take the
 

957
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,990
all right and then we gotta take the
proper map for

958
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
proper map for
 

959
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,509
proper map for
where we are we got to see our player

960
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
where we are we got to see our player
 

961
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,069
where we are we got to see our player
there uh where it has the triangle on

962
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
there uh where it has the triangle on
 

963
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,030
there uh where it has the triangle on
the player

the player
 

965
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,710
the player
then we right click that and we got it

966
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
then we right click that and we got it
 

967
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,710

okay cool then we also gotta hide a
 

971
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,749
okay cool then we also gotta hide a
lodestone somewhere i guess we'll put

972
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
lodestone somewhere i guess we'll put
 

973
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:03,990
lodestone somewhere i guess we'll put
that

974

988
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
i did it again i'm not looking at my
 

989
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,230
i did it again i'm not looking at my
keyboard

990
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
keyboard
 

991
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,669
keyboard
all right so we got our nether hub mark

992
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
all right so we got our nether hub mark
 

993
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,590
all right so we got our nether hub mark
so now the compass always points to that

994
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
so now the compass always points to that
 

995
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,870
so now the compass always points to that
cool so i'm going to go around marking

996
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
cool so i'm going to go around marking
 

997
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,310
cool so i'm going to go around marking
all our portals and then i'll show you

998
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
all our portals and then i'll show you
 

999
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,230
all our portals and then i'll show you
guys the final result when we're done

1000
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
guys the final result when we're done
 

1001
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,590
guys the final result when we're done
here and see what it looks like

1002
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
here and see what it looks like
 

1003
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,830
here and see what it looks like
awesome so we got it all marked out and

1004
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
awesome so we got it all marked out and
 

1005
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,430
awesome so we got it all marked out and
uh it took a fair bit of time probably

1006
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
uh it took a fair bit of time probably
 

1007
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,350
uh it took a fair bit of time probably
about an hour but we got i think most of

1008
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
about an hour but we got i think most of
 

1009
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,270
about an hour but we got i think most of
the key locations uh

1010
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
the key locations uh
 

1011
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,310
the key locations uh
marked on the map here and uh you know

1012
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
marked on the map here and uh you know
 

1013
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,350
marked on the map here and uh you know
the results are

1014
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
the results are
 

1015
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,029
the results are
kind of interesting i i do like it

1016
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
kind of interesting i i do like it
 

1017
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,029
kind of interesting i i do like it
though actually like it doesn't look

1018
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
though actually like it doesn't look
 

1019
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,150
though actually like it doesn't look
great

1020
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
great
 

1021
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,990
great
but it does a pretty good job at what

1022
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
but it does a pretty good job at what
 

1023
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,430
but it does a pretty good job at what
it's supposed to do like it gives us a

1024
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
it's supposed to do like it gives us a
 

1025
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,110
it's supposed to do like it gives us a
good idea of where stuff is

1026
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
good idea of where stuff is
 

1027
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,750
good idea of where stuff is
located and especially in relation to

1028
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
located and especially in relation to
 

1029
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,350
located and especially in relation to
each other so

1030
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
each other so
 

1031
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,029
each other so
another hub's right in the center here

1032
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
another hub's right in the center here
 

1033
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,870
another hub's right in the center here
one big problem i have though is my

1034
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
one big problem i have though is my
 

1035
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,830
one big problem i have though is my
nether hub is

1036
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
nether hub is
 

1037
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,789
nether hub is
odd based and the map is going to be

1038
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
odd based and the map is going to be
 

1039
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,950
odd based and the map is going to be
even based so

1040
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
even based so
 

1041
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,669
even based so
like this is our center and this is the

1042
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
like this is our center and this is the
 

1043
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,230
like this is our center and this is the
center of the nether hub so it doesn't

1044
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
center of the nether hub so it doesn't
 

1045
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,909
center of the nether hub so it doesn't
quite work out it might look better if i

1046
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
quite work out it might look better if i
 

1047
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,270
quite work out it might look better if i
add four more maps on this side

1048
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
add four more maps on this side
 

1049
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,710
add four more maps on this side
but i'm not really sure what to do about

1050
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
but i'm not really sure what to do about
 

1051
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,230
but i'm not really sure what to do about
it if you guys have an idea of where i

1052
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
it if you guys have an idea of where i
 

1053
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,390
it if you guys have an idea of where i
should put this let me know

1054
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
should put this let me know
 

1055
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,789
should put this let me know
um i was thinking maybe we put it at the

1056
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
um i was thinking maybe we put it at the
 

1057
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,669
um i was thinking maybe we put it at the
tunnels but

1058
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
tunnels but
 

1059
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,549
tunnels but
for now i got it right here but yeah

1060
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
for now i got it right here but yeah
 

1061
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,750
for now i got it right here but yeah
check it out so

1062
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
check it out so
 

1063
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,909
check it out so
like if we go straight down we go

1064
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
like if we go straight down we go
 

1065
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,350
like if we go straight down we go
forward

1066
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
forward
 

1067
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,190
forward
uh we will end up at the crimson keep if

1068
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
uh we will end up at the crimson keep if
 

1069
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,110
uh we will end up at the crimson keep if
we go down that tunnel and take a left

1070
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
we go down that tunnel and take a left
 

1071
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,430
we go down that tunnel and take a left
you can see it from the nether hub where

1072
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
you can see it from the nether hub where
 

1073
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,110
you can see it from the nether hub where
we are right now we go up

1074
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
we are right now we go up
 

1075
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,510
we are right now we go up
and to the left it's right over there

1076
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
and to the left it's right over there
 

1077
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,230
and to the left it's right over there
now

1078
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
now
 

1079
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,150
now
we also put the coordinates on the map

1080
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
we also put the coordinates on the map
 

1081
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,150
we also put the coordinates on the map
i'm glad i thought about this

1082
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
i'm glad i thought about this
 

1083
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,830
i'm glad i thought about this
uh it's probably hard to read on youtube

1084
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
uh it's probably hard to read on youtube
 

1085
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,990
uh it's probably hard to read on youtube
but they're there you can see it in game

1086
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
but they're there you can see it in game
 

1087
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,270
but they're there you can see it in game
pretty good they're kind of tiny though

1088
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
pretty good they're kind of tiny though
 

1089
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,230
pretty good they're kind of tiny though
and uh most of stuff is on these two

1090
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
and uh most of stuff is on these two
 

1091
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,549
and uh most of stuff is on these two
maps actually these two over here

1092
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
maps actually these two over here
 

1093
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,230
maps actually these two over here
so i think we can throw this in

1094
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
so i think we can throw this in
 

1095
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,390
so i think we can throw this in
and is it a map it wants okay it's a map

1096
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
and is it a map it wants okay it's a map
 

1097
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,750
and is it a map it wants okay it's a map
please don't mess up my uh original

1098
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
please don't mess up my uh original
 

1099
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,150
please don't mess up my uh original
i don't want to do it again okay that's

1100
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
i don't want to do it again okay that's
 

1101
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,110
i don't want to do it again okay that's
good

1102
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
good
 

1103
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,870
good
yeah it keeps the markers i was worried

1104
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
yeah it keeps the markers i was worried
 

1105
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,549
yeah it keeps the markers i was worried
i was gonna lose them very good very

1106
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
i was gonna lose them very good very
 

1107
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,549
i was gonna lose them very good very
good so we got a backup now of all five

1108
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
good so we got a backup now of all five
 

1109
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,990
good so we got a backup now of all five
maps just in case

1110
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
maps just in case
 

1111
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,590
maps just in case
something happens to them i hit it with

1112
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
something happens to them i hit it with
 

1113
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,190
something happens to them i hit it with
an end or pearl or piglen

1114
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
an end or pearl or piglen
 

1115
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,190
an end or pearl or piglen
shoots them you know they'll pop off and

1116
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
shoots them you know they'll pop off and
 

1117
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,470
shoots them you know they'll pop off and
we might lose them

1118
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
we might lose them
 

1119
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,750
we might lose them
and that but that would stink uh the

1120
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
and that but that would stink uh the
 

1121
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,270
and that but that would stink uh the
other thing we did though of course is

1122
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
other thing we did though of course is
 

1123
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,029
other thing we did though of course is
we did the lodestone so if you check out

1124
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
we did the lodestone so if you check out
 

1125
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,310
we did the lodestone so if you check out
the compasses here

1126
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
the compasses here
 

1127
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,630
the compasses here
we got the names of the things down the

1128
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
we got the names of the things down the
 

1129
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,990
we got the names of the things down the
tunnel and also

1130
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
tunnel and also
 

1131
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,789
tunnel and also
uh location we got the coordinates there

1132
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
uh location we got the coordinates there
 

1133
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,430
uh location we got the coordinates there
so

1134
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
so
 

1135
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,270
so
that's cool and the compass points at

1136
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
that's cool and the compass points at
 

1137
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,789
that's cool and the compass points at
them even while it's in the chest here

1138
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
them even while it's in the chest here
 

1139
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,510
them even while it's in the chest here
so the

1140
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
so the
 

1141
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,029
so the
juryville's a little bit off to the left

1142
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
juryville's a little bit off to the left
 

1143
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,630
juryville's a little bit off to the left
you see the pointers a bit to the left

1144
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
you see the pointers a bit to the left
 

1145
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,270
you see the pointers a bit to the left
there

1146
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
there
 

1147
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,950
there

um i want to see like do they work now
 

1165
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,230
um i want to see like do they work now
actually or not

1166
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
actually or not
 

1167
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,830
actually or not

1168
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
i have no idea um like obviously they
 

1169
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,390
i have no idea um like obviously they
work

1170
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
work
 

1171
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,990
work
they have worked for a long time but the

1172
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
they have worked for a long time but the
 

1173
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,909
they have worked for a long time but the
big problem was with the chunk loading

1174
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:19,919
big problem was with the chunk loading
 

1175
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,230
big problem was with the chunk loading
and

1176
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
and
 

1177
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,750
and
unloading situation so like

1178
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
unloading situation so like
 

1179
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,909
unloading situation so like
this was always possible um

1180
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
this was always possible um
 

1181
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,630
this was always possible um
let's go make a new ender porter here

1182
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
let's go make a new ender porter here
 

1183
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,270
let's go make a new ender porter here
they're actually so simple to make too

1184
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
they're actually so simple to make too
 

1185
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,549
they're actually so simple to make too
all we gotta do is like dig a hole

1186
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
all we gotta do is like dig a hole
 

1187
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,270
all we gotta do is like dig a hole
oh we hit redstone so all we got to do

1188
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
oh we hit redstone so all we got to do
 

1189
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,909
oh we hit redstone so all we got to do
is like

1190
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
is like
 

1191
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,230
is like
get some soul sand and some water and

1192
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
get some soul sand and some water and
 

1193
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,830
get some soul sand and some water and
get the bubble columns going right and

1194
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
get the bubble columns going right and
 

1195
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,590
get the bubble columns going right and
that'll hold up an ender pearl now that

1196
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
that'll hold up an ender pearl now that
 

1197
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,909
that'll hold up an ender pearl now that
wasn't the case before so get our water

1198
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
wasn't the case before so get our water
 

1199
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,909
wasn't the case before so get our water
get our bubbles get our ender pearl

1200
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
get our bubbles get our ender pearl
 

1201
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,510
get our bubbles get our ender pearl
and now is this gonna float so it's

1202
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
and now is this gonna float so it's
 

1203
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,270
and now is this gonna float so it's
actually affected by bubble streams now

1204
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
actually affected by bubble streams now
 

1205
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,270
actually affected by bubble streams now
which is amazing

1206
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
which is amazing
 

1207
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,270
which is amazing
and i'm assuming it would work if we

1208
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
and i'm assuming it would work if we
 

1209
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,710
and i'm assuming it would work if we
leave the chunks right

1210
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
leave the chunks right
 

1211
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,270
leave the chunks right
let's go check that out because that was

1212
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
let's go check that out because that was
 

1213
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,710
let's go check that out because that was
the big problem you would teleport when

1214
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
the big problem you would teleport when
 

1215
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,630
the big problem you would teleport when
you didn't want to

1216
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
you didn't want to
 

1217
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,110
you didn't want to
but if we have total control over it now

1218
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
but if we have total control over it now
 

1219
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,270
but if we have total control over it now
that would be great

1220
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
that would be great
 

1221
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,710
that would be great
all right so we should be far enough

1222
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
all right so we should be far enough
 

1223
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,870
all right so we should be far enough
away where that hasn't loaded

1224
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
away where that hasn't loaded
 

1225
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,470
away where that hasn't loaded
and then when they would reload that's

1226
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
and then when they would reload that's
 

1227
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,310
and then when they would reload that's
when we would teleport

1228
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
when we would teleport
 

1229
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,390
when we would teleport
so let's head back

1230
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400

 

1231
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,230

and i haven't teleported yet that's a

1232
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
and i haven't teleported yet that's a
 

1233
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,110
and i haven't teleported yet that's a
good sign

1234
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120

 

1235
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,630

should still be there then

1236
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640

 

1237
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,190

and it is okay cool so i'm gonna just

1238
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
and it is okay cool so i'm gonna just
 

1239
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,070
and it is okay cool so i'm gonna just
test it a bit more

1240
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
test it a bit more
 

1241
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,310
test it a bit more
off camera here make sure we didn't just

1242
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
off camera here make sure we didn't just
 

1243
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,430
off camera here make sure we didn't just
get lucky there

1244
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
get lucky there
 

1245
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,310
get lucky there
yes it actually works now everybody i'm

1246
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
yes it actually works now everybody i'm
 

1247
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,070
yes it actually works now everybody i'm
so excited about this

1248
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
so excited about this
 

1249
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,149
so excited about this
i've been wanting to make an ender pearl

1250
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
i've been wanting to make an ender pearl
 

1251
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,470
i've been wanting to make an ender pearl
transportation system forever

1252
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
transportation system forever
 

1253
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,390
transportation system forever
so i tried leaving the area a few times

1254
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
so i tried leaving the area a few times
 

1255
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,230
so i tried leaving the area a few times
and coming back having the chunks unload

1256
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
and coming back having the chunks unload
 

1257
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,350
and coming back having the chunks unload
and reload

1258
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
and reload
 

1259
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,110
and reload
i went to the nether and it still is

1260
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
i went to the nether and it still is
 

1261
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,990
i went to the nether and it still is
here and i also reloaded the game

1262
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
here and i also reloaded the game
 

1263
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,669
here and i also reloaded the game
both while within the chunks and while

1264
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
both while within the chunks and while
 

1265
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,190
both while within the chunks and while
outside of the chunks and

1266
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
outside of the chunks and
 

1267
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,310
outside of the chunks and
uh yeah every case it's fine this is

1268
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
uh yeah every case it's fine this is
 

1269
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,310
uh yeah every case it's fine this is
only one water source too so it's not

1270
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
only one water source too so it's not
 

1271
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,029
only one water source too so it's not
going to need

1272
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
going to need
 

1273
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,669
going to need
like a big big thing to do it so the

1274
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
like a big big thing to do it so the
 

1275
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,110
like a big big thing to do it so the
idea is we

1276
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
idea is we
 

1277
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,470
idea is we
oh i had the pistons already

1278
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480

 

1279
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,870

the idea is we set up a piston here or

1280
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
the idea is we set up a piston here or
 

1281
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,390
the idea is we set up a piston here or
something maybe even a slime block

1282
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
something maybe even a slime block
 

1283
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,029
something maybe even a slime block
launcher

1284
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
launcher
 

1285
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,190
launcher
and uh then we trigger it and that

1286
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
and uh then we trigger it and that
 

1287
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,070
and uh then we trigger it and that
activates the ender pearl

1288
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
activates the ender pearl
 

1289
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,029
activates the ender pearl
and we can run redstone like hundreds of

1290
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
and we can run redstone like hundreds of
 

1291
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,630
and we can run redstone like hundreds of
blocks there's even ways of loading

1292
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
blocks there's even ways of loading
 

1293
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,669
blocks there's even ways of loading
chunks

1294
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:29,679
chunks
 

1295
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,510
chunks
uh we can go thousands of blocks and

1296
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
uh we can go thousands of blocks and
 

1297
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,870
uh we can go thousands of blocks and
trigger an ender pearl way

1298
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
trigger an ender pearl way
 

1299
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,110
trigger an ender pearl way
off somewhere else at a different base

1300
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
off somewhere else at a different base
 

1301
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,390
off somewhere else at a different base
or whatever

1302
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
or whatever
 

1303
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,190
or whatever
and and transport around our world that

1304
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
and and transport around our world that
 

1305
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,310
and and transport around our world that
way which is cool

1306
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
way which is cool
 

1307
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,470
way which is cool
so this is the new best way of uh

1308
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
so this is the new best way of uh
 

1309
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,830
so this is the new best way of uh
traveling in the game

1310
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
traveling in the game
 

1311
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,510
traveling in the game
like ice ice roads are cool

1312
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
