said i wasn't going to do any more

342
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360

arches

344
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
arches
 

345
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,070
arches
and i've done more arches down here i

346
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
and i've done more arches down here i
 

347
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,309
and i've done more arches down here i
i really like this part of the cave

348
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
i really like this part of the cave
 

349
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,749
i really like this part of the cave
though

350
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
though
 

351
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,110
though
like i really do and i think it's

352
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
like i really do and i think it's
 

353
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,110
like i really do and i think it's
because of the arches they add a lot to

354
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
because of the arches they add a lot to
 

355
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,230
because of the arches they add a lot to
it so i

356
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
it so i
 

357
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,830
it so i
i got two more arches down here

358
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
i got two more arches down here
 

359
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,390
i got two more arches down here
well three more technically because i i

360
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
well three more technically because i i
 

361
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,870
well three more technically because i i
did a double arch here

362
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
did a double arch here
 

363
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,790
did a double arch here
to wilson um this isn't really done here

364

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
the ceiling here the river is right
 

377
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,270
the ceiling here the river is right
above you can see the water

378
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
above you can see the water
 

379
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,150
above you can see the water
on the leaves even i was really worried

380
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
on the leaves even i was really worried
 

381
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,270
on the leaves even i was really worried
when i was

382
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
when i was
 

383
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,710
when i was
building this i was going to update the

384
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
building this i was going to update the
 

385
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,430

00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
river here and if that happens oh man
 

387
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,990
river here and if that happens oh man
like if i was to break this block right

388
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
like if i was to break this block right
 

389
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,270
like if i was to break this block right
here

390
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
here
 

391
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,869
here
or if an enderman came by and did

392
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
or if an enderman came by and did
 

393
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,710
or if an enderman came by and did
something like that

394
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
something like that
 

395
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,150
something like that
this water block would update and it

396
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
this water block would update and it
 

397
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,309
this water block would update and it
would update all the other ones

398
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
would update all the other ones
 

399
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,629
would update all the other ones
down the river it's a real pain to fix

400
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
down the river it's a real pain to fix
 

401
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,230
down the river it's a real pain to fix
oh that actually doesn't look too good

402
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
oh that actually doesn't look too good
 

403
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,990
oh that actually doesn't look too good
does it

404
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
does it
 

405
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,670
does it
it's only one deep here that was a

406
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
it's only one deep here that was a
 

407
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,670
it's only one deep here that was a
problem and if i place a block here it's

408
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
problem and if i place a block here it's
 

409
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,790
problem and if i place a block here it's
going to update

410
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
going to update
 

411
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,469
going to update
so i guess we'll just live with it um

412
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
so i guess we'll just live with it um
 

413
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,469
so i guess we'll just live with it um
yeah so that's that's done that's pretty

414
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
yeah so that's that's done that's pretty
 

415
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,469
yeah so that's that's done that's pretty
cool

416
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
cool
 

417
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,510
cool
um still gonna work on the outside here

418
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
um still gonna work on the outside here
 

419
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,110
um still gonna work on the outside here
a little bit like maybe put

420
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
a little bit like maybe put
 

421
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,430
a little bit like maybe put
i might put some wheat here that would

422
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
i might put some wheat here that would
 

423
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,350
i might put some wheat here that would
probably look pretty good

424
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360

 

425
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,029

yeah that doesn't really look that good

426
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
yeah that doesn't really look that good
 

427
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,310
yeah that doesn't really look that good
does it uh we should probably do

428
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
does it uh we should probably do
 

429
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,190
does it uh we should probably do
something else

430
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
something else
 

431
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,710
something else
there's just this little bit of space

432
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
there's just this little bit of space
 

433
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,230
there's just this little bit of space
between the paths like this

434
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
between the paths like this
 

435
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,030
between the paths like this
three blocks here one block here uh we

436
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
three blocks here one block here uh we
 

437
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,990
three blocks here one block here uh we
should probably

438
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
should probably
 

439
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,389
should probably
do something with although we could we

440
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
do something with although we could we
 

441
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,990
do something with although we could we
could probably make it to stonewall

442
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
could probably make it to stonewall
 

443
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,430
could probably make it to stonewall
or something too it would look okay uh

444
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
or something too it would look okay uh
 

445
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,269
or something too it would look okay uh
it does look a little wrong if if all

446
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
it does look a little wrong if if all
 

447
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,870
it does look a little wrong if if all
the stone isn't being held up by

448
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
the stone isn't being held up by
 

449
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,150
the stone isn't being held up by
something i haven't decided

450
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
something i haven't decided
 

451
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,110
something i haven't decided
fully if i should keep my cave like if i

452
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
fully if i should keep my cave like if i
 

453
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,710
fully if i should keep my cave like if i
should keep all this stone in my cave or

454
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
should keep all this stone in my cave or
 

455
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,030
should keep all this stone in my cave or
if i

456
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
if i
 

457
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,590
if i
should change it we'll probably keep it

458
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
should change it we'll probably keep it
 

459
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,190
should change it we'll probably keep it
though because it's supposed to be

460
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
though because it's supposed to be
 

461
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,710
though because it's supposed to be
supposed to have that underground feel

462
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
supposed to have that underground feel
 

463
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,710
supposed to have that underground feel
to it too so a little bit of stone is

464
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
to it too so a little bit of stone is
 

465
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,670
to it too so a little bit of stone is
good

466
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
good
 

467
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,509
good
so in that case maybe we should change

468
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
so in that case maybe we should change
 

469
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,990
so in that case maybe we should change
this

470
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000

 

471
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,710

because look look at the the slope on

472
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
because look look at the the slope on
 

473
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,470
because look look at the the slope on
the roof it looks like it needs support

474
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
the roof it looks like it needs support
 

475
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,150
the roof it looks like it needs support
here doesn't it

476
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
here doesn't it
 

477
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,150
here doesn't it
if there was gravity and all that fun

478
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
if there was gravity and all that fun
 

479
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,829
if there was gravity and all that fun
stuff in the game

480
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
stuff in the game
 

481
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,110
stuff in the game
which there isn't of course

482
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
which there isn't of course
 

483
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,150
which there isn't of course
um today i think we should head over to

484
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
um today i think we should head over to
 

485
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,509
um today i think we should head over to
my other

486
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
my other
 

487
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,350
my other
base like where the silverfish farm is

488
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
base like where the silverfish farm is
 

489
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,230
base like where the silverfish farm is
and all that i haven't checked

490
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
and all that i haven't checked
 

491
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,949
and all that i haven't checked
if the baby zombies have affected that

492
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
if the baby zombies have affected that
 

493
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,590
if the baby zombies have affected that
or not

494
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
or not
 

495
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,910
or not
my uh sorting system and all that might

496
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
my uh sorting system and all that might
 

497
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,310
my uh sorting system and all that might
be broken

498
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
be broken
 

499
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,750
be broken
i'm a little concerned about that

500
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760

 

501
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,550

i don't know what what to do with this

502
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
i don't know what what to do with this
 

503
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,150
i don't know what what to do with this
if it's all flat it doesn't look good

504
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
if it's all flat it doesn't look good
 

505
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,870
if it's all flat it doesn't look good
either

506
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880

 

507
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,030

anyway i'll mess with them another time

508
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
anyway i'll mess with them another time
 

509
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,110
anyway i'll mess with them another time
so yeah i was originally talking about

510
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
so yeah i was originally talking about
 

511
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,230
so yeah i was originally talking about
having eight of these stalls

512
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
having eight of these stalls
 

513
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,670
having eight of these stalls
the thing is just four of four of them

514
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
the thing is just four of four of them
 

515
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,030
the thing is just four of four of them
goes up to here

516
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
goes up to here
 

517
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,870
goes up to here
and we're i punched through the wall and

518
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
and we're i punched through the wall and
 

519
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,870
and we're i punched through the wall and
we're up by this mushroom farm which

520
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
we're up by this mushroom farm which
 

521
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,350
we're up by this mushroom farm which
even though we're taking it down we are

522
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
even though we're taking it down we are
 

523
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,710
even though we're taking it down we are
getting really close to

524
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
getting really close to
 

525
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,550
getting really close to
my my lab here as well

526
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
my my lab here as well
 

527
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,949
my my lab here as well
and if we put four more in it would go

528
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
and if we put four more in it would go
 

529
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,230
and if we put four more in it would go
up to i think like

530
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
up to i think like
 

531
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,750
up to i think like
here so yeah just cutting it a little

532
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
here so yeah just cutting it a little
 

533
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,550
here so yeah just cutting it a little
bit close

534
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
bit close
 

535
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,230
bit close
because i also wanted to put an elevator

536
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
because i also wanted to put an elevator
 

537
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,750
because i also wanted to put an elevator
a horse elevator to get up to the

538
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
a horse elevator to get up to the
 

539
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,269
a horse elevator to get up to the
surface here

540
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
surface here
 

541
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,670
surface here
so four is probably good um

542
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
so four is probably good um
 

543
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,350
so four is probably good um
i don't need that many horses around

544
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
i don't need that many horses around
 

545
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,190
i don't need that many horses around
i put a chest here i'm not really sure

546
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
i put a chest here i'm not really sure
 

547
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
i put a chest here i'm not really sure
what we're using that for

548
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
what we're using that for
 

549
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,150
what we're using that for
but it's there in case we want to put

550
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
but it's there in case we want to put
 

551
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,710
but it's there in case we want to put
something we got drafting tables on both

552
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
something we got drafting tables on both
 

553
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,470
something we got drafting tables on both
sides and of course

554
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
sides and of course
 

555
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,949
sides and of course
an ender chest which is really important

556
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
an ender chest which is really important
 

557
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,949
an ender chest which is really important
one of the problems i have with my base

558
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
one of the problems i have with my base
 

559
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,310
one of the problems i have with my base
is i never really factor in

560
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
is i never really factor in
 

561
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,389
is i never really factor in
like spots to put crafting tables or

562
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
like spots to put crafting tables or
 

563
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,550
like spots to put crafting tables or
ender chests or anything like that

564
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
ender chests or anything like that
 

565
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,829
ender chests or anything like that
so it can be a little bit annoying i

566
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
so it can be a little bit annoying i
 

567
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,670
so it can be a little bit annoying i
have to walk a long ways sometimes

568
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
have to walk a long ways sometimes
 

569
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,670
have to walk a long ways sometimes
to to get to one like we got one here

570
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
to to get to one like we got one here
 

571
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,350
to to get to one like we got one here
i didn't originally plan to put one

572
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
i didn't originally plan to put one
 

573
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,670
i didn't originally plan to put one
there that was an afterthought

574
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
there that was an afterthought
 

575
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,350
there that was an afterthought
that's why it's a block switcher too

576
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
that's why it's a block switcher too
 

577
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,110
that's why it's a block switcher too
um there's there's a sneaky little ender

578
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
um there's there's a sneaky little ender
 

579
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,310
um there's there's a sneaky little ender
chest

580
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
chest
 

581
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,190
chest
in this waterfall which was also an

582
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
in this waterfall which was also an
 

583
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,750
in this waterfall which was also an
afterthought

584
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
afterthought
 

585
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,829
afterthought
and if we go over here we have one more

586
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
and if we go over here we have one more
 

587
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,509
and if we go over here we have one more
they're actually their space pretty good

588
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
they're actually their space pretty good
 

589
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,190
they're actually their space pretty good
with that that third one where i just

590
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
with that that third one where i just
 

591
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,150
with that that third one where i just
put it there

592
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
put it there
 

593
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,590
put it there
but there's one more ender chest here

594
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
but there's one more ender chest here
 

595
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,430
but there's one more ender chest here
which is also hidden again an

596
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
which is also hidden again an
 

597
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,829
which is also hidden again an
afterthought

598
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
afterthought
 

599
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,310
afterthought
crafting table there there's a crafting

600

00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
it because this thing's kind of weird
 

605
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,110
it because this thing's kind of weird
it's like the only place i've used brick

606
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
it's like the only place i've used brick
 

607
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,629
it's like the only place i've used brick
for some reason i thought it would look

608
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
for some reason i thought it would look
 

609
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,069
for some reason i thought it would look
good

610
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
good
 

611
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,990
good
and now that we've done it we gotta live

612
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
and now that we've done it we gotta live
 

613
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,670
and now that we've done it we gotta live
with it so

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
with it so
 

615
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,150
with it so
yeah anyway let's head on over to the

616
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
yeah anyway let's head on over to the
 

617
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,310
yeah anyway let's head on over to the
other base

618
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
other base
 

619
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,150
other base
and check things out over there

620
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160

 

621
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,870

oh yeah by the way i don't think i've

622
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
oh yeah by the way i don't think i've
 

623
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,990
oh yeah by the way i don't think i've
mentioned this yet but

624
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
mentioned this yet but
 

625
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,790
mentioned this yet but
the silverfish farm haven't seen me do

626
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
the silverfish farm haven't seen me do
 

627
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,829
the silverfish farm haven't seen me do
anything within a while

628
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
anything within a while
 

629
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,190
anything within a while
i'm pretty sure it's broken

630
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
i'm pretty sure it's broken
 

631
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,230
i'm pretty sure it's broken
for like a few months now uh like a

632
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
for like a few months now uh like a
 

633
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,509
for like a few months now uh like a
little while ago

634
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
little while ago
 

635
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,269
little while ago
actually we'll turn it on we'll try to

636
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
actually we'll turn it on we'll try to
 

637
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,710
actually we'll turn it on we'll try to
confirm it today

638
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
confirm it today
 

639
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,870
confirm it today
if it's broken or not did some silver

640
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
if it's broken or not did some silver
 

641
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,310
if it's broken or not did some silver
fish spawning in here

642
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
fish spawning in here
 

643
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,509
fish spawning in here
but like a few months ago they were

644
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
but like a few months ago they were
 

645
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,350
but like a few months ago they were
making a bunch of changes where they

646
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
making a bunch of changes where they
 

647
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,030
making a bunch of changes where they
were reducing

648
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
were reducing
 

649
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,870
were reducing
the number of things that were affected

650
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
the number of things that were affected
 

651
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,230
the number of things that were affected
by

652
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
by
 

653
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,350
by
or that caused block updates so like

654
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
or that caused block updates so like
 

655
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,949
or that caused block updates so like
sheep beating grass no longer was

656
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
sheep beating grass no longer was
 

657
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,710
sheep beating grass no longer was
causing block updates

658
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
causing block updates
 

659
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,550
causing block updates
and i think they got rid of silverfish

660
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
and i think they got rid of silverfish
 

661
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,069
and i think they got rid of silverfish
entering blocks

662
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
entering blocks
 

663
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,310
entering blocks
causing block updates so that's how this

664
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
causing block updates so that's how this
 

665
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,550
causing block updates so that's how this
farm operated

666
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
farm operated
 

667
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,110
farm operated
and if it can't detect it anymore it's

668
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
and if it can't detect it anymore it's
 

669
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,509
and if it can't detect it anymore it's
not going to work anymore so

670
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
not going to work anymore so
 

671
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,870
not going to work anymore so
we'll just get a few spawning there and

672
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
we'll just get a few spawning there and
 

673
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,389
we'll just get a few spawning there and
we'll check it again maybe they changed

674
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
we'll check it again maybe they changed
 

675
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,230
we'll check it again maybe they changed
it back

676
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
it back
 

677
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,509
it back
but or maybe i just maybe i just didn't

678
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
but or maybe i just maybe i just didn't
 

679
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,389
but or maybe i just maybe i just didn't
uh

680
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
uh
 

681
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,389
uh
do something right last time i tested it

682
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
do something right last time i tested it
 

683
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,230
do something right last time i tested it
who knows

684
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
who knows
 

685
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,389
who knows
okay but anyway what we want to check is

686
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
okay but anyway what we want to check is
 

687
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,910
okay but anyway what we want to check is
if this is broken

688
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
if this is broken
 

689
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,870
if this is broken
today as well let's head on up there and

690
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
today as well let's head on up there and
 

691
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,750
today as well let's head on up there and
switch it

692
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760

 

693
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,990

because the baby zombies it probably

694
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
because the baby zombies it probably
 

695
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,430
because the baby zombies it probably
isn't broken actually because they

696
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
isn't broken actually because they
 

697
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,629
isn't broken actually because they
should follow the same

698
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
should follow the same
 

699
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,870
should follow the same
logic as a normal zombie i think they

700
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
logic as a normal zombie i think they
 

701
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,710
logic as a normal zombie i think they
chase villagers

702
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
chase villagers
 

703
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,670
chase villagers
and i'm pretty sure they're over a block

704
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
and i'm pretty sure they're over a block
 

705
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,629
and i'm pretty sure they're over a block
tall so they shouldn't

706
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
tall so they shouldn't
 

707
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,990
tall so they shouldn't
really be that much different than a

708
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
really be that much different than a
 

709
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,030
really be that much different than a
normal zombie

710
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040

 

711
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,509

oh we should maybe go up actually let's

712
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
oh we should maybe go up actually let's
 

713
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,790
oh we should maybe go up actually let's
go up

714
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800

 

715
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,790

716
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
we need to finish this thing too this is
 

717
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,829
we need to finish this thing too this is
one of my other big projects i haven't

725
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,550
be able to see if he does anything he
shouldn't do

726
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
shouldn't do
 

727
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,910

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
uh for the most part it seems to be
 

729
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,509

765
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,949
switch it off hopefully
hopefully it's just creepers in here

766
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
hopefully it's just creepers in here
 

767
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,030

775
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,629
watch them burn that's really loud
the idea is i was i planned on making it

776
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
the idea is i was i planned on making it
 

777
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,670
the idea is i was i planned on making it
so i could stand

778
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
so i could stand
 

779
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,670
so i could stand
here it was dangerous

780
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
here it was dangerous
 

781
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,189
here it was dangerous
they can see me through here okay so no

782
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
they can see me through here okay so no
 

783
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,389
they can see me through here okay so no
more should be falling down

784
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
more should be falling down
 

785
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,910
more should be falling down
it should be down to one hit and i'm i

786
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
it should be down to one hit and i'm i
 

787
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,749
it should be down to one hit and i'm i
designed it so that the skeletons would

788
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
designed it so that the skeletons would
 

789
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,590
designed it so that the skeletons would
be in the middle

790
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
be in the middle
 

791
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,910
be in the middle
and then creepers on an end so that if i

792
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
and then creepers on an end so that if i
 

793
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,230
and then creepers on an end so that if i
walked into the line of sight

794
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
walked into the line of sight
 

795
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,670
walked into the line of sight
the skeletons would shoot at the

796
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
the skeletons would shoot at the
 

797
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,069
the skeletons would shoot at the
creepers and and kill them hopefully

798
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
creepers and and kill them hopefully
 

799
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,749
creepers and and kill them hopefully

i should do that a few more times and
get them all

844
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:58,990
get them all
 

845
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,470
get them all
[Music]

846
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
[Music]
 

847
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,269
[Music]
all right so this thing is bunching up

848
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
all right so this thing is bunching up
 

849
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,309
all right so this thing is bunching up
here uh

850
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
here uh
 

851
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,069
here uh
i'm looking at it another thing that

852
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
i'm looking at it another thing that
 

853
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,510
i'm looking at it another thing that
might be broken is this

854
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520

 

855
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,510

because this was all the way down and

856
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
because this was all the way down and
 

857
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,630
because this was all the way down and
it's not supposed to be

858
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:16,640

 

859
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,510

this uh this detector seems to be broken

860
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
this uh this detector seems to be broken
 

861
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,350
this uh this detector seems to be broken
somehow

862
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360

 

863
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,870

because the idea is when the block gets

864
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
because the idea is when the block gets
 

865
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,390
because the idea is when the block gets
to here

866
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
to here
 

867
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,789
to here
it's supposed to send redstone oh you

868
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
it's supposed to send redstone oh you
 

869
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,669
it's supposed to send redstone oh you
know what's missing

870
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
know what's missing
 

871
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,110
know what's missing
there's supposed to be a redstone torch

872
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
there's supposed to be a redstone torch
 

873
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,350
there's supposed to be a redstone torch
right here

874
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
right here
 

875
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,029
right here
and i just happen to have one dust

876
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
and i just happen to have one dust
 

877
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,510
and i just happen to have one dust
that's perfect

878
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
that's perfect
 

879
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,270
that's perfect
okay i think that'll fix it

880
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280

 

881
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,549

um let's try this out okay

882
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
um let's try this out okay
 

883
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,430
um let's try this out okay
maybe that's not what i did i don't know

884
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
maybe that's not what i did i don't know
 

885
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,470
maybe that's not what i did i don't know
something's wrong with that

886
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
something's wrong with that
 

887
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,510
something's wrong with that
for sure let's see if they enter

888
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
for sure let's see if they enter
 

889
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,549
for sure let's see if they enter
the box so and cause an update so

890
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
the box so and cause an update so
 

891
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,110
the box so and cause an update so
when i tested it before i put a repeater

892
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
when i tested it before i put a repeater
 

893
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,230
when i tested it before i put a repeater
here to update the piston

894
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240

 

895
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,870

i think that did something let's do it

896
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
i think that did something let's do it
 

897
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,510
i think that did something let's do it
one more time just to be sure

898
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
one more time just to be sure
 

899
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,110
one more time just to be sure
actually yeah is this a silverfish block

900
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
actually yeah is this a silverfish block
 

901
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,789
actually yeah is this a silverfish block
that is a silver fish block okay that's

902
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
that is a silver fish block okay that's
 

903
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,430
that is a silver fish block okay that's
good

904
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440

 

905
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,590

okay so the block that's there should

906
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
okay so the block that's there should
 

907
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,549
okay so the block that's there should
definitely be

908
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
definitely be
 

909
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,510
definitely be
a smooth stone without a silver fish in

910
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
a smooth stone without a silver fish in
 

911
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,029
a smooth stone without a silver fish in
let's walk away

912
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039

 

913
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,310

oh okay never mind it's working

914
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
oh okay never mind it's working
 

915
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,990
oh okay never mind it's working
i guess the thing that was broken was

916
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
i guess the thing that was broken was
 

917
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,750
i guess the thing that was broken was
this

918
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
this
 

919
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,230
this
i'll have to fix this

920
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
i'll have to fix this
 

921
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,590
i'll have to fix this
i don't know i've been watching it for a

922
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
i don't know i've been watching it for a
 

923
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,909
i don't know i've been watching it for a
while now there's something definitely

924
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
while now there's something definitely
 

925
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,029
while now there's something definitely
wrong here

926
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
wrong here
 

927
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,029
wrong here
i fixed that but it's like

928
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
i fixed that but it's like
 

929
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,070
i fixed that but it's like
i'll update this is the silver fish

930
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
i'll update this is the silver fish
 

931
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,190
i'll update this is the silver fish
yeah that's a silver fish oops

932
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
yeah that's a silver fish oops
 

933
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,590
yeah that's a silver fish oops
what did i just do update it

934
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
what did i just do update it
 

935
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,470
what did i just do update it
okay they can't enter a block when i'm

936
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
okay they can't enter a block when i'm
 

937
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,909
okay they can't enter a block when i'm
here at least they weren't able to

938
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
here at least they weren't able to
 

939
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,470
here at least they weren't able to
before i have to be outside of their

940
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
before i have to be outside of their
 

941
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,710
before i have to be outside of their
aggro range before they can enter a

942
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
aggro range before they can enter a
 

943
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,270
aggro range before they can enter a
block which is i think

944
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
block which is i think
 

945
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,870
block which is i think
it's over eight blocks away for sure

946
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
it's over eight blocks away for sure
 

947
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,830
it's over eight blocks away for sure
it's like 16 i think

948
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840

 

949
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,310

okay that's

950
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
okay that's
 

951
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,669
okay that's
that's smooth stone right there there's

952
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
that's smooth stone right there there's
 

953
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,350
that's smooth stone right there there's
no silver fish in that one

954
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
no silver fish in that one
 

955
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,669
no silver fish in that one
or the the one right below there it's

956
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
or the the one right below there it's
 

957
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,390
or the the one right below there it's
like when i move out of the range

958
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
like when i move out of the range
 

959
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,710
like when i move out of the range
it works the first time right away no

960
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
it works the first time right away no
 

961
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,390
it works the first time right away no
problem

962
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
problem
 

963
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,990
problem
second times good just trying to figure

964
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
second times good just trying to figure
 

965
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,230
second times good just trying to figure
out

966
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
out
 

967
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,950
out
why it's not working okay third time

968
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960

 

969
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,230

it's gonna keep working

970
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240

 

971
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,070

yeah after three times it just stops

972
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
yeah after three times it just stops
 

973
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,590
yeah after three times it just stops
working for some reason

974
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
working for some reason
 

975
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,669
working for some reason
maybe my cobblestone generator is not

976
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
maybe my cobblestone generator is not
 

977
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,710
maybe my cobblestone generator is not
keeping up but

978
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
keeping up but
 

979
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,590
keeping up but
i don't know oh it's still going look at

980
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
i don't know oh it's still going look at
 

981
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,070
i don't know oh it's still going look at
that

982
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080

 

983
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,470

still going good good
i'm gonna watch it for a bit longer it

986
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
i'm gonna watch it for a bit longer it
 

987
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,510
i'm gonna watch it for a bit longer it
wasn't working before for some reason

988
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520

 

989
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,710

ah yeah no worries guys it's running

990
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
ah yeah no worries guys it's running
 

991

just fine
 

993
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,990
just fine
i'm so glad we tested it i thought for

994
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
i'm so glad we tested it i thought for
 

995
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,149
i'm so glad we tested it i thought for
sure it was broken and i was gonna have

996
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
sure it was broken and i was gonna have
 

997
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:22,710
sure it was broken and i was gonna have
to

998
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
to
 

999
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,549
to
either change this or tear it down or

1000
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
either change this or tear it down or
 

1001
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,750
either change this or tear it down or
something

1002
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,760
something
 

1003
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,390
something
so i'm glad that's working again uh i

1004
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
so i'm glad that's working again uh i
 

1005
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,669
so i'm glad that's working again uh i
think what happened

1006
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
think what happened
 

1007
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,950
think what happened
probably i'm pretty sure they did remove

1008
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
probably i'm pretty sure they did remove
 

1009
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,630
probably i'm pretty sure they did remove
the ability to detect

1010
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
the ability to detect
 

1011
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,390
the ability to detect
a silverfish entering a block for at

1012
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400

it was very complex
for the time um

1512
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
for the time um
 

1513
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,710
for the time um
yeah to give you an idea of my

1514
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720
yeah to give you an idea of my
 

1515
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,310
yeah to give you an idea of my
redstone knowledge at that time i

1516
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
redstone knowledge at that time i
 

1517
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,710
redstone knowledge at that time i
i didn't even know you could send like a

1518
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
i didn't even know you could send like a
 

1519
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,990
i didn't even know you could send like a
redstone signal up

1520
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,000
redstone signal up
 

1521
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,269
redstone signal up
vertically using redstone torches like

1522
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:35,279
vertically using redstone torches like
 

1523
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,710
vertically using redstone torches like
like how we do this pretend those are

1524
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
like how we do this pretend those are
 

1525
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,990
like how we do this pretend those are
redstone torches and you

1526
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,000
redstone torches and you
 

1527
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,870
redstone torches and you
can get it up in a one by one space i

1528
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
can get it up in a one by one space i
 

1529
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,710
can get it up in a one by one space i
discovered that during that build and i

1530
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:44,720
discovered that during that build and i
 

1531
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,990
discovered that during that build and i
thought it was the coolest thing

1532
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
thought it was the coolest thing
 

1533
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,230
thought it was the coolest thing
ever because i i don't think a lot of

1534
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
ever because i i don't think a lot of
 

1535
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,750

was this like
 

1539
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,310
was this like
early redstone at that time the build

1540
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
early redstone at that time the build
 

1541
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,789
early redstone at that time the build
had

1542
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799

had
over 700 pieces of redstone in i was

1544
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,440

counting
 

1547
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,710
counting
and it was the first time i used logic

1548
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
and it was the first time i used logic
 

1549
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,230
and it was the first time i used logic
gates

1550
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,240
gates
 

1551
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,110
gates
and yeah it was it was a fun build

gave me an idea
of how to use it and and it worked the

1586
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
of how to use it and and it worked the
 

1587
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,269
of how to use it and and it worked the
way i wanted a lot of people they'll try
