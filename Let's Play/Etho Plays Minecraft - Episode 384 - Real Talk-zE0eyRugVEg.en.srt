00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:50,940
these minecarts there used to be a
 

219
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,640
these minecarts there used to be a
minecart thing here that would pick them

220
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:52,650
minecart thing here that would pick them
 

221
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,070
minecart thing here that would pick them
up and then he's supposed to circle

222
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,080
up and then he's supposed to circle
 

223
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,130
up and then he's supposed to circle
around the tree farm here but it kept

224
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,140
around the tree farm here but it kept
 

225
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,170
around the tree farm here but it kept
breaking on us is he gonna come down but

226
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,180
breaking on us is he gonna come down but
 

227
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
breaking on us is he gonna come down but
if we name him he won't be spawn ever so

228
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,190
if we name him he won't be spawn ever so
 

229
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,120
if we name him he won't be spawn ever so
that is probably what we should try to

230
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,130
that is probably what we should try to
 

231
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,570
that is probably what we should try to
do I think I may have put something up

232
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:11,580
do I think I may have put something up
 

233
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,149
do I think I may have put something up
there to block them

234
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:13,159
there to block them
 

235
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:18,510
there to block them
oh now he's a stake in this time okay so

236
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,520
oh now he's a stake in this time okay so
 

237
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,159
oh now he's a stake in this time okay so
he should make his way up I'm gonna grab

238
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:21,169
he should make his way up I'm gonna grab
 

239
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,489
he should make his way up I'm gonna grab
a nametag or maybe we'll just test this

240
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:24,499
a nametag or maybe we'll just test this
 

241
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:27,309
a nametag or maybe we'll just test this
first I'm gonna test it first after I

242
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:27,319
first I'm gonna test it first after I
 

243
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,509
first I'm gonna test it first after I
destroy everything stupid dick all right

don't know if this works I kind of doubt
 

249
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:40,179
don't know if this works I kind of doubt
it will but we used to be able to pick

250
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:40,189
it will but we used to be able to pick
 

251
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,519
it will but we used to be able to pick
them up through the corner here oh it

252
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:42,529
them up through the corner here oh it
 

253
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,899
them up through the corner here oh it
does work then you would go in the

254
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:46,909
does work then you would go in the
 

255
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,059
does work then you would go in the
minecart and yeah he's going to go

256
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:49,069
minecart and yeah he's going to go
 

257
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,459
minecart and yeah he's going to go
around and around let's see if you'll do

258
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:51,469
around and around let's see if you'll do
 

259
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:54,730
around and around let's see if you'll do
a full cycle because I would like to get

260
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:54,740
a full cycle because I would like to get
 

261
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,499
a full cycle because I would like to get
maybe one or two of these guys doing

262
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:56,509
maybe one or two of these guys doing
 

263
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,389
maybe one or two of these guys doing
that just so we can have that feature

264
00:06:58,389 --> 00:06:58,399
that just so we can have that feature
 

265
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,949
that just so we can have that feature
working again and then we'll just name

266
00:06:59,949 --> 00:06:59,959
working again and then we'll just name
 

267
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,689
working again and then we'll just name
them we won't have to worry about it

268

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:19,429
very good I have a nametag now and we
 

281
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:21,579
very good I have a nametag now and we
got another big slime to spawn eyes

282
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:21,589
got another big slime to spawn eyes
 

283
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:23,379

00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:47,839
don't worry oh man I was looking at this
 

301
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,299
don't worry oh man I was looking at this
- it actually looks like it's easy to

302
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:49,309
- it actually looks like it's easy to
 

303
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:54,069
- it actually looks like it's easy to
fix up what's wrong is this trapdoor

304
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:54,079
fix up what's wrong is this trapdoor
 

305
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,609
fix up what's wrong is this trapdoor
staying open too long when it opens so

306
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:57,619
staying open too long when it opens so
 

307
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:59,679
staying open too long when it opens so
if I just add a proper monostable

308
00:07:59,679 --> 00:07:59,689
if I just add a proper monostable
 

309
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,869
if I just add a proper monostable
circuit to this it will probably work

310
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:01,879
circuit to this it will probably work
 

311
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,419
circuit to this it will probably work
again alright and for now we will just

312
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:07,429
again alright and for now we will just
 

313
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:13,469
again alright and for now we will just
manually trigger it's got big momma

00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,070
today oh well one option is we could do
 

807
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,610
today oh well one option is we could do
a slime block launcher to get up to the

808
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,620
a slime block launcher to get up to the
 

809
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,130
a slime block launcher to get up to the
second floor or we could do a staircase

810
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,140
second floor or we could do a staircase
 

811
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,110
second floor or we could do a staircase

right now we have no way of getting up
 

813
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,900
right now we have no way of getting up
here so I thought the middle here would

814
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:08,910
here so I thought the middle here would
 

815
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,290
here so I thought the middle here would
be a good thing or a good place to go up

816
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:11,300
be a good thing or a good place to go up

this layout we got to get up to how high

822
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,410
this layout we got to get up to how high
 

823
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,810
this layout we got to get up to how high
at least up to here alright that is this

824
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:35,820
at least up to here alright that is this
 

825
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,460
at least up to here alright that is this
height that would be four blocks that

826
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:40,470
height that would be four blocks that
 

827
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,150
height that would be four blocks that
might be doable actually

828

only need four steps to get up to this
 

839
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,360
only need four steps to get up to this
level and this parts a little bit higher

840
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,370
level and this parts a little bit higher
 

841
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,220
level and this parts a little bit higher
so we would have another staircase here

this is only three steps and that's
 

845
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,120
this is only three steps and that's
that's pretty good and compact this this
