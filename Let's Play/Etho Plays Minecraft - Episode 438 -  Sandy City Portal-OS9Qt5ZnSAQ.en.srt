00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,499
ender pearl up there it's not in a
convenient location is what I'm getting

320
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:22,509
convenient location is what I'm getting
 

321
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,379
convenient location is what I'm getting
at so we're going to try build a proper

322
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:25,389
at so we're going to try build a proper
 

323
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,889
at so we're going to try build a proper
nether portal in this area and I thought

324
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:28,899
nether portal in this area and I thought
 

325
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,389
nether portal in this area and I thought
it would be cool if we put in the well

326
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:30,399
it would be cool if we put in the well
 

327
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,990
it would be cool if we put in the well
here like a little secret one so what

328
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
here like a little secret one so what
 

329
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,659
here like a little secret one so what
we're gonna do have will have like this

330
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:36,669
we're gonna do have will have like this
 

331
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,279
we're gonna do have will have like this
layer of water so it still looks like a

332
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:38,289
layer of water so it still looks like a
 

333
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,719
layer of water so it still looks like a
well and then we have to I want to make

334
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:42,729
well and then we have to I want to make
 

335
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,360
well and then we have to I want to make
it like automatic you know what I mean

336
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,370
it like automatic you know what I mean
 

337
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,220
it like automatic you know what I mean
what's the best way actually let's go

338
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,230
what's the best way actually let's go
 

339
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,249
what's the best way actually let's go
back up which way did we fall from oh I

340
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:52,259
back up which way did we fall from oh I
 

341
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,619
back up which way did we fall from oh I
happen to have an ender pearl there we

342
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:55,629
happen to have an ender pearl there we
 

343
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:59,490
happen to have an ender pearl there we
go alright so generally when we use this

344
00:08:59,490 --> 00:08:59,500
go alright so generally when we use this
 

345
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,379
go alright so generally when we use this
we're probably going to enter from this

346
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:01,389
we're probably going to enter from this
 

347
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,990
we're probably going to enter from this
direction falling this way so we want

348
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
direction falling this way so we want
 

349
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,629
direction falling this way so we want
the the portal like over on this side I

350
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:06,639
the the portal like over on this side I
 

351
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,290
the the portal like over on this side I
guess just so it's a little less

352
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,300
guess just so it's a little less
 

353
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,660
guess just so it's a little less
disorienting disorientating when we use

354
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:12,670
disorienting disorientating when we use
 

355
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,019
disorienting disorientating when we use
it ah let's let's try to build that

356
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:16,029
it ah let's let's try to build that
 

357
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,199
it ah let's let's try to build that
actually let's mmm what's what's the

358
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:19,209
actually let's mmm what's what's the
 

359
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,910
actually let's mmm what's what's the
first thing to do here maybe we should

360
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:20,920
first thing to do here maybe we should
 

361
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,070
first thing to do here maybe we should
figure out where to put the

362
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,080
figure out where to put the
 

363
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,850
figure out where to put the
the first platform now we want to go

364
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:26,860
the first platform now we want to go
 

365
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,500
the first platform now we want to go
down at this level so what we're going

366
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,510
down at this level so what we're going
 

367
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,610
down at this level so what we're going
to do is have like Pistons and pressure

368
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:32,620
to do is have like Pistons and pressure
 

369
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,170
to do is have like Pistons and pressure
plates if we land on the pressure plates

370
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:36,180

 

371
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,050

let's see these pistons will push you oh

372
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,060
let's see these pistons will push you oh
 

373
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,430
let's see these pistons will push you oh
you know what's going to happen here I'm

374
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
you know what's going to happen here I'm
 

375
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,220
you know what's going to happen here I'm
going to break the signs I'm going to

376
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,230
going to break the signs I'm going to
 

377
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,570
going to break the signs I'm going to
break the gravel the signs are going to

378
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:45,580
break the gravel the signs are going to
 

379
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,740
break the gravel the signs are going to
break and then the water is going to

380
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:46,750
break and then the water is going to
 

381
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,500
break and then the water is going to
fall on us unless I can break it in

382
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,510
fall on us unless I can break it in
 

383
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,630
fall on us unless I can break it in
places very quickly now I failed oh wait

384
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
places very quickly now I failed oh wait
 

385
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,100
places very quickly now I failed oh wait
no the signs are on that side okay this

386
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,110
no the signs are on that side okay this
 

387
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,940
no the signs are on that side okay this
might be okay I placed it but it's

388
00:09:59,940 --> 00:09:59,950
might be okay I placed it but it's
 

389
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:06,510
might be okay I placed it but it's
breaking what you guys see that the the

390
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:06,520
breaking what you guys see that the the
 

391
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,110
breaking what you guys see that the the
piston broke when I placed it that was

392
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,120
piston broke when I placed it that was
 

393
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,470
piston broke when I placed it that was
weird

394
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
weird
 

395
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,630
weird
did I actually lose it or what happened

396
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
did I actually lose it or what happened
 

397
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,500
did I actually lose it or what happened
I want to see man do that again 61 we

398
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,510
I want to see man do that again 61 we
 

399
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,410
I want to see man do that again 61 we
had 61 now we have 60 what happened the

400
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,420
had 61 now we have 60 what happened the
 

401
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:22,980
had 61 now we have 60 what happened the
piston

402
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:22,990
piston
 

403
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,040
piston
oh man that's weird

404
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,050
oh man that's weird
 

405
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,770
oh man that's weird
59 yeah we're losing kissed ins okay

406
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:33,780
59 yeah we're losing kissed ins okay
 

407
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,420
59 yeah we're losing kissed ins okay
kind of strange I'm pretty sure it never

408
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,430
kind of strange I'm pretty sure it never
 

409
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,760
kind of strange I'm pretty sure it never
used to do that

410
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:37,770
used to do that
 

411
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:45,920
used to do that
okay let's rebuild this all right so I

412
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:45,930

 

413
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,380

guess the ideas we'll put repeaters here

414
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,390
guess the ideas we'll put repeaters here
 

415
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,420
guess the ideas we'll put repeaters here
um

416
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,430
um
 

417
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,210
um
redstone on top of these blocks is what

418
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:54,220
redstone on top of these blocks is what
 

419
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,040
redstone on top of these blocks is what
we're gonna have to try dude this is

420
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,050
we're gonna have to try dude this is
 

421
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,780
we're gonna have to try dude this is
really annoying having all this gravel

422
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:57,790
really annoying having all this gravel
 

423
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,540
really annoying having all this gravel
and sand here I got to say maybe we

424
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:00,550
and sand here I got to say maybe we
 

425
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,640
and sand here I got to say maybe we
should just get rid of the water

426
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:01,650
should just get rid of the water
 

427
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,770
should just get rid of the water
temporarily because otherwise I'm going

428
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:04,780
temporarily because otherwise I'm going
 

429
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,000
temporarily because otherwise I'm going
to struggle with this the whole time

430
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,010
to struggle with this the whole time
 

431
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,610
to struggle with this the whole time
it's like a juggling act you know trying

432
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:08,620
it's like a juggling act you know trying
 

433
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,910
it's like a juggling act you know trying
to build well stopping the water yeah

434
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
to build well stopping the water yeah
 

435
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,630
to build well stopping the water yeah
well just get rid of that for now okay

436
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:15,640
well just get rid of that for now okay
 

437
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,520
well just get rid of that for now okay
so I just took a little moment here to

438
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:17,530
so I just took a little moment here to
 

439
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,900
so I just took a little moment here to
figure out a few things it occurred to

440
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:18,910
figure out a few things it occurred to
 

441
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,370
figure out a few things it occurred to
me we could probably do this a little

442
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,380
me we could probably do this a little
 

443
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,900
me we could probably do this a little
bit better than what I was trying to do

444
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:21,910
bit better than what I was trying to do
 

445
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,510
bit better than what I was trying to do
here also when we enter the well we're

446
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:24,520
here also when we enter the well we're
 

447
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,920
here also when we enter the well we're
probably actually going to enter either

448
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:25,930
probably actually going to enter either
 

449
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,660
probably actually going to enter either
from this side or the other side because

450
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:27,670
from this side or the other side because
 

451
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,680
from this side or the other side because
we have the post in the way so we'll

452
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:31,690
we have the post in the way so we'll
 

453
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,300
we have the post in the way so we'll
pick one or the other here oh I guess

454
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,310
pick one or the other here oh I guess
 

455
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,930
pick one or the other here oh I guess
we'll go

456
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:36,940
we'll go
 

457
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,520
we'll go
yeah let's put the nether portal on this

458
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:38,530
yeah let's put the nether portal on this
 

459
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,270
yeah let's put the nether portal on this
side new plan okay

460
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:41,280
side new plan okay
 

461
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,520
side new plan okay
alright this is what I was doing and I

462
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:44,530
alright this is what I was doing and I
 

463
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,060
alright this is what I was doing and I
just had like pressure plate repeater

464
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,070
just had like pressure plate repeater
 

465
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,640
just had like pressure plate repeater
sticky piston hit the pressure plate it

466
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:50,650
sticky piston hit the pressure plate it
 

467
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,560
sticky piston hit the pressure plate it
pushes you and I need to go down one

468
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:52,570
pushes you and I need to go down one
 

469
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,450
pushes you and I need to go down one
step in the middle we'd have another one

470
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:54,460
step in the middle we'd have another one
 

471
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,340
step in the middle we'd have another one
and then another one at the third layer

472
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,350
and then another one at the third layer
 

473
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,560
and then another one at the third layer
would have taken up a lot of space and

474
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,570
would have taken up a lot of space and
 

475
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,330
would have taken up a lot of space and
it occurred to me you know we have we

476
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:00,340
it occurred to me you know we have we
 

477
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,860
it occurred to me you know we have we
have slime blocks in the game I should

478
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:01,870
have slime blocks in the game I should
 

479
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,620
have slime blocks in the game I should
really take advantage of them here so

480
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:04,630
really take advantage of them here so
 

481
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,000
really take advantage of them here so
that's why I have a new plan now okay

482
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,010
that's why I have a new plan now okay
 

483
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,940
that's why I have a new plan now okay
let's let's see the nether portal goes

484
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:11,950
let's let's see the nether portal goes
 

485
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,590
let's let's see the nether portal goes
there what we're going to do then is

486
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
there what we're going to do then is
 

487
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,520
there what we're going to do then is
have a 3x3 thing of pressure plates that

488
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:17,530
have a 3x3 thing of pressure plates that
 

489
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,880
have a 3x3 thing of pressure plates that
will detect it when we land

490
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:19,890
will detect it when we land
 

491
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,790
will detect it when we land
so let's I'm getting really used to this

492
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:23,800
so let's I'm getting really used to this
 

493
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,590
so let's I'm getting really used to this
middle middle clicking to select the

494
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
middle middle clicking to select the
 

495
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,460
middle middle clicking to select the
block you want it's really really cool

496
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,470
block you want it's really really cool
 

497
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,980
block you want it's really really cool
alright so just put some redstone down

498
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:31,990
alright so just put some redstone down
 

499
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,760
alright so just put some redstone down
here oops

500
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:32,770
here oops
 

501
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,140
here oops
fill that in oh I keep bragging like the

502
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,150
fill that in oh I keep bragging like the
 

503
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,930
fill that in oh I keep bragging like the
one and only torch we have down here

504
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:38,940
one and only torch we have down here
 

505
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,800
one and only torch we have down here
alright this pressure plates and out if

506
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:43,810
alright this pressure plates and out if
 

507
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,750
alright this pressure plates and out if
we step on any of these it's going to

508
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
we step on any of these it's going to
 

509
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,240
we step on any of these it's going to
trigger that redstone down below let's

510
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,250
trigger that redstone down below let's
 

511
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,980
trigger that redstone down below let's
break this stuff since we're not using

512
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:49,990
break this stuff since we're not using
 

513
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,700
break this stuff since we're not using
it okay and then what we're going to do

514
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:53,710
it okay and then what we're going to do
 

515
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,310
it okay and then what we're going to do
is have like a arm that pushes us from

516
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
is have like a arm that pushes us from
 

517
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,200
is have like a arm that pushes us from
this side into the nether portal over

518
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,210
this side into the nether portal over
 

519
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,740
this side into the nether portal over
here let's go ahead and build the nether

520
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,750
here let's go ahead and build the nether
 

521
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,480
here let's go ahead and build the nether
portal just so we know where it's going

522
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,490
portal just so we know where it's going
 

523
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:10,350
portal just so we know where it's going
oh and that's okay good and also I'm

524
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:10,360
oh and that's okay good and also I'm
 

525
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,880
oh and that's okay good and also I'm
going to try set this up so that when we

526
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:11,890
going to try set this up so that when we
 

527
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,170
going to try set this up so that when we
go through the nether portal it

528
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,180
go through the nether portal it
 

529
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,180
go through the nether portal it
automatically closes behind us as well

530
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,190
automatically closes behind us as well
 

531
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,730
automatically closes behind us as well
so that we if like we're in the nether

532
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:17,740
so that we if like we're in the nether
 

533
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,010
so that we if like we're in the nether
we use another portal we never want to

534
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,020
we use another portal we never want to
 

535
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,510
we use another portal we never want to
end up down in the well here that would

536
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:21,520
end up down in the well here that would
 

537
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,880
end up down in the well here that would
not be this would not be a good place to

538
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:23,890
not be this would not be a good place to
 

539
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,380
not be this would not be a good place to
come out it's kind of inconvenient okay

540
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:28,390
come out it's kind of inconvenient okay
 

541
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,630
come out it's kind of inconvenient okay
there's our nether portal alright so now

542
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:30,640
there's our nether portal alright so now
 

543
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,720
there's our nether portal alright so now
we need our arm that pushes us so we're

544
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:33,730
we need our arm that pushes us so we're
 

545
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,310
we need our arm that pushes us so we're
going to do a little slime block thing

546
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,320
going to do a little slime block thing
 

547
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,910
going to do a little slime block thing
here basically goes the torch basically

548
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
here basically goes the torch basically
 

549
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,560
here basically goes the torch basically
it's going to go like this

550
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,570

 

551
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,800

clear garbage here and we will do oh we

552
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:52,810
clear garbage here and we will do oh we
 

553
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,140
clear garbage here and we will do oh we
got invisible blocks guys we're going to

554
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,150
got invisible blocks guys we're going to
 

555
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,530
got invisible blocks guys we're going to
do that that shape there I'm pretty sure

556
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:58,540
do that that shape there I'm pretty sure
 

557
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,530
do that that shape there I'm pretty sure
and then like sticky pistons on each of

558
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:01,540
and then like sticky pistons on each of
 

559
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,030
and then like sticky pistons on each of
these let me break these temporarily

560
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
these let me break these temporarily
 

561
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,450
these let me break these temporarily
okay I'm back and I can't remember where

562
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:11,460
okay I'm back and I can't remember where
 

563
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,600
okay I'm back and I can't remember where
where do we have to trigger this I think

564
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:15,610
where do we have to trigger this I think
 

565
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,880
where do we have to trigger this I think
at this line here right yeah okay we're

566
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:20,890
at this line here right yeah okay we're
 

567
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,220
at this line here right yeah okay we're
going to assume that so then we put that

568
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,230
going to assume that so then we put that
 

569
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,970
going to assume that so then we put that
down there

570
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:23,980
down there
 

571
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,950
down there
now we need to go up here I'm rambling

572
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:27,960
now we need to go up here I'm rambling
 

573
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,150
now we need to go up here I'm rambling
let's uh get some more land what we'll

574
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,160
let's uh get some more land what we'll
 

575
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,680
let's uh get some more land what we'll
do is put down a torch I don't do a lot

576
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:37,690
do is put down a torch I don't do a lot
 

577
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,270
do is put down a torch I don't do a lot
of redstone on camera I thought this

578
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,280
of redstone on camera I thought this
 

579
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,370
of redstone on camera I thought this
would be a simple enough thing to do but

580
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:41,380
would be a simple enough thing to do but
 

581
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,810
would be a simple enough thing to do but
as you can see even simple things like

582
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:42,820
as you can see even simple things like
 

583
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,520
as you can see even simple things like
this I struggle a little bit with um

584
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:46,530
this I struggle a little bit with um
 

585
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,810
this I struggle a little bit with um
which one do we have to activate first

586
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:48,820
which one do we have to activate first
 

587
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,340
which one do we have to activate first
let's figure out the sequence maybe a

588
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,350
let's figure out the sequence maybe a
 

589
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,440
let's figure out the sequence maybe a
good way of figuring out the sequence of

590
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,450
good way of figuring out the sequence of
 

591
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,420
good way of figuring out the sequence of
things is using levers and triggering it

592
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:54,430
things is using levers and triggering it
 

593
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,340
things is using levers and triggering it
one by one

594
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,350
one by one
 

595
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,540
one by one
so I'm guessing it's this one first

596
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:57,550
so I'm guessing it's this one first
 

597
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:04,440
so I'm guessing it's this one first
right oh wait a sec it's not going to

598
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,450
right oh wait a sec it's not going to
 

599
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,990
right oh wait a sec it's not going to
work as we got invisible block we've got

600
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,000
work as we got invisible block we've got
 

601
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,490
work as we got invisible block we've got
all this land on the side we need to get

602
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:08,500
all this land on the side we need to get
 

603
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,730
all this land on the side we need to get
rid of let's break this is a the slime

604
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:14,740
rid of let's break this is a the slime
 

605
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,080
rid of let's break this is a the slime
blocks are sticking to that that's not

606
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,090
blocks are sticking to that that's not
 

607
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,580
blocks are sticking to that that's not
good okay let's try it again okay so it

608
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:20,590
good okay let's try it again okay so it
 

609
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,100
good okay let's try it again okay so it
goes forward one oops oh and these are

610
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,110
goes forward one oops oh and these are
 

611
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,090
goes forward one oops oh and these are
gonna have to be obsidian yeah because

612
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,100
gonna have to be obsidian yeah because
 

613
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,030
gonna have to be obsidian yeah because
otherwise they move with it or some

614
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
otherwise they move with it or some
 

615
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,720
otherwise they move with it or some
block that doesn't get triggered right

616
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:35,730
block that doesn't get triggered right
 

617
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,220
block that doesn't get triggered right
that one then you trigger this one the

618
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,230
that one then you trigger this one the
 

619
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,680
that one then you trigger this one the
whole thing moves forward good and then

620
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:40,690
whole thing moves forward good and then
 

621
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,590
whole thing moves forward good and then
when we pull it back oops is it all

622
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:46,600
when we pull it back oops is it all
 

623
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,180
when we pull it back oops is it all
retract properly yeah okay good umm so

624
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,190
retract properly yeah okay good umm so
 

625
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,940
retract properly yeah okay good umm so
probably what we're going to do get rid

626
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:53,950
probably what we're going to do get rid
 

627
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,759
probably what we're going to do get rid
of these again

628
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:56,769
of these again
 

629
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,540
of these again
oh that's a skeleton horse I found a few

630
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:00,550
oh that's a skeleton horse I found a few
 

631
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,449
oh that's a skeleton horse I found a few
more of them but none of them were were

632
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:03,459
more of them but none of them were were
 

633
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,210
more of them but none of them were were
all that great so then I think we set

634
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:06,220
all that great so then I think we set
 

635
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,600
all that great so then I think we set
this the two this the four let's try it

636
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:09,610
this the two this the four let's try it
 

637
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:09,929
this the two this the four let's try it
out

638
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:09,939
out
 

639
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:13,229
out
this should be the the sequence yeah

640
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:13,239
this should be the the sequence yeah
 

641
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:19,220
this should be the the sequence yeah
then retract oh did not retract properly

642
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,230
then retract oh did not retract properly
 

643
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,900
then retract oh did not retract properly
uh-huh it was because I had the

644
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:21,910
uh-huh it was because I had the
 

645
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,150
uh-huh it was because I had the
repeaters reversed so I flipped them

646
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
repeaters reversed so I flipped them
 

647
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,749
repeaters reversed so I flipped them
here so now whole thing seems to work

648
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
here so now whole thing seems to work
 

649
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,900
here so now whole thing seems to work
okay nice and simple all we got to do

650
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:30,910
okay nice and simple all we got to do
 

651
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,489
okay nice and simple all we got to do
now is connect this to our three by

652
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:32,499
now is connect this to our three by
 

653
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,970
now is connect this to our three by
three thing of redstone down here and we

654
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:35,980
three thing of redstone down here and we
 

655
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,639
three thing of redstone down here and we
should be good to go

656
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:37,649
should be good to go
 

657
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,590
should be good to go
all right I guess we have to come up to

658
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:40,600
all right I guess we have to come up to
 

659
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,109
all right I guess we have to come up to
here don't want to attach here because

660
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:43,119
here don't want to attach here because
 

661
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,729
here don't want to attach here because
then the redstone is going to face the

662
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:44,739
then the redstone is going to face the
 

663
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:49,979
then the redstone is going to face the
wrong way and so are we out of we are

664
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:49,989
wrong way and so are we out of we are
 

665
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:54,030
wrong way and so are we out of we are
out of it let's make some more okay

666
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,040
out of it let's make some more okay
 

667
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,129
out of it let's make some more okay
sometimes I put redstone on sandstone I

668
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:56,139
sometimes I put redstone on sandstone I
 

669
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,789
sometimes I put redstone on sandstone I
don't know why I did that yeah so now

670
00:16:59,789 --> 00:16:59,799
don't know why I did that yeah so now
 

671
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,509
don't know why I did that yeah so now
let's try it out as soon as we land on

672
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
let's try it out as soon as we land on
 

673
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,149
let's try it out as soon as we land on
any of these we get pushed into the

674
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:06,159
any of these we get pushed into the
 

675
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,039
any of these we get pushed into the
nether portal now that's what we want

676
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,049
nether portal now that's what we want
 

677
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,510
nether portal now that's what we want
it's not glitching out that's great

678
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:12,520
it's not glitching out that's great
 

679
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,840
it's not glitching out that's great
so what I'm going to do now is hook up

680
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:15,850
so what I'm going to do now is hook up
 

681
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,500
so what I'm going to do now is hook up
the timer on the portal so when we hit

682
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:19,510
the timer on the portal so when we hit
 

683
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,260
the timer on the portal so when we hit
the pressure plate portal turns on then

684
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,270
the pressure plate portal turns on then
 

685
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,620
the pressure plate portal turns on then
after I think it's 41 ticks 41 redstone

686
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:25,630
after I think it's 41 ticks 41 redstone
 

687
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,340
after I think it's 41 ticks 41 redstone
ticks we shut it off awesome so I think

688
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,350
ticks we shut it off awesome so I think
 

689
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,230
ticks we shut it off awesome so I think
it's just about done here let's just put

690
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:31,240
it's just about done here let's just put
 

691
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,169
it's just about done here let's just put
the finishing touches on it so we're

692
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:34,179
the finishing touches on it so we're
 

693
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,610
the finishing touches on it so we're
going to put down our water again this

694
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:38,620
going to put down our water again this
 

695
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,909
going to put down our water again this
will work right this is the part I'm

696
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
will work right this is the part I'm
 

697
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,850
will work right this is the part I'm
scared of I hate I hate how water rex

698
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:44,860
scared of I hate I hate how water rex
 

699
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,190
scared of I hate I hate how water rex
redstone you know if only they could get

700
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
redstone you know if only they could get
 

701
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,580
redstone you know if only they could get
along but they just don't alright so

702
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:50,590
along but they just don't alright so
 

703
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,320
along but they just don't alright so
basically from these pressure plates I

704
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,330
basically from these pressure plates I
 

705
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,870
basically from these pressure plates I
have a 5 tick delay here this is just to

706
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:57,880
have a 5 tick delay here this is just to
 

707
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,610
have a 5 tick delay here this is just to
give us enough time so that we're within

708
00:17:59,610 --> 00:17:59,620
give us enough time so that we're within
 

709
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,919
give us enough time so that we're within
the portal area we don't want to turn it

710
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:01,929
the portal area we don't want to turn it
 

711
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:05,220
the portal area we don't want to turn it
turn it on before we are at the portal

712
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,230
turn it on before we are at the portal
 

713
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,830
turn it on before we are at the portal
otherwise this isn't going to work so

714
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
otherwise this isn't going to work so
 

715
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,649
otherwise this isn't going to work so
then goes up here this redstone

716
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:10,659
then goes up here this redstone
 

717
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:12,810
then goes up here this redstone
activates this dispenser first off we're

718
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:12,820
activates this dispenser first off we're
 

719
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,919
activates this dispenser first off we're
going to fill this up with flint and

720
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:13,929
going to fill this up with flint and
 

721
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:16,830
going to fill this up with flint and
steel so it lights the portal alright

722
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:16,840
steel so it lights the portal alright
 

723
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,830
steel so it lights the portal alright
and then we have ten repeaters that's 40

724
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
and then we have ten repeaters that's 40
 

725
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,589
and then we have ten repeaters that's 40
and then there's little mom stable

726
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:22,599
and then there's little mom stable
 

727
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,129
and then there's little mom stable
circuit here alright and then one more

728
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:26,139
circuit here alright and then one more
 

729
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,979
circuit here alright and then one more
ticks so 41 total then it goes to this

730
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:28,989
ticks so 41 total then it goes to this
 

731
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,629
ticks so 41 total then it goes to this
dispenser which we're going to put a

732
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:30,639
dispenser which we're going to put a
 

733
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,700
dispenser which we're going to put a
water bucket in so that ejects the water

734
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:32,710
water bucket in so that ejects the water
 

735
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,029
water bucket in so that ejects the water
breaks the portal and then it also sends

736
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:36,039
breaks the portal and then it also sends
 

737
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,779
breaks the portal and then it also sends
a signal down this line and with a 2

738
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:39,789
a signal down this line and with a 2
 

739
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,969
a signal down this line and with a 2
redstone delay after that it's going to

740
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:41,979
redstone delay after that it's going to
 

741
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,710
redstone delay after that it's going to
activate this again to pick up the water

742
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:43,720
activate this again to pick up the water
 

743
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,259
activate this again to pick up the water
and that's pretty much all we got to do

744
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:46,269
and that's pretty much all we got to do
 

745
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:51,180
and that's pretty much all we got to do
so let's try this out it almost seemed

746
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,190
so let's try this out it almost seemed
 

747
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,169
so let's try this out it almost seemed
to light that a little too soon doing it

748
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:54,179
to light that a little too soon doing it
 

749
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:59,570
to light that a little too soon doing it
maybe I'll add a little bit more delay

750
00:18:59,570 --> 00:18:59,580

 

751
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,710

that was definitely fine we could

752
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:01,720
that was definitely fine we could
 

753
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,399
that was definitely fine we could
probably make it 6 okay I love that

754
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:05,409
probably make it 6 okay I love that
 

755
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,129
probably make it 6 okay I love that
water sound that's so cool

756
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:08,139
water sound that's so cool
 

757
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:11,310
water sound that's so cool
also I got some some Sealand lanterns

758
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,320
also I got some some Sealand lanterns
 

759
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,719
also I got some some Sealand lanterns
here we don't want mobs spawning down

760
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:12,729
here we don't want mobs spawning down
 

761
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:14,279
here we don't want mobs spawning down
here because this will activate the

762
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:14,289
here because this will activate the
 

763
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,159
here because this will activate the
thing and cause some trouble right so we

764
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:17,169
thing and cause some trouble right so we
 

765
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,560
thing and cause some trouble right so we
want to make sure it's bright enough and

766
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:18,570
want to make sure it's bright enough and
 

767
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,279
want to make sure it's bright enough and
a weekend

768
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:20,289
a weekend
 

769
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,969
a weekend
finish this off hopefully without

770
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:23,979
finish this off hopefully without
 

771
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:28,139
finish this off hopefully without
getting teleported this okay

772
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:28,149
getting teleported this okay
 

773
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:30,389
getting teleported this okay
everything's good here it's lit up yeah

774
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:30,399
everything's good here it's lit up yeah
 

775
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,489
everything's good here it's lit up yeah
once I close this off I probably never

776
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:32,499
once I close this off I probably never
 

777
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:35,279
once I close this off I probably never
enter back here again want to make sure

778
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:35,289
enter back here again want to make sure
 

779
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:40,469
enter back here again want to make sure
it's lit up well enough good okay very

780
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:40,479
it's lit up well enough good okay very
 

781
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:46,589
it's lit up well enough good okay very
quickly got it so it should be good to

782
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:46,599
quickly got it so it should be good to
 

783
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,460
quickly got it so it should be good to
go now where is it gonna put us in the

784
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:50,470
go now where is it gonna put us in the
 

785
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,839
go now where is it gonna put us in the
nether

786
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:50,849
nether
 

787
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:54,180
nether
I'll put us on the stupid potion track

788
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,190
I'll put us on the stupid potion track
 

789
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:59,460
I'll put us on the stupid potion track
oh that might be a problem this is not

790
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,470
oh that might be a problem this is not
 

791
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,229
oh that might be a problem this is not
actually connected with another hub not
