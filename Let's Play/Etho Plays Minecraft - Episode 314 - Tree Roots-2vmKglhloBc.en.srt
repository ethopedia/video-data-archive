00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,270
clay it's like that's right you gotta
put the clay balls in not not clay

162
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
put the clay balls in not not clay
 

163
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,449
put the clay balls in not not clay
blocks and so I had eight stacks of

164
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:10,459
blocks and so I had eight stacks of
 

165
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,319
blocks and so I had eight stacks of
hardened clay that I couldn't make

166
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:14,329
hardened clay that I couldn't make
 

167
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:17,050
hardened clay that I couldn't make
bricks out of it was pretty sad like I

168
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,060
bricks out of it was pretty sad like I
 

169
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,550
bricks out of it was pretty sad like I
didn't get hardened clay easy from the

170
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
didn't get hardened clay easy from the
 

171
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,240
didn't get hardened clay easy from the
Mesa now so I don't need to convert real

172
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,250
Mesa now so I don't need to convert real
 

173
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,260
Mesa now so I don't need to convert real
clay into

174
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,270
clay into
 

175
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,730
clay into
that stuff anymore and it's just a waste

176
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:24,740
that stuff anymore and it's just a waste
 

177
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,270
that stuff anymore and it's just a waste
if I do so that was pretty sad

178
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
if I do so that was pretty sad
 

179
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,010
if I do so that was pretty sad
especially since I spent like half an

180
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,020
especially since I spent like half an
 

181
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,350
especially since I spent like half an
hour collecting at all and I only have

182
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,360
hour collecting at all and I only have
 

183
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,080
hour collecting at all and I only have
like three four stacks left from the

184
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,090
like three four stacks left from the
 

185
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,040
like three four stacks left from the
mistake anyway so let's go ahead and

186
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,050
mistake anyway so let's go ahead and
 

187
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,399
mistake anyway so let's go ahead and
make some stairs it's probably plenty of

188
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:42,409
make some stairs it's probably plenty of
 

189
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,980
make some stairs it's probably plenty of
stairs I decided to go with with brick

190
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:44,990
stairs I decided to go with with brick
 

191
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,629
stairs I decided to go with with brick
for these things that I think it might

192
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
for these things that I think it might
 

193
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,719
for these things that I think it might
look pretty cool it has that structural

194
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:49,729
look pretty cool it has that structural
 

195
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,850
look pretty cool it has that structural
look to it like it's it's kind of like

196
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:51,860
look to it like it's it's kind of like
 

197
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,710
look to it like it's it's kind of like
stone but it has color to it as well

198
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:53,720
stone but it has color to it as well
 

199
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,770
stone but it has color to it as well
which is what I wanted if I used wood it

200
00:04:59,770 --> 00:04:59,780
which is what I wanted if I used wood it
 

201
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,629
which is what I wanted if I used wood it
doesn't really make sense because wood

202
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639
doesn't really make sense because wood
 

203
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,730
doesn't really make sense because wood
rots of course this is minecraft but I

204
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:06,740
rots of course this is minecraft but I
 

205
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,649
rots of course this is minecraft but I
think this is I think brick is probably

206
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:08,659
think this is I think brick is probably
 

207
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:09,909
think this is I think brick is probably
the best choice and I don't use it very

208
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
the best choice and I don't use it very
 

209
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,800
the best choice and I don't use it very
often so it's kind of cool to to use it

210
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:11,810
often so it's kind of cool to to use it
 

211
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,770
often so it's kind of cool to to use it
here I think so we will make this come

212
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:14,780
here I think so we will make this come
 

213
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,309
here I think so we will make this come
all the way around and I sort of did

214
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:18,319
all the way around and I sort of did
 

215
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,860
all the way around and I sort of did
like the random garbage in the in the

216
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:20,870
like the random garbage in the in the
 

217
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,170
like the random garbage in the in the
ground here it doesn't look that great

218
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,180
ground here it doesn't look that great
 

219
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,100
ground here it doesn't look that great
in my opinion it's a little too chaotic

220
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,110
in my opinion it's a little too chaotic
 

221
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,260
in my opinion it's a little too chaotic
it sort of sort of bugs me but it's

222
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,270
it sort of sort of bugs me but it's
 

223
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,600
it sort of sort of bugs me but it's
gonna be flooded with water anyway so we

224
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,610
gonna be flooded with water anyway so we
 

225
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,469
gonna be flooded with water anyway so we
just want texture underneath the water

226
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:37,479

 

227
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,469

let's go back up yeah let's go look at

228
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:41,479
let's go back up yeah let's go look at
 

229
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,570
let's go back up yeah let's go look at
what this looks like we did two all

230
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,580
what this looks like we did two all
 

231
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,990
what this looks like we did two all
right yeah we did two now that it goes

232
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,000
right yeah we did two now that it goes
 

233
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,309
right yeah we did two now that it goes
all the way around yeah I think I like

234
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:51,319
all the way around yeah I think I like
 

235
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,839
all the way around yeah I think I like
that it looks very strong like it's

236
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:55,849
that it looks very strong like it's
 

237
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:58,029
that it looks very strong like it's
holding up the ceiling I'm thinking

238
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,039
holding up the ceiling I'm thinking
 

239
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,430
holding up the ceiling I'm thinking
let's let's try to break up the ceiling

240
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,440
let's let's try to break up the ceiling
 

241
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,110
let's let's try to break up the ceiling
too it might be cool to have like tree

242
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,120
too it might be cool to have like tree
 

243
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,659
too it might be cool to have like tree
roots coming through the roof and the

244
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:04,669
roots coming through the roof and the
 

245
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:07,689
roots coming through the roof and the
walls make it look like this is actually

246
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:07,699
walls make it look like this is actually
 

247
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,159
walls make it look like this is actually
a cave and maybe have dripping water in

248
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:12,169
a cave and maybe have dripping water in
 

249
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:16,059
a cave and maybe have dripping water in
places could be pretty cool let me go

250
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:16,069
places could be pretty cool let me go
 

251
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:17,860
places could be pretty cool let me go
ahead and finish up all these these

252
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:17,870
ahead and finish up all these these
 

253
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,269
ahead and finish up all these these
bring around things okay I got the brick

254
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:22,279
bring around things okay I got the brick
 

255
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,110
bring around things okay I got the brick
done guys

256
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
done guys
 

257
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,839
done guys
here is the reveal I like it I think

258
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:31,849
here is the reveal I like it I think
 

259
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,829
here is the reveal I like it I think
that's pretty cool

260
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:32,839
that's pretty cool
 

261
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,529
that's pretty cool
I really like how the 3d works like as

262
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:35,539
I really like how the 3d works like as
 

263
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,119
I really like how the 3d works like as
you approach it

264
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:37,129
you approach it
 

265
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,359
you approach it
expands out I mean like the ring like as

266
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:40,369
expands out I mean like the ring like as
 

267
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,339
expands out I mean like the ring like as
you get closer it expands out and

268
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:42,349
you get closer it expands out and
 

269
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:45,179
you get closer it expands out and
something about that just is really neat

270
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:45,189
something about that just is really neat
 

271
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,999
something about that just is really neat
because it does it all the way around

272
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:48,009
because it does it all the way around
 

273
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:51,219
because it does it all the way around
anyway I like it and I'm happy with that

274
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:51,229
anyway I like it and I'm happy with that
 

275
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,229
anyway I like it and I'm happy with that
I think brick was a good choice for the

276
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:53,239
I think brick was a good choice for the
 

277
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,809
I think brick was a good choice for the
material so now let's go ahead we're

278
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:55,819
material so now let's go ahead we're
 

279
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,359
material so now let's go ahead we're
gonna do the flooding I think it's time

280
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:58,369
gonna do the flooding I think it's time
 

281
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:01,959
gonna do the flooding I think it's time
for the flooding anyway I would like to

282
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:01,969
for the flooding anyway I would like to
 

283
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:05,619
for the flooding anyway I would like to
change his dirts with maybe podzol or

284
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:05,629
change his dirts with maybe podzol or
 

285
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:09,249
change his dirts with maybe podzol or
mycelium I'm actually not too sure how

286
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:09,259
mycelium I'm actually not too sure how
 

287
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,839
mycelium I'm actually not too sure how
mycelium looks with brick I don't know

288
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:10,849
mycelium looks with brick I don't know
 

289
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:13,239
mycelium looks with brick I don't know
if I've ever seen that before but we're

290
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:13,249
if I've ever seen that before but we're
 

291
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:18,149
if I've ever seen that before but we're
gonna flood this two layers thick

292
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:18,159

 

293
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,790

thankfully flooding is so easy you guys

294
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:21,800
thankfully flooding is so easy you guys
 

295
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,980
thankfully flooding is so easy you guys
remember before ice like before you

296
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:23,990
remember before ice like before you
 

297
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,509
remember before ice like before you
could pick up ice water was so tough to

298
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:28,519
could pick up ice water was so tough to
 

299
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,179
could pick up ice water was so tough to
work with

300
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:30,189
work with
 

301
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:33,279
work with
now you just down a couple blocks you

302
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,289
now you just down a couple blocks you
 

303
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,189
now you just down a couple blocks you
don't need to move half-a-million

304
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:36,199
don't need to move half-a-million
 

305
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,989
don't need to move half-a-million
buckets of water around it's wonderful

306
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:39,999
buckets of water around it's wonderful
 

307
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,579
buckets of water around it's wonderful
although you know what these blocks here

308
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:42,589
although you know what these blocks here
 

309
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,779
although you know what these blocks here
these are gonna be annoying maybe I

310
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:43,789
these are gonna be annoying maybe I
 

311
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,749
these are gonna be annoying maybe I
should take these out just temporarily

312
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
should take these out just temporarily
 

313
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,899
should take these out just temporarily
because I want to do one more layer just

314
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:49,909
because I want to do one more layer just
 

315
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:53,709
because I want to do one more layer just
short of the dirt here and then maybe

316
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:53,719
short of the dirt here and then maybe
 

317
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,769
short of the dirt here and then maybe
I'd like as a drain with water flowing

318
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:56,779
I'd like as a drain with water flowing
 

319
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:02,699
I'd like as a drain with water flowing
out down into this too would look cool I

320
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:02,709

 

321
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,629

guess that kind of looks like a sewer

322
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
guess that kind of looks like a sewer
 

323
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,249
guess that kind of looks like a sewer
system if we do that there's nothing

324
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:06,259
system if we do that there's nothing
 

325
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,169
system if we do that there's nothing
wrong with that though all right so this

326
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:11,179
wrong with that though all right so this
 

327
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:16,570
wrong with that though all right so this
is good let's get the next layer going

328

yeah so break the ice oh this is where
 

387
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,960
yeah so break the ice oh this is where
water budgets are better because it

388
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,970
water budgets are better because it
 

389
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,370
water budgets are better because it
doesn't make water if there's there's

390
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,380
doesn't make water if there's there's
 

391
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,790
doesn't make water if there's there's
nothing under it all right and we will

392
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
nothing under it all right and we will
 

393
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,770
nothing under it all right and we will
put another ice block there all but it

394
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:06,780
put another ice block there all but it
 

395
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,670
put another ice block there all but it
it did that whoops don't panic we can

00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:32,939
took me like an hour was pretty tedious
 

443
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,399
took me like an hour was pretty tedious
actually working out all the little

444
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:34,409
actually working out all the little
 

445
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,099
actually working out all the little
details I have to go collect more leaves

446
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:37,109
details I have to go collect more leaves
 

447
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:39,739
details I have to go collect more leaves
and wood and and I don't know how

448
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:39,749
and wood and and I don't know how
 

449
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,089
and wood and and I don't know how
interesting it would have been lots of

450
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:41,099
interesting it would have been lots of
 

451
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:43,429
interesting it would have been lots of
fiddle farting around as butyl below

452
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:43,439
fiddle farting around as butyl below
 

453
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,189
fiddle farting around as butyl below
would say but I'm pretty happy with how

454
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:46,199
would say but I'm pretty happy with how
 

455
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:48,469
would say but I'm pretty happy with how
looks might have went a little overboard

456
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:48,479
looks might have went a little overboard
 

457
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:51,769
looks might have went a little overboard
with the leaves but it's pretty good and

458
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:51,779
with the leaves but it's pretty good and
 

459
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,929
with the leaves but it's pretty good and
then in places like you see there

460
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:53,939
then in places like you see there
 

461
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:55,759
then in places like you see there
there's there's water dripping I just

462
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:55,769
there's there's water dripping I just
 

463
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,979
there's there's water dripping I just
like dug two blocks up stuck a water

464
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:57,989
like dug two blocks up stuck a water
 

465
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,799
like dug two blocks up stuck a water
block up there and a stone below it so

466
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:00,809
block up there and a stone below it so
 

467
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:05,119
block up there and a stone below it so
it looks like the ceiling has water

468
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:05,129
it looks like the ceiling has water
 

469
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,299
it looks like the ceiling has water
above I guess that's where the the water

470
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:08,309
above I guess that's where the the water
 

471
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:10,639
above I guess that's where the the water
table is at yeah that's it and it's

472
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:10,649
table is at yeah that's it and it's
 

473
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,679
table is at yeah that's it and it's
dripping down into the cave and this is

474
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:12,689
dripping down into the cave and this is
 

475
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,529
dripping down into the cave and this is
a water system to prevent everything

476
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:15,539
a water system to prevent everything
 

477
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,449

to fix might go to like one of those new
 

637
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,020
to fix might go to like one of those new
areas we saw when exploring with the

638
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,030
areas we saw when exploring with the
 

639
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,050
areas we saw when exploring with the
cool terrain build a castle there

640
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,060
cool terrain build a castle there
 

641
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,570
cool terrain build a castle there
normally when people build castles they

642
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:09,580
normally when people build castles they
 

643
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,130
normally when people build castles they
don't furnish the rooms or anything they

644
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,140
don't furnish the rooms or anything they
 

645
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,160
don't furnish the rooms or anything they
just kind of leave them blank because

646
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,170
just kind of leave them blank because
 

647
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,630
just kind of leave them blank because
it's more about building a big structure

648
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:16,640
it's more about building a big structure
 

649
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,670
it's more about building a big structure
than it is about fine-tuning it

650
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:18,680
than it is about fine-tuning it
 

651
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,590
than it is about fine-tuning it
yes but I thought it would be cool to

652
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:20,600
yes but I thought it would be cool to
 

653
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,320
yes but I thought it would be cool to
make it like a redstone Museum castle so

654
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,330
make it like a redstone Museum castle so
 

655
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,269
make it like a redstone Museum castle so
all the empty rooms we'll put like a

656
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
all the empty rooms we'll put like a
 

657
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,590
all the empty rooms we'll put like a
redstone device in like what do you call

658
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:32,600
redstone device in like what do you call
 

659
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,500
redstone device in like what do you call
it an exhibit hey like it'll be one for

660
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,510
it an exhibit hey like it'll be one for
 

661
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,639
it an exhibit hey like it'll be one for
for probably while there's probably

662
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:39,649
for probably while there's probably
 

663
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:40,960
for probably while there's probably
gonna be like ten or twenty forty

664
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:40,970
gonna be like ten or twenty forty
 

665
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,139
gonna be like ten or twenty forty
flip-flops and a little description for

666
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:44,149
flip-flops and a little description for
 

667
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,019
flip-flops and a little description for
each one how it works and that will I

668
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:47,029
each one how it works and that will I
 

669
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:48,970
each one how it works and that will I
think that'd be like a cool way of

670
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:48,980
think that'd be like a cool way of
 

671
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,600
think that'd be like a cool way of
teaching people redstone and also as a

672
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:51,610
teaching people redstone and also as a
 

673
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,060
teaching people redstone and also as a
sort of a reference for myself because

674
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,070
sort of a reference for myself because
 

675
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,410
sort of a reference for myself because
there's lots of different designs for

676
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:56,420
there's lots of different designs for
 

677
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,460
there's lots of different designs for
stuff that I often forget about so if I

678
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,470
stuff that I often forget about so if I
 

679
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,460
stuff that I often forget about so if I
have a master reference to redstone

680
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,470
have a master reference to redstone
 

681
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,960
have a master reference to redstone
devices somewhere that would be pretty

682
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:04,970
devices somewhere that would be pretty
 

683
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,710
devices somewhere that would be pretty
cool

684
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:05,720
cool
 

685
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,860
cool
Oh that last one was important that's

686
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:11,870
Oh that last one was important that's
 

687
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,699
Oh that last one was important that's
another idea been wanting to do some

688
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:15,709
another idea been wanting to do some
 

689
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,650
another idea been wanting to do some
stuff with the horses and and like

690
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:17,660
stuff with the horses and and like
 

691
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,210
stuff with the horses and and like
donkeys and stuff like build a stable

692
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:22,220
donkeys and stuff like build a stable
 

693
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,449
donkeys and stuff like build a stable

I think there was a few other ideas I

702
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,460
I think there was a few other ideas I
 

703
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,250
I think there was a few other ideas I
can't quite recall right now because I'm

704
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,260
can't quite recall right now because I'm
 

705
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,710
can't quite recall right now because I'm
recording and like I said people kind of

706
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:41,720
recording and like I said people kind of
 

707
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,380
recording and like I said people kind of
get a little dumb when they're recording

708
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,390
get a little dumb when they're recording
 

709
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,520
get a little dumb when they're recording
just a little bit not not super dumb but

710

we need more red die so this spider farm

730
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
we need more red die so this spider farm
 

731
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,280
we need more red die so this spider farm
I had like sixty for hoppers underneath

732
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,290
I had like sixty for hoppers underneath
 

733
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,650
I had like sixty for hoppers underneath
and the spiders are falling down and and

734
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:23,660
and the spiders are falling down and and
 

735
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,870
and the spiders are falling down and and
dying on the hoppers but that is just so

736
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:25,880
dying on the hoppers but that is just so
 

737
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,790
dying on the hoppers but that is just so
wasteful I want to I want to reclaim

738
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:27,800
wasteful I want to I want to reclaim
 

739
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,780
wasteful I want to I want to reclaim
these hoppers there's another rep like

740
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:31,790
these hoppers there's another rep like
 

741
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,600
these hoppers there's another rep like
exact same

742
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:32,610
exact same
 

743
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,549
exact same
copy of this farm like a little further

744
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
copy of this farm like a little further
 

745
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,789
copy of this farm like a little further
over there - I think I think we I have

746
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:37,799
over there - I think I think we I have
 

747
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,760
over there - I think I think we I have
it set up where you can see it if we go

748
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:40,770
it set up where you can see it if we go
 

749
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,039
it set up where you can see it if we go
back out I've made that ender pearl

750
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,049
back out I've made that ender pearl
 

751
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,070
back out I've made that ender pearl
throw lots of times by the way yeah over

752
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
throw lots of times by the way yeah over
 

753
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,320
throw lots of times by the way yeah over
there there's another one so we're going

754
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,330
there there's another one so we're going
 

755
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,030
there there's another one so we're going
to get rid of the hoppers and instead we

756
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,040
to get rid of the hoppers and instead we
 

757
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,840
to get rid of the hoppers and instead we
are going to did we're gonna set up a

758
00:18:59,840 --> 00:18:59,850
are going to did we're gonna set up a
 

759
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,500
are going to did we're gonna set up a
hopper minecart that goes around so the

760
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,510
hopper minecart that goes around so the
 

761
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,890
hopper minecart that goes around so the
whole base here I'm gonna change ooh

762
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:06,900
whole base here I'm gonna change ooh
 

763
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,120
whole base here I'm gonna change ooh
that's not a chest wait wait I want that

764
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,130
that's not a chest wait wait I want that
 

765
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:17,060
that's not a chest wait wait I want that
back yeah we'll have a hopper minecart

766
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,070
back yeah we'll have a hopper minecart
 

767
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,650
back yeah we'll have a hopper minecart
and we're gonna make it trigger we'll

768
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:18,660
and we're gonna make it trigger we'll
 

769
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,000
and we're gonna make it trigger we'll
probably set up like some trip wires

770
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,010
probably set up like some trip wires
 

771
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,980
probably set up like some trip wires
that when the spiders fall down they

772
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:21,990
that when the spiders fall down they
 

773
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,750
that when the spiders fall down they
activate it and that tells the hopper

774
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
activate it and that tells the hopper
 

775
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,780
activate it and that tells the hopper
minecart to go pick up the string and

776
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:26,790
minecart to go pick up the string and
 

777
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,549
minecart to go pick up the string and
then when it gets the other end it stops

778
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
then when it gets the other end it stops
 

779
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,010
then when it gets the other end it stops
until they fall down and trigger the

780
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,020
until they fall down and trigger the
 

781
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,720
until they fall down and trigger the
trip wires again that way it's not

782
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:32,730
trip wires again that way it's not
 

783
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,340
trip wires again that way it's not
always running when it doesn't need to

784
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,350
always running when it doesn't need to
 

785
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,230
always running when it doesn't need to
be I really don't like having clocks

786
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
be I really don't like having clocks
 

787
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,480
be I really don't like having clocks
running in my world um so that should

788
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:41,490
running in my world um so that should
 

789
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,299
running in my world um so that should
work out pretty good I think and then

790
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:43,309
work out pretty good I think and then
 

791
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,680
work out pretty good I think and then
kind of need to set up some way of

792
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:45,690
kind of need to set up some way of
 

793
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,590
kind of need to set up some way of
bringing the string from down here up

794

it'll take it to the Nexus to the main

802
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,070
it'll take it to the Nexus to the main
 

803

that's gonna be a tough project for me
 

809
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,150
that's gonna be a tough project for me
to start though because I need to gather

it's just well I do kinda know why like

818
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:22,590
it's just well I do kinda know why like
 

819
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,580
it's just well I do kinda know why like
it goes well oh that was I made it dark

820
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:25,590
it goes well oh that was I made it dark
 

821
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,880
it goes well oh that was I made it dark
goes really well with like redstone

822
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:28,890
goes really well with like redstone
 

823
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,260
goes really well with like redstone
blocks like out of all the all the

824

these normally stand out just terribly

828
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,230

 

829
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,650

we're gonna be using power rails for

830
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:42,660
we're gonna be using power rails for
 

831
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,720
we're gonna be using power rails for
most of it because we have a gold farm

832
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:44,730
most of it because we have a gold farm
 

833
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,890
most of it because we have a gold farm
now

834
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:45,900
now
 

835
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,440
now
and that is one of the awesome things

836
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,450
and that is one of the awesome things
 

837
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,300
and that is one of the awesome things
about having a gold farm

838

when you can make gold power rails for

842
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,020
when you can make gold power rails for
 

843
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,560
when you can make gold power rails for
pretty much free so I think I'm just

844
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:00,570
pretty much free so I think I'm just
 

845
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,180
pretty much free so I think I'm just
gonna do a pretty wasteful I should have

846
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,190
gonna do a pretty wasteful I should have
 

847
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,890
gonna do a pretty wasteful I should have
brought some real tracks with me cuz I'm

848
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:06,900
brought some real tracks with me cuz I'm
 

849
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,600

down and then to power it put redstone

854
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:16,620
down and then to power it put redstone
 

855
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,280
down and then to power it put redstone
blocks below in places and it'll power

856
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,290
blocks below in places and it'll power
 

857
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:25,700
blocks below in places and it'll power
up the whole line wait for it wait for

858
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:25,710
up the whole line wait for it wait for
 

859
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,450
up the whole line wait for it wait for
it

860
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,460
it
 

861
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,220

I love the explosion when they hit the

862
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,230
I love the explosion when they hit the
 

863
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,760
I love the explosion when they hit the
ground that looks so cool okay we got

864
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:34,770
ground that looks so cool okay we got
 

865
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,710
ground that looks so cool okay we got
the tracks down there's two ends to it

866
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
the tracks down there's two ends to it
 

867
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
the tracks down there's two ends to it
that I haven't done anything with yet

868
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,490
that I haven't done anything with yet
 

869
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:44,810
that I haven't done anything with yet
let's hit on down got him I made it go

870
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:44,820
let's hit on down got him I made it go
 

871
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,790
let's hit on down got him I made it go
this way just cuz that's that's the

872
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:46,800
this way just cuz that's that's the
 

873
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
this way just cuz that's that's the
natural way the tracks from connecting

874
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,330
natural way the tracks from connecting
 

875
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,090
natural way the tracks from connecting
it with it was a lot less trouble that

876
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,100
it with it was a lot less trouble that
 

877
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,450
it with it was a lot less trouble that
way so all we really needed to do this

878
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:53,460
way so all we really needed to do this
 

879
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,610
way so all we really needed to do this
should be pretty simple maybe we'll put

880
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:58,620
should be pretty simple maybe we'll put
 

881
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,240
should be pretty simple maybe we'll put
them at head level above head level yeah

882
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,250
them at head level above head level yeah
 

883
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:11,080
them at head level above head level yeah
yeah let's Oh what do we have here

884
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,090
yeah let's Oh what do we have here
 

885
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,010
yeah let's Oh what do we have here

gonna I'm gonna head back up sorry for

954
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,090
gonna I'm gonna head back up sorry for
 

955
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,530
gonna I'm gonna head back up sorry for
the detour trip down memory lane here

956
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:49,540

 

957
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,150

okay like I was saying before I got

958
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,160
okay like I was saying before I got
 

959
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,100
okay like I was saying before I got
distracted we're gonna be putting trip

960
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,110
distracted we're gonna be putting trip
 

961
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,250
distracted we're gonna be putting trip
wires on each of the sides here I think

962
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,260
wires on each of the sides here I think
 

963
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,330
wires on each of the sides here I think
just four four per side is enough we're

964
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:01,340
just four four per side is enough we're
 

965
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,670
just four four per side is enough we're
really covering 50% of the area here so

966
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:03,680
really covering 50% of the area here so
 

967
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,150
really covering 50% of the area here so
a spider has a 50-50 chance I think at

968
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,160
a spider has a 50-50 chance I think at
 

969
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,140
a spider has a 50-50 chance I think at
least of triggering

970
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,150
least of triggering
 

971
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,720
least of triggering
this when it falls down and since lots

972
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:10,730
this when it falls down and since lots
 

973
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,040
this when it falls down and since lots
of spiders are gonna be falling down

974
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,050
of spiders are gonna be falling down
 

975
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,650
of spiders are gonna be falling down
that's his pretty good odds that they

976
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:14,660
that's his pretty good odds that they
 

977
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,420
that's his pretty good odds that they
are gonna activate this with with only

978
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,430
are gonna activate this with with only
 

979
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,460
are gonna activate this with with only
four all right I think that go get out

980
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,470
four all right I think that go get out
 

981
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,010
four all right I think that go get out
of here torch nobody likes you do that

982
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:26,020
of here torch nobody likes you do that
 

983
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,690
of here torch nobody likes you do that
okay this that's how you play strength

984
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:31,700

 

985
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,500

oh we're shorts good thing we're right

986
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:35,510
oh we're shorts good thing we're right
 

987
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,860
oh we're shorts good thing we're right
by a string farm how perfect is that

988
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:40,870
by a string farm how perfect is that
 

989
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:46,510
by a string farm how perfect is that
there we go okay I'm gonna put stairs in

990
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,520
there we go okay I'm gonna put stairs in
 

991
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,030
there we go okay I'm gonna put stairs in
here just these still work right yeah I

992
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,040
here just these still work right yeah I
 

993
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,280
here just these still work right yeah I
never know I always get confused if you

994
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,290
never know I always get confused if you
 

995
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,990
never know I always get confused if you
have a solid block trip wires don't work

996
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,000
have a solid block trip wires don't work
 

997
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,780
have a solid block trip wires don't work
underneath but if it's a transparent one

998
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:01,790
underneath but if it's a transparent one
 

999
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,200
underneath but if it's a transparent one
it does still actually over here we're

1000
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,210
it does still actually over here we're
 

1001
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,270
it does still actually over here we're
gonna dig this out okay so spider falls

1002
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,280
gonna dig this out okay so spider falls
 

1003
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,630
gonna dig this out okay so spider falls
down hits the tripwire have a line of

1004
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:13,640
down hits the tripwire have a line of
 

1005
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,040
down hits the tripwire have a line of
redstone under here maybe

1006
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,050
redstone under here maybe
 

1007
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,260
redstone under here maybe
so the any one of them will activate

1008
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,270
so the any one of them will activate
 

1009
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,380
so the any one of them will activate
this this redstone and then we just need

1010
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,390

 

1011
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:30,550

power rails at the ends here and just

1012
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:30,560
power rails at the ends here and just
 

1013
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,790
power rails at the ends here and just
connect this I'm gonna have to wreck my

1014
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:33,800
connect this I'm gonna have to wreck my
 

1015
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,530
connect this I'm gonna have to wreck my
design though if I do that that's

1016
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:35,540
design though if I do that that's
 

1017
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,790
design though if I do that that's
terrible

1018
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:38,800

 

1019
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,880

alright regular track just we'll have to

1020
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:42,890
alright regular track just we'll have to
 

1021
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,280
alright regular track just we'll have to
move the redstone block over here that's

1022
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,290
move the redstone block over here that's
 

1023
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:52,120
move the redstone block over here that's
okay so spider falls down that gets

1024
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,130
okay so spider falls down that gets
 

1025
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,520
okay so spider falls down that gets
activated the spider falls down here

1026
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:54,530
activated the spider falls down here
 

1027
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,750
activated the spider falls down here
still gets activated that should

1028
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:58,760
still gets activated that should
 

1029
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,370
still gets activated that should
probably be a hopper below actually

1030
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:00,380
probably be a hopper below actually
 

1031
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,080
probably be a hopper below actually
because we're gonna be taking the string

1032
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,090
because we're gonna be taking the string
 

1033
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,970
because we're gonna be taking the string
out of the hopper minecarts same it's

1034
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:06,980
out of the hopper minecarts same it's
 

1035
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,060
out of the hopper minecarts same it's
over here

1036
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,070
over here
 

1037
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:15,310
over here
get that over in there place it good

1038
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:15,320
get that over in there place it good
 

1039
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,110
get that over in there place it good
good

1040
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,120
good
 

1041
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,000
good
anyway you get the idea it's pretty

1042
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,010
anyway you get the idea it's pretty
 

1043
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,460
anyway you get the idea it's pretty
simple

1044
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,470

 

1045
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,910

wait I did that wrong okay maybe he's a

1046
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:25,920
wait I did that wrong okay maybe he's a
 

1047
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,560
wait I did that wrong okay maybe he's a
little more complex than that that I'm

1048
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:27,570
little more complex than that that I'm
 

1049
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,510
little more complex than that that I'm
letting it out to be now it's it's

1050
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520
letting it out to be now it's it's
 

1051
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,740
letting it out to be now it's it's
really simple

1052
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:32,750

 

1053
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:41,080

poppers just about done here

1054
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,090

 

1055
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:47,630

power real perfect and now that we got

1056
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:47,640
power real perfect and now that we got
 

1057
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,190
power real perfect and now that we got
the hoppers let's make a hopper minecart

1058
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
the hoppers let's make a hopper minecart
 

1059
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,140
the hoppers let's make a hopper minecart
and test this out and I'm gonna put

1060
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,150
and test this out and I'm gonna put
 

1061
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,730
and test this out and I'm gonna put
chests and stuff underneath as you can

1062
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:55,740
chests and stuff underneath as you can
 

1063
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,670
chests and stuff underneath as you can
imagine all right hopefully when the

1064
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:58,680
imagine all right hopefully when the
 

1065
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,050
imagine all right hopefully when the
spiders fall down they don't land on

1066
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,060
spiders fall down they don't land on
 

1067
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,220
spiders fall down they don't land on
these chests I'm gonna remove the

1068
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,230
these chests I'm gonna remove the
 

1069
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,130
these chests I'm gonna remove the
torches when this is all done too

1070
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,140
torches when this is all done too
 

1071
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,620
torches when this is all done too
obviously

1072
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:05,630
obviously
 

1073
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,080
obviously
well maybe maybe not all the torches but

1074
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,090
well maybe maybe not all the torches but
 

1075
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,640
well maybe maybe not all the torches but
I'll light it up so that the torches

1076
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:10,650
I'll light it up so that the torches
 

1077
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,680
I'll light it up so that the torches
don't affect the spawner up there even

1078
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:12,690
don't affect the spawner up there even
 

1079
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,390
don't affect the spawner up there even
though they probably don't right now

1080
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:14,400
though they probably don't right now
 

1081
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:21,410
though they probably don't right now
anyway all right spiders show your ugly

1082
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:21,420
anyway all right spiders show your ugly
 

1083
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:28,190
anyway all right spiders show your ugly
faces oh that's not good wait how did

1084
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:28,200
faces oh that's not good wait how did
 

1085
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,170
faces oh that's not good wait how did
they land that none of the tripwires

1086
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:30,180
they land that none of the tripwires
 

1087
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,970
they land that none of the tripwires
activated that was surprising there's

1088
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:34,980
activated that was surprising there's
 

1089
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,300
activated that was surprising there's
one right there

1090
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:37,310
one right there
 

1091
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,500
one right there
did they fall through the tripwire

1092
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:39,510
did they fall through the tripwire
 

1093
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:48,610
did they fall through the tripwire
without activating it man come on I

1094
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:48,620
without activating it man come on I
 

1095
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,790
without activating it man come on I
think you must be falling too fast and

1096
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:52,800
think you must be falling too fast and
 

1097
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,020
think you must be falling too fast and
they're falling through it is that

1098
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,030
they're falling through it is that
 

1099
00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:00,560
they're falling through it is that
possible let's try one more time

1100
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:00,570

 

1101
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:11,029

should work come on spiders and you day

1102
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
should work come on spiders and you day
 

1103
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,180
should work come on spiders and you day
now oh it's spinning its spinning this

1104
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,190
now oh it's spinning its spinning this
 

1105
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,099
now oh it's spinning its spinning this
water above here is unnecessary by the

1106
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:16,109
water above here is unnecessary by the
 

1107
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,629
water above here is unnecessary by the
way I just kind of left that because it

1108
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:17,639
way I just kind of left that because it
 

1109
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,769
way I just kind of left that because it
was there from before

1110
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:18,779
was there from before
 

1111
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:22,669
was there from before
ouch yes still in inactivated did I do

1112
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:22,679
ouch yes still in inactivated did I do
 

1113
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:29,739
ouch yes still in inactivated did I do
something wrong down here hmm

1117
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,649
that is really surprising yeah I might
have to move these up higher so that

1118
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:42,659
have to move these up higher so that
 

1119
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,119
have to move these up higher so that
they're not falling as fast I think

1120
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,129
they're not falling as fast I think
 

1121
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:45,439
they're not falling as fast I think
they're falling too quick in there

1122

they're falling too quick in there
 

1123
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:46,849
they're falling too quick in there
they're passing through without

1124
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:46,859
they're passing through without
 

1125
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:52,009
they're passing through without
activating them okay I think it'll work

1126
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:52,019
activating them okay I think it'll work
 

1127
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,009
activating them okay I think it'll work
this time otherwise I quit guys can't

1128
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:55,019
this time otherwise I quit guys can't
 

1129
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,689
this time otherwise I quit guys can't
handle it anymore

1130
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:56,699
handle it anymore
 

1131
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:59,059

there is redstone underneath this side
 

1133
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:01,789
there is redstone underneath this side
of the trip wires and those it comes

1134
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:01,799
of the trip wires and those it comes
 

1135
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,879
of the trip wires and those it comes
down to each side here so it powers up

1136
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:04,889
down to each side here so it powers up
 

1137
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:09,819
down to each side here so it powers up
the power rail from over here mm-hmm and

1138
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:09,829
the power rail from over here mm-hmm and
 

1139
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:12,199
the power rail from over here mm-hmm and
does the same on the other side too so

1140
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:12,209
does the same on the other side too so

they're falling like in the right place

1192
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:51,960

1195
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,910
they're just passing through it without
activating it for some reason it's

1196
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:58,920
activating it for some reason it's
 

1197
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,740
activating it for some reason it's
because it well I know why it's because

1198
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:00,750
because it well I know why it's because

1205
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,970
with the tripwire hitbox so I think they
can pass through it pretty easily okay

1206

areas of land but like there was a cape
 

1275
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,550
areas of land but like there was a cape
that went here and I made it straights

1276
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:29,560
that went here and I made it straights
 

1277
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,220
that went here and I made it straights
for example it used to be pretty pretty

1278
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,230
for example it used to be pretty pretty
 

1279
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,970
for example it used to be pretty pretty
rough around here so this using the cave

1280
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:35,980
rough around here so this using the cave
 

1281
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,700
rough around here so this using the cave
the original team shape sort of a

1282
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:38,710
the original team shape sort of a
 

1283
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,590
the original team shape sort of a
guideline to help me decide how to build

1284
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:40,600
guideline to help me decide how to build
 

1285
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,490
guideline to help me decide how to build
things and it has resulted in a pretty

1286
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:44,500
things and it has resulted in a pretty
 

1287
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,830
things and it has resulted in a pretty
good looking

1288
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:46,840
good looking
 

1289
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,990
good looking
basse I would say especially this area I

1290
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,000
basse I would say especially this area I
 

1291
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,850
basse I would say especially this area I
really like like there's lots of

1292
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:50,860
really like like there's lots of
 

1293
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,980
really like like there's lots of
elevation changes and stuff I would not

1294
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:52,990
elevation changes and stuff I would not
 

1295
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,440
elevation changes and stuff I would not
have thought of doing this like in this

1296
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,450
have thought of doing this like in this
 

1297
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,830
have thought of doing this like in this
shape if it was a meat is building

1298
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:58,840
shape if it was a meat is building
 

1299
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,810
shape if it was a meat is building
normally somewhere it's because this is

1300
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:00,820
normally somewhere it's because this is
 

1301
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,520
normally somewhere it's because this is
the shape the cave was and I just

1302
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:04,530

 

1303
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,140

adjusted it a little bit to make it work

1304
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,150
adjusted it a little bit to make it work
 

1305
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:13,440
adjusted it a little bit to make it work
I guess so yeah little adjustments here

1306
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,450
I guess so yeah little adjustments here
 

1307
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,630
I guess so yeah little adjustments here
and there again this this was not

1308
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:15,640
and there again this this was not
 

1309
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,730
and there again this this was not
straight like this for sure it was

1310
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:17,740
straight like this for sure it was
 

1311
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:23,790
straight like this for sure it was
pretty rough and I think I dug a ton of

1312
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:23,800
pretty rough and I think I dug a ton of
 

1313
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,720
pretty rough and I think I dug a ton of
this outand yeah you know there's just

1314
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:26,730
this outand yeah you know there's just
 

1315
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,610
this outand yeah you know there's just
some things it's not too bad if it's

1316
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:29,620
some things it's not too bad if it's
 

1317
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,770
some things it's not too bad if it's
man-made especially if you try and make

1318
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:31,780
man-made especially if you try and make
 

1319
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,290
man-made especially if you try and make
it a little natural like but add

1320
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:34,300
it a little natural like but add
 

1321
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,930
it a little natural like but add
randomness to it like like I did here I

1322
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:36,940
randomness to it like like I did here I
 

1323
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,520
randomness to it like like I did here I
think helps but yeah that's that's

1324
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,530
think helps but yeah that's that's
 

1325
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,170
think helps but yeah that's that's
computed for this episode some other

1326
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,180
computed for this episode some other
 

1327
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,790
computed for this episode some other
things some other rules with the man

1328
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:44,800
things some other rules with the man
 

1329
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,610
things some other rules with the man
cave of course is not to use torches and

1330
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:47,620
cave of course is not to use torches and
 

1331
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,790
cave of course is not to use torches and
finished areas so like you can tell here

1332
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
finished areas so like you can tell here
 

1333
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,350
finished areas so like you can tell here
is not a finished area because there's

1334
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:52,360
is not a finished area because there's
 

1335
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,200
is not a finished area because there's
torches everywhere while over here it's

1336
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,210
torches everywhere while over here it's
 

1337
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,670
torches everywhere while over here it's
it's a lot better and I think there's a

1338
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:02,680
it's a lot better and I think there's a
 

1339
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,150
it's a lot better and I think there's a
few other rules I had with this anyway

1340
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,160
few other rules I had with this anyway
 

1341
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,860
few other rules I had with this anyway
that's that's it for today's episode
