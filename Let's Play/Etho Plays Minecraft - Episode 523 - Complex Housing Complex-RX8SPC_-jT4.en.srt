00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,780
just that one spot
yeah so I've been changing all this out

54
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:23,790
yeah so I've been changing all this out
 

55
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,510
yeah so I've been changing all this out
with the green clay so that it looks

56
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
with the green clay so that it looks
 

57
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,450
with the green clay so that it looks
green through the leaves you know some

58
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,460
green through the leaves you know some
 

59
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,120
green through the leaves you know some
minor little thing change this all out

60
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,130
minor little thing change this all out
 

61
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,679
minor little thing change this all out
and I guess we're gonna prepare that red

62
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:33,689
and I guess we're gonna prepare that red
 

63
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,370
and I guess we're gonna prepare that red
stone I think that's our nighttime song

64
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:37,380
stone I think that's our nighttime song
 

65
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,460
stone I think that's our nighttime song
our daytime song over there go check it

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,470
our daytime song over there go check it
 

67
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:48,770
our daytime song over there go check it
out yeah so this we broke this right so

68
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:48,780
out yeah so this we broke this right so
 

69
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,410
out yeah so this we broke this right so
it must have been here but that doesn't

70
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,420
it must have been here but that doesn't
 

71
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,399
it must have been here but that doesn't
make any sense

72
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,409
make any sense
 

73
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,230
make any sense
oh I think it was so that this red stone

74
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,240
oh I think it was so that this red stone
 

75
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,359
oh I think it was so that this red stone
doesn't point at this block cuz if it

76
00:01:59,359 --> 00:01:59,369
doesn't point at this block cuz if it
 

77
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,510
doesn't point at this block cuz if it
does it messes this up uh-huh yeah so a

78
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
does it messes this up uh-huh yeah so a
 

79
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,280
does it messes this up uh-huh yeah so a
major renovation on the man cave today

80
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,290
major renovation on the man cave today
 

81
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,770
major renovation on the man cave today
but it's gonna be barely noticeable like

82
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:06,780
but it's gonna be barely noticeable like
 

83
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,719
but it's gonna be barely noticeable like
a lot of it is very subtle things like

84
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:08,729
a lot of it is very subtle things like
 

85
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,290
a lot of it is very subtle things like
look at this for example this has been a

86
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,300
look at this for example this has been a
 

87
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,940
look at this for example this has been a
dispenser forever but now in this

88
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:13,950
dispenser forever but now in this
 

89
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,589
dispenser forever but now in this
updates you can shear sheep

90
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
updates you can shear sheep
 

91
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,869
updates you can shear sheep
automatically by putting shears in a

92
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
automatically by putting shears in a
 

93
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,270
automatically by putting shears in a
dispenser so this doesn't eject them

94
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
dispenser so this doesn't eject them
 

95
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,630
dispenser so this doesn't eject them
anymore so we gotta change it cuz it's

96
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:23,640
anymore so we gotta change it cuz it's
 

97
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,610
anymore so we gotta change it cuz it's
broken

98
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:24,620
broken
 

99
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,830
broken
put a dropper there instead and

100
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
put a dropper there instead and
 

101
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,869
put a dropper there instead and
everything is back to normal just the

102
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:29,879
everything is back to normal just the
 

103
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,729
everything is back to normal just the
way we want it

104
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:30,739
way we want it
 

105
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,780
way we want it
uh-huh yeah so we'll just run through

106
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:32,790
uh-huh yeah so we'll just run through
 

107
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,160
uh-huh yeah so we'll just run through
the man cave here real quickly I'll show

108
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,170
the man cave here real quickly I'll show
 

109
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,870
the man cave here real quickly I'll show
you some of the subtle changes that have

110
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:35,880
you some of the subtle changes that have
 

111
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,449
you some of the subtle changes that have
occurred like for example we got a stone

112
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:38,459
occurred like for example we got a stone
 

113
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,300
occurred like for example we got a stone
cutter over here by the window now

114
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,310
cutter over here by the window now
 

115
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,890
cutter over here by the window now
because kind of like crafting tables and

116
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:42,900
because kind of like crafting tables and
 

117
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,750
because kind of like crafting tables and
enderchest it's just some machine we'll

118
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:44,760
enderchest it's just some machine we'll
 

119
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,759
enderchest it's just some machine we'll
probably use a lot so kind of want to

120
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:46,769
probably use a lot so kind of want to
 

121
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,680
probably use a lot so kind of want to
want them around every so often in your

122
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:48,690
want them around every so often in your
 

123
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,589
want them around every so often in your
vases I think the big thing though

124
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
vases I think the big thing though
 

125
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,259
vases I think the big thing though
remember we can't shine lighting through

126
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:54,269
remember we can't shine lighting through
 

127
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,809
remember we can't shine lighting through
Pistons anymore so we had to hide a

128
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:56,819
Pistons anymore so we had to hide a
 

129
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,250
Pistons anymore so we had to hide a
whole bunch of lighting through the

130
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,260
whole bunch of lighting through the
 

131
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,960
whole bunch of lighting through the
Manteo that's the big change it occurred

132
00:02:59,960 --> 00:02:59,970
Manteo that's the big change it occurred
 

133
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,559
Manteo that's the big change it occurred
here so I got a lantern there one of the

134
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:03,569
here so I got a lantern there one of the
 

135
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,130
here so I got a lantern there one of the
big tricks I used is I found out you can

136
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,140
big tricks I used is I found out you can
 

137
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,979
big tricks I used is I found out you can
shine lighting through compost bins for

138
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:09,989
shine lighting through compost bins for
 

139
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,350
shine lighting through compost bins for
some reason so this glowstone wasn't

140
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:12,360
some reason so this glowstone wasn't
 

141
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,640
some reason so this glowstone wasn't
here before right

142
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:13,650
here before right
 

143
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,220
here before right
it only seems to work with composter

144
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,230
it only seems to work with composter
 

145
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,420
it only seems to work with composter
though like it doesn't work with the

146
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,430
though like it doesn't work with the
 

147
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,640
though like it doesn't work with the
Stonecutters you can't shine it through

148
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:19,650
Stonecutters you can't shine it through
 

149
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,979
Stonecutters you can't shine it through
like enchanting tables anymore but these

150
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:21,989
like enchanting tables anymore but these
 

151
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,490
like enchanting tables anymore but these
for some reason hopefully they don't

152
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,500
for some reason hopefully they don't
 

153
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,520
for some reason hopefully they don't
change that but remember we used to have

154
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,530
change that but remember we used to have
 

155
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,500
change that but remember we used to have
Pistons like all along the wood all over

156
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,510
Pistons like all along the wood all over
 

157
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,330
Pistons like all along the wood all over
the place right those are those are all

158
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,340
the place right those are those are all
 

159
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,090
the place right those are those are all
gone now I've hidden lighting in a few

160
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,100
gone now I've hidden lighting in a few
 

161
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,390
gone now I've hidden lighting in a few
other clever ways like behind paintings

162
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:37,400
other clever ways like behind paintings
 

163
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,150
other clever ways like behind paintings
and pretty much got rid of all the dark

164
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,160
and pretty much got rid of all the dark
 

165
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,479
and pretty much got rid of all the dark
spots I think in our man cave now added

166
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:44,489
spots I think in our man cave now added
 

167
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,520
spots I think in our man cave now added
a painting here with lighting behind and

168
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,530
a painting here with lighting behind and
 

169
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,550
a painting here with lighting behind and
I abuse the compost thing all Lots and

170
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,560
I abuse the compost thing all Lots and
 

171
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,069
I abuse the compost thing all Lots and
they're kind of all over the place and

172
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:52,079
they're kind of all over the place and
 

173
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,819
they're kind of all over the place and
even with those you can use them like

174
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:55,829
even with those you can use them like
 

175
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,210
even with those you can use them like
for walls and it's actually not like a

176
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,220
for walls and it's actually not like a
 

177
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,270
for walls and it's actually not like a
bad looking texture right so we got

178
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,280
bad looking texture right so we got
 

179
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,030
bad looking texture right so we got
three compost bins here and lighting

180
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
three compost bins here and lighting
 

181
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,150
three compost bins here and lighting
underneath kind of cool kind of cool

182
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,160
underneath kind of cool kind of cool
 

183
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,069
underneath kind of cool kind of cool
added some extra decorative things

184
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:13,079
added some extra decorative things
 

185
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,240
added some extra decorative things
around the place too like we got a

186
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,250
around the place too like we got a
 

187
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,029
around the place too like we got a
bamboo shoot there now and just very

188
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,039
bamboo shoot there now and just very
 

189
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,750
bamboo shoot there now and just very
minor subtle things added a lot of

190
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:20,760
minor subtle things added a lot of
 

191
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,190
minor subtle things added a lot of
lighting above here because we used to

192
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,200
lighting above here because we used to
 

193
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,990
lighting above here because we used to
have pistons all on the floor got rid of

194
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
have pistons all on the floor got rid of
 

195
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,890
have pistons all on the floor got rid of
all those had some bushes in here

196
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:29,900

 

197
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,670

more compost bins hiding lighting and oh

198
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680
more compost bins hiding lighting and oh
 

199
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,410
more compost bins hiding lighting and oh
yeah one one other big thing up over

200
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:36,420
yeah one one other big thing up over
 

201
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,930
yeah one one other big thing up over
here we didn't have any leaves here

202
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:38,940
here we didn't have any leaves here
 

203
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,490
here we didn't have any leaves here
before and I added them in and put

204
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,500
before and I added them in and put
 

205
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,860
before and I added them in and put
lighting underneath them and again

206
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:42,870
lighting underneath them and again
 

207
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,010
lighting underneath them and again
another compost bin okay

208
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,020
another compost bin okay
 

209
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,640
another compost bin okay
is this so good so easy that's about it

210
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:49,650
is this so good so easy that's about it
 

211
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,320
is this so good so easy that's about it
couple changes over here too like we

212
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,330
couple changes over here too like we
 

213
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,880
couple changes over here too like we
have a dark spot here forever and it's

214
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:52,890
have a dark spot here forever and it's
 

215
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,370
have a dark spot here forever and it's
gone finally because I hit some lighting

216
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,380
gone finally because I hit some lighting
 

217
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,760
gone finally because I hit some lighting
under the leaves here well you know what

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:10,770
are you gonna finish building the Nexus
 

229
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,010
are you gonna finish building the Nexus
it's a bit of an eyesore doesn't look so

230

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:20,790
we're actually starting a new project
 

237
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,700
we're actually starting a new project
today right by the Nexus so we have like

238
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:25,710
today right by the Nexus so we have like
 

239
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,340
today right by the Nexus so we have like
this big grass field here and I kind of

240
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,350
this big grass field here and I kind of
 

241
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,090
this big grass field here and I kind of
want to build a village here a few

want to build a village here a few
 

243
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,280
want to build a village here a few
episodes ago we did that thing where we

244
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,290
episodes ago we did that thing where we
 

245
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,820
episodes ago we did that thing where we
renovated a village mostly because I

246
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:37,830
renovated a village mostly because I
 

247
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,020
renovated a village mostly because I
wanted to get an idea of how the

248
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,030
wanted to get an idea of how the
 

249
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,120
wanted to get an idea of how the
villages work but honestly I wanted to

250
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,130
villages work but honestly I wanted to
 

251
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,250
villages work but honestly I wanted to

that's what we're doing today so this is
 

255
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,730
that's what we're doing today so this is
the block scheme you guys are wondering

256
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:49,740
the block scheme you guys are wondering
 

257
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,200
the block scheme you guys are wondering
if this is a joke or if I'm actually

258
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,210
if this is a joke or if I'm actually
 

259
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,580
if this is a joke or if I'm actually
gonna work on the Nexus now we're not

260
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:52,590
gonna work on the Nexus now we're not
 

261
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,900
gonna work on the Nexus now we're not
working out of the Nexus we're doing

262
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:53,910
working out of the Nexus we're doing
 

263
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,780
working out of the Nexus we're doing
this this is the block scheme I want to

264
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:56,790
this this is the block scheme I want to
 

265
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,960
this this is the block scheme I want to
use so dark oak wood with brick four

266
00:05:59,960 --> 00:05:59,970
use so dark oak wood with brick four
 

267
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,400
use so dark oak wood with brick four
walls and prismarine for the shingles on

268
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,410
walls and prismarine for the shingles on
 

269
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,080
walls and prismarine for the shingles on
the roof I think would look very nice

270
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,090
the roof I think would look very nice
 

271
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,560
the roof I think would look very nice
and some path blocks oh look at it guys

272
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:09,570
and some path blocks oh look at it guys
 

273
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,990
and some path blocks oh look at it guys
it's a winning winning color scheme I

274
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
it's a winning winning color scheme I
 

275
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
it's a winning winning color scheme I
tell you what's I've been wanting to use

276
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,410
tell you what's I've been wanting to use
 

277
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,430
tell you what's I've been wanting to use
it for a long time and we're gonna build

278
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,440
it for a long time and we're gonna build
 

279
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,920
it for a long time and we're gonna build
it I just starting around here we want

280
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:18,930
it I just starting around here we want
 

281
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,510
it I just starting around here we want
to make it so we can connect it to this

282
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,520
to make it so we can connect it to this
 

283
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,180
to make it so we can connect it to this
path that comes by here and then

284
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,190
path that comes by here and then
 

285
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,500
path that comes by here and then
probably around here is where we're

286
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,510
probably around here is where we're
 

287
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,150
probably around here is where we're
gonna want to start our first house and

288
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,160
gonna want to start our first house and
 

289
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,850
gonna want to start our first house and
kind of expand out this way yeah so the

290
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:34,860
kind of expand out this way yeah so the
 

291
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,780
kind of expand out this way yeah so the
plan is let's grab our dark oak here

292
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:38,790
plan is let's grab our dark oak here
 

293
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,720
plan is let's grab our dark oak here
Wi-Fi start building

294
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:40,730
Wi-Fi start building
 

295
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,970
Wi-Fi start building
it's really hard to build while talking

296
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:42,980
it's really hard to build while talking
 

297
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,280
it's really hard to build while talking
I gotta tell you guys this but I'll try

298
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,290
I gotta tell you guys this but I'll try
 

299
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,960
I gotta tell you guys this but I'll try
yeah so like kind of like we figured out

300
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:49,970
yeah so like kind of like we figured out
 

301
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,130
yeah so like kind of like we figured out
before we want to do that chimney thing

302
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,140
before we want to do that chimney thing
 

303
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,140
before we want to do that chimney thing
so if a villager goes to their house at

304
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,150
so if a villager goes to their house at
 

305
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,270
so if a villager goes to their house at
nighttime we want to have a campfire

306
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,280
nighttime we want to have a campfire
 

307
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,490
nighttime we want to have a campfire
emit smoke from a chimney or something

308
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:00,500
emit smoke from a chimney or something
 

309
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,440
emit smoke from a chimney or something
so that we know they're there we got we

310
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:02,450
so that we know they're there we got we
 

311
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,960
so that we know they're there we got we
want to hook redstone up to this village

312
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:04,970
want to hook redstone up to this village
 

313
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,780
want to hook redstone up to this village
will do that sense this idea where we

314
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:07,790
will do that sense this idea where we
 

315
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,910
will do that sense this idea where we
can see how many people actually live in

316
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:09,920
can see how many people actually live in
 

317
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,660
can see how many people actually live in
the village

318
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:10,670
the village
 

319
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,570
the village
how many villagers I think would be a

320
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:13,580
how many villagers I think would be a
 

321
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,420
how many villagers I think would be a
cool idea I think about maybe building a

322
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,430
cool idea I think about maybe building a
 

323
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,810
cool idea I think about maybe building a
bank here where we can deposit emeralds

324
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:19,820
bank here where we can deposit emeralds
 

325
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,460
bank here where we can deposit emeralds
and they like keep track of like if

326
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,470
and they like keep track of like if
 

327
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,730
and they like keep track of like if
we're in a deficit period or four we're

328
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:24,740
we're in a deficit period or four we're
 

329
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,810
we're in a deficit period or four we're
gaining emeralds

330
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:25,820
gaining emeralds
 

331
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,130
gaining emeralds
you know if I'm spending them quicker

332
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:27,140
you know if I'm spending them quicker
 

333
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,840
you know if I'm spending them quicker
than we're gaining them sort of thing

334
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:30,850

 

335
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,220

probably do some minecart stuff in that

336
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,230
probably do some minecart stuff in that
 

337
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,620
probably do some minecart stuff in that
as well with this and yeah well just see

338
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:35,630
as well with this and yeah well just see
 

339
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,130
as well with this and yeah well just see
how this goes anyways one of the big

340
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,140
how this goes anyways one of the big
 

341
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,860
how this goes anyways one of the big
plans is to make the buildings go

342
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:41,870
plans is to make the buildings go
 

343
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,710
plans is to make the buildings go
forward so instead of going straight up

344
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
forward so instead of going straight up
 

345
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,300
forward so instead of going straight up
or going to the back they go forward

346
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,310
or going to the back they go forward
 

347
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,390
or going to the back they go forward
like they're leaning over top of us is

348
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,400
like they're leaning over top of us is
 

349
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,180
like they're leaning over top of us is
gonna be one of the keys to our design

350
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,190
gonna be one of the keys to our design
 

351
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,150
gonna be one of the keys to our design
here we'll start changing up our build

352
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,160
here we'll start changing up our build
 

353
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
here we'll start changing up our build
here so I want to build weird houses - I

354
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:56,930
here so I want to build weird houses - I
 

355
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,330
here so I want to build weird houses - I
don't want to make like standard boring

of feeling let's do like a a window

366
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:12,260
of feeling let's do like a a window

steel thing there with flowers maybe

368
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:14,420
steel thing there with flowers maybe
 

369
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:22,650
steel thing there with flowers maybe
we'll do mmm some trapdoors

370
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:22,660

 

371
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,600

uh-huh I'll do most of this off-camera

372
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,610
uh-huh I'll do most of this off-camera
 

373
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,280
uh-huh I'll do most of this off-camera
don't worry no we don't want those ones

374
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,290
don't worry no we don't want those ones
 

375
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,920
don't worry no we don't want those ones
I accidentally crafted them yeah we want

376
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:29,930
I accidentally crafted them yeah we want
 

377
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,430
I accidentally crafted them yeah we want
these ones we'll put those underneath do

378
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
these ones we'll put those underneath do
 

379
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,070
these ones we'll put those underneath do
it like that's I brought over some sweet

380
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
it like that's I brought over some sweet
 

381
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,390
it like that's I brought over some sweet
berries we'll probably be using these a

382
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:37,400
berries we'll probably be using these a
 

383
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,380
berries we'll probably be using these a
lot I think they look pretty nice get a

384
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,390
lot I think they look pretty nice get a
 

385
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,590
lot I think they look pretty nice get a
couple of those there and let me do a

386
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:44,600
couple of those there and let me do a
 

387
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,910
couple of those there and let me do a
bit off-camera and we'll see how this

388
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
bit off-camera and we'll see how this
 

389
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,790
bit off-camera and we'll see how this
goes

390
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:49,800

 

391
00:08:49,800 --> 00:09:11,650

ah which one of those describes it I

392
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:11,660
ah which one of those describes it I
 

393
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,780
ah which one of those describes it I
think I think who is the one we want to

394
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:14,790
think I think who is the one we want to
 

395
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,389
think I think who is the one we want to
go for I like it I think it's pretty

396
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:17,399
go for I like it I think it's pretty
 

397
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,620
go for I like it I think it's pretty
good so we just had like a little

398
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:18,630
good so we just had like a little
 

399
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,630
good so we just had like a little
fragment of a building me an idea of of

400
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
fragment of a building me an idea of of
 

401
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,940
fragment of a building me an idea of of
what it might look like the scheme

402
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:22,950
what it might look like the scheme
 

403
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,470
what it might look like the scheme
working together you know I think that's

404
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
working together you know I think that's
 

405
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,100
working together you know I think that's
pretty good

406
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,110
pretty good
 

407
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,040
pretty good
I like it so we're gonna we're gonna

408
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,050
I like it so we're gonna we're gonna
 

409
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,139
I like it so we're gonna we're gonna
stick with that and you know we'll

410
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:30,149
stick with that and you know we'll
 

411
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,460
stick with that and you know we'll
change it up a little bit like we're not

412
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,470
change it up a little bit like we're not
 

413
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,829
change it up a little bit like we're not
gonna always use these blocks we have

414
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
gonna always use these blocks we have
 

415
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,769
gonna always use these blocks we have
some freedom to change them around a lot

416
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:36,779
some freedom to change them around a lot
 

417
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,180
some freedom to change them around a lot
of the terracotta actually works with

418
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,190
of the terracotta actually works with
 

419
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,000
of the terracotta actually works with
brick I think so we can change up our

420
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,010
brick I think so we can change up our
 

421
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,310
brick I think so we can change up our
colors a little bit and all that I think

422
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,320
colors a little bit and all that I think
 

423
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,710
colors a little bit and all that I think
I'm gonna add an archway here so I want

424
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm gonna add an archway here so I want
 

425
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm gonna add an archway here so I want
to be able to walk underneath the

426
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,250
to be able to walk underneath the
 

427
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,180
to be able to walk underneath the
building kind of and like connect up to

428
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,190
building kind of and like connect up to
 

429
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,180
building kind of and like connect up to
the path there maybe he's the next plan

430
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,190
the path there maybe he's the next plan
 

431
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,540
the path there maybe he's the next plan
so we're gonna do something like this

432
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:58,550
so we're gonna do something like this
 

433
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,380
so we're gonna do something like this
and bring this over to about there we'll

434
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,390
and bring this over to about there we'll
 

435
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:10,430
and bring this over to about there we'll
do that on the other side and maybe like

436
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:10,440
do that on the other side and maybe like
 

437
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,560
do that on the other side and maybe like
up to here we don't want to overthink

438
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:12,570
up to here we don't want to overthink
 

439
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,670
up to here we don't want to overthink
this either too much like we're just

440
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
this either too much like we're just
 

441
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,800
this either too much like we're just
gonna build a kind of on sway you know

442
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:15,810
gonna build a kind of on sway you know
 

443
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,360
gonna build a kind of on sway you know
we're not gonna measure everything I

444
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,370
we're not gonna measure everything I
 

445
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,310
we're not gonna measure everything I
think this is an even number even you

446
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,320
think this is an even number even you
 

447
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,329
think this is an even number even you
know we don't care about those things

448
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:20,339
know we don't care about those things
 

449
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,720
know we don't care about those things
we're just doing it although that

450
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:23,730
we're just doing it although that
 

451
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,930
we're just doing it although that
doesn't line up is that a problem it's

452
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:26,940
doesn't line up is that a problem it's
 

453
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,280
doesn't line up is that a problem it's
not a problem guys we'll make it work

454
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,290
not a problem guys we'll make it work
 

455
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,069
not a problem guys we'll make it work
we'll figure it out all right so then

456
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:31,079
we'll figure it out all right so then
 

457
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,420
we'll figure it out all right so then
we'll mirror it on this side we want a

458
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,430
we'll mirror it on this side we want a
 

459
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,800
we'll mirror it on this side we want a
little bit of symmetry with the build

460
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:33,810
little bit of symmetry with the build
 

461
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,740
little bit of symmetry with the build
but not like total right all right so we

462
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:36,750
but not like total right all right so we
 

463
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,269
but not like total right all right so we
got a little bit more done here and it's

464
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:38,279
got a little bit more done here and it's
 

465
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,889
got a little bit more done here and it's
it's looking pretty weird but that's

466
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:39,899
it's looking pretty weird but that's
 

467
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,710
it's looking pretty weird but that's
fine you know weird is good von sway is

468
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
fine you know weird is good von sway is
 

469
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,100
fine you know weird is good von sway is
the way they're gonna be more like

470
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,110
the way they're gonna be more like
 

471
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,540
the way they're gonna be more like
complexes I think like multiple

472
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:47,550
complexes I think like multiple
 

473
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,389
complexes I think like multiple
villagers per building so it's gonna be

474
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
villagers per building so it's gonna be
 

475
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,860
villagers per building so it's gonna be
one of our entrances here I guess and I

476
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:54,870
one of our entrances here I guess and I
 

477
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,870
one of our entrances here I guess and I
think we're gonna hang some banners from

478
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
think we're gonna hang some banners from
 

479
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,950
think we're gonna hang some banners from
that thing look pretty cool

480
00:10:59,950 --> 00:10:59,960
that thing look pretty cool
 

481
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,330
that thing look pretty cool
and I like we're trying to keep a little

482
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:01,340
and I like we're trying to keep a little
 

483
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,310
and I like we're trying to keep a little
bit of symmetry alright cuz it's nice on

484
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,320
bit of symmetry alright cuz it's nice on
 

485
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,810
bit of symmetry alright cuz it's nice on
the eyes when you have a bit of symmetry

486
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:04,820
the eyes when you have a bit of symmetry
 

487
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,150
the eyes when you have a bit of symmetry
so I want like the roof to end over

488
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,160
so I want like the roof to end over
 

489
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,040
so I want like the roof to end over
there on the other side but like how do

490
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,050
there on the other side but like how do
 

491
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,460
there on the other side but like how do
we what do we do now like for this part

492
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,470
we what do we do now like for this part
 

493
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,200
we what do we do now like for this part
of the building

494
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,210
of the building
 

495
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,270
of the building
it's what I'm trying to figure out I'm

496
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,280
it's what I'm trying to figure out I'm
 

497
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,190
it's what I'm trying to figure out I'm
guessing we're gonna want this to come

498
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,200
guessing we're gonna want this to come
 

499
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,310
guessing we're gonna want this to come
over like I did a curve here I made it

500
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:21,320
over like I did a curve here I made it
 

501
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,630
over like I did a curve here I made it
come out this way a bit so it's not like

502
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
come out this way a bit so it's not like
 

503
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,720
come out this way a bit so it's not like
a totally flat building either and we'll

504
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:25,730
a totally flat building either and we'll
 

505
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,540
a totally flat building either and we'll
probably want this to come over like to

506
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:28,550
probably want this to come over like to
 

507
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,980
probably want this to come over like to
here or something and then start turning

508
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:29,990
here or something and then start turning
 

509
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,670
here or something and then start turning
back this way is what we're gonna aim

510
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
back this way is what we're gonna aim
 

511
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,340
back this way is what we're gonna aim
for so with that in mind the roof can

512
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:39,350
for so with that in mind the roof can
 

513
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,490
for so with that in mind the roof can
either go down or we might make it go

514
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:42,500
either go down or we might make it go
 

515
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,760
either go down or we might make it go
like curved up and like that sort of

516
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:45,770
like curved up and like that sort of
 

517
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,300
like curved up and like that sort of
thing I think we might go like this and

518
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,310
thing I think we might go like this and
 

519
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,440
thing I think we might go like this and
then put a balcony here and like a door

520
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,450
then put a balcony here and like a door
 

521
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,820
then put a balcony here and like a door
over there to go out on the balcony

522
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:56,830
over there to go out on the balcony
 

523
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,910
over there to go out on the balcony
because I'm not really sure what to do

524
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:00,920
because I'm not really sure what to do
 

525
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,910
because I'm not really sure what to do
with the section now to be honest it's

526
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
with the section now to be honest it's
 

527
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,090
with the section now to be honest it's
like it's weird right we'll figure it

528
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,100
like it's weird right we'll figure it
 

529
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,670
like it's weird right we'll figure it
out though okay well this is a little

530
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
out though okay well this is a little
 

531
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,020
out though okay well this is a little
different for me this is probably the

532
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,030
different for me this is probably the
 

533
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,360
different for me this is probably the
first time I did like a roof section

534
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,370
first time I did like a roof section
 

535
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,130
first time I did like a roof section
before the building like we don't have

536
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,140
before the building like we don't have
 

537
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,540
before the building like we don't have
the building and figured out underneath

538
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,550
the building and figured out underneath
 

539
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,400
the building and figured out underneath
there usually you do the building and

540
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,410
there usually you do the building and
 

541
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,780
there usually you do the building and
then you put the roof on at the very end

542
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,790
then you put the roof on at the very end
 

543
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,450
then you put the roof on at the very end
right but I wanted this continuous line

544
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:22,460
right but I wanted this continuous line
 

545
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,240
right but I wanted this continuous line
effect with the roof cuz I think that

546
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,250
effect with the roof cuz I think that
 

547
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,260
effect with the roof cuz I think that
looks cool so we got like a

548
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,270
looks cool so we got like a
 

549
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,590
looks cool so we got like a
stretched-out s over here and then I

550
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
stretched-out s over here and then I
 

551
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,060
stretched-out s over here and then I
added on this piece over here I think

552
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,070
added on this piece over here I think
 

553
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,560
added on this piece over here I think
this looks really cool actually we could

554
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,570
this looks really cool actually we could
 

555
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,750
this looks really cool actually we could
copy this and use it on other other

556
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:34,760
copy this and use it on other other
 

557
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,120
copy this and use it on other other
buildings we make as well I think it

558
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,130
buildings we make as well I think it
 

559
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,700
buildings we make as well I think it
looks pretty neat one thing though I'm

560
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:39,710
looks pretty neat one thing though I'm
 

561
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,500
looks pretty neat one thing though I'm
starting it at the finicky stage like I

562
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,510
starting it at the finicky stage like I
 

563
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,510
starting it at the finicky stage like I
put some red up there I'm not sure I

564
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:43,520
put some red up there I'm not sure I
 

565
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,790
put some red up there I'm not sure I
like the red I tried putting brick up

566
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:45,800
like the red I tried putting brick up
 

567
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,570
like the red I tried putting brick up
there like I'm like placing blocks and

568
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:49,580
there like I'm like placing blocks and
 

569
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,100
there like I'm like placing blocks and
removing them check him out placing them

570
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,110
removing them check him out placing them
 

571
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,260
removing them check him out placing them
trying something else you know the

572
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,270
trying something else you know the
 

573
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:59,200
trying something else you know the
really slow buildings stuff I might like

574
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,210
really slow buildings stuff I might like
 

575
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,210
really slow buildings stuff I might like
that more actually I'm not sure okay

576
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,220
that more actually I'm not sure okay
 

577
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,190
that more actually I'm not sure okay
that worked pretty good actually so we

578
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
that worked pretty good actually so we
 

579
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,510
that worked pretty good actually so we
did the white clay thing at the top

580
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:04,520
did the white clay thing at the top
 

581
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,890
did the white clay thing at the top
there as well because even though this

582
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:05,900
there as well because even though this
 

583
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,020
there as well because even though this
is an asymmetrical build we want to

584
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,030
is an asymmetrical build we want to
 

585
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,600
is an asymmetrical build we want to
create patterns so it'll probably do a

586
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:10,610
create patterns so it'll probably do a
 

587
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,010
create patterns so it'll probably do a
lot of the roofs like this where we have

588
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,020
lot of the roofs like this where we have
 

589
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,480
lot of the roofs like this where we have
the white clay at the top like that

590
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,490
the white clay at the top like that
 

591
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,389
the white clay at the top like that
and it's an easy way of filling in space

592
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
and it's an easy way of filling in space
 

593
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,919
and it's an easy way of filling in space
and I think it looks pretty nice adds a

594
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:17,929
and I think it looks pretty nice adds a
 

595
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,989
and I think it looks pretty nice adds a
little bit contrast to the build having

596
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:19,999
little bit contrast to the build having
 

597
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,179
little bit contrast to the build having
a different color there I love that

598
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:25,189
a different color there I love that
 

599
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:29,019
a different color there I love that
sound yeah so one of the cool features

600
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:29,029
sound yeah so one of the cool features
 

601
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,299
sound yeah so one of the cool features
we want to add to our village to each of

602
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:31,309
we want to add to our village to each of
 

603
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,879
we want to add to our village to each of
our buildings is a fireplace so that

604
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:33,889
our buildings is a fireplace so that
 

605
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,350
our buildings is a fireplace so that
when the villagers go to bed at

606
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
when the villagers go to bed at
 

607
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,769
when the villagers go to bed at
nighttime

608
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:35,779
nighttime
 

609
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,019
nighttime
we're gonna activate some redstone

610
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:38,029
we're gonna activate some redstone
 

611
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,850
we're gonna activate some redstone
that's so that smoke will come out of

612
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:39,860
that's so that smoke will come out of
 

613
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,079
that's so that smoke will come out of
the chimney and we can see that their

614
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:41,089
the chimney and we can see that their
 

615
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,689
the chimney and we can see that their
home really easily so we want to build a

616
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:43,699
home really easily so we want to build a
 

617
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,049
home really easily so we want to build a
fireplace on each house to do that the

618
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:47,059
fireplace on each house to do that the
 

619
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,499
fireplace on each house to do that the
only thing is I usually build fireplaces

620
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:50,509
only thing is I usually build fireplaces
 

621
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,109
only thing is I usually build fireplaces
out of brick and the whole building is

622
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:53,119
out of brick and the whole building is
 

623
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,970
out of brick and the whole building is
made out of brick right we want it to

624
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:54,980
made out of brick right we want it to
 

625
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,489
made out of brick right we want it to
stand out and have some contrast so I

626
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:57,499
stand out and have some contrast so I
 

627
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,799
stand out and have some contrast so I
think we'll do the fireplaces out of

628
00:13:59,799 --> 00:13:59,809
think we'll do the fireplaces out of
 

629
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,009
think we'll do the fireplaces out of
stone brick even though it's not a super

630
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,019
stone brick even though it's not a super
 

631
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,499
stone brick even though it's not a super
exciting material it'll it'll stand out

632
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:05,509
exciting material it'll it'll stand out
 

633
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,019
exciting material it'll it'll stand out
at least right and hopefully look pretty

634
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:08,029
at least right and hopefully look pretty
 

635
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,419
at least right and hopefully look pretty
nice uh-oh and we're starting have some

636
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:10,429
nice uh-oh and we're starting have some
 

637
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,129
nice uh-oh and we're starting have some
problems here so I think this side of

638
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:12,139
problems here so I think this side of
 

639
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,809
problems here so I think this side of
the house looks great I'm very happy

640
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:13,819
the house looks great I'm very happy
 

641
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,210
the house looks great I'm very happy
with it but then when we go over here

642
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,220
with it but then when we go over here
 

643
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,480
with it but then when we go over here
now that we've added the fireplace it's

644
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,490
now that we've added the fireplace it's
 

645
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,030
now that we've added the fireplace it's
pretty dull it's pretty plain I don't

646
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,040
pretty dull it's pretty plain I don't
 

647
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,239
pretty dull it's pretty plain I don't
know maybe I lost inspiration it's not

648
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:25,249
know maybe I lost inspiration it's not
 

649
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:27,039
know maybe I lost inspiration it's not
done like we still have a lot of stuff

650
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,049
done like we still have a lot of stuff
 

651
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,559
done like we still have a lot of stuff
looking out at the top here but I think

652
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:29,569
looking out at the top here but I think
 

653
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,410
looking out at the top here but I think
this is shaped good like the fireplace

654
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:32,420
this is shaped good like the fireplace
 

655
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,429
this is shaped good like the fireplace
I just don't like how it looks so maybe

656
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:36,439
I just don't like how it looks so maybe
 

657
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,489
I just don't like how it looks so maybe
we change to different material a nether

658
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:39,499
we change to different material a nether
 

659
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:40,840
we change to different material a nether
brick or something I'm not sure what to

660
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:40,850
brick or something I'm not sure what to
 

661
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,609
brick or something I'm not sure what to
do with about that side of the house but

662
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:42,619
do with about that side of the house but
 

663
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:44,350
do with about that side of the house but
I did do over here as well

664
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,360
I did do over here as well
 

665
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,910
I did do over here as well
what we did is we just copied that

666
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
what we did is we just copied that
 

667
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,600
what we did is we just copied that
initial tower we built and like mirrored

668
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,610
initial tower we built and like mirrored
 

669
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,699
initial tower we built and like mirrored
it and connected them all together put

670
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:51,709
it and connected them all together put
 

671
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,970
it and connected them all together put
like a weird middle section in here one

672
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:54,980
like a weird middle section in here one
 

673
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,100
like a weird middle section in here one
issue I'm finding is we're using a lot

674
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,110
issue I'm finding is we're using a lot
 

675
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,989
issue I'm finding is we're using a lot
of brick like maybe too much so I wanted

676
00:14:58,989 --> 00:14:58,999
of brick like maybe too much so I wanted
 

677
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,819
of brick like maybe too much so I wanted
to add some different materials in the

678
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:00,829
to add some different materials in the
 

679
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,910
to add some different materials in the
middle and these are mushroom stems by

680
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
middle and these are mushroom stems by
 

681
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,850
middle and these are mushroom stems by
the way they look pretty nice right

682
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:05,860
the way they look pretty nice right
 

683
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,650
the way they look pretty nice right
really like those I did something you

684
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:08,660
really like those I did something you
 

685
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,879
really like those I did something you
should probably never do here though I

686
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:09,889
should probably never do here though I
 

687
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,749
should probably never do here though I
mixed like fence windows with window

688
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:13,759
mixed like fence windows with window
 

689
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,400
mixed like fence windows with window
windows the glass ones don't do that but

690
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,410
windows the glass ones don't do that but
 

691
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,069
windows the glass ones don't do that but
if you do bonds way it's okay all right

692
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:21,079
if you do bonds way it's okay all right
 

693
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,189
if you do bonds way it's okay all right
that's the trick in here this is our

694
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:24,199
that's the trick in here this is our
 

695
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,310
that's the trick in here this is our
inside fireplace and I'm okay with this

696
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:27,320
inside fireplace and I'm okay with this
 

697
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,670
inside fireplace and I'm okay with this
all right we had an option we could have

698
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:30,680
all right we had an option we could have
 

699
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,860
all right we had an option we could have
just put like I can't fire in the

700
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:32,870
just put like I can't fire in the
 

701
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,360
just put like I can't fire in the
fireplace and not did the flame you know

702
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,370
fireplace and not did the flame you know
 

703
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,770
fireplace and not did the flame you know
but we did both we have the flame and

704
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:38,780
but we did both we have the flame and
 

705
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,600
but we did both we have the flame and
they can't fire behind there so we can

706
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:40,610
they can't fire behind there so we can
 

707
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,500
they can't fire behind there so we can
see the smoke from the campfire still

708
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,510
see the smoke from the campfire still
 

709
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,920
see the smoke from the campfire still
and I think that works out okay yeah

710
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:47,930
and I think that works out okay yeah
 

711
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,830
and I think that works out okay yeah
like I want to keep the campfire

712
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:49,840
like I want to keep the campfire
 

713
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,880
like I want to keep the campfire
underground if possible that's it down

714
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:51,890
underground if possible that's it down
 

715
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,280
underground if possible that's it down
there so that'll be easier to hook

716
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,290
there so that'll be easier to hook
 

717
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,650
there so that'll be easier to hook
redstone up to it if it's at this height

718
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:56,660
redstone up to it if it's at this height
 

719
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,030
redstone up to it if it's at this height
it'll be a little bit harder because we

720
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,040
it'll be a little bit harder because we
 

721
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,460
it'll be a little bit harder because we
need to put a piston above and then like

722
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,470
need to put a piston above and then like
 

723
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,380
need to put a piston above and then like
how do you hide the wiring to the piston

724
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,390
how do you hide the wiring to the piston
 

725
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,790
how do you hide the wiring to the piston
you know it's it becomes kind of an

726
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:03,800
you know it's it becomes kind of an
 

727
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,510
you know it's it becomes kind of an
issue ah let's see what else we gonna do

728
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:07,520
issue ah let's see what else we gonna do
 

729
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,080
issue ah let's see what else we gonna do
here let's go up this is nice so I like

730
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,090
here let's go up this is nice so I like
 

731
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,640
here let's go up this is nice so I like
doing a little bit of building every so

732
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:12,650
doing a little bit of building every so
 

733
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,810
doing a little bit of building every so
often we did acacia wood for up here it

734
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:16,820
often we did acacia wood for up here it
 

735
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,970
often we did acacia wood for up here it
goes good with dark wood I think dark

736
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:18,980
goes good with dark wood I think dark
 

737
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,970
goes good with dark wood I think dark
oak throw in a window sure we got a door

738
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:24,980
oak throw in a window sure we got a door
 

739
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,770
oak throw in a window sure we got a door
here so we're gonna have a second floor

740
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:26,780
here so we're gonna have a second floor
 

741
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,530
here so we're gonna have a second floor
to this building which means we need a

742
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:29,540
to this building which means we need a
 

743
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:36,220
to this building which means we need a
staircase to go up maybe where do we put

744
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,230
staircase to go up maybe where do we put
 

745
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:42,060
staircase to go up maybe where do we put
it maybe like here upwards all right

746
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,070
it maybe like here upwards all right
 

747
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,110
it maybe like here upwards all right
something like that we'll plan for that

748
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,120
something like that we'll plan for that
 

749
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,140
something like that we'll plan for that
kind of like over here how is it gonna

750
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,150
kind of like over here how is it gonna
 

751
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:52,930
kind of like over here how is it gonna
go up and then we'll have to see how the

752
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:52,940
go up and then we'll have to see how the
 

753
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,670
go up and then we'll have to see how the
villagers handle it so the probably

754
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:54,680
villagers handle it so the probably
 

755
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,730
villagers handle it so the probably
second floor is gonna start right around

756
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:56,740
second floor is gonna start right around
 

757
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,010
second floor is gonna start right around
here all right let's do a little

758
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,020
here all right let's do a little
 

759
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,870
here all right let's do a little
comparison here so for the interior

760
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:01,880
comparison here so for the interior
 

761
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
comparison here so for the interior
floors to the house we could go jungle

762
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:03,890
floors to the house we could go jungle
 

763
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,850
floors to the house we could go jungle
wood jungle planks we could go Bridge

764
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:06,860
wood jungle planks we could go Bridge
 

765
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:13,560
wood jungle planks we could go Bridge
planks or I'm thinking oak or spruce

766
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:13,570
planks or I'm thinking oak or spruce
 

767
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,520
planks or I'm thinking oak or spruce
which one is it

768
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:15,530
which one is it
 

769
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,929
which one is it
which is the best jungle is a little bit

770
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:19,939
which is the best jungle is a little bit
 

771
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,880
which is the best jungle is a little bit
too close in color to the brick I think

772
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:21,890
too close in color to the brick I think
 

773
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,720
too close in color to the brick I think
I don't really like that so that's out

774
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:24,730
I don't really like that so that's out
 

775
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,990
I don't really like that so that's out
spruce doesn't really go well with the

776
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,000
spruce doesn't really go well with the
 

777
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,470
spruce doesn't really go well with the
brick should I say that I used it in a

778
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
brick should I say that I used it in a
 

779
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,880
brick should I say that I used it in a
few places no it looks great with the

780
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:33,890
few places no it looks great with the
 

781
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,660
few places no it looks great with the
brick birch is too bright I think we're

782
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:37,670
brick birch is too bright I think we're
 

783
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:43,080
brick birch is too bright I think we're
gonna go with oak

784
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,090

 

785
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,200

mmm-hmm changed my mind you know what it

786
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,210
mmm-hmm changed my mind you know what it
 

787
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,630
mmm-hmm changed my mind you know what it
is I think there's like a lot more black

788
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:49,640
is I think there's like a lot more black
 

789
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,730
is I think there's like a lot more black
lines than the old planks now like in

790
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:51,740
lines than the old planks now like in
 

791
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,060
lines than the old planks now like in
this this new texture pack and I don't

792
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,070
this this new texture pack and I don't
 

793
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,889
this this new texture pack and I don't
think I like that like I used to be a

794
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:56,899
think I like that like I used to be a
 

795
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,600
think I like that like I used to be a
big fan of oak planks but not so much

796
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:58,610
big fan of oak planks but not so much
 

797
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,259
big fan of oak planks but not so much
anymore

798
00:17:59,259 --> 00:17:59,269
anymore
 

799
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:04,240
anymore
sure go mushroom blocks maybe we could

800
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,250
sure go mushroom blocks maybe we could
 

801
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,500
sure go mushroom blocks maybe we could
even do like this style if we want now

802
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,510
even do like this style if we want now
 

803
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,330
even do like this style if we want now
we should probably stick to these okay

804
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:10,340
we should probably stick to these okay
 

805
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,279
we should probably stick to these okay
so this is taking a little bit of time

806
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:12,289
so this is taking a little bit of time
 

807
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,470
so this is taking a little bit of time
to get this done but we're getting close

808
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
to get this done but we're getting close
 

809
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,600
to get this done but we're getting close
I won't be able to finish it today

810
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:16,610
I won't be able to finish it today
 

811
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,289
I won't be able to finish it today
though it looks like it's just one

812

village which is gonna be a bit crazy so
 

817
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,740

again we did that thing over here I like

818
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:26,750
again we did that thing over here I like
 

819
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,639

how that looks

820
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:27,649
how that looks
 

821
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,840
how that looks
we'll probably use that several times

822
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:28,850
we'll probably use that several times
 

823
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,649
we'll probably use that several times
throughout the village we're gonna put

824
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:32,659
throughout the village we're gonna put
 

825
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,379
throughout the village we're gonna put
like a staircase to go up here to a

826
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:35,389
like a staircase to go up here to a
 

827
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:37,090
like a staircase to go up here to a
second floor and then we might connect

828
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,100
second floor and then we might connect
 

829
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,620
second floor and then we might connect
the two buildings together at the top

830
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:38,630
the two buildings together at the top
 

831
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,840
the two buildings together at the top
here because we definitely can if we

832
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:40,850
here because we definitely can if we
 

833
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,490
here because we definitely can if we
want to just mess around with acacia we

834
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:45,500
want to just mess around with acacia we
 

835
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,190
want to just mess around with acacia we
might go for oak upstairs I'm not sure

836
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,200
might go for oak upstairs I'm not sure
 

837
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,899
might go for oak upstairs I'm not sure
but I do like the mushroom blocks

downstairs I think that looks pretty
 

841
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,730
downstairs I think that looks pretty
cool they're different enough from the

842
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:54,740
cool they're different enough from the
 

843
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,299
cool they're different enough from the
brick I think where they they look okay

844
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:57,309
brick I think where they they look okay
 

845
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,710

one last thing we'll do on this together
 

851
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,399
one last thing we'll do on this together
and then we'll call it for the building

852
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:09,409
and then we'll call it for the building
 

853
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:14,259
and then we'll call it for the building
I think we'll add another entrance down

854
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:14,269
I think we'll add another entrance down
 

855
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:18,570
I think we'll add another entrance down
here let's leave that three block gap

856
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:18,580
here let's leave that three block gap
 

857
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,450
here let's leave that three block gap
and we will plan to put it like over

858
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:22,460
and we will plan to put it like over
 

859
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,419
and we will plan to put it like over
here something like this and then we'll

860
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:25,429
here something like this and then we'll
 

861
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,149
here something like this and then we'll
do the blue tile roof down here as well

862
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:28,159
do the blue tile roof down here as well
 

863
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,720
do the blue tile roof down here as well
I really like how these look they they

864
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,730
I really like how these look they they
 

865
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,580

make it a little bit of a change to them

866
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,590
make it a little bit of a change to them
 

867
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,580
make it a little bit of a change to them
with the texture pack change and I think

868
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:36,590
with the texture pack change and I think
 

869
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,139
with the texture pack change and I think
they're even better now like I like them

870
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:38,149
they're even better now like I like them
 

871
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:41,440
they're even better now like I like them
before I think they're even better than

872
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,450
before I think they're even better than
 

873
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,680
before I think they're even better than
they were all right

874
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:44,690
they were all right
 

875
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,070
they were all right
maybe we'll do one of those all right so

876
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
maybe we'll do one of those all right so
 

877
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,690
maybe we'll do one of those all right so
let's try to just a few more things here

878
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:49,700
let's try to just a few more things here
 

879
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,110
let's try to just a few more things here
before we wrap up the episode a couple

880
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
before we wrap up the episode a couple
 

881

let's check outs first off the poppy
 

885
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,560
let's check outs first off the poppy
farm now that we've updated I think this

886
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,570
farm now that we've updated I think this
 

887
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,860
farm now that we've updated I think this
is all the iron we're gonna get not that

888
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:05,870
is all the iron we're gonna get not that
 

889
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,110
is all the iron we're gonna get not that
I would ever use this higher no no no

890
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,120
I would ever use this higher no no no
 

891
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,770
I would ever use this higher no no no
definitely not guys if you guys don't

definitely not guys if you guys don't
 

893
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,260
definitely not guys if you guys don't
know the initial plan with this iron

894
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:14,270
know the initial plan with this iron
 

895
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,830
know the initial plan with this iron
firm this poppy farm was we would only

896
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
firm this poppy farm was we would only
 

897
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,330
firm this poppy farm was we would only
use the iron for building the Nexus and

898
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:22,340
use the iron for building the Nexus and
 

899
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:29,440
use the iron for building the Nexus and
we did then I kept using it and it's

900
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,450
we did then I kept using it and it's
 

901
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,660
we did then I kept using it and it's
like just been barely able to keep up

902
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:31,670
like just been barely able to keep up
 

903
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,550
like just been barely able to keep up
like this is pretty much all the iron we

904
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:33,560
like this is pretty much all the iron we
 

905
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,040
like this is pretty much all the iron we
have left I think we have 32 blocks or

906
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,050
have left I think we have 32 blocks or
 

907
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,860
have left I think we have 32 blocks or
something in our ender chest still 33

908
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:37,870
something in our ender chest still 33
 

909
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,050
something in our ender chest still 33
that's it that's all our iron couple

910
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,060
that's it that's all our iron couple
 

911
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,230
that's it that's all our iron couple
beacons with some iron and I think and

912
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
beacons with some iron and I think and
 

913
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,110
beacons with some iron and I think and
that's our total supply so we're gonna

914
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
that's our total supply so we're gonna
 

915
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
that's our total supply so we're gonna
need to build a new iron farm soon

916
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,370
need to build a new iron farm soon
 

917
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,940
need to build a new iron farm soon
because I am almost certain this one

918
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:51,950
because I am almost certain this one
 

919
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,320
because I am almost certain this one
doesn't work anymore thing is they're

920

next pre-release there's new ways of
 

925
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,930
next pre-release there's new ways of
farming iron golems so I might need to

926
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:04,940
farming iron golems so I might need to
 

927
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,580
farming iron golems so I might need to
wait a bit on that but we're gonna run

928

wait a bit on that but we're gonna run
 

929
