1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,270
Hey, there, whereyet is the old Aljozer Etho, up
in them Dercanelland and I tell you woots

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:19,350
whather dey went out Ootside and I saw a boot o
three feet t o snowa boot. Ther madee Mus ran down

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,840
the street and had been thaced by a Porror
beariers, that it was so caught out. I tell you

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,960
why you don't see that Eber day up in Tem near
Canada Landby, At the end E, last episode we

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,820
started working on an expansion to our
netherhab, a village or breeder system up above

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,830
here and I got a little bit more done on it. We have
like t a sandstone ground. We got some neather

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,600
brick mixed tins, some purple wool. I know
everybody loves the purple wool. Oh yeah, it's

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,580
just amazing, so we kinda had like a sloap
ceiling here. We might try to do that glass thing

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,660
up there as well, and maybe we'll change the
sandstone to smooth sandstone i haven't

10
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,560
decided, but we gotta get some lighting up here.
I tried like using the lanterns and I don't think

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,020
they're going to work the blue lanterns maybe,
but they don't give off enoug light to actually

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,040
be useful. I think so, li. e. I don't like the
orange with the purple and the yellow and stuff.

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,310
Maybe it's not the worst thing in the world. I, d.
no, I kind o. like whatl we did below as we had some

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,550
purple glass in the walls and places, I think
we'll do something similar, either full block

15
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:28,780
or I got some pains as well, And then I think we'll
just hide lighting behind these. Ah, probably

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,980
two blocks up, so you can't see it at all. I think
if it's over here that one lookes good. Yeah, I

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,070
don't like tati, Ge, At least the block hirher,
uhhuh, uhhuh, maybe ye'll dislike punch holes

18
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:50,130
all the way down here, Nd I could look cool, too.
Oh, you see that they just woke up. Oh, all right s

19
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,700
o snappers. We'e got this place all put together
and it's very similar to the hulbelows. We got

20
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,770
again that nether brick. We got the glass in the
ceiling and up in the middle there is my mind

21
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,310
cartt elevator to get on top of the bedrock, So we
kinda have to leave that there or that's a lot of

22
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,170
villagers, isn't it? Myg gal, be carried away
with a number of beds and stuff, H. we'll

23
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,230
probably start shipping these guys out to other
places in our world, and then I won't refeed them

24
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,820
for a long time until population drops down to
like ten or so. so. Yeah, the idea is if we need a

25
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,230
villager now, anywhere in our world, we got
these drop shoots on each of the four a tunnels.

26
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,560
Maybe we'll put them in a minecurt. They won't
take a all damage that way, all right,

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,160
everybody. well, I think our plan for to day is
just to do a bunch of random stuff around our

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,900
world, as as my fancy way of saying, I don't have a
plan. but now I got like a hundred things on my

29
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,060
list I want to do. and uh, most of them aren't
really. They're just like random little

30
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,440
projects. So Ive recently been like making a
bunch of Mani farms in creative, and one that I

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,340
thought was pretty good was a coko, be n farm i did
so I want to add that into or world for brown, die

32
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,990
and let's build it together here really quick.
Ah, this. I goin be for the storage and aright.

33
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,530
You guys are paying attention right yet, Yant o
Kate. We get some hoppers in here. It's goin t be

34
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,930
double hop or speed, so we got one hopper going to
the chest here, Ond one going in over there. The

35
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:22,150
cogo beans will transfer superfast and in order
to plant coco beans, it has to be on junglewood,

36
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,590
so we get a piece of junglewood there. We'll
plant them there. There's two dispensers you

37
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:33,580
can bone mail, cocoa beans or ampobomial. in
these dispensers I got be very careful. those

38
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,130
sheep don't get out if they do, or we're in big
trouble. They're going t take over the world.

39
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:45,360
Nobody's going to be happy with that. Let's I. I
just realized you guys aren't going to be able t

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,280
sea too well here, ell mi hav Ben. a bad idea, Ca,
Iwill get a piece of red stone there on that one

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,530
and we'll have to put one here too. shift. click
areayou. see what's happening here. Now we just

42
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,850
need a clock running to triggers those
dispensers so we're going to use an observer

43
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:12,440
clock is two observers facing each other like a
so in here cookin a way, And now we'll have an

44
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:19,839
onoff switch for this ting by moping, one of
these out of the way. Oh, isn't going to get out it

45
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,850
wer goods. It a torchup there here. I think he can
sceep here. Oh, he was just about to make a run for

46
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,140
it, so you might have noticed when we first set
this up. it was kind of going like kuckk, quick,

47
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,960
and now twice ha speed. I didn't change
anything. Thatthiss will happens when you uh th

48
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,860
ook thelever up to this All right, So now we'e got
ta hook up a harvester for it as well, we're just

49
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,810
going is a piston to do that, but we gotta get a
piece of red stone on top of the cocoa bean block

50
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,450
as where the cocoa beans go. Ah, but we a made sure
it doesn't connect to the other ones next to it,

51
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,930
So we're going O put a block overtop here. cut it
off, and now we're going to add some chests up

52
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,850
here, fer bomiuo that will flow down to the
dispensers. It just takes two ball mail to grow a

53
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,820
cocoa bean to maturity, unlike like a wheatan
stuff, which sometimes takes three, is always

54
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:21,290
two. and then all we got do is get our pis ten rates
facend down at the cocoa bean and hard to do. Got

55
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:30,700
it okay good, and we'll put a repeater over top of
that En break our leavver, for now, The leaver as

56
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,450
just there ecause. it's annoying. we're going
to move it up over here now. Hoh, that's our aunt

57
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,490
off, switch, An, we can just decorate it.
However we want an, we put some blocks in front

58
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,890
and jest for luoks. He might want to put trap dor
fror, your hopper or something. But that's

59
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:52,840
about it. We just flipped this to turn it on and we
uh rite, click with our cocoa bean lug. An at all

60
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,530
the brown eye you could ever want. It is mass
producing the stuff like super quack, All

61
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:07,190
right, so this is like loaded up bundling down
here at two times a speed. Oh, those poor guys.

62
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:13,090
they have even less space. Now I discovered up
the redstone with some haybailes wi'r going to

63
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,940
head over to the end now. and I got a bit of a weird
project Iy wante to do over there, so let's take

64
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:26,640
our inder porter. baam. Been using this thing a
lot. It is actually really awesome and we arent

65
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,090
there. Yeah, I kinda want to build some kind of
transportation system, in the end to get to

66
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:38,010
those types of portals, and also Ea Ourmain
portal here from our obsidian platform here,

67
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,240
dig out a tunnel like a three by three tunnel that
goes right to our portal and all those other

68
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,630
little portales and fill it up. I water, and then
get adulpin here, so we get Dolphin's grace, and

69
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,390
can es ziprate through our our end, nice and
quick. I can be a lot of digging though this goin

70
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:00,940
take a long time and we're going to need to get
some sol soil afer step. Watch your stat, wee

71
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,630
goin a fall Efa. it's bout a hundred block
tunnel, actually, so we're going to line the

72
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,740
floor with the sole soil so we get this sole speed
effect from our boots and go even quicker

73
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,130
through it. Okay, I think we're ready to start
flooding this thing, so lets git doin thati that

74
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:26,760
to go all lrong here with our water. So yo' going
to want to build like a wall around the platform

75
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,920
here, so when the dolphin comes through, he's
not going to jump off the edge on us N now, for the

76
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,730
easy part, we just gotta get Adolphin into the
end. That shouldn't be too tough, right. I have

77
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,980
no idea. do they do? They come out of the water. If
you. If you pull him out, I, ah, no problem, no

78
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,650
problems. so we're about two, three hundred
bucks away from our stronghold bass, actually,

79
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,070
now we gont make sure this is a little bit
confusing, but they will die if they stay in the

80
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,200
air too long, and they'll die if they stay in the
water too long. So they kina got to alternate as

81
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:07,570
we go here. We got a f. I think two minutes though
that they can stay out of water. O, and I name Yeu a

82
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:19,790
speedy. Okay, I think we're ready to go speedy.
Let's do this. Give Hem a slow falling potion oh,

83
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,850
how do I think about this idea? By the way I was
thinking it might be cool with the one point

84
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:30,860
seventeen up date with the the lightning rods
and stuff. What did they make it? So that charge

85
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:40,179
creepers drop tea and tea. A. So that'llah give a
reason for like actually wanting to use the Uh

86
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,320
lightning rods, and like setting up a
chargecreuper farm and farming T and t from

87
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,760
them. I think that could be pretty cool, itki
help solve the whole uh tan t dopping glitch that

88
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,070
they still haven't fixed Bcause. I don't think
they want to ecause. There's no replacement for

89
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,160
it in the game. That'll be a way of getting the t n
T. and then they just need to add away of uh,

90
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:08,580
moving tent. Ah, anyways, we are about here
speedy. Oh, I'm sorry, let me let me guide you

91
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,570
through. You got to be quick, O'r, running out
time. I know you're excited to see outside of the

92
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:21,550
ocean and stuff, but you, we got to go here. Oh
man, I think we're running out of time. come on,

93
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:30,190
speedy. Going there? We? o. we got em. when a
flood is goon foeti. Oh, he went. he went in

94
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:43,170
Okeco. Ah, this is tricky. Cam. I give him some
water. Oh yeah, that's a. That's what I should

95
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:50,960
do. I sh. d just use the water to get Am Mhore, I
want em, rasped Kat'. we got the glass there.

96
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,590
good. good good. you're goin a block. This it is
trapps, and now we. Oh, I killed the water. Oh no.

97
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:08,500
I din. Okay, hoo. we need that water. An I' gong t
add he water right there Ban. we got speedy in

98
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,970
place, so as long as he's in a bubble stream like
that, he will never suffocate Ah, Otherwise

99
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,750
like, if you just leave em in water, they'll die.
If you leave em an air, they'll die. so an Iwas

100
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,610
cleaning up a blockene in there with em, and I
don't know, if he's refreshing the De span time

101
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,250
on that every time it like goes to his nose, She's
like non stop doing it. though, so I'm wondering

102
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,430
if that bloch will stay there forever or if it's
going to decay Y after five minutes. No, all

103
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,460
right, So we also got a bubble elevator that goes
from our tunnel up to the pordal. Ah, now what

104
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,330
we're going to be doin is fightin a couple
withers, cause we have no more beacons. left. I

105
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:49,800
want to set up a speed to beacon for this stunnel
as well, so let's get to doin that. An. I want to

106
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:57,730
see if it's going to bluw. our glass here.
Probably will Eis put Enston there if it does.

107
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:06,260
Ah, yeah, we got Toms o Ann stone from from all
that mining. Look it all. Oh, it didn't it didn't

108
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:13,940
bor nice. I. yeah, it's still there. So if you
want to keep a item around for some reason,

109
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,510
that's one way to refresh, it. let's give this
thing a try now. Ok, so the ideas ere going to come

110
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:27,410
in to the end and like a lot of times we do this jest
to get back to span. So then we just hold old

111
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:35,430
control and honestly, the Sowest part about
that was the elevator hum. Is there a faster

112
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,730
elevator we could do? I wonder. Aha, so that's
pretty cool. but Weave also added in another

113
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,410
tunnel which we're going to try out now. I
haven't tried it yet don'knowhow I's going to

114
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,010
work, An we'll probably be adding more in the
future to go O other places like these, these

115
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:55,900
little portal things, Um, le olice. Let's give
us a try. So there's ai. whoa. o. whizzed, Ray

116
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:02,830
Pasttit Can be careful how I do it. I guess Arryel
hat's better. He'll launch us out. how far that

117
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,960
take us from the island. A, not as far as I is
hoping. I was hoping I' like really launcos.

118
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:15,720
Maybe I got a hold space before I leave the exit.
Maybe we dragged on the ground and I was kind of

119
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,710
hoping you'd like launch us right to the Ann.
this thing over here, but I guess at doesn't

120
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:29,270
quite take you all the way. It gits a a nice boost
to it though, For sure, Yeah, the friction in

121
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,110
this game just kind of sucks the air. friction it
like instantly stops you no matter how fast

122
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,750
you're going. Oh, Ky. I tried it a couple more
times here and there is a trick to it. We gotto

123
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:46,000
press space right when we exit the tunnel to
activate our litras, and then we kindo dislike

124
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,670
soare all the way here without even needing a
rocket. Yasso. Here's an idea. Maybe, instead

125
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,840
of using a bubble elevator at the end, let's
build a staircase using slabs to get up there.

126
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,300
Ecause. it's only I think, like ten blocks we'r
gonnta climb if you try to swim vertically Ind

127
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:08,140
water. it's very slow, so we don't want to do
that, But if we can, Ah, staircases up with

128
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:15,100
slabs. it should be very fast. Ah, if we can do it,
let's test it out. I actually don't know. To be

129
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:22,350
honest. Oh yeah, we go over top of it. look at that
awesome woe and the cool thing is you get the sal

130
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,850
soil a speed of beck through slap, so we
shouldn't get a big light camera jerk, e, ap yip,

131
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,280
so we changed our tunnels slightly. here. we
have a staircase now. every two blocks we go up

132
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:39,630
one vertically and we'd have Sol soil below the
slab, so that we still keep that to soul speed. A

133
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:46,980
fat. Ok. yere e go and okay, Kind o sows you down a
bit. I think yeah, I think with that we were

134
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,150
slamming into the sides of the slabs just cause
we're moving so fast, we would need to space it

135
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:57,120
out even more like every four blocks C up one or
maybe even every six, but it was better than the

136
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,260
Bub oil rigers, who'll probably leave it like
that. Ah, anyways, we are going to be doing

137
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,030
something else here. Well, I'm Mannao. show you
a failed O attempt. I. I did here. I thought it'd

138
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:13,740
be cool if we could hook the Ender Porter network
up to a nether portals and then be able to hit in,

139
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,480
hit a button, an hill, aport to the portal and go
through all in one sort of thing here, so we got

140
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:28,840
our inderpearl hovering over here. Ah, the
problem is, it's actually really tough to do so.

141
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,630
And then I wanted the clothes after we go
through, too, so I set up some chains here to

142
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:40,020
align the pearl properly, so we're still. We're
hovering over the water. We can throw it down.

143
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,380
Ah, the problem is if that pearl gets too close to
the portal, it'll actually go through the

144
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,860
portal. That's one. issue, this is what we want
to happen right here where we go into swimming

145
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,420
Amose, and having the chain above us does that,
but it doesn't seem to happen consistently, but

146
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,040
when that happens we like instantly start going
through the portal whence we tell eports, which

147
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,000
is the dream, so I'll either teleport into the
water on to the portal block or somewhere in

148
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,770
between, We wan a telleport somewhere in
between ike, we just did if he were going through

149
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,360
the portal or getting tha happering screen
thing, and while we're here we can still throw

150
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,470
the pearl down within the four seconds it takes
to go through, so that's the perfect situation.

151
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,730
But you see this time it didn't happen. we're
standing on the portal blocks and sometimes we

152
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,570
go in the water even so I don't know why it's not
consistent and that is why this isn't really

153
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:41,710
working out that time a girl went through the
portal. Honestly, though, I think this is the

154
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,900
case where I'm being more fancy than I need to be
like. If you think about it, my goal is to have a

155
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,780
button at an anterporter to take me to the nether
portal, and we can build nether portals

156
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,500
wherever we want. Why wat? don't we disfild a
another portal at each interporter and then

157
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,240
have a button to go through, the big downside I
would say to this, though, is it's going to be

158
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,750
harder to make it look good. Because a obsidian
doesn't look the best. Then it s can take more

159
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,500
space and all that kind of stuff comparato is
tellporting somewhere else in going through a

160
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,180
portel. Yeah, I'm not sure the best way of doing
that. To be honest, I migt have to think about it a

161
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,620
bit more. Maybe gi's have ideas for it. Ah, but
we're 'n changed things up. now we're over at the

162
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,910
lab. I thought we'd do a little bit of progress
here. This is a small bild. so I think by far I

163
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,370
asked you guys what I should add to this thing.
and uh, one important thing I forgot was the

164
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,630
Aquaf affinity Helmits were going to add like a
somewhere to pick that up here. But uh, what I

165
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:43,040
want to build today is another suggestion. You
guys had to add some kind of ah like cobblestone

166
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,780
generator, I think that's a good idea because
this is the mining lab and that would be a way of

167
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:52,800
generating infinite blocks to test out the
mining on right. Ai. It kind of fits the theme.

168
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:02,310
What's the centere here right over there is the
technical way of the lining things up. Make sure

169
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:08,290
you don't move your mouse round too much. Ah,
okay, I think this is the middle right over here.

170
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:14,690
So what we're goin to do E is buille like a
Collstone generator, but that's not all. I also

171
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:20,109
want to build a stone generator and a Basult
generator and try combine them altogether.

172
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,829
Each one has a different hardness, so that's
great for testing. things in thin will do like

173
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,780
bassalts, maybe stone here and cobblestone
over here, and like, tried to squeeze em this

174
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,810
close together and built some sort of like
decorative machine for it, Ah, there's one

175
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,990
group of blocks. I very rarely usin this game.
It's the glaze terracotta, but I recently saw

176
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,430
like some one use it in a bill that An they
combined like five to seven different colors of

177
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,920
glaze, tarr, cottat, thegether, and it looked
so cool. It really inspired me to try use the

178
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:00,230
stuff. E, more, um, but man, I suck at it. Okay, I
think this'll work O this word that's cool

179
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,230
right, It's an odd number, right. So you gotta?
we gotta do something weird with it. Thes stuff

180
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,280
works best when you're working with even
numbers Cays, T. it's like two by two patterns.

181
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,260
Now Can lets do like this Will get the doughnuts.
Then I think that'll be good. Yeah, okay, I'm

182
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,390
happy with that. Maybe let's bump this back one
more block. Actually, Okay, Well, we got a basic

183
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,340
shape for our machine figured out now I will have
to dress. it up a lot, though I'm an Adda border

184
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,790
around round here. The idea behind the magma
block is like handling in a metal factory when

185
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:40,150
they're excruding metal. I want to make it look
at Uor, squeezing Nhiss through a dye, and it's

186
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,770
like henging up the area around it. You know. Ah,
we're going to add some signs above this

187
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:51,010
properly with their hardness levels and stuff
like bats. I want to get some pipes running in

188
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:57,180
tear with water and lava, and also like some
campfires to make you lookike it, smoking or

189
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,520
steaming. But before we get to fully decorating
this sing, let's actually make sure we can do the

190
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,610
red stone part of it. Usually when I do red some, I
figure out the interface first, so we kinda got a

191
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:13,030
idea of what we're doing now and then you do the
red stone, then you do the final detailing O, K,

192
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:18,680
so cause sometimes like, you'll you'll do the
red stones and you'll figure out. Oh, I need more

193
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,990
space than this or something, And then it's like
impossible to make it work. And if you've

194
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,150
detailed everything, that's all just wasted
effort. then Um, okay, so we'e got ta get Sol soil

195
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:41,750
below. We gott get ice. We ca get lava on the other
side or piston over here. Oky, that's basult

196
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,670
dun, now e te copestone, Okay, so we built
another smart piston over here, we're going to

197
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,350
have water next to the note, flock. it'll go down
and then we're going to make the lava flow into

198
00:19:52,350 --> 00:20:01,900
that. Think we can treak this now? I hope M
Colpstone, Yes, Yes, and then for the stone one,

199
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,010
it's going to be a bit more tricky. Ecause. We
can't do the note block, smart piston thing,

200
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,770
What we're going to do instead. We'v gotta
observer down there. It's going to try detect

201
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,850
when the water disappears, so if the stone
appears, the water will disappear and it will

202
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:24,260
make the piston extend. Is the thought anyways?
Let's see if that actually works Ey that shuts

203
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:33,230
off the water or it pushes twice. It seems to be
fine though the ho snapper's all right.

204
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,780
Everybody, check it out. We got er done. We
worked out the final details on this thing. Ah,

205
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,870
so we got a lava pipe flowing into one side. We got
a water, pipe into the other. they combined

206
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:48,580
together to make the differenc to different
stones here. Ah, put some orange glass on the

207
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,350
lavaside, blue glass on the the water side. In
the middle we got brown glass, and in the back

208
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:00,590
there we got some camp fires with the the smoke or
the steam rising up is put Tdawn on top of our

209
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:07,040
redstone, seems to work Oky, and yea, that's
about its. A. These are supposed to be like

210
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,770
pressure, gages and stuff. I don' know. I'm not
the best, look like imaginary details. Oh, we

211
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,520
got some vents in the back, Yere with the blast
furnaces and uh, well and all, I'm pretty happy

212
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,900
with it. It felt pretty lonely on its own side.
Added in some more of these column things as like

213
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,190
a color contrast An the he bulket up. I got
anether brick on the back there like we did over

214
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:38,610
there to keep in consistent and all in all seems
to be good, so when we mind thes out, they'll

215
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:48,900
start ot of producing hast thot our tools. Then
this an's orgin rigt gat ya oky. got worried for a

216
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:55,550
second. There is is very slow. Ah, anyway, is it?
It's kind of like a dimmiky fun little bild, but I

217
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,090
enjoy doing it. so I hope he as like te few, but
anyways, guys, I think it's about time we wrap up

218
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:05,790
for to day, so the common says Hey etho, I notice
that you explained the mechanics of Minecraft,

219
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,270
like the Speed Potion trick and things like
that. I really appreciate these things because

220
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:18,180
they make me better at the yame. On With my
question, why did you start doing this? Yes, I

221
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,740
would say. Ah, like talking about Jame Mccanx.
has been prettykey to the series Lik ever since

222
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,040
it started. That's just something we've always
kind a done right. I think a large reason for that

223
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:34,360
is because it's just the way I naturally tend to
play video games. I love learning games at a base

224
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,640
level, Like the key mechanics on how they work.
Um, not just mycraf. like all games. it's like

225
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,870
something I focus on a lot. Um, for whatever
reason, this is something I enjoy and then a lot

226
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,700
of people hate replaying video games, Like if
they have to start over or something. they just

227
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,870
dread it, but I love it for some reason cause
usually ill, I'll play through and then the

228
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,070
second time I play through, it's like Oh, I gon t
apply all these things I learnt the first time

229
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,470
and play much better the second time and then the
third time you get do even better and it feels

230
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,670
rewarding that way to me, which is probably one
of the main reasons why Rogue likes are one of my

231
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,980
favorite types of games. A, because they're
designed, for replayability in improving

232
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,660
their skills and stuff. Um, but yeah, just in
general, I think learning games at a base level

233
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,110
makes you better at them and adds more depth to
the game. so you appreciate them. More Mind

234
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:30,190
Draft becomes more interesting to people that
way and all in all, I think it's a good thing,

235
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:36,340
right, I hope anyways. Hope you guys enjoy
today's episode. Thank you for watching until

236
00:23:36,340 --> 00:00:00,000
the next one, take care, have a good date. Don't
hit the iron gollum by light
