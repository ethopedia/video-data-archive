00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:10,349
greetings again all my wonderful viewers
 

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,020
greetings again all my wonderful viewers
this is etho here's my plan okay I've

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,030
this is etho here's my plan okay I've
 

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,460
this is etho here's my plan okay I've
been looking at the silverfish farm

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,470
been looking at the silverfish farm
 

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,800
been looking at the silverfish farm
again I'm still not using it like I

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:18,810
again I'm still not using it like I
 

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,980
again I'm still not using it like I
originally intended to and I've been

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:21,990
originally intended to and I've been
 

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,590
originally intended to and I've been
trying to figure out what I need to do

12
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:24,600
trying to figure out what I need to do
 

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,620
trying to figure out what I need to do
to change it so I've been looking around

14
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:27,630
to change it so I've been looking around
 

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,269
to change it so I've been looking around
and I think the main problem I'm having

16
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
and I think the main problem I'm having
 

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,520
and I think the main problem I'm having
or the main reason why I don't just come

18
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,530
or the main reason why I don't just come
 

19
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,370
or the main reason why I don't just come
and knock the silverfish out it's

20
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:37,380
and knock the silverfish out it's
 

21
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,830
and knock the silverfish out it's
because I have it set up with six layers

22
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
because I have it set up with six layers
 

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,819
because I have it set up with six layers
and if I'm hitting silverfish down here

24
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:46,829
and if I'm hitting silverfish down here
 

25
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,150
and if I'm hitting silverfish down here
the top two layers they'll never come

26
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
the top two layers they'll never come
 

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,779
the top two layers they'll never come
out of there too far away so I have to

28
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:53,789
out of there too far away so I have to
 

29
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,020
out of there too far away so I have to
sort of manually remove them which is a

30
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,030
sort of manually remove them which is a
 

31
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,299
sort of manually remove them which is a
problem the other issue is like when I

32
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:02,309
problem the other issue is like when I
 

33
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,609
problem the other issue is like when I
originally made this I made it the size

34
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:04,619
originally made this I made it the size
 

35
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,039
originally made this I made it the size
it is so that's if I was to kill all the

36
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:07,049
it is so that's if I was to kill all the
 

37
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,010
it is so that's if I was to kill all the
silverfish I would get to level 50 which

38
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,020
silverfish I would get to level 50 which
 

39
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,530
silverfish I would get to level 50 which
was the maximum or what you needed to

40
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:12,540
was the maximum or what you needed to
 

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,010
was the maximum or what you needed to
enchant stuff back in the day that's

42
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,020
enchant stuff back in the day that's
 

43
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,260
enchant stuff back in the day that's
changed and there was also another

44
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,270
changed and there was also another
 

45
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,149
changed and there was also another
problem like if I was to have all those

46
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
problem like if I was to have all those
 

47
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,820
problem like if I was to have all those
silverfish released it would cause

48
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:22,830
silverfish released it would cause
 

49
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,660
silverfish released it would cause
tremendous legs so I never was able to

50
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:26,670
tremendous legs so I never was able to
 

51
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,609
tremendous legs so I never was able to
do that anyway so I think this is what

52
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:31,619
do that anyway so I think this is what
 

53
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,550
do that anyway so I think this is what
I'm going to do this bottom room here is

54
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm going to do this bottom room here is
 

55
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,770
I'm going to do this bottom room here is
not really useful to me the snow golems

56
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:38,780
not really useful to me the snow golems
 

57
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,740
not really useful to me the snow golems
they're cool but really they don't they

58
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:42,750
they're cool but really they don't they
 

59
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,700
they're cool but really they don't they
don't work like I intended

60
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:45,710
don't work like I intended
 

61
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,960
don't work like I intended
well they do make the silverfish come

62
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:47,970
well they do make the silverfish come
 

63
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,899
well they do make the silverfish come
out but they're way too slow and now I

64
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:50,909
out but they're way too slow and now I
 

65
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,819
out but they're way too slow and now I
can make the silverfish come out using

66
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:52,829
can make the silverfish come out using
 

67
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,539
can make the silverfish come out using
poison potions or or other means so

68
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:58,549
poison potions or or other means so
 

69
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:02,060
poison potions or or other means so
novelty effect of these guys is gone so

70
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,070
novelty effect of these guys is gone so
 

71
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,889
novelty effect of these guys is gone so
you're fired you're fired you're fired

72
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:06,899
you're fired you're fired you're fired
 

73
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,930
you're fired you're fired you're fired
you're fired you're fired and that's it

74
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:11,940
you're fired you're fired and that's it
 

75
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,070
you're fired you're fired and that's it
okay

76
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,080
okay
 

77
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,160
okay
so what I'm going to do let's see I

78
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,170
so what I'm going to do let's see I
 

79
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,270
so what I'm going to do let's see I
think what I should do is raise the

80
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
think what I should do is raise the
 

81
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,420
think what I should do is raise the
floor up to this level here then I'll

82
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:23,430
floor up to this level here then I'll
 

83
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,430
floor up to this level here then I'll
remove two more blocks so I can walk

84
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
remove two more blocks so I can walk
 

85
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,770
remove two more blocks so I can walk
underneath that will leave three layers

86
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:27,780
underneath that will leave three layers
 

87
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,680
underneath that will leave three layers
of silverfish blocks and that seems

88
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:29,690
of silverfish blocks and that seems
 

89
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,730
of silverfish blocks and that seems
pretty ideal actually I'll be able to

90
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:34,740
pretty ideal actually I'll be able to
 

91
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,000
pretty ideal actually I'll be able to
get them all out really easily it'll

92
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,010
get them all out really easily it'll
 

93
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,470
get them all out really easily it'll
still look pretty much the same we'll

94
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,480
still look pretty much the same we'll
 

95
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,010
still look pretty much the same we'll
just not have these little rooms for the

96
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,020
just not have these little rooms for the
 

97
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,130
just not have these little rooms for the
snow golems I'm going to raise this

98
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,140
snow golems I'm going to raise this
 

99
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,380
snow golems I'm going to raise this
floor up it'll look exactly the same

100
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,390
floor up it'll look exactly the same
 

101
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,080
floor up it'll look exactly the same
might have to why I will have to change

102
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,090
might have to why I will have to change
 

103
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,140
might have to why I will have to change
some stuff with the tunnel but all in

104
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,150
some stuff with the tunnel but all in
 

105
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,760
some stuff with the tunnel but all in
all I think it'll work a lot better that

106
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:55,770
all I think it'll work a lot better that
 

107
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,090
all I think it'll work a lot better that
way

108
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,100
way
 

109
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,150
way
so that is what we're going to do to

110
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,160
so that is what we're going to do to
 

111
00:02:59,160 --> 00:05:10,270
so that is what we're going to do to
start out with today renovations begin

112
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,280

 

113
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,249

kyoool so I got most of that changed

114
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:13,259
kyoool so I got most of that changed
 

115
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:13,999
kyoool so I got most of that changed
over

116
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:14,009
over
 

117
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,490
over
so yeah this room still looks the same

118
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,500
so yeah this room still looks the same
 

119
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,090
so yeah this room still looks the same
like it's not going to look different

120
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,100
like it's not going to look different
 

121
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,710
like it's not going to look different
still looks the same down here only

122
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:21,720
still looks the same down here only
 

123
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,600
still looks the same down here only
difference is we got rid of that bottom

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:23,610
difference is we got rid of that bottom
 

125
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,350
difference is we got rid of that bottom
layer which we didn't really need and

126
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:26,360
layer which we didn't really need and
 

127
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,450
layer which we didn't really need and
yeah instead of going just three layers

128
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,460
yeah instead of going just three layers
 

129
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,129
yeah instead of going just three layers
I kept it at four because I don't want

130
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:34,139
I kept it at four because I don't want
 

131
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,710
I kept it at four because I don't want
the life I went one higher the

132
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
the life I went one higher the
 

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,480
the life I went one higher the
silverfish would start jumping up into

134
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:38,490
silverfish would start jumping up into
 

135
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,960
silverfish would start jumping up into
these places and ya don't want that

136
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:41,970
these places and ya don't want that
 

137
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,680
these places and ya don't want that
happening and four still works so that's

138
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:45,690
happening and four still works so that's
 

139
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,520
happening and four still works so that's
pretty cool

140
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:48,530

 

141
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,820

where was the center that's the center

142
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:54,830

 

143
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,310

how do we want to do this try try maybe

144
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,320
how do we want to do this try try maybe
 

145
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:13,250
how do we want to do this try try maybe
doing that and then finish it cool I'm

146
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,260
doing that and then finish it cool I'm
 

147
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,110
doing that and then finish it cool I'm
also going to try hug up the sensor here

148
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
also going to try hug up the sensor here
 

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,820
also going to try hug up the sensor here
to detect when this thing is full so

150
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:16,830
to detect when this thing is full so
 

151
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,730
to detect when this thing is full so
it'll shut down on its own I never did

152
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:19,740
it'll shut down on its own I never did
 

153
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,420
it'll shut down on its own I never did
end up doing that and we removed two

154
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,430
end up doing that and we removed two
 

155
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:31,969
end up doing that and we removed two
rows of Pistons yeah all right maybe

156
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:31,979
rows of Pistons yeah all right maybe
 

157
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:39,710
rows of Pistons yeah all right maybe
I'll just do salt glass

158
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:39,720

 

159
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,490

so we're going to take a little

160
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:41,500
so we're going to take a little
 

161
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,970
so we're going to take a little
enchantment break here we're at level 33

162

enchantment break here we're at level 33
 

163
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,740
enchantment break here we're at level 33
I was doing a whole bunch of repairing

164
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:46,750
I was doing a whole bunch of repairing
 

165
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,660
I was doing a whole bunch of repairing
another day on the minecraft server and

166
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:48,670
another day on the minecraft server and
 

167
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,060
another day on the minecraft server and
I kind of learnt or like I figured out

168
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,070
I kind of learnt or like I figured out
 

169
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,200
I kind of learnt or like I figured out
what I'm how I'm going to use anvils

170
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,210
what I'm how I'm going to use anvils
 

171
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,540
what I'm how I'm going to use anvils
specifically what I'm going to use it on

172
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,550
specifically what I'm going to use it on
 

173
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,600
specifically what I'm going to use it on
so for armor it's almost always a good

174
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:00,610
so for armor it's almost always a good
 

175
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,010
so for armor it's almost always a good
idea to use the repair on it because you

176
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,020
idea to use the repair on it because you
 

177
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,600
idea to use the repair on it because you
can get any diamond piece from

178
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:08,610
can get any diamond piece from
 

179
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,000
can get any diamond piece from
completely broken to fully repaired

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,010
completely broken to fully repaired
 

181
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,909
completely broken to fully repaired
basically with 4 diamonds so that is a

182
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:14,919
basically with 4 diamonds so that is a
 

183
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,200
basically with 4 diamonds so that is a
good deal plus you get to keep the

184
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,210
good deal plus you get to keep the
 

185
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,480
good deal plus you get to keep the
enchantment you got so protection for is

186
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,490
enchantment you got so protection for is
 

187
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,710
enchantment you got so protection for is
a very good enchantment and if you only

188
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:25,720
a very good enchantment and if you only
 

189
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,200
a very good enchantment and if you only
got that on a piece of armor it's pretty

190
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,210
got that on a piece of armor it's pretty
 

191
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,750
got that on a piece of armor it's pretty
cheap XP level wise - to repair it it

192
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:33,760
cheap XP level wise - to repair it it
 

193
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,850
cheap XP level wise - to repair it it
does not seem worth it to me to ever

194
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:35,860
does not seem worth it to me to ever
 

195
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,700
does not seem worth it to me to ever
repair a shovel because the shovel costs

196
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:38,710
repair a shovel because the shovel costs
 

197
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,120
repair a shovel because the shovel costs
only one diamond to make and you will

198
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,130
only one diamond to make and you will
 

199
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,630
only one diamond to make and you will
probably spend 4 diamonds to repair it

200
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:47,640

 

201
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,080

Plus XP so you may as well just take a

202
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,090
Plus XP so you may as well just take a
 

203
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,370
Plus XP so you may as well just take a
chance and try to get another good

204
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:53,380
chance and try to get another good
 

205
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,400
chance and try to get another good
shovel just by enchanting it properly so

206
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,410
shovel just by enchanting it properly so
 

207
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,219
shovel just by enchanting it properly so
that's is what I'm going to do with this

208
00:07:59,219 --> 00:07:59,229
that's is what I'm going to do with this
 

209
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:05,790
that's is what I'm going to do with this
it might be worth repairing picks but I

210
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:05,800
it might be worth repairing picks but I
 

211
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,219
it might be worth repairing picks but I
don't know it's almost worth just

212
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:08,229
don't know it's almost worth just
 

213
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:13,890
don't know it's almost worth just
enchanting a new one always although

214
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:13,900
enchanting a new one always although
 

215
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,200
enchanting a new one always although
like efficiency for unbreaking 3 picks

216
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,210
like efficiency for unbreaking 3 picks
 

217
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,710
like efficiency for unbreaking 3 picks
now you might want to spend the diamonds

218
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:19,720
now you might want to spend the diamonds
 

219
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,690
now you might want to spend the diamonds
on it because you'll spend 4 diamonds on

220
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:21,700
on it because you'll spend 4 diamonds on
 

221
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,570
on it because you'll spend 4 diamonds on
a pick that you could get with 3 plus

222
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:24,580
a pick that you could get with 3 plus
 

223
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,300
a pick that you could get with 3 plus
it'll cost you a few extra levels with

224
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,310
it'll cost you a few extra levels with
 

225
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,420
it'll cost you a few extra levels with
XP like three more levels to fully

226
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,430
XP like three more levels to fully
 

227
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,610
XP like three more levels to fully
repair it but it might be worth it

228
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:35,620

 

229
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,560

stuff with three enchantments like I

230
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:37,570
stuff with three enchantments like I
 

231
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,300
stuff with three enchantments like I
don't think I would ever try repairing

232
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:39,310
don't think I would ever try repairing
 

233
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,870
don't think I would ever try repairing
that or stuff like this I don't think

234
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
that or stuff like this I don't think
 

235
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,140
that or stuff like this I don't think
it's worth it because you have to repair

236
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,150
it's worth it because you have to repair
 

237
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,760
it's worth it because you have to repair
it like 4 times get it all the way

238
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:47,770
it like 4 times get it all the way
 

239
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,570
it like 4 times get it all the way
repaired and it costs so if you

240
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:51,580
repaired and it costs so if you
 

241
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,050
repaired and it costs so if you
like 120 levels so it's not really worth

242
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,060
like 120 levels so it's not really worth
 

243
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,210
like 120 levels so it's not really worth
it for anything with three enchantments

244
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,220
it for anything with three enchantments
 

245
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,470
it for anything with three enchantments
with swords again it's not really worth

246
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
with swords again it's not really worth
 

247
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,170
with swords again it's not really worth
enchanting just any old sword I would

248
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,180
enchanting just any old sword I would
 

249
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,000
enchanting just any old sword I would
probably use it with a looting three

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,010
probably use it with a looting three
 

251
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,380
probably use it with a looting three
sword though but that's about it

252
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,390
sword though but that's about it
 

253
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,500
sword though but that's about it
and yeah axes they take three diamonds

254
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,510
and yeah axes they take three diamonds
 

255
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,210
and yeah axes they take three diamonds
so you might want to repair those same

256
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,220
so you might want to repair those same
 

257
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,500
so you might want to repair those same
as picks not that I ever use axes

293
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,590
you broke me broke me pants man with the
silverfish problem I still don't think

294
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:22,600
silverfish problem I still don't think
 

295
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,880
silverfish problem I still don't think
it's working where I can get them

296
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:23,890
it's working where I can get them
 

297
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,810
it's working where I can get them
through this portal so we'll just

298
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:27,820
through this portal so we'll just
 

299
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,210
through this portal so we'll just
double-check that

300
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,220
double-check that
 

301
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,400
double-check that
oh okay maybe it is working that is the

302
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,410
oh okay maybe it is working that is the
 

303
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,430
oh okay maybe it is working that is the
very first time I've had a silverfish go

304
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:38,440
very first time I've had a silverfish go
 

305
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,870
very first time I've had a silverfish go
through and stay let's try let's try

306
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
through and stay let's try let's try
 

307
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,470
through and stay let's try let's try
with a few more I say it's a glitch like

308
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:49,480
with a few more I say it's a glitch like
 

309
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,670
with a few more I say it's a glitch like
that it wasn't working few people said

310
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
that it wasn't working few people said
 

311
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,110
that it wasn't working few people said
it was because I was using old

312
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
it was because I was using old
 

313
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,520
it was because I was using old
silverfish I need to use new ones then

314
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,530
silverfish I need to use new ones then
 

315
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:06,290
silverfish I need to use new ones then
you through yeah they're doing it still

316
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:06,300

 

317
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,170

and that might be although it doesn't

318
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,180
and that might be although it doesn't
 

319
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,380
and that might be although it doesn't
