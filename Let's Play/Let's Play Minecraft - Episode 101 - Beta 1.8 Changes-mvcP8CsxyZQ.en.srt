00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:51,889
system we'll go check that out yeah
 

323
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,309
system we'll go check that out yeah

biomes will be re added to the game in
 

327
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:59,559
biomes will be re added to the game in
the 1.9 patch when it comes out which is

328
00:09:59,559 --> 00:09:59,569
the 1.9 patch when it comes out which is
 

329
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,960
the 1.9 patch when it comes out which is
probably not going to be for weeks or

330
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:01,970
probably not going to be for weeks or
 

331
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,170
probably not going to be for weeks or
months from now and since this is where

months from now and since this is where
 

333
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,730
months from now and since this is where
I'm in working I don't really want to

334
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:06,740
I'm in working I don't really want to
 

335
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,559
I'm in working I don't really want to
wait for that yeah anyway let's let's

336
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:11,569
wait for that yeah anyway let's let's
 

337
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,170
wait for that yeah anyway let's let's
check out the hostile mob system so it's

338
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,180
check out the hostile mob system so it's
 

339
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,069
check out the hostile mob system so it's
switch to easy as you know you can't see

340
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
switch to easy as you know you can't see
 

341
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,960
switch to easy as you know you can't see
tags above mobs heads anymore that's

342
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:19,970
tags above mobs heads anymore that's
 

343
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:26,170
tags above mobs heads anymore that's
that's okay with f3 you can see your

344
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,180
that's okay with f3 you can see your
 

345
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,330
that's okay with f3 you can see your
seed now that's cool

346
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:30,340

 

347
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,010

first guy Enderman you still a block

348
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,020
first guy Enderman you still a block
 

349
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,500
first guy Enderman you still a block
already a lot of people are wondering

350
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,510
already a lot of people are wondering
 

351
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,880
already a lot of people are wondering
about the fog thing if you need to

352
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:39,890
about the fog thing if you need to
 

353
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,680
about the fog thing if you need to
change your fog distance I've heard you

354
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:41,690
change your fog distance I've heard you
 

355
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,900
change your fog distance I've heard you
hold f3 and then press F yeah not cool

356
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:46,910
hold f3 and then press F yeah not cool
 

357
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,450
hold f3 and then press F yeah not cool
you can see them Enderman are white when

358
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:49,460
you can see them Enderman are white when
 

359
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:57,160
you can see them Enderman are white when
they're on low fog that's cool you can

360
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,170
they're on low fog that's cool you can
 

361
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:04,150
they're on low fog that's cool you can
use this x-ray yeah so hostile mob

362
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
use this x-ray yeah so hostile mob
 

363
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,390
use this x-ray yeah so hostile mob
systems it's possible to make them work

364
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:07,400
systems it's possible to make them work
 

365
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,590
systems it's possible to make them work
still I would have to adjust this I

366
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
still I would have to adjust this I
 

367
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,140
still I would have to adjust this I
don't know if there's any blocks that

368
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,150
don't know if there's any blocks that
 

369
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,860
don't know if there's any blocks that
Enderman can spawn on or that mobs can

370
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:17,870
Enderman can spawn on or that mobs can
 

371
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,080
Enderman can spawn on or that mobs can
spawn on that they won't the Enderman

372
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,090
spawn on that they won't the Enderman
 

373
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,180
spawn on that they won't the Enderman
won't pick up I'm not sure about that

374
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,190
won't pick up I'm not sure about that
 

375
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,310
won't pick up I'm not sure about that
yet I'm guessing there is at least one

376
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
yet I'm guessing there is at least one
 

377
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,640
yet I'm guessing there is at least one
or two different types so I could have

378
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:27,650
or two different types so I could have
 

379
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,920
or two different types so I could have
to change everything to whatever type

380
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:29,930
to change everything to whatever type
 

381
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,240
to change everything to whatever type
that is or the other option is to lower

382
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,250
that is or the other option is to lower
 

383
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,730
that is or the other option is to lower
the ceiling in there to only two high

384
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:36,740
the ceiling in there to only two high
 

385
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,680
the ceiling in there to only two high
instead of three high so that Enderman

386
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:38,690
instead of three high so that Enderman
 

387
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,700
instead of three high so that Enderman
won't spawn but as is right now my mob

388
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:42,710
won't spawn but as is right now my mob
 

389
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,280
won't spawn but as is right now my mob
systems are all broken

390
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,290
systems are all broken
 

391
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,870
systems are all broken
Enderman will take pieces away until

392
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
Enderman will take pieces away until
 

393
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,990
Enderman will take pieces away until
water starts flowing down and it totally

394
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
water starts flowing down and it totally
 

395
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,020
water starts flowing down and it totally
gets messed up same with on chocolate

396
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,030
gets messed up same with on chocolate
 

397
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,050
gets messed up same with on chocolate
island all those mob systems are broken

398
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,060
island all those mob systems are broken
 

399
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,000
island all those mob systems are broken
the passive one and the hostile one I

400
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,010
the passive one and the hostile one I
 

401
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,660
the passive one and the hostile one I
would have to spend a bit of time to fix

402
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:01,670
would have to spend a bit of time to fix
 

403
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,790
would have to spend a bit of time to fix
the hostile one there as well so just

404
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
the hostile one there as well so just
 

405
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,620
the hostile one there as well so just
more reasons why I'm thinking of making

406
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:08,630
more reasons why I'm thinking of making
 

407
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:15,750
more reasons why I'm thinking of making
new world

408
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760

 

409
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,100

yeah so this is what happens is keep

410
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,110
yeah so this is what happens is keep
 

411
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,290
yeah so this is what happens is keep
ripping pieces out and it falls apart

412
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:20,300
ripping pieces out and it falls apart
 

413
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,970
ripping pieces out and it falls apart
water starts flowing like it's not

414
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:21,980
water starts flowing like it's not
 

415
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,610
water starts flowing like it's not
supposed to and it just stops working

416
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:24,620
supposed to and it just stops working
 

417
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,240
supposed to and it just stops working
after time so this next issue is a

418
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,250
after time so this next issue is a
 

419
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,370
after time so this next issue is a
really big one and it's actually the one

420
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,380
really big one and it's actually the one
 

421
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,260
really big one and it's actually the one
that made me realize that I probably

422
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,270
that made me realize that I probably
 

423
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,680
that made me realize that I probably
should just start a new LP world it's a

424
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:38,690
should just start a new LP world it's a
 

425
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,690
should just start a new LP world it's a
severe issue I don't think there's any

426
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:40,700
severe issue I don't think there's any
 

427
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,630
severe issue I don't think there's any
way around it as many of you know

428
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:45,640
way around it as many of you know
 

429
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,430
way around it as many of you know
landscape generation has changed in the

430
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:48,440
landscape generation has changed in the
 

431
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,780
landscape generation has changed in the
1.8 patch now maps are generated using

432
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:52,790
1.8 patch now maps are generated using
 

433
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,990
1.8 patch now maps are generated using
fractals which allows for some pretty

434
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
fractals which allows for some pretty
 

435
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,680
fractals which allows for some pretty
pretty amazing landscapes in the 1.8

436
00:12:59,680 --> 00:12:59,690
pretty amazing landscapes in the 1.8
 

437
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,750
pretty amazing landscapes in the 1.8
worlds but unfortunately the 1.73 worlds

438
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:04,760
worlds but unfortunately the 1.73 worlds
 

439
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,320
worlds but unfortunately the 1.73 worlds
and the 1.8 world generation does not

440
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,330
and the 1.8 world generation does not
 

441
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,750
and the 1.8 world generation does not
work together anymore and so this is

442
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:10,760
work together anymore and so this is
 

443
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,350
work together anymore and so this is
this is a boundary of my 1.73 worlds

444
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:14,360
this is a boundary of my 1.73 worlds
 

445
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,100
this is a boundary of my 1.73 worlds
this is where the 1.8 begins this is a

446
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,110
this is where the 1.8 begins this is a
 

447
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,570
this is where the 1.8 begins this is a
problem all 1.73 worlds have there's

448
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:22,580
problem all 1.73 worlds have there's
 

449
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,830
problem all 1.73 worlds have there's
ocean biome all around the newly

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:26,840
ocean biome all around the newly
 

451
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,990
ocean biome all around the newly
generated around the old chunks and they

452
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
generated around the old chunks and they
 

453
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,760
generated around the old chunks and they
stretch on for miles as far as I know

454
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:35,770
stretch on for miles as far as I know
 

455
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,830
stretch on for miles as far as I know
even in COEs world he started he made

456
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:38,840
even in COEs world he started he made
 

457
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,510
even in COEs world he started he made
another portal and he went a long

458
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:40,520
another portal and he went a long
 

459
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,580
another portal and he went a long
distance in his world and he he had the

460
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:45,590
distance in his world and he he had the
 

461
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,200
distance in his world and he he had the
same problem he started in an ocean

462
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,210
same problem he started in an ocean
 

463
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,050
same problem he started in an ocean
biome and it seemed to just stretch on

464
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,060
biome and it seemed to just stretch on
 

465
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,620
biome and it seemed to just stretch on
and on

466
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:50,630
and on
 

467
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,750
and on
there will be islands in it and stuff

468
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:52,760
there will be islands in it and stuff
 

469
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,620
there will be islands in it and stuff
but I don't know if there is actually

470
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:56,630
but I don't know if there is actually
 

471
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,250
but I don't know if there is actually
any of the other biomes beside ocean I'm

472
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,260
any of the other biomes beside ocean I'm
 

473
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,140
any of the other biomes beside ocean I'm
going to keep I'm going to go as far as

474
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,150
going to keep I'm going to go as far as
 

475
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,300
going to keep I'm going to go as far as
I can and see if I see like a swamp

476
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,310
I can and see if I see like a swamp
 

477
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,750
I can and see if I see like a swamp
biome or something one of the new ones

478
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760

 

479

529
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,929

also I'm not really sure what to do if I

530
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:29,939
also I'm not really sure what to do if I
 

531
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:31,790
also I'm not really sure what to do if I
do start in a world like should I

532
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:31,800
do start in a world like should I
 

533
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,619
do start in a world like should I
continue from episode 102 like should

534
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:36,629
continue from episode 102 like should
 

535
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,119
continue from episode 102 like should
that be the first episode in the new

536
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:38,129
that be the first episode in the new
 

537
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:41,660
that be the first episode in the new
world or should I just start give it a

538
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:41,670
world or should I just start give it a
 

539
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,790
world or should I just start give it a
new name and stuff like doc am did with

540
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:43,800
new name and stuff like doc am did with
 

541

his new world tour let me know about

542
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:49,079
his new world tour let me know about
 

543
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:57,259
his new world tour let me know about
that in these new areas strongholds

544
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:57,269
that in these new areas strongholds
 

545
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:00,110
that in these new areas strongholds
won't generate I'm pretty sure villages

546
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,120
won't generate I'm pretty sure villages
 

547
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,119
won't generate I'm pretty sure villages
don't generate and I'm not sure but I'm

548
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:02,129
don't generate and I'm not sure but I'm
 

549
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,720
don't generate and I'm not sure but I'm
guessing the abandoned mineshafts might

550
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:05,730
guessing the abandoned mineshafts might
 

551
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,710
guessing the abandoned mineshafts might
not generate either kind of hoping to

552
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
not generate either kind of hoping to
 

553
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,530
not generate either kind of hoping to
see one down here but I didn't find one

554
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:13,540
see one down here but I didn't find one
 

555
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,850
see one down here but I didn't find one
the only way to make that happen is if

556
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:15,860
the only way to make that happen is if
 

557
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,780
the only way to make that happen is if
you edit the world file and change one

558
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:22,790
you edit the world file and change one
 

559
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,430
you edit the world file and change one
of the values but yeah this lighting

560
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
of the values but yeah this lighting
 

561
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:36,970
of the values but yeah this lighting
this new lighting is pretty cool okay so

562
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:36,980
this new lighting is pretty cool okay so
 

563
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,040
this new lighting is pretty cool okay so

okay so passive mob spawning is

612
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:28,980
okay so passive mob spawning is
 

613
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,100
okay so passive mob spawning is
completely different now it's no longer

614
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,110
completely different now it's no longer
 

615

completely different now it's no longer
just if mobs are 24 blocks away from you

616
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:37,179
just if mobs are 24 blocks away from you
 

617
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,169
just if mobs are 24 blocks away from you
and within the 144 boundary type thing

618

and within the 144 boundary type thing
 

619
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:40,940
and within the 144 boundary type thing
anymore

620
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:40,950
anymore
 

621
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,320
anymore

something it seems to randomly decide if
 

629
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,029
something it seems to randomly decide if
it's going to place the passive mobs and

630
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
it's going to place the passive mobs and
 

631
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,639
it's going to place the passive mobs and
they'd spawn on other stuff besides

they'd spawn on other stuff besides
 

633

spawn on stone now I'm pretty sure they
 

639
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:20,690
spawn on stone now I'm pretty sure they
can spawn on blogs like wood soil grass

640
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:20,700
can spawn on blogs like wood soil grass
 

641
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,580
can spawn on blogs like wood soil grass
probably quite a few other blocks I'm

642
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:23,590
probably quite a few other blocks I'm
 

643
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,430
probably quite a few other blocks I'm
sure there's a few types they don't like

644
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:26,440
sure there's a few types they don't like
 

645
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,990
sure there's a few types they don't like
half slabs water

half slabs water
 

647
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,049
half slabs water
that stuff's probably the same where

648
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:31,059
that stuff's probably the same where
 

649
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,950
that stuff's probably the same where
they can't spawn on it there's also some

650
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
they can't spawn on it there's also some
 

651
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
they can't spawn on it there's also some
other conditions like they will not

652
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,450
other conditions like they will not
 

653
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,680
other conditions like they will not
spawn in certain biomes from what I

654
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:39,690
spawn in certain biomes from what I
 

655
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,759
spawn in certain biomes from what I
understand what I understand and from

what I've seen I talked to a guy named
 

659
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:48,990
what I've seen I talked to a guy named
the sprue today and he said they will

660
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,000
the sprue today and he said they will
 

661
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,440
the sprue today and he said they will
not spawn in ocean or desert biomes even

662
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:52,450
not spawn in ocean or desert biomes even
 

663
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,799
not spawn in ocean or desert biomes even
if you have grass in them if you place

664
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:55,809
if you have grass in them if you place
 

665
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:58,799
if you have grass in them if you place
grass in a desert biome you won't get

666
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:58,809
grass in a desert biome you won't get
 

667
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:01,889
grass in a desert biome you won't get
any passive mobs and I agree with that

668
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:01,899
any passive mobs and I agree with that
 

669
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:07,519
any passive mobs and I agree with that
that's what I've seen as well

670
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:07,529

 

671
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:10,649

yeah today I saw a pig spawn on top of a

672
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:10,659
yeah today I saw a pig spawn on top of a
 

673
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,619
yeah today I saw a pig spawn on top of a
tree like the very top would blocked in

674
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:13,629
tree like the very top would blocked in
 

675
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,749
tree like the very top would blocked in
a tree is where he spawned inside of a

676
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:15,759
a tree is where he spawned inside of a
 

677
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,289
a tree is where he spawned inside of a
leaf block which was very weird and he

678
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:19,299
leaf block which was very weird and he
 

679
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:23,759
leaf block which was very weird and he
was like stuck there the sprue also sent

680
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:23,769
was like stuck there the sprue also sent
 

681
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,860
was like stuck there the sprue also sent
me some pictures showing pigs on top of

682
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:25,870
me some pictures showing pigs on top of
 

683
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,710
me some pictures showing pigs on top of
a roof and one of the buildings of the

684
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
a roof and one of the buildings of the
 

685
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
a roof and one of the buildings of the
village there's no way they could've got

686
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:30,730
village there's no way they could've got
 

687
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,279
village there's no way they could've got
up there unless they spawned and it was

688
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:32,289
up there unless they spawned and it was
 

689
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,190
up there unless they spawned and it was
like a cobblestone roof if I remember

690
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
like a cobblestone roof if I remember
 

691
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,430
like a cobblestone roof if I remember
right

692
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440

 

693
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,930

so yeah I don't know how lighting

694
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:39,940
so yeah I don't know how lighting
 

695
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,380
so yeah I don't know how lighting
effects spawning not sure if it has any

696
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:43,390
effects spawning not sure if it has any
 

697
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,590
effects spawning not sure if it has any
effect I'm guessing it doesn't but yet

698
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:46,600
effect I'm guessing it doesn't but yet
 

699
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,570
effect I'm guessing it doesn't but yet
you don't see any animals in cave

700
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:48,580
you don't see any animals in cave
 

701
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,580
you don't see any animals in cave
systems in the way I believe that works

702
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:50,590
systems in the way I believe that works
 

703
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,580
systems in the way I believe that works
is they only will be placed on the

704
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:53,590
is they only will be placed on the
 

705
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,910
is they only will be placed on the
highest block in a location so they

706
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:56,920
highest block in a location so they
 

707
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,610
highest block in a location so they
could be placed here but they probably

708
00:20:59,610 --> 00:20:59,620
could be placed here but they probably
 

709
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,400
could be placed here but they probably
won't get placed down here assuming this

710
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,410
won't get placed down here assuming this
 

711
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,070
won't get placed down here assuming this
was a soil block because there's a block

712
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,080
was a soil block because there's a block
 

713
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,910
was a soil block because there's a block
above and I believe that's how they

714
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:08,920
above and I believe that's how they
 

715
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,520
above and I believe that's how they
prevent them from spawning inside of how

716
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:11,530
prevent them from spawning inside of how
 

717
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,490
prevent them from spawning inside of how
citizens excuse me and prevent them from

718

citizens excuse me and prevent them from
 

719
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,340
citizens excuse me and prevent them from
spawning inside of houses as well tongue

720
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,350
spawning inside of houses as well tongue
 

721
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,480

twister just my theory I don't know for

722
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,490
twister just my theory I don't know for
 

723
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,550
twister just my theory I don't know for
sure how it works but that's what I've

724
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:23,560
sure how it works but that's what I've
 

725
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,010
sure how it works but that's what I've
observed all right guys anyway I'll

726
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,020
observed all right guys anyway I'll
 

727
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,810
observed all right guys anyway I'll
probably end the episode here today

less resource gathering that kind of
 

763
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,730
less resource gathering that kind of
thing as it as I did established kind of

764
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:23,740
thing as it as I did established kind of
 

765
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,420
thing as it as I did established kind of
like I did this one go back to basics

766
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,430
like I did this one go back to basics
 

767
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,090

and then as I get established we'll get
 

769
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,970
and then as I get established we'll get
back to the complex builds and stuff

770
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:34,980
back to the complex builds and stuff
 

771
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,770
back to the complex builds and stuff
should be good I think it'll be fun if I

772
