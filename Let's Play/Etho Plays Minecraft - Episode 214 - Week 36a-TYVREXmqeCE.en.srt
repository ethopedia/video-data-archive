thing I'm noticing also our level isn't

118
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,150
thing I'm noticing also our level isn't
 

119
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,610
thing I'm noticing also our level isn't
displayed right now so when we went

120
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:45,620
displayed right now so when we went
 

121
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,360
displayed right now so when we went
through the portal it got it disappeared

122
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,370
through the portal it got it disappeared
 

123
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,979
through the portal it got it disappeared
so when we get an XP we're going to go

124
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:50,989
so when we get an XP we're going to go
 

125
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,619
so when we get an XP we're going to go
up to like level 22 it will refresh the

126
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:56,629
up to like level 22 it will refresh the
 

127
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,050
up to like level 22 it will refresh the
rumor I've heard is that they might be

128
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,060
rumor I've heard is that they might be
 

129
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,149
rumor I've heard is that they might be
changing it so the amount of XP you get

130
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,159
changing it so the amount of XP you get
 

131
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,069
changing it so the amount of XP you get
from mobs is proportional to how much

132
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,079
from mobs is proportional to how much
 

133
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,920
from mobs is proportional to how much
damage you deliver and since I'm only

134
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:05,930
damage you deliver and since I'm only
 

135
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,740
damage you deliver and since I'm only
doing half a heart to these guys I might

136
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:08,750
doing half a heart to these guys I might
 

137
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,490
doing half a heart to these guys I might
get very little XP so we shelled check

138
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:12,500
get very little XP so we shelled check
 

139
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,509
get very little XP so we shelled check
that out let's see a quickly level

140
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519

 

141
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,370

seems like it's same as it was before

142
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:20,380
seems like it's same as it was before
 

143
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,580
seems like it's same as it was before
that's good news for me

144
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:22,590
that's good news for me
 

145
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,780
that's good news for me
so I was worried this thing's gonna get

146
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:24,790
so I was worried this thing's gonna get
 

147
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:32,490
so I was worried this thing's gonna get
nerfed and it is I don't know if this is

148
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:32,500
nerfed and it is I don't know if this is
 

149
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,140
nerfed and it is I don't know if this is
quicker than the blaze farm or not the

150
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,150
quicker than the blaze farm or not the
 

151
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,890
quicker than the blaze farm or not the
blaze farm I think is more convenient

152
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:36,900
blaze farm I think is more convenient
 

153
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,320
blaze farm I think is more convenient
fortunately I think that is nerfed kind

154
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,330
fortunately I think that is nerfed kind
 

155
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,460
fortunately I think that is nerfed kind
