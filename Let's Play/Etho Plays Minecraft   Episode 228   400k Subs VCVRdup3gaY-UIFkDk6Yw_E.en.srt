349
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,110
i thought it was the mushroom farm
but no it was this and that's about as

350
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
but no it was this and that's about as
 

351
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,070
but no it was this and that's about as
far as

352
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
far as
 

353
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,829
far as
we got

354
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839

 

355
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,190

tree farms over here

356
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200

 

357
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,110

very cool so we're going to jump back to

358
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
very cool so we're going to jump back to
 

359
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,470
very cool so we're going to jump back to
the proper world and we're going to go

360
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
the proper world and we're going to go
 

361
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,070
the proper world and we're going to go
on a little tour of the place

362
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
on a little tour of the place
 

363
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,269
on a little tour of the place
and maybe i'll just describe a few

364
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
and maybe i'll just describe a few
 

365
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,350
and maybe i'll just describe a few
things in detail and

366
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
things in detail and
 

367
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,630
things in detail and
yeah just a relaxing episode today

368
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640

 

369
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,750

oh yeah i thought this was kind of

370
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
oh yeah i thought this was kind of
 

371
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,310
oh yeah i thought this was kind of
interesting too uh this world

372
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
interesting too uh this world
 

373
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,829
interesting too uh this world
or this biome was a forest uh when i

374
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
or this biome was a forest uh when i
 

375
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,630
or this biome was a forest uh when i
first made it

376
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
first made it
 

377
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,829
first made it
i made this world in i think pre-release

378
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
i made this world in i think pre-release
 

379
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,829
i made this world in i think pre-release
the 1.9 pre-release number three i think

380
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
the 1.9 pre-release number three i think
 

381
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,070
the 1.9 pre-release number three i think
so the biomes were a bit different then

382
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
so the biomes were a bit different then
 

383
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,910
so the biomes were a bit different then
this was a forest this is also

384
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
this was a forest this is also
 

385
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,110
this was a forest this is also
pre-anvil map format um

386
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
pre-anvil map format um
 

387
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,269
pre-anvil map format um
but for some reason when i load it now

388
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
but for some reason when i load it now
 

389
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,550
but for some reason when i load it now
it converts it to a snow biome

390
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
it converts it to a snow biome
 

391
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,350
it converts it to a snow biome
even though i went through the patches

392
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
even though i went through the patches
 

393
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,030
even though i went through the patches
with it being

394
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
with it being
 

395
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,990
with it being
a forest still it's remained a forced so

396
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
a forest still it's remained a forced so
 

397
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,430
a forest still it's remained a forced so
yeah it's kind of interesting

398
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
yeah it's kind of interesting
 

399
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,150
yeah it's kind of interesting
not sure the reason behind that

400
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160

 

401
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,590

there we are so everything's back to

402
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
there we are so everything's back to
 

403
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,750
there we are so everything's back to
normal the way it should be

404
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
normal the way it should be
 

405
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,030
normal the way it should be
this is our world as it is today

406
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
this is our world as it is today
 

407
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,590
this is our world as it is today
and yeah let's go for a world tour why

408
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
and yeah let's go for a world tour why
 

409
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,470
and yeah let's go for a world tour why
not

410
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
not
 

411
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,069
not
it's been requested for ever since i

412
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
it's been requested for ever since i
 

413
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,110
it's been requested for ever since i
brought the idea

414
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
brought the idea
 

415
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,470
brought the idea
back when i did the 200s

416
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
back when i did the 200s
 

417
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,310
back when i did the 200s
there's a lot of mobs here the 200

418
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
there's a lot of mobs here the 200
 

419
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,990
there's a lot of mobs here the 200
200 lp montage thing

420
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
200 lp montage thing
 

421
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,550
200 lp montage thing
um so it's a little strange for me to

422
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
um so it's a little strange for me to
 

423
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,630
um so it's a little strange for me to
give a world tour because i see

424
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
give a world tour because i see
 

425
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,710
give a world tour because i see
my world all the time i know exactly

426
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
my world all the time i know exactly
 

427
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,069
my world all the time i know exactly
where everything is and what everything

428
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
where everything is and what everything
 

429
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,670
where everything is and what everything
is from and

430
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
is from and
 

431
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,910
is from and
etc etc i kind of assume my subs know

432
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
etc etc i kind of assume my subs know
 

433
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,269
etc etc i kind of assume my subs know
that too but

434
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
that too but
 

435
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,509
that too but
really i do get a lot of new subs every

436
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
really i do get a lot of new subs every
 

437
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,470
really i do get a lot of new subs every
day

438
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
day
 

439
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,590
day
currently it's about 1500 or so per day

440
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
currently it's about 1500 or so per day
 

441
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,269
currently it's about 1500 or so per day
so that's a lot of people that don't

442
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
so that's a lot of people that don't
 

443
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,069
so that's a lot of people that don't
know much about

444
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
know much about
 

445
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,069
know much about
me and don't know much about my world

uh this was the main area where we

470
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
uh this was the main area where we
 

471
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,750
uh this was the main area where we
settled down

472
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
settled down
 

473
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,910
settled down
uh first thing we built was the creeper

474
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
uh first thing we built was the creeper
 

475
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,509
uh first thing we built was the creeper
face down there

face down there
 

477
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,870
face down there
and then i sort of i

478
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
and then i sort of i
 

479
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,870
and then i sort of i
mostly started developing in here

480
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
mostly started developing in here
 

481
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,470
mostly started developing in here
because this is where

482
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
because this is where
 

483
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,069
because this is where
i saw abandoned mine shaft it was the

484
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
i saw abandoned mine shaft it was the
 

485
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,870
i saw abandoned mine shaft it was the
first one i ever found in this area

486
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
first one i ever found in this area
 

487
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,069
first one i ever found in this area
and nice flat ground easy to build stuff

488
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
and nice flat ground easy to build stuff
 

489
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,550
and nice flat ground easy to build stuff
so

490
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
so
 

491
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,110

too
 

495
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,870
too
pretty straight walls so this made a

496
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
pretty straight walls so this made a
 

497
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,230
pretty straight walls so this made a
nice building area

498
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
nice building area
 

499
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,069
nice building area

here
 

667
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,269
here
i had it timed out perfectly so i could

668
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
i had it timed out perfectly so i could
 

669
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,829
i had it timed out perfectly so i could
just make it to the end

670
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
just make it to the end
 

671
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,710
just make it to the end
by the time this one would be finished

672

by the time this one would be finished
but since then they've

674
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
but since then they've
 

675
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,949
but since then they've
increased the potion brewing time so i

676
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
increased the potion brewing time so i
 

677
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,230
increased the potion brewing time so i
can usually do it

678
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
can usually do it
 

679
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,030
can usually do it
a lot faster i can fill up the bottles

680
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240

 

1031
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,390

there's uh four groups of bookshelves

that you can move up or down

1034
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,000
that you can move up or down
 

1035
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,630
that you can move up or down
to control levels of course you don't

1036
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
to control levels of course you don't
 

1037
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,470
to control levels of course you don't
need as many bookshelves anymore so this

1038
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
need as many bookshelves anymore so this
 

1039

seems
a little bit of all the different blocks

1082
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
a little bit of all the different blocks
 

1083
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,110

fit into
 

1085
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,789

and then i made it work for this
 

1319
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,990
and then i made it work for this
situation so i built two of them

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
my second main base in the world
 

1371
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,990
my second main base in the world
um originally it was a stronghold i

1372
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
um originally it was a stronghold i
 

1373
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,950
um originally it was a stronghold i
found i have

1374
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:44,960
found i have
 

1375
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,230
found i have
changed it up a lot since then

1376
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
changed it up a lot since then
 

1377
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,110
changed it up a lot since then
um so it's got

1378
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
um so it's got
 

1379
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,509
um so it's got
i guess it's got two main things to it

1380
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
i guess it's got two main things to it
 

1381
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,590
i guess it's got two main things to it
there's a silverfish farm here

1382
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
there's a silverfish farm here
 

1383
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,789
there's a silverfish farm here
which is my ongoing struggle to perfect

1384
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
which is my ongoing struggle to perfect
 

1385
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,830
which is my ongoing struggle to perfect
um getting close though getting close

1386
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
um getting close though getting close
 

1387
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,669
um getting close though getting close
it's another one of those over the top

1388
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:09,679
it's another one of those over the top
 

1389
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,630
it's another one of those over the top
not really necessary for anything

1390
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
not really necessary for anything
 

1391
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,389
not really necessary for anything
things that i invented

1392
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399
things that i invented
 

1393
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,029
things that i invented
basically what it does

1394
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:21,039

 

1395
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,750

there's a smooth stone generator back

1396
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:23,760
there's a smooth stone generator back
 

1397
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,350
there's a smooth stone generator back
here

1398
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360

 

1399
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,870

all right and it's set up in such a way

1400
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880
all right and it's set up in such a way
 

1401
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,669
all right and it's set up in such a way
that it can detect when a silverfish

1402
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:33,679
that it can detect when a silverfish
 

1403
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,190
that it can detect when a silverfish
enters

1404
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
enters
 

1405
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,230
enters
one of the smooth stone blocks and then

1406
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,240
one of the smooth stone blocks and then
 

1407
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,430
one of the smooth stone blocks and then
it's

1408
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,440
it's
 

1409
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,870
it's
oh it pushes it forward

1410
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
oh it pushes it forward
 

1411
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,190
oh it pushes it forward
and puts a new smooth stone lock in its

1412
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,200
and puts a new smooth stone lock in its
 

1413
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,389
and puts a new smooth stone lock in its
place so the

1414
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
place so the
 

1415
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,389
place so the
silver fish blocks go down this line and

1416
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
silver fish blocks go down this line and
 

1417
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,549
silver fish blocks go down this line and
they get compacted together into a big

1418
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
they get compacted together into a big
 

1419
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,669
they get compacted together into a big
block

1420
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:53,679
block
 

1421
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,590
block
and stored so that i can

1422
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
and stored so that i can
 

1423
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,350
and stored so that i can
later harvest them for xp something i've

1424
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
later harvest them for xp something i've
 

1425
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,269
later harvest them for xp something i've
the main reason i set it up though is

1426
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:03,279
the main reason i set it up though is
 

1427
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,310
the main reason i set it up though is
for mining i want to get the silverfish

1428
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,320
for mining i want to get the silverfish
 

1429
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,710
for mining i want to get the silverfish
uh to be able to i want to be able to

1430
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
uh to be able to i want to be able to
 

1431
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,349
uh to be able to i want to be able to
transport the silverfish to other areas

1432
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
transport the silverfish to other areas
 

1433
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,669
transport the silverfish to other areas
and just have them go nuts and and

1434
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
and just have them go nuts and and
 

1435
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,790
and just have them go nuts and and
destroy all the blocks and yeah

1436
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
destroy all the blocks and yeah
 

1437
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,030
destroy all the blocks and yeah
and just have fun with that there's uh

1438
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
and just have fun with that there's uh
 

1439
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,869
and just have fun with that there's uh
there's this up here too which i might

1440
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:24,879
there's this up here too which i might
 

1441
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,510
there's this up here too which i might
have to change

1442
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
have to change
 

1443
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,190
have to change
because i think there's stuff blocking

1444
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
because i think there's stuff blocking
 

1445
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,750
because i think there's stuff blocking
it now

1446
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760

 

1447
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,349

uh it's for the lighting below

1448
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
uh it's for the lighting below
 

1449
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,589
uh it's for the lighting below
more lag that's from the silverfish i

1450
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:37,599
more lag that's from the silverfish i
 

1451
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,069
more lag that's from the silverfish i
know

1452
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079

 

1453
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,950

so up here is the base i've been working

1454
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
so up here is the base i've been working
 

1455
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,629
so up here is the base i've been working
on very slowly

1456
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
on very slowly
 

1457
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,909
on very slowly
there's storage in these compartments

1458
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:47,919
there's storage in these compartments
 

1459
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,030
there's storage in these compartments
here

1460
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,040
here
 

1461
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,389
here
which i need to finish

1462
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399

 

1463
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,589

and this is for

1464
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
and this is for
 

1465
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,630
and this is for
mob system stuff which i'm also working

1466
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:58,640
mob system stuff which i'm also working
 

1467
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,069
mob system stuff which i'm also working
on still

1468
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
on still
 

1469
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,950
on still
uh above let's go above i guess

1470
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:06,960

 

1471
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,470

so weird right now i'm blanking on how

1472
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
so weird right now i'm blanking on how
 

1473
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,390
so weird right now i'm blanking on how
to get out of here i just the ladder

1474
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400

 

1475
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,710

oh the pressure of recording

1476
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
oh the pressure of recording
 

1477
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,190
oh the pressure of recording
yeah there's a big mob system up above

1478
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
yeah there's a big mob system up above
 

1479
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,829
yeah there's a big mob system up above
there's also

1480
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839
there's also
 

1481
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,870
there's also
millions and millions of slimes

1482
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:22,880
millions and millions of slimes
 

1483
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,750
millions and millions of slimes
always now i'm gonna have to light up

1484
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:25,760
always now i'm gonna have to light up
 

1485
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,069
always now i'm gonna have to light up
the surface here

1486
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
the surface here
 

1487
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,750
the surface here
it's not something i usually do in my

1488
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760
it's not something i usually do in my
 

1489
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,430
it's not something i usually do in my
worlds because i like the challenge i've

1490
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
worlds because i like the challenge i've
 

1491
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:31,829
worlds because i like the challenge i've
had

1492
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:31,839
had
 

1493
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,030
had
having mobs around you know just extra

1494
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,040
having mobs around you know just extra
 

1495
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,030
having mobs around you know just extra
surprise um but yeah it's affecting my

1496
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,040
surprise um but yeah it's affecting my
 

1497
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,230
surprise um but yeah it's affecting my
mob rates

1498
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
mob rates
 

1499
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,589
mob rates
so that's the big mob farm there

1500
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
so that's the big mob farm there
 

1501
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,349
so that's the big mob farm there
over here i'm going to cut for a sec is

1502
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:47,359
over here i'm going to cut for a sec is
 

1503
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,950
over here i'm going to cut for a sec is
the ice tray i'll show you that

1504
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960

 

1505
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,430

very good so this is the ice tray over

1506
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:53,440
very good so this is the ice tray over
 

1507
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,310
very good so this is the ice tray over
here

1508
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320
here
 

1509
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,230
here
i made this when it was changed where

1510
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,240
i made this when it was changed where
 

1511
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,829
i made this when it was changed where
you could pick ice up with silk touch

1512
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
you could pick ice up with silk touch
 

1513
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,190
you could pick ice up with silk touch
again

1514
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
again
 

1515
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,230
again
and it's set up in such a way that the

1516
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
and it's set up in such a way that the
 

1517
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,310
and it's set up in such a way that the
water freezes very quickly because it's

1518
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
water freezes very quickly because it's
 

1519
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,390
water freezes very quickly because it's
next to a snow block

1520
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
next to a snow block
 

1521
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,829
next to a snow block
or any solid block you can use

1522
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:09,839
or any solid block you can use
 

1523
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,870
or any solid block you can use
um and you can control that

1524
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
um and you can control that
 

1525
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,109
um and you can control that
make them go up and down

1526
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119

 

1527
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,510

and the dispensers here create a big

1528
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,520
and the dispensers here create a big
 

1529
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,630
and the dispensers here create a big
infinite spring of water

1530
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
infinite spring of water
 

1531
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,990
infinite spring of water
which fills up the whole thing with

1532
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,000
which fills up the whole thing with
 

1533
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,910
which fills up the whole thing with
water whenever we mine it out

1534
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920

 

1535
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,589

oh yeah and the reason why i'm

1536
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599

it's a pretty long road there it is so
 

1613
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,030
it's a pretty long road there it is so
it's a piston pusher

1614
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,040
it's a piston pusher
 

1615
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,150
it's a piston pusher
system it drops them down onto that pad

1616
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,160
system it drops them down onto that pad
 

1617
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,190
system it drops them down onto that pad
and then

another
 

1691
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,270
another
big aspect of the game in my opinion

1692
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280

 

1693
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,750

which is that's my weakest point in this
game i would say

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,040
game i would say
 

1701
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,950
