00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,750
if i was to guess because flying takes a
lot out of you

36
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760

00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
you shoot yourself with the arrows and
 

39
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,990
you shoot yourself with the arrows and
that causes food to be lost

40
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
that causes food to be lost
 

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,990
that causes food to be lost
and then to heal up the damage from that

42
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
and then to heal up the damage from that
 

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,230
and then to heal up the damage from that
as well also causes food to be lost now

44
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
as well also causes food to be lost now
 

45
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,190
as well also causes food to be lost now
so

46
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
so
 

47
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,350
so
losing food all over the place it's

48
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
losing food all over the place it's
 

49
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,630
losing food all over the place it's
crazy

50
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
crazy
 

51
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,270
crazy
uh but yeah today guys is the minecart

52
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
uh but yeah today guys is the minecart
 

53
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,030
uh but yeah today guys is the minecart

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
is do a little bit of experimenting a
 

57
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,310
is do a little bit of experimenting a
little bit of research we're going to

58
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
little bit of research we're going to
 

59
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,670
little bit of research we're going to
get some mine cart stuff together here

60
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
get some mine cart stuff together here
 

61
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,270
get some mine cart stuff together here
and just goof around with a few ideas

62
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
and just goof around with a few ideas
 

63
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,670
and just goof around with a few ideas
all right guys so lately in our modded

64
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
all right guys so lately in our modded
 

65
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,030
all right guys so lately in our modded
minecraft series we've been playing a

66
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
minecraft series we've been playing a
 

67
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,190
minecraft series we've been playing a
lot with the railcraft mod

68
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
lot with the railcraft mod
 

69
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,350
lot with the railcraft mod
and the railcraft mod allows you to do

70
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
and the railcraft mod allows you to do
 

71
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,109
and the railcraft mod allows you to do
some pretty cool pretty advanced

72
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
some pretty cool pretty advanced
 

73
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,710
some pretty cool pretty advanced
minecart things there's like

74
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
minecart things there's like
 

75
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,069
minecart things there's like
uh minecart switching

76
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
uh minecart switching
 

77
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,149
uh minecart switching
so you can tell where a minecart is on a

78
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
so you can tell where a minecart is on a
 

79
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,990
so you can tell where a minecart is on a
track and prevent another minecart from

80
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
track and prevent another minecart from
 

81
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,469
track and prevent another minecart from
colliding with it real easy with that

82
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
colliding with it real easy with that
 

83
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,350
colliding with it real easy with that
there's minecart routing so you can tell

84
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
there's minecart routing so you can tell
 

85
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,950
there's minecart routing so you can tell
a minecart

86
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
a minecart
 

87
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,709
a minecart
where to go really easily like if it

88
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
where to go really easily like if it
 

89
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,310
where to go really easily like if it
when it gets to a junction it knows

90
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
when it gets to a junction it knows
 

91
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,670
when it gets to a junction it knows
which way to take

92
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
which way to take
 

93
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,190
which way to take
based on its destination tickets and

94
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
based on its destination tickets and
 

95
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,790
based on its destination tickets and
there's just a lot of other really

96
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
there's just a lot of other really
 

97
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,710
there's just a lot of other really
useful things like holding tracks

98
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
useful things like holding tracks
 

99
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,150
useful things like holding tracks
and other gizmos like that so it got me

100
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
and other gizmos like that so it got me
 

101
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,990
and other gizmos like that so it got me
thinking here

102
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
thinking here
 

103
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,750
thinking here
what is preventing us from doing that

104
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
what is preventing us from doing that
 

105
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,990
what is preventing us from doing that
kind of stuff in vanilla minecraft what

106
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
kind of stuff in vanilla minecraft what
 

107
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,430
kind of stuff in vanilla minecraft what
is the limiter

108
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
is the limiter
 

109
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,830
is the limiter
uh are we able to do more advanced

110
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
uh are we able to do more advanced
 

111
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,110
uh are we able to do more advanced
minecart stuff

112
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
minecart stuff
 

113
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,190
minecart stuff
in this and i kind of think we are

114
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
in this and i kind of think we are
 

115
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,830
in this and i kind of think we are
we're gonna check it out here today

116
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
we're gonna check it out here today
 

117
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,589
we're gonna check it out here today
there are of course a lot of problems

118
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
there are of course a lot of problems
 

119
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,790
there are of course a lot of problems
though

120
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
though
 

121
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,949
though
and i'll demonstrate the first one here

122
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
and i'll demonstrate the first one here
 

123
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,070
and i'll demonstrate the first one here
so if we go to

124
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
so if we go to
 

125
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,990
so if we go to
f3q f3q brings up this list of all the

126
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
f3q f3q brings up this list of all the
 

127
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,110
f3q f3q brings up this list of all the
other f3

128
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
other f3
 

129
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,390
other f3
things you can do so we're gonna do f3g

130
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
things you can do so we're gonna do f3g
 

131
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,309
things you can do so we're gonna do f3g
show bunk bunk chunk

132
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
show bunk bunk chunk
 

133
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,150
show bunk bunk chunk
show the chunk boundaries here so we can

134
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
show the chunk boundaries here so we can
 

135
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,150
show the chunk boundaries here so we can
see it very clearly

136
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
see it very clearly
 

137
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,710
see it very clearly
uh one big problem minecarts have is

138
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
uh one big problem minecarts have is
 

139
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,830
uh one big problem minecarts have is
when chunks unload

140
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
when chunks unload
 

141
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,229
when chunks unload
so let's say this chunk unloads here

142
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
so let's say this chunk unloads here
 

143
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,990
so let's say this chunk unloads here
uh and this one's still loaded a

144
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
uh and this one's still loaded a
 

145
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,070
uh and this one's still loaded a
minecart can then go from this chunk

146
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
minecart can then go from this chunk
 

147
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,790
minecart can then go from this chunk
into this one since this one's unloaded

148
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
into this one since this one's unloaded
 

149
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,149
into this one since this one's unloaded
the minecart gets

150
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
the minecart gets
 

151
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,830
the minecart gets
uh saved into memory on your hard drive

152
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
uh saved into memory on your hard drive
 

153
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,309
uh saved into memory on your hard drive
and it's gonna end up around here

154
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
and it's gonna end up around here
 

155
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,470
and it's gonna end up around here
meanwhile those other minecarts can

156
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
meanwhile those other minecarts can
 

157
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,710
meanwhile those other minecarts can
can approach here and they all kind of

158
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
can approach here and they all kind of
 

159
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,830
can approach here and they all kind of
merge together

160
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
merge together
 

161
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,910
merge together
and join up i'll try to demonstrate that

162
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
and join up i'll try to demonstrate that
 

163
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,270
and join up i'll try to demonstrate that
i'm going to leave this area and come

164
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
i'm going to leave this area and come
 

165
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,030
i'm going to leave this area and come
back

166
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
back
 

167
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,949
back
and we'll just see what the spacing is

168
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
and we'll just see what the spacing is
 

169
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,470
and we'll just see what the spacing is
like on those minecarts it's not going

170
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
like on those minecarts it's not going
 

171
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,750
like on those minecarts it's not going
to be the same it's going to get

172
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
to be the same it's going to get
 

173
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,670
to be the same it's going to get
all bundled up probably

174
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680

 

175
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,710

so we're back here now and

176
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
so we're back here now and
 

177
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,309
so we're back here now and
mine carts are going the wrong way

178
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
mine carts are going the wrong way
 

179
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,710
mine carts are going the wrong way
they're bouncing all over the place

180
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
they're bouncing all over the place
 

181
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,710
they're bouncing all over the place
so once you have the chunks unload

182
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
so once you have the chunks unload
 

183
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,030
so once you have the chunks unload
bad stuff can happen and it can make it

184
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
bad stuff can happen and it can make it
 

185
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,550
bad stuff can happen and it can make it
almost impossible to make

186
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
almost impossible to make
 

187
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,070
almost impossible to make
uh advanced minecart systems because you

188
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
uh advanced minecart systems because you
 

189
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,550
uh advanced minecart systems because you
don't know what the mine carts are doing

190
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
don't know what the mine carts are doing
 

191
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,910
don't know what the mine carts are doing
and you can't control them when they're

192
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
and you can't control them when they're
 

193
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,990
and you can't control them when they're
all joined together like this so

194
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
all joined together like this so
 

195
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,710
all joined together like this so
yeah first thing we got to figure out is

196
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
yeah first thing we got to figure out is
 

197
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,309
yeah first thing we got to figure out is
some way of preventing this from

198
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
some way of preventing this from
 

199
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,949
some way of preventing this from
happening

200
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959

 

201
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,550

yeah and basically it's the same deal

202
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
yeah and basically it's the same deal
 

203
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,990
yeah and basically it's the same deal
over here if we have a straight section

204
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
over here if we have a straight section
 

205
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,949
over here if we have a straight section
of track like this

206
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
of track like this
 

207
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,030
of track like this
let's say we send five mine carts going

208
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
let's say we send five mine carts going
 

209
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,149
let's say we send five mine carts going
this way

210
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
this way
 

211
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,150
this way
and this chunk over here is unloaded

212
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
and this chunk over here is unloaded
 

213
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,349
and this chunk over here is unloaded
well then they're gonna all merge

214
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
well then they're gonna all merge
 

215
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,310
well then they're gonna all merge
together

216
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
together
 

217
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,229
together
when this chunk reloads there some of

218
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
when this chunk reloads there some of
 

219
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,830
when this chunk reloads there some of
them are probably gonna go backwards

220
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
them are probably gonna go backwards
 

221
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,390
them are probably gonna go backwards
some of them

222
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
some of them
 

223
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,790
some of them
are gonna be stuck together if we have

224
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
are gonna be stuck together if we have
 

225
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,629
are gonna be stuck together if we have
any junctions down the line and they're

226
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
any junctions down the line and they're
 

227
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,909
any junctions down the line and they're
probably not going to work properly

228
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
probably not going to work properly
 

229
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,510
probably not going to work properly
because the mine carts will be

230
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
because the mine carts will be
 

231
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,830
because the mine carts will be
too close together and that sort of

232
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
too close together and that sort of
 

233
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,189
too close together and that sort of
problem

234
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
problem
 

235
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,990
problem
so yeah the plan is to build smart

236
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
so yeah the plan is to build smart
 

237
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,629
so yeah the plan is to build smart
tracks

238
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
tracks
 

239
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,990
tracks
i have an idea for regulating the flow

240
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
i have an idea for regulating the flow
 

241
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,270
i have an idea for regulating the flow
of mine carts here on a single piece of

242
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
of mine carts here on a single piece of
 

243
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,150
of mine carts here on a single piece of
track

244
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
track
 

245
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,110
track
and it basically stems with this idea

246
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
and it basically stems with this idea
 

247
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,070
and it basically stems with this idea
here

248
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
here
 

249
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,990
here
set up these little junctions and little

250
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
set up these little junctions and little
 

251
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,110
set up these little junctions and little
holding areas

252
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
holding areas
 

253
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,390
holding areas
every section of tracked every chunk

254
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
every section of tracked every chunk
 

255
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,150
every section of tracked every chunk
here so we would do another one over

256
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
here so we would do another one over
 

257
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,310
here so we would do another one over
here

258
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
here
 

259
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,150
here
like so and

260
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
like so and
 

261
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,670
like so and
here let's get this powered again i'll

262
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
here let's get this powered again i'll
 

263
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,710
here let's get this powered again i'll
just show you show you the concept

264
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
just show you show you the concept
 

265
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,230
just show you show you the concept
so let's say yeah let's say we send a

266
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
so let's say yeah let's say we send a
 

267
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,670
so let's say yeah let's say we send a
minecart down here it's going to go

268
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
minecart down here it's going to go
 

269
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,270
minecart down here it's going to go
straight

270
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
straight
 

271
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,710
straight
because the track is pointing that way

272
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
because the track is pointing that way
 

273
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,390
because the track is pointing that way
it's going to get that little wobble as

274
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
it's going to get that little wobble as
 

275
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,590
it's going to get that little wobble as
it goes by that but it's

276
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
it goes by that but it's
 

277
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,990
it goes by that but it's
it's not going to affect the minecart

278
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
it's not going to affect the minecart
 

279
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,909
it's not going to affect the minecart
really

280
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
really
 

281
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,469
really
what we want to do is make set a rule so

282
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
what we want to do is make set a rule so
 

283
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,070
what we want to do is make set a rule so
only one mine cart per

284
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
only one mine cart per
 

285
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,629
only one mine cart per
chunk here so when a minecart enters

286
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
chunk here so when a minecart enters
 

287
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,070
chunk here so when a minecart enters
this chunk

288
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
this chunk
 

289
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,950
this chunk
we then want to switch his junction

290
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
we then want to switch his junction
 

291
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,870
we then want to switch his junction
so it goes into this holding area this

292
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
so it goes into this holding area this
 

293
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,150
so it goes into this holding area this
little holding area

294
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
little holding area
 

295
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,070
little holding area
so now if another minecart comes by

296
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
so now if another minecart comes by
 

297
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,830
so now if another minecart comes by
while there's a minecart over here in

298
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
while there's a minecart over here in
 

299
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,350
while there's a minecart over here in
this area

300
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
this area
 

301
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,550
this area
then it's going to wait

302
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
then it's going to wait
 

303
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,189
then it's going to wait
and then once that mine cart is out of

304
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
and then once that mine cart is out of
 

305
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,629
and then once that mine cart is out of
this chunk into the next one over here

306
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
this chunk into the next one over here
 

307
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,790
this chunk into the next one over here
then we want to release this one waiting

308
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
then we want to release this one waiting
 

309
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,309
then we want to release this one waiting
and that'll prevent them from bunching

310
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
and that'll prevent them from bunching
 

311
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,070
and that'll prevent them from bunching
up together so this would flip

312
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
up together so this would flip
 

313
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,590
up together so this would flip
and then this one would get set free

314
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
and then this one would get set free
 

315
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,110
and then this one would get set free
like so and same kind of thing thing's

316
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
like so and same kind of thing thing's
 

317
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,590
like so and same kind of thing thing's
going to repeat itself

318
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
going to repeat itself
 

319
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,790
going to repeat itself
um so what we got to do then

320
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
um so what we got to do then
 

321
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,270
um so what we got to do then
is probably set up some sort of detector

322
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
is probably set up some sort of detector
 

323
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,710
is probably set up some sort of detector
rail over here

324
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
rail over here
 

325
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,629
rail over here
like at the very end of the chunk here

326
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
like at the very end of the chunk here
 

327
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,629
like at the very end of the chunk here
the end of this section

328
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
the end of this section
 

329
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,710
the end of this section
when the minecart goes over the detector

330
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
when the minecart goes over the detector
 

331
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,710
when the minecart goes over the detector
rail it's going to then

332
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
rail it's going to then
 

333
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,029
rail it's going to then
uh switch this and release the minecart

334
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
uh switch this and release the minecart
 

335
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,350
uh switch this and release the minecart
here

336
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
here
 

337
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,029
here
and yeah i think that's the concept

338
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
and yeah i think that's the concept
 

339
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,469
and yeah i think that's the concept
this is like solving a puzzle i got to

340
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
this is like solving a puzzle i got to
 

341
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,909
this is like solving a puzzle i got to
figure out how to do this exactly it's

342
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
figure out how to do this exactly it's
 

343
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,909
figure out how to do this exactly it's
going to be a bit complicated probably

344
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919

 

345
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,070

okay so i set up a little thing here to

346
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
okay so i set up a little thing here to
 

347
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,390
okay so i set up a little thing here to
test out we got an rs nor latch at the

348
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
test out we got an rs nor latch at the
 

349
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,749
test out we got an rs nor latch at the
junction now

350
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
junction now
 

351
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,150
junction now
uh basically when the minecart goes over

352
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
uh basically when the minecart goes over
 

353
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,430
uh basically when the minecart goes over
this detector rail

354
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
this detector rail
 

355
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,670
this detector rail
it's gonna push the redstone block over

356
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
it's gonna push the redstone block over
 

357
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,710
it's gonna push the redstone block over
it's gonna power

358
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
it's gonna power
 

359
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,909
it's gonna power
the junction uh that'll cause any other

360
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
the junction uh that'll cause any other
 

361
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,950
the junction uh that'll cause any other
minecarts that come

362
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
minecarts that come
 

363
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,950
minecarts that come
right after the previous one to go to

364
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
right after the previous one to go to
 

365
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,309
right after the previous one to go to
the right here

366
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
the right here
 

367
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,390
the right here
into the holding area and then when it

368
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
into the holding area and then when it
 

369
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,110
into the holding area and then when it
gets to the other detector rail

370
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
gets to the other detector rail
 

371
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,749
gets to the other detector rail
way down at the other section here it's

372
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
way down at the other section here it's
 

373
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,990
way down at the other section here it's
going to send power back

374
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
going to send power back
 

375
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,189
going to send power back
uh over to the minecart release and also

376
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
uh over to the minecart release and also
 

377
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,550
uh over to the minecart release and also
to

378
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
to
 

379
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,110
to
this piston goes underneath here that

380
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
this piston goes underneath here that
 

381
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,990
this piston goes underneath here that
will push the redstone

382
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
will push the redstone
 

383
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,830
will push the redstone
block back and it should allow more

384
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
block back and it should allow more
 

385
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,670
block back and it should allow more
minecarts to then

386
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
minecarts to then
 

387
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,309
minecarts to then
pass by here so let's try it out with

388
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
pass by here so let's try it out with
 

389
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,110
pass by here so let's try it out with
one minecarts

390
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
one minecarts
 

391
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,309
one minecarts
first off you see how it switched and

392
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
first off you see how it switched and
 

393
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,350
first off you see how it switched and
now it switched back

394
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
now it switched back
 

395
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,510
now it switched back
okay so that's all good uh let's get rid

396
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
okay so that's all good uh let's get rid
 

397
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,189
okay so that's all good uh let's get rid
of this one minecart we'll send to this

398
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
of this one minecart we'll send to this
 

399
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,230
of this one minecart we'll send to this
this next time that's the real test it

400
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
this next time that's the real test it
 

401
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,230
this next time that's the real test it
should hold one of them until the other

402
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
should hold one of them until the other
 

403
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,629
should hold one of them until the other
one

404
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
one
 

405
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,270
one
passes by the chunk and with this setup

406
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
passes by the chunk and with this setup
 

407
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,270
passes by the chunk and with this setup
we should never have three mine carts

408
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
we should never have three mine carts
 

409
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,749
we should never have three mine carts
trying to to pass a certain chunk at a

410
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
trying to to pass a certain chunk at a
 

411
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,150
trying to to pass a certain chunk at a
time

412
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160

 

413
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,070

yeah so it make sure it holds it until

414
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
yeah so it make sure it holds it until
 

415
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,589
yeah so it make sure it holds it until
it's free to go

416
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
it's free to go
 

417
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,830
it's free to go
aha very cool so this is great it seems

418
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
aha very cool so this is great it seems
 

419
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,909
aha very cool so this is great it seems
to do what i wanted to do

420
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
to do what i wanted to do
 

421
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,150
to do what i wanted to do
but now it is time for the real

422
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
but now it is time for the real
 

423
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,150
but now it is time for the real
challenge guys the big contender over

424
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
challenge guys the big contender over
 

425
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,309
challenge guys the big contender over
here

426
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
here
 

427
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,270
here
over here yeah so i've taken this and

428
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
over here yeah so i've taken this and
 

429
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,629
over here yeah so i've taken this and
now i set up a loop

430
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
now i set up a loop
 

431
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,350
now i set up a loop
of this smart track so it goes around

432
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
of this smart track so it goes around
 

433
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,189
of this smart track so it goes around
like so

434
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
like so
 

435
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,710
like so
and we're gonna see if it can handle the

436
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
and we're gonna see if it can handle the
 

437
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,830
and we're gonna see if it can handle the
minecarts now if it

438
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
minecarts now if it
 

439
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,430
minecarts now if it
it prevents them from colliding because

440
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
it prevents them from colliding because
 

441
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,430
it prevents them from colliding because
that's what it's supposed to do

442
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
that's what it's supposed to do
 

443
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,469
that's what it's supposed to do
when we leave the area here so as it is

444
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
when we leave the area here so as it is
 

445
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,990
when we leave the area here so as it is
right now

446
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
right now
 

447
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,909
right now
we just have one minecart on it kind of

448
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
we just have one minecart on it kind of
 

449
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,469
we just have one minecart on it kind of
does this

450
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479

 

451
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,230

you see all the junctions getting

452
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
you see all the junctions getting
 

453
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,670
you see all the junctions getting
switched whenever these

454
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
switched whenever these
 

455
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,630
switched whenever these
redstone blocks move it's a real mess

456
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
redstone blocks move it's a real mess
 

457
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,389
redstone blocks move it's a real mess
right now it doesn't look good

458
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
right now it doesn't look good
 

459
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,990
right now it doesn't look good
but i'm just trying to make sure it

460
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
but i'm just trying to make sure it
 

461
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,110
but i'm just trying to make sure it
works before i refine it i guess

462
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
works before i refine it i guess
 

463
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,150
works before i refine it i guess
all right so let's get our chunk view

464
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
all right so let's get our chunk view
 

465
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,509
all right so let's get our chunk view
going so you can see what's happening

466
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
going so you can see what's happening
 

467
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,829
going so you can see what's happening
here there's three chunks total so

468
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
here there's three chunks total so
 

469
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,870
here there's three chunks total so
there's this one

470
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
there's this one
 

471
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,310
there's this one
this one and this one that it goes into

472
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
this one and this one that it goes into
 

473
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,430
this one and this one that it goes into
and there's four of these junctions in

474
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
and there's four of these junctions in
 

475
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,389
and there's four of these junctions in
total

476
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
total
 

477
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,150
total
uh one on each end and then in the

478
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
uh one on each end and then in the
 

479
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,750
uh one on each end and then in the
middle straightaway section

480
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
middle straightaway section
 

481
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,030
middle straightaway section
there's two over here and

482
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
there's two over here and
 

483
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,389
there's two over here and
over here all right so for total

484
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
over here all right so for total
 

485
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,230
over here all right so for total
that means i think you can handle three

486
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
that means i think you can handle three
 

487
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,750
that means i think you can handle three
mine carts at the most

488
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
mine carts at the most
 

489
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,430
mine carts at the most
but if you have a longer track it'll

490
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
but if you have a longer track it'll
 

491
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,910
but if you have a longer track it'll
handle more

492
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
handle more
 

493
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,030
handle more
we get these going hopefully

494
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
we get these going hopefully
 

495
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,470
we get these going hopefully
you see that one was waiting there oh

496
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
you see that one was waiting there oh
 

497
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,430
you see that one was waiting there oh
that one snuck in though

498
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
that one snuck in though
 

499
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,550
that one snuck in though
uh oh oh

500
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560

 

501
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,710

works perfect all right there might be

502
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
works perfect all right there might be
 

503
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,389
works perfect all right there might be
something special we got to do to add

504
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
something special we got to do to add
 

505
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,750
something special we got to do to add
the minecarts

506
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
the minecarts
 

507
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,269
the minecarts
let me try that again okay i think that

508
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
let me try that again okay i think that
 

509
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,350
let me try that again okay i think that
messed up because i'm not using

510
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
messed up because i'm not using
 

511
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,870
messed up because i'm not using
monostable circuits anywhere

512
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
monostable circuits anywhere
 

513
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,030
monostable circuits anywhere
with this so this junction is not

514
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
with this so this junction is not
 

515
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,949
with this so this junction is not
switching fast enough i could add them

516
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
switching fast enough i could add them
 

517
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:49,430
switching fast enough i could add them
and

518
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
and
 

519
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,430
and
this would get a little bit more complex

520
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
this would get a little bit more complex
 

521
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,030
this would get a little bit more complex
but just for right now

522
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
but just for right now
 

523
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,630
but just for right now
uh let's just see if it works when it is

524
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
uh let's just see if it works when it is
 

525
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,910
uh let's just see if it works when it is
working

526
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
working
 

527
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,430
working
so i'll have to be careful not to load

528
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
so i'll have to be careful not to load
 

529
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,949
so i'll have to be careful not to load
them too fast

530
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
them too fast
 

531
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,550
them too fast
they have to clear a section before i

532
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
they have to clear a section before i
 

533
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,030
they have to clear a section before i
add another one

534
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
add another one
 

535
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,790
add another one
but that the big test here is that it

536
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
but that the big test here is that it
 

537
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,150
but that the big test here is that it
doesn't break when we

538
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
doesn't break when we
 

539
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,750
doesn't break when we
unload these chunks okay oh that one got

540
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
unload these chunks okay oh that one got
 

541
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,110
unload these chunks okay oh that one got
stuck

542
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120

 

543
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,670

wait what's happening why is it going

544
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
wait what's happening why is it going
 

545
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,949
wait what's happening why is it going
over there

546
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959

 

547
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,470

now whatever all right so i'm gonna try

548
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
now whatever all right so i'm gonna try
 

549
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,069
now whatever all right so i'm gonna try
get out of here um

550
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
get out of here um
 

551
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,829
get out of here um
and see if i can do anything to break

552
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
and see if i can do anything to break
 

553
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,750
and see if i can do anything to break
looks good

554
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760

 

555
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,790

no

556
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800

 

557
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,949

no darn

558
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
no darn
 

559
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,470
no darn
you know i left the area and came back

560
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
you know i left the area and came back
 

561
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,990
you know i left the area and came back
like 10 times i thought it was going to

562
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
like 10 times i thought it was going to
 

563
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,870
like 10 times i thought it was going to
be good

564
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
be good
 

565
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,470
be good
it wasn't having any problems but this

566
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
it wasn't having any problems but this
 

567
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,910
it wasn't having any problems but this
time

568
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
time
 

569
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,590
time
it messed up

570
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600

 

571
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,430

okay good news i think i got it fixed

572
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
okay good news i think i got it fixed
 

573
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,829
okay good news i think i got it fixed
here uh those monostable circuits i

574
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
here uh those monostable circuits i
 

575
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,949
here uh those monostable circuits i
talked about are actually really

576
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
talked about are actually really
 

577
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,230
talked about are actually really
important

578
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
important
 

579
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,870
important
so look at this piston here you notice

580
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
so look at this piston here you notice
 

581
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,630
so look at this piston here you notice
how fast the arm goes out and

582
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
how fast the arm goes out and
 

583
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,470
how fast the arm goes out and
and back in it's like real quick now

584
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
and back in it's like real quick now
 

585
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,110
and back in it's like real quick now
uh before it was going out for about a

586
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
uh before it was going out for about a
 

587
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,069
uh before it was going out for about a
second and then

588
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
second and then
 

589
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,630
second and then
retracting but you'll notice how quick

590
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
retracting but you'll notice how quick
 

591
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,630
retracting but you'll notice how quick
the block gets pushed back afterwards it

592
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
the block gets pushed back afterwards it
 

593
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,230
the block gets pushed back afterwards it
wasn't able to push his block

594
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
wasn't able to push his block
 

595
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,710
wasn't able to push his block
back uh when it goes over this detector

596
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
back uh when it goes over this detector
 

597
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,269
back uh when it goes over this detector

should fix it i'm gonna again do the

602
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
should fix it i'm gonna again do the
 

603
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,430
should fix it i'm gonna again do the
same thing

604
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
same thing
 

605
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,430
same thing
fly away and come back oh and i fell

606
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
fly away and come back oh and i fell
 

607
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,110
fly away and come back oh and i fell
down the hole

608
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
down the hole
 

609
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,030
down the hole
the stupid hole this is the hole i felt

610
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
the stupid hole this is the hole i felt
 

611
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,949
the stupid hole this is the hole i felt
out when i killed that dragon

612
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
out when i killed that dragon
 

613
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,949
out when i killed that dragon
like back in episode 150 and lost all

614
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
like back in episode 150 and lost all
 

615
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,389
like back in episode 150 and lost all
the experience

616
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
the experience
 

617
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,590
the experience
looks good all right let's try it a few

618
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
looks good all right let's try it a few
 

619
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,030
looks good all right let's try it a few
more times

620
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040

 

621
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,350

oh they're all stopped

622
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360

 

623
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,790

no why did they all stop

624
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
no why did they all stop
 

625
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,389
no why did they all stop
darn oh

626
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
darn oh
 

627
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,790
darn oh
this is like a detective riddle you know

628
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
this is like a detective riddle you know
 

629
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,150
this is like a detective riddle you know
trying to figure out why did it break

630
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
trying to figure out why did it break
 

631
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,069
trying to figure out why did it break
why did it not work

632
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
why did it not work
 

633
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,829
why did it not work
because you can't see it not working you

634
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
because you can't see it not working you
 

635
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,310
because you can't see it not working you
have to like figure it out afterwards

636
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
have to like figure it out afterwards
 

637
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,910
have to like figure it out afterwards
but yeah there's no minecart over there

638
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
but yeah there's no minecart over there
 

639
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,509
but yeah there's no minecart over there
so this one should have been free to go

640
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
so this one should have been free to go
 

641
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,350
so this one should have been free to go
and you can see the junctions actually

642
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
and you can see the junctions actually
 

643
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,110
and you can see the junctions actually
switched uh the problem is it did not re

644
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
switched uh the problem is it did not re
 

645
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,590
switched uh the problem is it did not re
it did not move when the power rail was

646
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
it did not move when the power rail was
 

647
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,550
it did not move when the power rail was
lit up

648
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
lit up
 

649
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,670
lit up
so this chunk was unloaded and if a

650
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
so this chunk was unloaded and if a
 

651
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,990
so this chunk was unloaded and if a
minecart's in an unloaded chunk

652
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
minecart's in an unloaded chunk
 

653
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,949
minecart's in an unloaded chunk
um the redstone stuff can happen but the

654
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
um the redstone stuff can happen but the
 

655
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,910
um the redstone stuff can happen but the
entity stuff

656
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
entity stuff
 

657
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,230
entity stuff
doesn't happen unless you load a big

658
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
doesn't happen unless you load a big
 

659
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,829
doesn't happen unless you load a big
area which we're not doing here

660
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
area which we're not doing here
 

661
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,310
area which we're not doing here
so yeah the power rail turned on

662
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
so yeah the power rail turned on
 

663
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,910
so yeah the power rail turned on
but then the mine carts didn't unload

664
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
but then the mine carts didn't unload
 

665
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,509
but then the mine carts didn't unload
chunk so it didn't move

666
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
chunk so it didn't move
 

667
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,550
chunk so it didn't move
and it got stuck here um long story

668
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
and it got stuck here um long story
 

669
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,269
and it got stuck here um long story
short we

670
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
short we
 

671
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,069
short we
can't send the power rail uh a pulse

672
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
can't send the power rail uh a pulse
 

673
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,590
can't send the power rail uh a pulse
like i'm doing here

674
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
like i'm doing here
 

675
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,470
like i'm doing here
instead we're going to rip this stuff

676
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
instead we're going to rip this stuff
 

677
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,069
instead we're going to rip this stuff
out

678
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
out
 

679
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,590
out
we need to connect the power rail

680
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
we need to connect the power rail
 

681
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,069
we need to connect the power rail
directly to our snore latch here so when

682
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
directly to our snore latch here so when
 

683
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,670
directly to our snore latch here so when
the block the redstone block is over

684
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
the block the redstone block is over
 

685
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,389
the block the redstone block is over
here

686
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
here
 

687
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,310
here
that power rail should be lit and when

688
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
that power rail should be lit and when
 

689
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,870
that power rail should be lit and when
it's over here it shouldn't be

690
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
it's over here it shouldn't be
 

691
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,509
it's over here it shouldn't be
okay so back to testing here again you

692
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
okay so back to testing here again you
 

693
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,509
okay so back to testing here again you
see how the redstone block directly

694
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
see how the redstone block directly
 

695
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,990
see how the redstone block directly
powers the power rail now

696
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
powers the power rail now
 

697
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,750
powers the power rail now
if the redstone block is over there this

698
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
if the redstone block is over there this
 

699
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,470
if the redstone block is over there this
is powered for sure

700
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
is powered for sure
 

701
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,949
is powered for sure
and if this doesn't work i don't know

702
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
and if this doesn't work i don't know
 

703
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,030
and if this doesn't work i don't know
what's going to work

704
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
what's going to work
 

705
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,230
what's going to work
all right let's get out of here i'm

706
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
all right let's get out of here i'm
 

707
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,829
all right let's get out of here i'm
again i'm going to fly back and forth

708
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
again i'm going to fly back and forth
 

709
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,670
again i'm going to fly back and forth
unload the chunks and reload them and

710
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
unload the chunks and reload them and
 

711
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,550
unload the chunks and reload them and
just see

712
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
just see
 

713
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,990
just see
if i can get it to mess up hopefully not

714
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
if i can get it to mess up hopefully not
 

715
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,110
if i can get it to mess up hopefully not
because i don't know what to do if this

716
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
because i don't know what to do if this
 

717
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,949
because i don't know what to do if this
doesn't work

718
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959

 

719
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,230

ah

720
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240

 

721
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,710

go well i hate to say it guys but i

722
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
go well i hate to say it guys but i
 

723
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,069
go well i hate to say it guys but i
think i'm going to give up

724
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
think i'm going to give up
 

725
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,110
think i'm going to give up
on this i don't do that often but

726
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
on this i don't do that often but
 

727
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,550
on this i don't do that often but
honestly i don't know what the problem

728
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
honestly i don't know what the problem
 

729
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,150
honestly i don't know what the problem
is and

730
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
is and
 

731
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,710
is and
it all looks good to me maybe you guys

732
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
it all looks good to me maybe you guys
 

733
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,949
it all looks good to me maybe you guys
can figure it out i don't know

734
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
can figure it out i don't know
 

735
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,870
can figure it out i don't know
uh i felt like i was very close with

736
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
uh i felt like i was very close with
 

737
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,990
uh i felt like i was very close with
that but

738
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
that but
 

739
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,509
that but
just not working don't know what to do

740
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
just not working don't know what to do
 

741
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,870
just not working don't know what to do
at the very least though i'm going to do

742
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
at the very least though i'm going to do
 

743
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,310
at the very least though i'm going to do
something like this with my minecart

744
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
something like this with my minecart
 

745
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,350
something like this with my minecart
tracks this will

746
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
tracks this will
 

747
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,829
tracks this will
prevent minecarts from flowing backwards

748
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
prevent minecarts from flowing backwards
 

749
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,509
prevent minecarts from flowing backwards
becoming a problem

750
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
becoming a problem
 

751
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,269
becoming a problem
at the very least because if they try to

752
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
at the very least because if they try to
 

753
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,629
at the very least because if they try to
they'll just

754
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
they'll just
 

755
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,710
they'll just
do that and bounce back and keep going

756
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
do that and bounce back and keep going
 

757
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,550
do that and bounce back and keep going
straight like they should

758
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
straight like they should
 

759
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,790
straight like they should
uh this will not prevent minecarts from

760
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
uh this will not prevent minecarts from
 

761
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,870
uh this will not prevent minecarts from
merging together though

762
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
merging together though
 

763
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,110
merging together though
which may or may not be important i'm

764
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
which may or may not be important i'm
 

765
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,509
which may or may not be important i'm
not sure yet

766
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
not sure yet
 

767
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,670
not sure yet
like that was supposed to prevent

768
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
like that was supposed to prevent
 

769
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,189
like that was supposed to prevent
anyways we're going to move on to

770
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
anyways we're going to move on to
 

771
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,550
anyways we're going to move on to
something a little bit more fun

772
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
something a little bit more fun
 

773
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,550
something a little bit more fun
hopefully

774
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
hopefully
 

775
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,949
hopefully
because that was getting frustrating uh

776
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
because that was getting frustrating uh
 

777
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,910
because that was getting frustrating uh
the idea of

778
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
the idea of
 

779
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,949
the idea of
minecart routing so the idea is when a

780
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
minecart routing so the idea is when a
 

781
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,430
minecart routing so the idea is when a
minecart gets to a junction like this

782
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
minecart gets to a junction like this
 

783
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,069
minecart gets to a junction like this
uh it should know whether or not to

784
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
uh it should know whether or not to
 

785
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,389
uh it should know whether or not to
switch the junction automatically

786
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
switch the junction automatically
 

787
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,590
switch the junction automatically
it's sort of like the minecarts

788
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
it's sort of like the minecarts
 

789
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,230
it's sort of like the minecarts
intelligence and we do that using

790
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
intelligence and we do that using
 

791
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,189
intelligence and we do that using
tickets

792
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
tickets
 

793
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,110
tickets
like you do in railcraft so

794
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
like you do in railcraft so
 

795
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,949
like you do in railcraft so
let's see do i have any hoppers yes i do

796
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
let's see do i have any hoppers yes i do
 

797
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,670
let's see do i have any hoppers yes i do
okay so here's something cool whenever a

798
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
okay so here's something cool whenever a
 

799
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,990
okay so here's something cool whenever a
minecart passes by a hopper like this it

800
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
minecart passes by a hopper like this it
 

801
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,949
minecart passes by a hopper like this it
picks up exactly one item

802
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
picks up exactly one item
 

803
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,790
picks up exactly one item
uh if it's if it's going at full speed

804
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
uh if it's if it's going at full speed
 

805
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,670
uh if it's if it's going at full speed
anyway or it should

806
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
anyway or it should
 

807
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,350
anyway or it should
all right so that should grab one piece

808
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
all right so that should grab one piece
 

809
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,030
all right so that should grab one piece
of paper yeah

810
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
of paper yeah
 

811
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,949
of paper yeah
and likewise when it uh goes over a

812
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
and likewise when it uh goes over a
 

813
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,310
and likewise when it uh goes over a
minecart it'll drop off

814
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
minecart it'll drop off
 

815
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,430
minecart it'll drop off
one item exactly you see where i'm

816
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
one item exactly you see where i'm
 

817
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,790
one item exactly you see where i'm
getting with this

818
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
getting with this
 

819
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,910
getting with this
so we can give minecarts tickets uh like

820
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
so we can give minecarts tickets uh like
 

821
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,310
so we can give minecarts tickets uh like
this

822
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
this
 

823
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,790
this
and we can receive them using items

824
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
and we can receive them using items
 

825
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,990
and we can receive them using items
orders

826
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
orders
 

827
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,189
orders
and on these tickets or random pieces of

828
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
and on these tickets or random pieces of
 

829
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,389
and on these tickets or random pieces of
whatever

830
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
whatever
 

831
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,470
whatever
we can give them a destination string

832
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
we can give them a destination string
 

833
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,389
we can give them a destination string
using an anvil

834
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
using an anvil
 

835
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,990
using an anvil
let's say this is destination number one

836
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
let's say this is destination number one
 

837
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,949
let's say this is destination number one
then when it gets to a junction that

838
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
then when it gets to a junction that
 

839
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,790
then when it gets to a junction that
that matches this it'll cause it to

840
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
that matches this it'll cause it to
 

841
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,670
that matches this it'll cause it to
switch

842
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
switch
 

843
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,870
switch
all right let me try set that up okay

844
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
all right let me try set that up okay
 

845
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,350
all right let me try set that up okay
guys

846
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
guys
 

847
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,430
guys
so this is uh pretty cool from what i've

848
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
so this is uh pretty cool from what i've
 

849
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,550
so this is uh pretty cool from what i've
seen so far

850
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
seen so far
 

851
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,710
seen so far
we have a little test track to try out

852
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
we have a little test track to try out
 

853
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,470
we have a little test track to try out
the cart routing here

854
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
the cart routing here
 

855
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,949
the cart routing here
so one of these things is a ticket

856
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
so one of these things is a ticket
 

857
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,150
so one of these things is a ticket
receiver

858
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
receiver
 

859
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,710
receiver
and basically it's just an item filter

860
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
and basically it's just an item filter
 

861
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,470
and basically it's just an item filter
so what you do is put some garbage items

862
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
so what you do is put some garbage items
 

863
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,350
so what you do is put some garbage items
in here

864
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
in here
 

865
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,749
in here
i made two two switches actually so we

866
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
i made two two switches actually so we
 

867
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,949
i made two two switches actually so we
have destination one

868
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
have destination one
 

869
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,389
have destination one
and two we'll put number two in here

870
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
and two we'll put number two in here
 

871
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,110
and two we'll put number two in here
all right and while uh there's more than

872
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
all right and while uh there's more than
 

873
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,069
all right and while uh there's more than
41

874
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
41
 

875
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,230
41
papers in there the signal goes three

876
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
papers in there the signal goes three
 

877
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,430
papers in there the signal goes three
blocks

878
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
blocks
 

879
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,509
blocks
which then goes to this wire up to the

880
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
which then goes to this wire up to the
 

881
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,590
which then goes to this wire up to the
junction like so

882
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
junction like so
 

883
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,790
junction like so
um let's grab the extras out of here

884
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
um let's grab the extras out of here
 

885
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,870
um let's grab the extras out of here
all right so yeah if there's there's

886
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
all right so yeah if there's there's
 

887
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,670
all right so yeah if there's there's
more than 41 in there

888
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
more than 41 in there
 

889
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,870
more than 41 in there
then then it goes through all right so

890
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
then then it goes through all right so
 

891
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,829
then then it goes through all right so
we have one junction right here and then

892
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
we have one junction right here and then
 

893
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,509
we have one junction right here and then
there's another one i set up right over

894
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
there's another one i set up right over
 

895
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,310
there's another one i set up right over
here

896
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
here
 

897
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,629
here
okay so we'll call this one destination

898
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
okay so we'll call this one destination
 

899
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,990
okay so we'll call this one destination
one

900
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
one
 

901
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,829
one
put the junk items in put 40

902
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
put the junk items in put 40
 

903
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,990
put the junk items in put 40
41 items in here 41 tickets all right

904
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
41 items in here 41 tickets all right
 

905
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,310
41 items in here 41 tickets all right
and there's three final destinations

906
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
and there's three final destinations
 

907
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,629
and there's three final destinations
here so there's one over here

908
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
here so there's one over here
 

909
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,310
here so there's one over here
one over here and one over here

910
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
one over here and one over here
 

911
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,309
one over here and one over here
depending on which tidgets we put in our

912
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
depending on which tidgets we put in our
 

913
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,150
depending on which tidgets we put in our
mine cart will determine where it ends

914
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
mine cart will determine where it ends
 

915
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,710
mine cart will determine where it ends
up

916
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
up
 

917
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,429
up
in our little sample track here so if we

918
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
in our little sample track here so if we
 

919
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,429
in our little sample track here so if we
put this here with no minecraft or no

920
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
put this here with no minecraft or no
 

921
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,909
put this here with no minecraft or no
tickets in the system

922
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
tickets in the system
 

923
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,189
tickets in the system
it's going to end up right over here

924
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
it's going to end up right over here
 

925
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,949
it's going to end up right over here
every time

926
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
every time
 

927
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,390
every time
all right if we do destination one

928
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
all right if we do destination one
 

929
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,909
all right if we do destination one
let's try that out

930
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919

 

931
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,590

so destination one i think we'll get

932
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
so destination one i think we'll get
 

933
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,029
so destination one i think we'll get
past this first junction i'll go to the

934
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
past this first junction i'll go to the
 

935
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,710
past this first junction i'll go to the
left now

936
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
left now
 

937
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,710
left now
uh and then it goes right over there so

938
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
uh and then it goes right over there so
 

939
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,230
uh and then it goes right over there so
if we give it destination one

940
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
if we give it destination one
 

941
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,150
if we give it destination one
and destination two then it should end

942
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
and destination two then it should end
 

943
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,029
and destination two then it should end
up over here i'm pretty sure

944
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
up over here i'm pretty sure
 

945
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,150
up over here i'm pretty sure
all right let's try that out

946
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
all right let's try that out
 

947
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,630
all right let's try that out
destination one and two so both ticket

948
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
destination one and two so both ticket
 

949
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,990
destination one and two so both ticket
things are are loaded now

950
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000

 

951
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,270

i'm gonna have a lot of fun playing with

952
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
i'm gonna have a lot of fun playing with
 

953
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,270
i'm gonna have a lot of fun playing with
this i think i want to set up some big

954
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
this i think i want to set up some big
 

955
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,150
this i think i want to set up some big
fancy

956
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
fancy
 

957
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,190
fancy
cart network eventually yeah so it

958
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
cart network eventually yeah so it
 

959
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,789
cart network eventually yeah so it
should have got both tickets this time

960
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799

 

961
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,909

oh it didn't work though

962
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919

 

963
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,150

maybe my timings aren't quite right i

964
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
maybe my timings aren't quite right i
 

965
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,630
maybe my timings aren't quite right i
thought that would have been good

966
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
thought that would have been good
 

967
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,950
thought that would have been good
there's 22 in each of these oh i didn't

968
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
there's 22 in each of these oh i didn't
 

969
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,950
there's 22 in each of these oh i didn't
grab this one

970
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
grab this one
 

971
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,430
grab this one
let's move this oh because the detector

972
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
let's move this oh because the detector
 

973
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,870
let's move this oh because the detector
rail here

974
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
rail here
 

975
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,630
rail here
okay you can tell i didn't test this out

976
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
okay you can tell i didn't test this out
 

977
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,390
okay you can tell i didn't test this out
yet exactly

978
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
yet exactly
 

979
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,750
yet exactly
let's move that over here a little bit

980
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
let's move that over here a little bit
 

981
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,870
let's move that over here a little bit
of a mistake there because it's

982
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
of a mistake there because it's
 

983
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,990
of a mistake there because it's
receiving power

984
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
receiving power
 

985
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,990
receiving power
from that so it couldn't uh the hopper

986
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
from that so it couldn't uh the hopper
 

987
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,390
from that so it couldn't uh the hopper
wasn't putting any items out actually

988
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
wasn't putting any items out actually
 

989
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,870
wasn't putting any items out actually
okay let's try it again oh we got one

990
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
okay let's try it again oh we got one
 

991
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,750
okay let's try it again oh we got one
made here

992
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
made here
 

993
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,750
made here
okay so i should grab both tickets

994
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760

 

995
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,070

and this time go over there nice

996
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
and this time go over there nice
 

997
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,630
and this time go over there nice
that is really neat so yeah whenever we

998
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
that is really neat so yeah whenever we
 

999
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,909
that is really neat so yeah whenever we
need to take a junction

1000
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
need to take a junction
 

1001
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,830
need to take a junction
we can we can tell it to do that um

1002
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
we can we can tell it to do that um
 

1003
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,029
we can we can tell it to do that um
depending on which tickets we give it so

1004
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
