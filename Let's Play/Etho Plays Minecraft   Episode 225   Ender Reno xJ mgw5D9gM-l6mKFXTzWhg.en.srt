00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
with beacons so you know
 

15
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,390
with beacons so you know
like i had a barrier here before i'm

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
like i had a barrier here before i'm

changing changing it around

18
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
changing changing it around
 

19
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,470
changing changing it around
but you know if you have a solid block

20
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
but you know if you have a solid block
 

21
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,429
but you know if you have a solid block
above the beam

22
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
above the beam
 

23
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,950
above the beam
it gets disabled right

24
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
it gets disabled right
 

25
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,430
it gets disabled right
um there is this really neat thing you

26
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
um there is this really neat thing you
 

27
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,470
um there is this really neat thing you
can do though

28
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
can do though
 

29
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,030
can do though
it's more of a visual pleasing thing

30
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
it's more of a visual pleasing thing
 

31
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,549
it's more of a visual pleasing thing
than anything

32
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
than anything
 

33
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,310
than anything
but i i wanted to see what it would look

34
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
but i i wanted to see what it would look
 

35
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,069
but i i wanted to see what it would look
like if you had one of these above a

36
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
like if you had one of these above a
 

37
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,270
like if you had one of these above a
beacon

38
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280

 

39
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,270

because they're very similar in size the

40
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
because they're very similar in size the
 

41
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,590
because they're very similar in size the
beam and

42
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
beam and
 

43
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,310
beam and
the cobblestone wall and it i think it

44
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
the cobblestone wall and it i think it
 

45
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,189
the cobblestone wall and it i think it
has a really cool effect

46
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199

 

47
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,149

and i'll probably do this a lot if i

48
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
and i'll probably do this a lot if i
 

49
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,270
and i'll probably do this a lot if i
ever set up beacons

50
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
ever set up beacons
 

51
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,630
ever set up beacons
just because i like it so much

52
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640

 

53
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,630

but yeah check that out

54
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640

 

55
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,310

i don't know i think it's cool you can

56
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
i don't know i think it's cool you can
 

57
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,630
i don't know i think it's cool you can
even like uh

58
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
even like uh
 

59
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,310
even like uh
create patterns in it like you can have

60
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
create patterns in it like you can have
 

61
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,630
create patterns in it like you can have
one missing

62
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
one missing
 

63
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,710
one missing
every second block or something if you

64
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
every second block or something if you
 

65
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,230
every second block or something if you
have several beams next to each other

66
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
have several beams next to each other
 

67
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,190
have several beams next to each other
you can do other

68
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
you can do other
 

69
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,550
you can do other
other patterns as well um

70
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
other patterns as well um
 

71
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,710
other patterns as well um
really good for underground bases like

72
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
really good for underground bases like
 

73
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,310
really good for underground bases like
if you have a beacon underground

74
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
if you have a beacon underground
 

75
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,030
if you have a beacon underground
but you don't want to see an opening in

76
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
but you don't want to see an opening in
 

77
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,550
but you don't want to see an opening in
the sky

78
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
the sky
 

79
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,069
the sky
you can do something like this i'm just

80
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
you can do something like this i'm just
 

81
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,030
you can do something like this i'm just
going to put this where the other

82
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
going to put this where the other
 

83
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,789
going to put this where the other
beacons are supposed to go

84
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
beacons are supposed to go
 

85
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,990
beacons are supposed to go
do something like this and

86
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
do something like this and
 

87
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,670
do something like this and
have

88
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680

 

89
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:00,230

like blocks around here

90
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240

 

91
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,469

creeper check we're good

92
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479

 

93
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,990

so the beacon ground will look like that

94
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
so the beacon ground will look like that
 

95
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,190
so the beacon ground will look like that
to make it come up

96
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200

 

97
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,710

and i'll probably do this on the

98
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
and i'll probably do this on the
 

99
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,630
and i'll probably do this on the
minecraft server with my

100
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
minecraft server with my
 

101
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,869
minecraft server with my
beacon setup it looks really cool if you

102
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
beacon setup it looks really cool if you
 

103
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,110
beacon setup it looks really cool if you
have like glass

104
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
have like glass
 

105
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,990
have like glass
like three high glass i can see the beam

106
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
like three high glass i can see the beam
 

107
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,550
like three high glass i can see the beam
through it

108
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560

 

109
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,110

and go up

110
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120

 

111
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,070

top it off with another one of these

112
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080

 

113
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,390

and then like to have your ceiling

114
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
and then like to have your ceiling
 

115
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,990
and then like to have your ceiling
up there

116
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000

 

117
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,990

i don't know i thought it was cool i

118
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
i don't know i thought it was cool i
 

119
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,390
i don't know i thought it was cool i
wanted to share it

120

121
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,949

and it doesn't look as good as i hoped

122
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
and it doesn't look as good as i hoped
 

123
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,630
and it doesn't look as good as i hoped
with the the mossy walls though

124
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
with the the mossy walls though
 

125
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,790
with the the mossy walls though
the mossy cobblestone walls looks a

126
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
the mossy cobblestone walls looks a
 

127
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,949
the mossy cobblestone walls looks a
little strange

128
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959

 

129
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,030

but yeah anyway

130
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040

 

131
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,190

well i couldn't just leave at that so i

132
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
well i couldn't just leave at that so i
 

133
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,790
well i couldn't just leave at that so i
messed with that some more and now we

134
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
messed with that some more and now we
 

135
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,309
messed with that some more and now we
have a

136
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
have a
 

137
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,509
have a
fairly big structure for our beacon to

138
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
fairly big structure for our beacon to
 

139
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,309
fairly big structure for our beacon to
protect it

140
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
protect it
 

141
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,430
protect it
and to emphasize it some more

142
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
and to emphasize it some more
 

143
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,509
and to emphasize it some more
i don't know i think it's pretty cool i

144
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
i don't know i think it's pretty cool i
 

145

like it
 

147
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,949
like it
it'll look a lot better when we get

148
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
it'll look a lot better when we get
 

149
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,309
it'll look a lot better when we get
three more beams in there though

150
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319

 

151
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,670

thought it'd be nice to go through these

158
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
thought it'd be nice to go through these

out a lot
i'm pretty sure they can't steal blocks

550
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
i'm pretty sure they can't steal blocks
 

551
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,990
i'm pretty sure they can't steal blocks
if it's on flat ground

552
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
if it's on flat ground
 

553
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,829
if it's on flat ground
like if i fill this totally in i don't

554
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
like if i fill this totally in i don't
 

555
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,509

557
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,790
think they can pick them up it's only if
they can grab the side of it like this

558
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
they can grab the side of it like this
 

559
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,629
they can grab the side of it like this
but like blocks over here they can't

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,350
reach
the outer edge i don't have to watch it

592
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
the outer edge i don't have to watch it
 

593
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,670
the outer edge i don't have to watch it
for a bit

594
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
for a bit
 

595
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,629
for a bit
uh yeah so go do the other half here and

596
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
uh yeah so go do the other half here and
 

597
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,150
uh yeah so go do the other half here and
put in some lighting

598
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
put in some lighting
 

599
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,069
put in some lighting
glowstone pattern of some sort

600
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079

 

601
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,509

i get that a lot where it makes the

602
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
i get that a lot where it makes the
 

603
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,829
i get that a lot where it makes the
noise but i didn't actually anger any of

604
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839

 

605
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,590

them

606
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
them
 

607
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,710
them
it's like if you look at them but

608
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
it's like if you look at them but
 

609
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,389
it's like if you look at them but
not at the crotch sometimes it does that

610
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
not at the crotch sometimes it does that
 

611
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,470
not at the crotch sometimes it does that
uh it's weird anyway

612
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480

 

613
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,110

well next up we are placing the grass

614
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
well next up we are placing the grass
 

615
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,750
well next up we are placing the grass
and

616
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
and
 

617
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,350
and
it should spread pretty good we got the

618
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
it should spread pretty good we got the
 

619
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,030
it should spread pretty good we got the
lights in place i

620
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
lights in place i
 

621
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,750
lights in place i
put the glowstone every fifth block it's

622
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
put the glowstone every fifth block it's
 

623
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,110
put the glowstone every fifth block it's
more than what's needed

624
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
more than what's needed
 

625
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,069
more than what's needed
but it will keep this place nice and

626
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
but it will keep this place nice and
 

627
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:14,949
but it will keep this place nice and
bright

628
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
bright
 

629
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,189
bright
and yeah you can definitely see they're

630
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
and yeah you can definitely see they're
 

631
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,470
and yeah you can definitely see they're
taken from the edges so i'll need

632
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
taken from the edges so i'll need
 

633
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,069
taken from the edges so i'll need
another block

634
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
another block
 

635
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,269
another block
uh all along here that they can't take

636
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
uh all along here that they can't take
 

637
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,310
uh all along here that they can't take
so maybe cobblestone um

638
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320

 

639
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,590

other than that it's looking pretty good

640
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600

 

641
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:41,509

seems like a lot of enderman doesn't it

642
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519

 

643
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,310

there it is some nice green pastures for

644
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
there it is some nice green pastures for
 

645
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,230
there it is some nice green pastures for
them to graze on

646
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
them to graze on
 

647
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,990
them to graze on
uh looks a lot better i think

648
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
uh looks a lot better i think
 

649
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,430
uh looks a lot better i think
it's quite the change though it's gonna

650
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
it's quite the change though it's gonna
 

651
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,189
it's quite the change though it's gonna
take some time to get used to but i do

652
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
take some time to get used to but i do
 

653
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:53,990
take some time to get used to but i do
like it more

654
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
like it more
 

655
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,030
like it more
it's a lot easier to see them too uh

656
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
it's a lot easier to see them too uh
 

657
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,990
it's a lot easier to see them too uh
when it was gray before uh there wasn't

658
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
when it was gray before uh there wasn't
 

659
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,310
when it was gray before uh there wasn't
as much contrast and

660
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
as much contrast and
 

661
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,350
as much contrast and
you know when they get a little bit

662
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
you know when they get a little bit
 

663
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,590
you know when they get a little bit
further away from your view

664
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
further away from your view
 

665
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,110
further away from your view
the ones in the back can be hard to see

666
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
the ones in the back can be hard to see
 

667
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,790
the ones in the back can be hard to see
so with the green

668
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
so with the green
 

669
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,030
so with the green
they stand out a lot more

670
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
they stand out a lot more
 

671
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,590
they stand out a lot more
i do want to try put a cobblestone fence

672
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
i do want to try put a cobblestone fence
 

673
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,750
i do want to try put a cobblestone fence
around it yet

674
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
around it yet
 

675
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,509
around it yet
i think that would be pretty good and i

676
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
i think that would be pretty good and i
 

677
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,990
i think that would be pretty good and i
don't think it'll affect it

678
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
don't think it'll affect it
 

679
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,430
don't think it'll affect it
negatively in any way

680
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440

 

681
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,670

because they shouldn't teleport behind

682
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
because they shouldn't teleport behind
 

683
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,790
because they shouldn't teleport behind
the fence

684
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800

 

685
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,110

i might grab some mossy stuff too and

686
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
i might grab some mossy stuff too and

actually one thing i'm wondering about
 

757
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,350
actually one thing i'm wondering about
these cobblestone walls they shouldn't

758
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
these cobblestone walls they shouldn't
 

759
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,069
these cobblestone walls they shouldn't
be able to

760
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
be able to
 

761
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,230
be able to
jump over them so if i

762
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
jump over them so if i
 

763
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,990
jump over them so if i
use them i might not even need a roof

764
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000

 

765
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,310

yeah interesting

766
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
yeah interesting
 

767
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,830
yeah interesting
that's one possibility

768
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
that's one possibility
 

769
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,390
that's one possibility
um but yeah instead of doing a fence

770
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
um but yeah instead of doing a fence
 

771
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,390
um but yeah instead of doing a fence
even if i do

772
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
even if i do
 

773
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,230
even if i do
put a protection over my head i'll use

774
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
put a protection over my head i'll use
 

775
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,789
put a protection over my head i'll use
water like i'll i'll put ice down and

776
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
water like i'll i'll put ice down and
 

777
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,470
water like i'll i'll put ice down and
melt it so i'll have floating water

778
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
melt it so i'll have floating water
 

779
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,750
melt it so i'll have floating water
above my head

780
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
above my head
 

781
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,110
above my head
so they won't be able to attack me

782
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
so they won't be able to attack me
 

783
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,549
so they won't be able to attack me
and they won't be able to teleport on

784
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
and they won't be able to teleport on
 

785
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,150
and they won't be able to teleport on
top of the fence because that's what's

786
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
top of the fence because that's what's
 

787
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,230
top of the fence because that's what's
happening with this a lot with me

788
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
happening with this a lot with me
 

789
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,789
happening with this a lot with me
uh they go up there sometimes they'll be

uh they go up there sometimes they'll be
 

791
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,830
uh they go up there sometimes they'll be
aggro so when i

792
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840

 

793
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,630

when i poke out of here they'll all

794
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640

801
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,990
walking this way
they'll knock me off this walkway which

802
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000

around with this i'll probably
 

899
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,710
around with this i'll probably
try to figure it out some more later i

900
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
try to figure it out some more later i
 

901
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,990

it's been so long how do we do that so

908
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
it's been so long how do we do that so
 

909
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,870
it's been so long how do we do that so
we'll do the standard road the two

910
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880

 

911
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,549

block one like this

912
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559

 

913
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,990

917
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,149

and then ladders

918
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159

 

919
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,669

930
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520

 

931
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,190

actually i had a different design for it

932
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
actually i had a different design for it
 

933
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,190
actually i had a different design for it
didn't i

934
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
didn't i
 

935
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,350
didn't i
i'm thinking back way way back to the

936
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
i'm thinking back way way back to the
 

937
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,990
i'm thinking back way way back to the
old design i think the new one

938
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
old design i think the new one
 

939
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,510
old design i think the new one
or the newer one

940
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520

 

941
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,789

struggling to remember

942
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
struggling to remember
 

943
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,590
struggling to remember
did i have water here that went like

944
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600

 

945
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,669

like that maybe

946
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679

 

947
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,270

we'll try it blocks above build our

948
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
we'll try it blocks above build our
 

949
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,510
we'll try it blocks above build our
boats

950
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520

 

951
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,430

oh the number of boats i went through

952
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
oh the number of boats i went through
 

953
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,390
oh the number of boats i went through
trying to figure all that out

954
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
trying to figure all that out
 

955
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,590
trying to figure all that out
back when it was tough to get wood so

956
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
back when it was tough to get wood so
 

957
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,310
back when it was tough to get wood so
many hours

958
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
many hours
 

959
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,950
many hours
cutting down trees

960
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960

 

961
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,590

okay that's a good sign i did not put

962
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
okay that's a good sign i did not put
 

963
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,070
okay that's a good sign i did not put
any water down the lane though

964
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
any water down the lane though
 

965
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:35,510
any water down the lane though
so we'll do that one by one

966
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520

 

967
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,789

that was weird it's like i placed the

968
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
that was weird it's like i placed the
 

969
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,830
that was weird it's like i placed the
water in the wrong spot and it corrected

970
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
water in the wrong spot and it corrected
 

971
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:46,390
water in the wrong spot and it corrected
itself

972
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400

 

973
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,870

okay

974
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880

 

975
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,310

um that thing tree is in my way

976
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
um that thing tree is in my way
 

977
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,230
um that thing tree is in my way
right so we need we'll put water here

978
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240

 

979
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,870

get out of here and we will put one

980
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880

 

981
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,710

over here

982
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720

 

983
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,830

oh

984
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840

 

985
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,390

i think it's working

986
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400

 

987
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,669

just make sure the water's flowing

988
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
just make sure the water's flowing
 

989
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,149
just make sure the water's flowing
straight at the end here

990
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159

 

991
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,789

well that's good news yeah i would like

992
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
well that's good news yeah i would like
 

993
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,350
well that's good news yeah i would like
to have a

994
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
to have a
 

995
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,549
to have a
eats road set up somewhere in my world

996
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
eats road set up somewhere in my world
 

997
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,909
eats road set up somewhere in my world
just for the coolness factor i think it

998
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
just for the coolness factor i think it
 

999
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,269
just for the coolness factor i think it
i think it still works actually looks

1000
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:43,279
i think it still works actually looks
 

1001
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,430
i think it still works actually looks
like it's going really quick too

1002
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
like it's going really quick too
 

1003
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,830
like it's going really quick too
because they did speed up boats like

1004
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
because they did speed up boats like
 

1005
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,870
because they did speed up boats like
it's not

1006
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
it's not
 

1007
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,470
it's not
quite the same as it used to be oh that

1008
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
quite the same as it used to be oh that
 

1009
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,470
quite the same as it used to be oh that
was weird i wasn't

1010
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
was weird i wasn't
 

1011
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,990
was weird i wasn't
it's kind of along this side i think

1012
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
it's kind of along this side i think
 

1013
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,430
it's kind of along this side i think
that's not right yeah i'll have to set

1014
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
that's not right yeah i'll have to set
 

1015
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,390
that's not right yeah i'll have to set
up a big

1016
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
up a big
 

1017
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,750
up a big
scale test on this

1018
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
scale test on this
 

1019
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,909
scale test on this
but it almost seems like it's not going

1020
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
but it almost seems like it's not going
 

1021
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,269
but it almost seems like it's not going
straight

1022
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279

 

1023
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,789

anyway i don't have time to mess with

1024
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
anyway i don't have time to mess with
 

1025
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,029
anyway i don't have time to mess with
this today for for a long time

1026
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
this today for for a long time
 

1027
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,070
this today for for a long time
