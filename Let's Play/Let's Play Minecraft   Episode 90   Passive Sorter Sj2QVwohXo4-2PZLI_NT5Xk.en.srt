this is where we're going to connect
with our emp units at all these plus

47
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,830
uh right now the mobs are just falling
down this

48
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
down this
 

49
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,149
down this
soil section here and hitting the ground

50
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
soil section here and hitting the ground
 

51
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,429
soil section here and hitting the ground
and dying

52
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
and dying
 

53
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,469

collectively all the other in the middle

54
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
collectively all the other in the middle
 

55
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,950
collectively all the other in the middle
up here i think the only change i've

56
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
up here i think the only change i've
 

57
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,950
up here i think the only change i've
made since last episode is i

58
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
made since last episode is i
 

59
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,550
made since last episode is i
did end up lowering the stream here

60
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
did end up lowering the stream here
 

61
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,590
did end up lowering the stream here
one block because the mobs were kind of

62
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
one block because the mobs were kind of
 

63
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,469
one block because the mobs were kind of
jumping out of it

64
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
jumping out of it
 

65
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,670
jumping out of it
back into these side ones which was

66
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
back into these side ones which was
 

67
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,990
back into these side ones which was
slowing them down just a little bit

68
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000

 

69
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,350

so it should work a little bit better

70
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
so it should work a little bit better
 

71
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,550
so it should work a little bit better
like that which is good

72
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560

 

73
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,030

faster moving mobs is more efficient

74
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
faster moving mobs is more efficient
 

75
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,109
faster moving mobs is more efficient

145
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,270

a little bit laggy that ceiling won't be

146
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
a little bit laggy that ceiling won't be
 

147
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,270
a little bit laggy that ceiling won't be
completely flat like it is right now

148
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
completely flat like it is right now
 

149
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,030
completely flat like it is right now
in the end but uh one thing at a time

150
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
in the end but uh one thing at a time
 

151
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,470
in the end but uh one thing at a time
so that's what the tubes are gonna look

152
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
so that's what the tubes are gonna look
 

153
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,869
so that's what the tubes are gonna look
like there will be a back wall

154
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
like there will be a back wall
 

155
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,229
like there will be a back wall
all around here so it's not like you're

156
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
all around here so it's not like you're
 

157
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,430
all around here so it's not like you're
going to be looking at sky

158
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440

 

159
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,750

lighting in here i still haven't figured

160
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
lighting in here i still haven't figured
 

161
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,789
lighting in here i still haven't figured
that out i'm

162
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
that out i'm
 

163
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,430
that out i'm
almost thinking if i put lighting here

164
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
almost thinking if i put lighting here
 

165
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,270

348
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
and we're gonna use these kind because i
 

349
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,949
and we're gonna use these kind because i
think they'll look best with snow

350
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959

 

351
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,829

the old plain original half slabs

352
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

353
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,029

okay we'll have one

354
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
okay we'll have one
 

355
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,230
okay we'll have one
there it's safe to put our water here

356
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
there it's safe to put our water here
 

357
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,590
there it's safe to put our water here
now

358
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600

 

359
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,030

so we get pushed to the right we're

360
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
so we get pushed to the right we're
 

361
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,190
so we get pushed to the right we're
gonna have our pig wolf separator here

362
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
gonna have our pig wolf separator here
 

363
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,230
gonna have our pig wolf separator here
next and i believe

364
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
next and i believe
 

365
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,150
next and i believe
i want them to go

366
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160

 

367
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,310

to the right yeah to the right

368
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320

 

369
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,110

the one i made on chocolate island big

370
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
the one i made on chocolate island big
 

371
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,590
the one i made on chocolate island big
separate i had on chocolate island

372
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
separate i had on chocolate island
 

373
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,630
separate i had on chocolate island
was only

374
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640

 

375
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,190

one wide really this one we're gonna

376
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
one wide really this one we're gonna
 

377
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,269
one wide really this one we're gonna
make at least two wide because the odd

378
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
make at least two wide because the odd
 

379
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,990
make at least two wide because the odd
time i was finding pigs

380
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
time i was finding pigs
 

381
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,509
time i was finding pigs
made it past the pig separator and

382
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
made it past the pig separator and
 

383
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,790
made it past the pig separator and
ended up with the sheep in the cows

384
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
ended up with the sheep in the cows
 

385
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,310
ended up with the sheep in the cows
when there was when there's a lot of

386
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
when there was when there's a lot of
 

387
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,190
when there was when there's a lot of
pigs entering the thing at a time

388
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200

 

389
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,710

uh yeah we need half slabs here too

390
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720

 

391
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,470

and we will put

392
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480

 

393
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,990

glass here

394
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000

 

395
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,310

so the idea is we'll have a stream a

396
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
so the idea is we'll have a stream a
 

397
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,750
so the idea is we'll have a stream a
water stream right here that's going to

398
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
water stream right here that's going to
 

399
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,949
water stream right here that's going to
flow

400
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959

 

401
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,990

this way and also diagonally

402
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
this way and also diagonally
 

403
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,269
this way and also diagonally
this way

404
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
this way
 

405
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,509
this way
oh you know what we're doing this wrong

406
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
oh you know what we're doing this wrong
 

407
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,110
oh you know what we're doing this wrong
guys we're doing it wrong

408
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
guys we're doing it wrong
 

409
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,190
guys we're doing it wrong
it's been a while we don't want half

410
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
it's been a while we don't want half
 

411
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,310
it's been a while we don't want half
slaps here

412
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
slaps here
 

413
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,870
slaps here
we want solid blocks here

414
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880

 

415
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,269

pigs are one block high sheep and cows

416
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
pigs are one block high sheep and cows
 

417
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,069
pigs are one block high sheep and cows
sorry pigs are one block high wolves are

418
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
sorry pigs are one block high wolves are
 

419
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,509
sorry pigs are one block high wolves are
less than one block high

420
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
less than one block high
 

421
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,670
less than one block high
so they'll fit through this one high gap

422
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
so they'll fit through this one high gap
 

423
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,230
so they'll fit through this one high gap
okay sheep and cows they're about a

424
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
okay sheep and cows they're about a
 

425
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,389
okay sheep and cows they're about a
block and a half just under

426
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
block and a half just under
 

427
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,829
block and a half just under
so they won't be able to fit through

428
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
so they won't be able to fit through
 

429
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,430
so they won't be able to fit through
here they'll continue going on

430
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
here they'll continue going on
 

431
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,550
here they'll continue going on
this way

432
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560

 

433
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,030

right and

434
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
right and
 

435
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,430
right and
so we'll build this up and place some

436
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
so we'll build this up and place some
 

437
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,550
so we'll build this up and place some
soil temporarily

438
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560

 

439
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,670

glass over here

440
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
glass over here
 

441
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,710
glass over here
and the trick i found with separating

442
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
and the trick i found with separating
 

443
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,990
and the trick i found with separating
pigs

444
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
pigs
 

445
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,030
pigs
and wolves 100 from sheep and cows was

446
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
and wolves 100 from sheep and cows was
 

447
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,030
and wolves 100 from sheep and cows was
to make them rub their heads against the

448
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
to make them rub their heads against the
 

449
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,110
to make them rub their heads against the
ceiling

450
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
ceiling
 

451
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,350
ceiling
the other methods before i figured that

452
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
the other methods before i figured that
 

453
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,150
the other methods before i figured that
out had

454
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
out had
 

455
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,949
out had
the water on the ground and they would

456
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
the water on the ground and they would
 

457
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,910
the water on the ground and they would
bob up and down

458
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
bob up and down
 

459
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,269
bob up and down
and most of the time they would get

460
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
and most of the time they would get
 

461
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,350
and most of the time they would get
separated but sometimes it wouldn't

462
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
separated but sometimes it wouldn't
 

463
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,190
separated but sometimes it wouldn't
so in order to get this working

464
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
so in order to get this working
 

465
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,750
so in order to get this working
100 you need them to rub their heads

466
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
100 you need them to rub their heads
 

467
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,870
100 you need them to rub their heads
against this

468
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
against this
 

469
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,870
against this
glass block here

470
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880

 

471
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,670

which continues oops to here

472
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
which continues oops to here
 

473
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,910
which continues oops to here
um not sure how long we're gonna make

474
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
um not sure how long we're gonna make
 

475
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,269
um not sure how long we're gonna make
this

476
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
this
 

477
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,230
this
probably probably at least five blocks

478
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240

 

479
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,710

and the water will go here it'll flow

480
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:49,720
and the water will go here it'll flow
 

481
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,230
and the water will go here it'll flow
[Music]

482
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
[Music]
 

483
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,829
[Music]
yeah this is probably good enough it can

484
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
yeah this is probably good enough it can
 

485
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,310
yeah this is probably good enough it can
probably

486
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
probably
 

487
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,470
probably
wide enough i should say probably wide

488
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
wide enough i should say probably wide
 

489
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,949
wide enough i should say probably wide
enough

490
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959

 

491
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,870

so the pig and wolf area here is two

492
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
so the pig and wolf area here is two
 

493
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,829
so the pig and wolf area here is two
blocks wide get out of here

494
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
blocks wide get out of here
 

495
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,670
blocks wide get out of here
the one on chocolate island was only one

496
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
the one on chocolate island was only one
 

497
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,230
the one on chocolate island was only one
wide and they would sometimes jam

498
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
wide and they would sometimes jam
 

499
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,310
wide and they would sometimes jam
up

500
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320

 

501
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,350

so we'll run this and

502
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360

 

503
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,829

just temporarily we'll have that there

504
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839

 

505
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,590

kind of trying to be careful not to

506
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
kind of trying to be careful not to
 

507
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:39,030
kind of trying to be careful not to
spill water everywhere

508
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
spill water everywhere
 

509
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,710
spill water everywhere
uh let's get some more lighting

510
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
uh let's get some more lighting
 

511
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,230
uh let's get some more lighting
so if we place water right now it's

512
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
so if we place water right now it's
 

513
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,629
so if we place water right now it's
gonna flow

514
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
gonna flow
 

515
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,230
gonna flow
like this

516
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
like this
 

517
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,509
like this
and that was some lag

518
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519

 

519
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,750

uh break time

520
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760

 

521
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,990

yeah sometimes when fraps uh splits my

522
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
yeah sometimes when fraps uh splits my
 

523
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,110
yeah sometimes when fraps uh splits my
recordings up

524
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
recordings up
 

525
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,550
recordings up

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,069
the new the new file it creates
is super laggy when it's recording so

528
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
is super laggy when it's recording so
 

529
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,870
is super laggy when it's recording so
i need to stop recording and restart

530
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
i need to stop recording and restart
 

531
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,790
i need to stop recording and restart

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
this today
 

547
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,550
this today
well at least get very close to finished

548
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560

 

549
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,629

okay we have

550
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639

 

551
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,430

have it like this how far is this it

552
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
have it like this how far is this it
 

553
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,470
have it like this how far is this it
goes

554
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
goes
 

555
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,470
goes
since the water is there it goes one two

556
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
since the water is there it goes one two
 

557
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,230
since the water is there it goes one two
three four five

558
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
three four five
 

559
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,189
three four five
six seven eight so that's as far as

560
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
six seven eight so that's as far as
 

561
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,829
six seven eight so that's as far as
water will go

562
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839

 

563
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,990

so if we put a block here it'll be safe

564
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
so if we put a block here it'll be safe
 

565
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,189
so if we put a block here it'll be safe
to put water down

566
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
to put water down
 

567
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,629
to put water down
here without it pouring everywhere

568
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
here without it pouring everywhere
 

569
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,829
here without it pouring everywhere
because that's that's where it'll end

570
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839

 

571
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,470

okay

572
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480

 

573
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,150

so now in this stream we should have

574
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
so now in this stream we should have
 

575
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,230
so now in this stream we should have
wolves and pigs

576
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
wolves and pigs
 

577
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,670
wolves and pigs
and in this stream here we'll just have

578
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
and in this stream here we'll just have
 

579
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,910
and in this stream here we'll just have
sheep and

580
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920

 

581
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,069

holy

582
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079

 

583
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,829

wow okay that scared me

584
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839

ah
 

587
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,030
ah
uh break time

588
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040

 

589
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,030

okay continuing on i've changed my mind

590
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
okay continuing on i've changed my mind
 

591
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,829
okay continuing on i've changed my mind
about something

592
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
about something
 

593
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,790
about something
so this is going to be chickens now this

594
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
so this is going to be chickens now this
 

595
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,069
so this is going to be chickens now this
will be pigs

596
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
will be pigs
 

597
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,710
will be pigs
this will be sheep and cows this will be

598
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
this will be sheep and cows this will be
 

599
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,269
this will be sheep and cows this will be
wolves

600
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
wolves
 

601
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,629
wolves
this will be banking vape vacant

602
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
this will be banking vape vacant
 

603
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,030
this will be banking vape vacant
decent oh i'm so bad with words

604
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
decent oh i'm so bad with words
 

605
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,829
decent oh i'm so bad with words
i can't remember what it is now the

606
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
i can't remember what it is now the
 

607
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,990
i can't remember what it is now the
reason for that is wolves are

608
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
reason for that is wolves are
 

609
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,870
reason for that is wolves are
rarer than the other mob types and they

610
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
rarer than the other mob types and they
 

611
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,189
rarer than the other mob types and they
don't drop anything

612
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
don't drop anything
 

613
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,150
don't drop anything
the first ones i'm going to come up to

614
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
the first ones i'm going to come up to
 

615
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,150
the first ones i'm going to come up to
first one i'll come to when i

616
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
first one i'll come to when i
 

617
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,110
first one i'll come to when i
walk to my emp units will be this one

618
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
walk to my emp units will be this one
 

619
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,150
walk to my emp units will be this one
and this one then this one

620
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
and this one then this one
 

621
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,389
and this one then this one
so if wolves aren't dropping anything i

622
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
so if wolves aren't dropping anything i
 

623
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,509
so if wolves aren't dropping anything i
want to be the first

624
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
want to be the first
 

625
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,110
want to be the first
the furthest one away from me

626
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120

 

627
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,189

uh okay so continuing on let's go

628
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
uh okay so continuing on let's go
 

629
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,710
uh okay so continuing on let's go
let's go here we go you can cover this

630
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
let's go here we go you can cover this
 

631
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,670
let's go here we go you can cover this
up

632
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
up
 

633
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,670
up
pretty sure

634
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680

 

635
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,990

boom done okay

636
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000

 

637
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,269

next so all three of our streams here

638
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
next so all three of our streams here
 

639
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,189
next so all three of our streams here
are incomplete at the moment

640
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199

 

641
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,629

which one should i work on this one's

642
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
which one should i work on this one's
 

643
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,069
which one should i work on this one's
pigs

644
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079

 

645
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:18,629

we can probably very simply

646
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639

 

647
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,749

just run it like this straight there

648
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
just run it like this straight there
 

649
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,030
just run it like this straight there
and that's another reason why i kind of

650
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
and that's another reason why i kind of
 

651
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,389
and that's another reason why i kind of
want that pigs because i think it will

652
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
want that pigs because i think it will
 

653
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,629
want that pigs because i think it will
be really simple

654
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
be really simple
 

655
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,069
be really simple
uh i forgot that

656
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
uh i forgot that
 

657
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,629
uh i forgot that
we went up two blocks here so i didn't

658
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
we went up two blocks here so i didn't
 

659
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,150
we went up two blocks here so i didn't
really need to have this raised off the

660
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
really need to have this raised off the
 

661
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,550
really need to have this raised off the
ground

662
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
ground
 

663
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,949
ground
at the start because we gained the block

664
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
at the start because we gained the block
 

665
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,590
at the start because we gained the block
anyway

666
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600

 

667
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,870

uh anyway does it doesn't matter much

668
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
uh anyway does it doesn't matter much
 

669
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,069
uh anyway does it doesn't matter much
it just makes it kind of easier

670
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
it just makes it kind of easier
 

671
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,350
it just makes it kind of easier
so yeah we'll go like this

672
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
so yeah we'll go like this
 

673
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,990
so yeah we'll go like this
right to here

674
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
right to here
 

675
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,990
right to here
and the pigs will fall down

676
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
and the pigs will fall down
 

677
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,230
and the pigs will fall down
wrong did it wrong try again

678
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
wrong did it wrong try again
 

679
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,309
wrong did it wrong try again
we need a diagonal water stream to

680
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
we need a diagonal water stream to
 

681
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,510
we need a diagonal water stream to
separate the wolves

682
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
separate the wolves
 

683
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,150
separate the wolves
from the pigs so this needs to come out

684
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
from the pigs so this needs to come out
 

685
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,110
from the pigs so this needs to come out
one more block

686
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
one more block
 

687
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,909
one more block
like so glass

688
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919

 

689
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,189

water stream will go here pushing

690
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
water stream will go here pushing
 

691
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,270
water stream will go here pushing
them kind of that way

692
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280

 

693
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,270

and

694
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280

 

695
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,909

first

696
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919

 

697
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,549

how to do this how to do this okay i

698
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
how to do this how to do this okay i
 

699
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,590
how to do this how to do this okay i
think we can put

700
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600

 

701
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,710

a ladder here that'll be our first

702
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
a ladder here that'll be our first
 

703
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,390
a ladder here that'll be our first
separator for the wolves i think we'll

704
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
separator for the wolves i think we'll
 

705
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,870
separator for the wolves i think we'll
have

706
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
have
 

707
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,310
have
two that's all we need

708
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320

 

709
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,590

i'm hoping so

710
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
i'm hoping so
 

711
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,350
i'm hoping so
run this up have another ladder here

712
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
run this up have another ladder here
 

713
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,590
run this up have another ladder here
and so the way this works is pigs are so

714
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
and so the way this works is pigs are so
 

715
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,630
and so the way this works is pigs are so
fat that they won't

716
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
fat that they won't
 

717
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,029
fat that they won't
fit if there's a ladder there but wolves

718
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
fit if there's a ladder there but wolves
 

719
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,789
fit if there's a ladder there but wolves
are able to fit through

720
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
are able to fit through
 

721
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,909
are able to fit through
that gap because uh ladders have a

722
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
that gap because uh ladders have a
 

723
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,350
that gap because uh ladders have a
little bit of a

724
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
little bit of a
 

725
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,590
little bit of a
physical collision mask

726
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
physical collision mask
 

727
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,909
physical collision mask
makes makes it a little bit thinner here

728
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
makes makes it a little bit thinner here
 

729
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,590
makes makes it a little bit thinner here
than if it was a full block

730
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
than if it was a full block
 

731
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,950
than if it was a full block
width okay

732
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
width okay
 

733
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,630
width okay
now let's add another torch so you guys

734
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
now let's add another torch so you guys
 

735
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,110
now let's add another torch so you guys
can see

736
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
can see
 

737
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,789
can see
so we have diagonal water stream going

738
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
so we have diagonal water stream going
 

739
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,750
so we have diagonal water stream going
that way we will have

740
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760

 

741
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,070

oops block there

742
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
oops block there
 

743
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,830
oops block there
and there

744
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
and there
 

745
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,310
and there
that'll be our split

746
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320

 

747
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,830

yeah this should be really easy so we'll

748
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
yeah this should be really easy so we'll
 

749
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,870
yeah this should be really easy so we'll
have

750
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
have
 

751
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,549
have
snow there

752
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559

 

753
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,710

oh

754
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720

 

755
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,070

i'm just worried now that the

756
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
i'm just worried now that the
 

757
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,470
i'm just worried now that the
water streams we need two here and they

758
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
water streams we need two here and they
 

759
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,350
water streams we need two here and they
might create a

760
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
might create a
 

761
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,750
might create a
dead no no i just get rid of this

762
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760

 

763
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,430

yeah so now we only need one water

764
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
yeah so now we only need one water
 

765
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,909
yeah so now we only need one water
stream for this

766
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
stream for this
 

767
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,830
stream for this
okay maybe i'll just use glass

768
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
okay maybe i'll just use glass
 

769
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,029
okay maybe i'll just use glass
here and i just killed a torch so now

770
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
here and i just killed a torch so now
 

771
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,150
here and i just killed a torch so now
you can't see

772
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160

 

773
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,430

and run it right to our wolf

774
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440

 

775
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,590

ah dang that's not our wolf one is it

776
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
ah dang that's not our wolf one is it
 

777
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,630
ah dang that's not our wolf one is it
that's our shaping tower

778
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640

 

779
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,350

how quickly i forget so we like we gotta

780
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
how quickly i forget so we like we gotta
 

781
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,710
how quickly i forget so we like we gotta
go all the way over here

782
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720

 

783
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:06,310

how do we do that the best way

784
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
how do we do that the best way
 

785
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,149
how do we do that the best way
snow gets destroyed so quick with

786
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
snow gets destroyed so quick with
 

787
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,750
snow gets destroyed so quick with
shovels

788
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
shovels
 

789
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,230
shovels
you gotta be careful

790
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240

 

791
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,830

oh yeah that's the other thing we have

792
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
oh yeah that's the other thing we have
 

793
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,990
oh yeah that's the other thing we have
our stream here they might interfere

794
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
our stream here they might interfere
 

795
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,190
our stream here they might interfere
with each other if we're not

796
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
with each other if we're not
 

797
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,190
with each other if we're not
careful

798
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200

 

799
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200

okay well we'll go

800
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,210

 

801
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,190

we only need it one block high

804
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559

 

805
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,390

and we can have a half slab going over

806
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
and we can have a half slab going over
 

807
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,230
and we can have a half slab going over
top okay this will work

808
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
top okay this will work
 

809
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:48,710
top okay this will work
this will all work good pretty sure

810
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
this will all work good pretty sure
 

811
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,990
this will all work good pretty sure
okay go all the way along let's

812
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
okay go all the way along let's
 

813
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,590
okay go all the way along let's
go here

814
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600

 

815
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,549

you get the idea so they'll come

816
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
you get the idea so they'll come
 

817
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,149
you get the idea so they'll come
all the way to here

818
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159

 

819
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,390

the longest stream is the wolf one so

820
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
the longest stream is the wolf one so
 

821
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,630
the longest stream is the wolf one so
it's a good thing they're the rarest

822
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
it's a good thing they're the rarest
 

823
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,950
it's a good thing they're the rarest
because that's the least efficient one

824
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960

 

825
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,510

okay pigs go down here

826
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520

 

827
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,750

uh it's safe to place our water now

828
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760

 

829
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,510

i believe yes

830
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520

 

831
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,190

oh we need a sign there

832
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
oh we need a sign there
 

833
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,549
oh we need a sign there
we don't want water flowing down

834
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559

 

835
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,310

so we'll put a sign there to keep the

836
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
so we'll put a sign there to keep the
 

837
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,230
so we'll put a sign there to keep the
water from falling down

838
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
water from falling down
 

839
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,590
water from falling down
and now we will place our water

840
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
and now we will place our water
 

841
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,270
and now we will place our water
good so it's a diagonal stream going

842
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
good so it's a diagonal stream going
 

843
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,549
good so it's a diagonal stream going
that way wolves should go through

844
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
that way wolves should go through
 

845
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,270
that way wolves should go through
these two gaps and whatever's left

846
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
these two gaps and whatever's left
 

847
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,950
these two gaps and whatever's left
should be pigs and they'll fall down

848
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
should be pigs and they'll fall down
 

849
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,510
should be pigs and they'll fall down
here

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:12,549

if i figured this all right oh

852
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:12,559
if i figured this all right oh
 

853
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,110
if i figured this all right oh

that should be it for our pigs
 

875
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,070
that should be it for our pigs
i am gonna get some more water and then

876
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
i am gonna get some more water and then
 

877
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,510
i am gonna get some more water and then
we will be back

878
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520

 

879
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,830

dang we're like 22 minutes in guys we

880
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
dang we're like 22 minutes in guys we
 

881
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,710
dang we're like 22 minutes in guys we
gotta

882
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
gotta
 

883
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,750
gotta
go go go hurry hurry hurry

884
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
go go go hurry hurry hurry
 

885
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,190
go go go hurry hurry hurry
look at all those guys okay to be fair

886
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
look at all those guys okay to be fair
 

887
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,070
look at all those guys okay to be fair
last time i

888
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
last time i
 

889
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,070
last time i
did all this mob stuff this mob sorting

890
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
did all this mob stuff this mob sorting
 

891
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,669
did all this mob stuff this mob sorting
stuff it took i think at least five

892
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
stuff it took i think at least five
 

893
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,029
stuff it took i think at least five
episodes so we're

894
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
episodes so we're
 

895
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,350
episodes so we're
doing great on time if you consider that

896
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
doing great on time if you consider that
 

897
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,190
doing great on time if you consider that
kind of mess this up we don't want it

898
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
kind of mess this up we don't want it
 

899
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,110
kind of mess this up we don't want it
too high in here

900
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
too high in here
 

901
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,470
too high in here
necessarily try to keep it one high i

902
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
necessarily try to keep it one high i
 

903
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,270
necessarily try to keep it one high i
believe would be better

904
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280

 

905
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,270

since uh both the pigs and the wolves

906
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
since uh both the pigs and the wolves
 

907
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,350
since uh both the pigs and the wolves
will fit in a one-high gap

908
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360

 

909
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,430

let's get rid of this

910
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
let's get rid of this
 

911
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,510
let's get rid of this
keep it cleaner not again

912
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
keep it cleaner not again
 

913
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,230
keep it cleaner not again
holy ah i'll see you at the top

914
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240

 

915
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,750

right so the wolves are going to come

916
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
right so the wolves are going to come
 

917
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,710
right so the wolves are going to come
out here

918
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:00,720

 

919
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,590

they'll either fall in the stream over

920
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
they'll either fall in the stream over
 

921
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:03,990
they'll either fall in the stream over
here

922
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
here
 

923
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,310
here
or over here doesn't matter they go to

924
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
or over here doesn't matter they go to
 

925
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,590
or over here doesn't matter they go to
the same place

926
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600

 

927
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,269

right so we can cover this

928
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
right so we can cover this
 

929
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,190
right so we can cover this
keep them from escaping

930
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
keep them from escaping
 

931
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,870
keep them from escaping
and yeah

932
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880

 

933
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,310

okay so this part here it's gonna get a

934
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
okay so this part here it's gonna get a
 

935
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,350
okay so this part here it's gonna get a
little bit more tricky

936
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
little bit more tricky
 

937
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,710
little bit more tricky
actually let's do the chicken stuff

938
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
actually let's do the chicken stuff
 

939
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,830
actually let's do the chicken stuff
that's really easy

940
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840

 

941
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,390

okay chicken stuff so our water stream

942
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
okay chicken stuff so our water stream
 

943
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,950
okay chicken stuff so our water stream
there will

944
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
there will
 

945
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,390
there will
go right and then over so that's one two

946
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
go right and then over so that's one two
 

947
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,789
go right and then over so that's one two
three

948
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
three
 

949
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,870
three
four blocks so far

950
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
four blocks so far
 

951
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,630
four blocks so far
that's the fourth block that's a fifth

952
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
that's the fourth block that's a fifth
 

953
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,470
that's the fourth block that's a fifth
block

954
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
block
 

955
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,190
block
uh let's just run it this way six seven

956
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
uh let's just run it this way six seven
 

957
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,390
uh let's just run it this way six seven
eight maximum length of water is eight

958
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
eight maximum length of water is eight
 

959
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,110
eight maximum length of water is eight
blocks

960
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
blocks
 

961
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,950
blocks
so now we will go down one level

962
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
so now we will go down one level
 

963
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,750
so now we will go down one level
and keep on extending it further we

964
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
and keep on extending it further we
 

965
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,950
and keep on extending it further we
can't use

966
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
can't use
 

967
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,190
can't use
stairs or half slabs when dealing with

968
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
stairs or half slabs when dealing with
 

969
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,870
stairs or half slabs when dealing with
the chickens because they can get stuck

970
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
the chickens because they can get stuck
 

971
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,070
the chickens because they can get stuck
in them

972
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
in them
 

973
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,350
in them
so we need to go down a level

974
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
so we need to go down a level
 

975
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,310
so we need to go down a level
old school method to extend our water

976
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
old school method to extend our water
 

977
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,110
old school method to extend our water
stream

978
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120

 

979
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,230

or else resort to using pistons somehow

980
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
or else resort to using pistons somehow
 

981
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,870
or else resort to using pistons somehow
but that's uh not really the best

982
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
but that's uh not really the best
 

983
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,710
but that's uh not really the best
solution

984
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
solution
 

985
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,549
solution
because it will lag your game if you

986
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
because it will lag your game if you
 

987
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,590
because it will lag your game if you
have to use pistons

988
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600

 

989
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,669

that's five six seven eight

990
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
that's five six seven eight
 

991
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,390
that's five six seven eight
and one more level it's worked out

992
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
and one more level it's worked out
 

993
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,310
and one more level it's worked out
pretty good

994
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320

 

995
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,549

ends there and we will have

996
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
ends there and we will have
 

997
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:57,590
ends there and we will have
a sign there assuming we had a sign

998
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
a sign there assuming we had a sign
 

999
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,830
a sign there assuming we had a sign
to keep the water stream from flowing

1000
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
to keep the water stream from flowing
 

1001
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,110
to keep the water stream from flowing
down

1002
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
down
 

1003
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,950
down
so let me get rid of this i gotta make

1004
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
so let me get rid of this i gotta make
 

1005
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,390
so let me get rid of this i gotta make
sure i don't fall

1006
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
sure i don't fall
 

1007
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,310
sure i don't fall
down it again

1008
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320

 

1009
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,590

this will extend

1010
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600

 

1011
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,549

and this will go like this

1012
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559

 

1013
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:27,350

not like that ah darn it fell off

1014
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360

 

1015
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:38,789

so build up the sides for over here

1016
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:38,799
so build up the sides for over here
 

1017
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,789
so build up the sides for over here
uh actually we should try place our

1018
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:40,799
uh actually we should try place our
 

1019
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,870
uh actually we should try place our
water if we can

1020
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880

 

1021
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,710

i don't think we can without destroying

1022
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
i don't think we can without destroying
 

1023
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,149
i don't think we can without destroying
a block

1024
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
a block
 

1025
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,269
a block
we'll get to that in a bit

1026
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279

 

1027
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,029

gotta hurry gotta hurry

1028
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039

 

1029
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,510

wasting too much time here i actually

1030
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
wasting too much time here i actually
 

1031
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,350
wasting too much time here i actually
wanted to like test this all out this

1032
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
wanted to like test this all out this
 

1033
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,630
wanted to like test this all out this
episode

1034
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
episode
 

1035
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,830
episode
see the emp stuff in action but uh

1036
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
see the emp stuff in action but uh
 

1037
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,470
see the emp stuff in action but uh
don't know if that's gonna happen now

1038
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480

 

1039
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,990

okay we only want this one high really

1040
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
okay we only want this one high really
 

1041
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,750
okay we only want this one high really
drop there place our water stream

1042
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
drop there place our water stream
 

1043
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,750
drop there place our water stream
already

1044
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760

 

1045
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:37,750

and go down a block here

1046
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760

 

1047
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,510

then we'll run it right to

1048
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520

 

1049
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,430

the end here not super

1050
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
the end here not super
 

1051
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,630
the end here not super
complicated or exciting that's how you

1052
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
complicated or exciting that's how you
 

1053
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,990
complicated or exciting that's how you
do it

1054
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000

 

1055
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,310

need more water should have set up a

1056
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320
need more water should have set up a
 

1057
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,350
need more water should have set up a
pool an

1058
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
pool an
 

1059
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,510
pool an
infinite pool down there although i

1060
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
infinite pool down there although i
 

1061
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:11,830
infinite pool down there although i
guess this isn't too far

1062
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840

 

1063
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,110

see put that there goes to the end

1064
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
see put that there goes to the end
 

1065
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,669
see put that there goes to the end
cover this all up so i don't fall down

1066
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
cover this all up so i don't fall down
 

1067
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,830
cover this all up so i don't fall down
there again

1068
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840

 

1069
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,830

good okay sweet

1070
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:28,840

 

1071
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,230

awesome

1072
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
awesome
 

1073
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,750
awesome
okay i'm going to attempt to place water

1074
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
okay i'm going to attempt to place water
 

1075
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,510
okay i'm going to attempt to place water
and then a glass block quickly so it

1076
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
and then a glass block quickly so it
 

1077
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:33,990
and then a glass block quickly so it
doesn't

1078
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
doesn't
 

1079
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,029
doesn't
pour out everywhere

1080
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039

 

1081
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,230

that's how you do it like a pro awesome

1082
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240

 

1083
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:54,070

so chicken separator should be done

1084
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080

 

1085
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,909

chicken separator is done pig separator

1086
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
chicken separator is done pig separator
 

1087
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,909
chicken separator is done pig separator
is done wolf separator is mostly done

1088
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
is done wolf separator is mostly done
 

1089
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,630
is done wolf separator is mostly done
sheep and cows they gotta get over they

1090
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
sheep and cows they gotta get over they
 

1091
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,190
sheep and cows they gotta get over they
gotta get

1092
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
gotta get
 

1093
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,230
gotta get
over here so we can do that

1094
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
over here so we can do that
 

1095
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,230
over here so we can do that
fairly simple we're allowed to run a

1096
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
fairly simple we're allowed to run a
 

1097
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,710
fairly simple we're allowed to run a
half slab over top here

1098
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
half slab over top here
 

1099
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,990
half slab over top here
we'll go underneath it i'm expecting

1100
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000

 

1101
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,950

maybe we'll put a glass block over

1102
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
maybe we'll put a glass block over
 

1103
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,070
maybe we'll put a glass block over
over here wolves should go underneath

1104
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
over here wolves should go underneath
 

1105
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,630
over here wolves should go underneath
that

1106
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640

 

1107
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,870

this can just cross over top

1108
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880

 

1109
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,990

let's see how long is that

1110
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
let's see how long is that
 

1111
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,029
let's see how long is that
stream starts there one two three four

1112
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
stream starts there one two three four
 

1113
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,430
stream starts there one two three four
five

1114
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
five
 

1115
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,430
five
six seven so far i can go one more

1116
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440

 

1117
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,350

okay if we destroy this it shouldn't

1118
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
okay if we destroy this it shouldn't
 

1119
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,470
okay if we destroy this it shouldn't
spill out

1120
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
spill out
 

1121
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,070
spill out
good very good

1122
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080

very good okay
 

1125
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,310
very good okay
and finally we can run a short little

1126
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,320
and finally we can run a short little
 

1127
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,789
and finally we can run a short little
stream

1128
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
stream
 

1129
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:14,720
stream
to here

1130
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:14,730

 

1131
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:20,070

[Music]

1133
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,269

maybe we'll just have it on the ground

1134
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:21,279
maybe we'll just have it on the ground
 

1135
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,430
maybe we'll just have it on the ground
level doesn't really matter

1136
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440

 

1137
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:35,110

am i out of glass a little bit left

1138
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120

 

1139
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,149

1141
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,310
oh i thought i fell down again okay i'm
gonna get more glass and more water

1142
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
gonna get more glass and more water
 

1143
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,149
gonna get more glass and more water
see you in a second

1144
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159

 

1145
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,710

okay over 30 minutes now let's finish

1146
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
okay over 30 minutes now let's finish
 

1147
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,350
okay over 30 minutes now let's finish
this quickly

1148
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
this quickly
 

1149
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,269
this quickly
okay we'll have a sign here keep the

1150
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:51,279
okay we'll have a sign here keep the
 

1151
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,269
okay we'll have a sign here keep the
water from flowing down

1152
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
water from flowing down
 

1153
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,430
water from flowing down
our long tube

1154
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440

 

1155
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,350

sheep and cows will fall down to the

1156
00:30:59,350 --> 00:30:59,360
sheep and cows will fall down to the
 

1157
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,350
sheep and cows will fall down to the
stream stream will push them down the

1158
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,360
stream stream will push them down the
 

1159
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,389
stream stream will push them down the
hole

1160
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:02,399
hole
 

1161
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,509
hole
very simple okay

1162
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:05,519
very simple okay
 

1163
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,269
very simple okay
let's fill this in

1164
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279

 

1165
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,310

and one there

1166
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,320
and one there
 

1167
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,269
and one there
blocks there

1168
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279

 

1169
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,110

a little bit hard to see all this glass

1170
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
a little bit hard to see all this glass
 

1171
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,669
a little bit hard to see all this glass
gets confusing we may as well uh

1172
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
gets confusing we may as well uh
 

1173
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:32,389
gets confusing we may as well uh
fill in our sides

1174
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
fill in our sides
 

1175
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,430
fill in our sides
okay sheep and cow should be done now

1176
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:37,440
okay sheep and cow should be done now
 

1177
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,430
okay sheep and cow should be done now
pretty sure so lastly we have

1178
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
pretty sure so lastly we have
 

1179
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,509
pretty sure so lastly we have
wolves we just need to extend the stream

1180
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
wolves we just need to extend the stream
 

1181
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,509
wolves we just need to extend the stream
i can't remember how i used to do that i

1182
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
i can't remember how i used to do that i
 

1183
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,549
i can't remember how i used to do that i
think i would just have

1184
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559

 

1185
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,990

two half slabs build this

1186
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
two half slabs build this
 

1187
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,789
two half slabs build this
up and we need

1188
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
up and we need
 

1189
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:06,470
up and we need
sign here i need two more signs i think

1190
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480

 

1191
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,990

should have made them before i started

1192
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
should have made them before i started
 

1193
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,669
should have made them before i started
recording

1194
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
recording
 

1195
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,669
recording
oh well

1196
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
oh well
 

1197
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,990
oh well
go go okay

1198
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000

 

1199
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,830

yeah so one sign there one sign here

1200
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:26,840

 

1201
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,750

and build up this other side

1202
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
and build up this other side
 

1203
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,389
and build up this other side
so that the water doesn't spill out and

1204
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
so that the water doesn't spill out and
 

1205
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,350
so that the water doesn't spill out and
now we can place

1206
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360
now we can place
 

1207
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,750
now we can place
water here wolves will go up the stream

1208
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
water here wolves will go up the stream
 

1209
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,470
water here wolves will go up the stream
and now we can extend it further

1210
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
and now we can extend it further
 

1211
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,990
and now we can extend it further
cover us up

1212
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000

 

1213
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,190

that there put our final sign

1214
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
that there put our final sign
 

1215
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,669
that there put our final sign
here so once again the water doesn't

1216
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:53,679
here so once again the water doesn't
 

1217
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,029
here so once again the water doesn't
flow down

1218
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
flow down
 

1219
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:05,350
flow down
the tube ah we need more water

1220
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360

 

1221
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,870

so yeah we built pretty much a whole

1222
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
so yeah we built pretty much a whole
 

1223
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,750
so yeah we built pretty much a whole
passive mob sorter in one episode i

1224
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
passive mob sorter in one episode i
 

1225
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,549
passive mob sorter in one episode i
surprised

1226
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
surprised
 

1227
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,509
surprised
to be honest and i didn't uh cut much of

1228
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519
to be honest and i didn't uh cut much of
 

1229
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,509
to be honest and i didn't uh cut much of
the footage

1230
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
the footage
 

1231
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:25,110
the footage
so it doesn't take that long i guess

1232
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,120
so it doesn't take that long i guess
 

1233
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,870
so it doesn't take that long i guess
it helps if you've done it before

1234
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880

 

1235
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,389

okay finish it up and now let's really

1236
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
okay finish it up and now let's really
 

1237
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,430
okay finish it up and now let's really
hope this works

1238
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,440
hope this works
 

1239
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,269
hope this works
wolves should be done everything should

1240
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:41,279
wolves should be done everything should
 

1241
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,149
wolves should be done everything should
be done

1242
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159

 

1243
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,909

so we're going to open up those

1244
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:47,919

 

1245
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,269

blocks we placed in the center

1246
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:51,279
blocks we placed in the center
 

1247
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,070
blocks we placed in the center
and then we will see this in action

1248
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080

 

1249
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,149

he's been patiently watching us this

1250
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:58,159
he's been patiently watching us this
 

1251
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,110
he's been patiently watching us this
whole

1252
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
whole
 

1253
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,710
whole
time i can't believe it

1254
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:02,720

 

1255
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,310

okay the last thing i forgot to mention

1256
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,320
okay the last thing i forgot to mention
 

1257
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,710
okay the last thing i forgot to mention
is i like to have a door here so that i

1258
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
is i like to have a door here so that i
 

1259
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,470
is i like to have a door here so that i
if i fall down the water streams above

1260
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
if i fall down the water streams above
 

1261
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,230
if i fall down the water streams above
and end up in the center here we can

1262
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,240
and end up in the center here we can
 

1263
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,710
and end up in the center here we can
just walk out

1264
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720

 

1265
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,829

so it's kind of a maintenance access

1266
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:19,839
so it's kind of a maintenance access
 

1267
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,230
so it's kind of a maintenance access
door

1268
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,240

 

1269
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,629

okay that also makes it very easy to get

1270
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
okay that also makes it very easy to get
 

1271
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,349
okay that also makes it very easy to get
rid of these soil blocks

1272
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:31,359

 

1273
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,950

and see it running for the first time

1274
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
and see it running for the first time
 

1275
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,190
and see it running for the first time
might not work too good at for the first

1276
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,200
might not work too good at for the first
 

1277
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,389
might not work too good at for the first
time because we have

1278
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399
time because we have
 

1279
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,950
time because we have
a huge abundance of mobs

1280
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960

 

1281
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,310

but it looks like all the pigs got

1282
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320
but it looks like all the pigs got
 

1283
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,950
but it looks like all the pigs got
separated amazingly

1284
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
separated amazingly
 

1285
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,230
separated amazingly
all the chickens are getting separated

1286
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240

 

1287
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,150

don't know if we'll get any wolves

1288
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160

this is kind of like a tutorial on how

1346
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:31,599
this is kind of like a tutorial on how
 

1347
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,430
this is kind of like a tutorial on how
to build it of course you would have to

1348
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
to build it of course you would have to
 

1349
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,430
to build it of course you would have to
adjust it slightly

1350
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,440
adjust it slightly
 

1351
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,430
adjust it slightly
if your setups different which it most

1352
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
if your setups different which it most
 

1353
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,630
if your setups different which it most
likely will be

1354
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:38,640
likely will be
 

1355
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,710
likely will be
but you should get the idea

1356
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,670

i forgot something though

1394
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680

 

1395
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,150

i forgot the freaking squid so let's go

1396
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
i forgot the freaking squid so let's go
 

1397
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,990
i forgot the freaking squid so let's go
back up here

1398
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
back up here
 

1399
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,069
back up here
really quick i just want to show you

1400
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
really quick i just want to show you
 

1401
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,430
really quick i just want to show you
what to do if it's a concern for you

1402
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:45,440
what to do if it's a concern for you
 

1403
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,829
what to do if it's a concern for you
it's not really for me because i have

1404
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839
it's not really for me because i have
 

1405
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,589
it's not really for me because i have
lots of water around my world so they're

1406
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
lots of water around my world so they're
 

1407
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,670
lots of water around my world so they're
more likely to spawn

1408
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
more likely to spawn
 

1409
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,790
more likely to spawn
in the ocean and not thousands of blocks

1410
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
in the ocean and not thousands of blocks
 

1411
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,270
in the ocean and not thousands of blocks
of water

1412
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,280
of water
 

1413
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,870
of water
i have in the ocean than the few dozen i

1414
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
i have in the ocean than the few dozen i
 

1415
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,190
i have in the ocean than the few dozen i
have

1416
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
have
 

1417
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,790
have
in my passive spawning pads

1418
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:02,800
in my passive spawning pads
 

1419
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,270
in my passive spawning pads
but if you're in a dry area it's a

1420
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280
but if you're in a dry area it's a
 

1421
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,630
but if you're in a dry area it's a
possibility

1422
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
possibility
 

1423
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,390
possibility
i would suggest either digging up this

1424
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,400
i would suggest either digging up this
 

1425
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,750
i would suggest either digging up this
block or

1426
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760

 

1427
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,870

probably probably just

1428
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:16,880
probably probably just
 

1429
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,230
probably probably just
this block here

1430
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240

 

1431
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,870

yeah okay dig that out

1432
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:28,880

 

1433
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,910

so what you're gonna do is you're gonna

1434
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:29,920
so what you're gonna do is you're gonna
 

1435
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,230
so what you're gonna do is you're gonna
take advantage of the fact that squid

1436
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,240
take advantage of the fact that squid
 

1437
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,150
take advantage of the fact that squid
sink and water and all the other mobs

1438
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,160
sink and water and all the other mobs
 

1439
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,030
sink and water and all the other mobs
will try to swim in water

1440
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040

 

1441
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,150

get rid of that

1442
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160

 

1443
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,870

and the squid will go up that half step

1444
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
and the squid will go up that half step
 

1445
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,750
and the squid will go up that half step
he might

1446
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:47,760
he might
 

1447
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,750
he might
stop in a little bit of air there

1448
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
stop in a little bit of air there
 

1449
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,630
stop in a little bit of air there
if he does any other mob that comes by

1450
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:54,640
if he does any other mob that comes by
 

1451
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,109
if he does any other mob that comes by
will push him into this water here i'm

1452
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
will push him into this water here i'm
 

1453
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,710
will push him into this water here i'm
hoping you actually

1454
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
hoping you actually
 

1455
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:10,950
hoping you actually
maybe make this too wide

1456
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:10,960

 

1457
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,630

there's a chance of them falling in a

1458
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
there's a chance of them falling in a
 

1459
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,829
there's a chance of them falling in a
one wide and a one

1460
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
one wide and a one
 

1461
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,430
one wide and a one
in one block like that is pretty low

1462
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440

 

1463
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,589

yes left two

1464
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599

 

1465
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,829

and then just make a

1466
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839

 

1467
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,510

make your stream for them however you

1468
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
make your stream for them however you
 

1469
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,109
make your stream for them however you
want

1470
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119

 

1471
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,710

oops i don't really know where i'm going

1472
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
oops i don't really know where i'm going
 

1473
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,710
oops i don't really know where i'm going
with mine yet so

1474
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:44,720
with mine yet so
 

1475
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,230
with mine yet so
i'm not going to worry about it i really

1476
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,240
i'm not going to worry about it i really
 

1477
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,150
i'm not going to worry about it i really
doubt i'll get any

1478
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,160
doubt i'll get any
 

1479
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,230
doubt i'll get any
squid in mine even but you can uh play

1480
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,240
squid in mine even but you can uh play
 

1481
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,829
squid in mine even but you can uh play
around with the

1482
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:54,839

 

1483
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,030

idea

1484
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
idea
 

1485
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,510
idea
fill that in and they should swim into

1486
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
fill that in and they should swim into
 

1487
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,190
fill that in and they should swim into
the stream here

1488
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
the stream here
 

1489
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,829
the stream here
the other passive mob should swim over

1490
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
the other passive mob should swim over
 

1491
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,589
the other passive mob should swim over
top that hopefully

1492
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:05,599
top that hopefully
 

1493
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:13,589
top that hopefully
you can see it happen

1494
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599

 

1495
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,349

let me tell may take a little while here

1496
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:19,359

 

1497
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,589

come on guys

1498
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:23,599

 

1499
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,230

yeah when i'm up here past the passive

1500
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,240
yeah when i'm up here past the passive
 

1501
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,589
yeah when i'm up here past the passive
mobs aren't really going to spawn

1502
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
mobs aren't really going to spawn
 

1503
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,990
mobs aren't really going to spawn
because i'm too close to them

1504
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,000
because i'm too close to them
 

1505
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,069
because i'm too close to them
i'll get a few though

1506
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079

 

1507
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,470

yeah they still swim up against the

1508
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
yeah they still swim up against the
 

1509
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,550
yeah they still swim up against the
ceiling there so it's still working

1510
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:40,560
ceiling there so it's still working
 

1511
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,190
ceiling there so it's still working
that's my recommendation or else you

1512
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,200
that's my recommendation or else you
 

1513
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,790
that's my recommendation or else you
could try over here

1514
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:46,800

 

1515
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,270

like this block here and there's a

1516
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,280
like this block here and there's a
 

1517
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,270
like this block here and there's a
chance that the squid

1518
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
chance that the squid
 

1519
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,670
chance that the squid
will go down instead of going up this

1520
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,680
will go down instead of going up this
 

1521
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,270
will go down instead of going up this
half slab

1522
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280

 

1523
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,030

but you'd have to play around with it

1524
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
but you'd have to play around with it
 

1525
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,069
but you'd have to play around with it
because i don't know for sure

1526
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
because i don't know for sure
 

1527
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,790
because i don't know for sure
all right that's it bye bye thanks for

1528
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:04,800
all right that's it bye bye thanks for
