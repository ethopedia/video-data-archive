00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
i think we'll need to set up some some
 

543
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,710
i think we'll need to set up some some
way of

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
way of
 

545
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,269
way of
of getting rid of the guys we don't want

um in the most entertaining way possible
 

551
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,190
um in the most entertaining way possible
of course

552
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
of course
 

553
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,870
of course
problem is they're hard to control you

554
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
problem is they're hard to control you
 

555
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,389
problem is they're hard to control you
can't really i don't think you unleash

556
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
can't really i don't think you unleash
 

557

can't really i don't think you unleash
them

558
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279

 

559
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,910

all right i'm going to do this again

560
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:04,920
all right i'm going to do this again
 

561
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,870
all right i'm going to do this again

[Applause]
 

569
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,150
[Applause]
all right so that's probably gonna be it

570
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
all right so that's probably gonna be it
 

571
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,829
all right so that's probably gonna be it
for the trading for today

572
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
for the trading for today
 

573
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,870
for the trading for today
and yeah i think the next step to this

574
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
and yeah i think the next step to this
 

575
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,910
and yeah i think the next step to this
village we gotta

576
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
village we gotta
 

577
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,389
village we gotta
build some way of eradicating the

578
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
build some way of eradicating the
 

579
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,310
build some way of eradicating the
useless villagers

580
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
useless villagers
 

581
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,790
useless villagers
and that way we can get new villagers to

582
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
and that way we can get new villagers to
 

583
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,350
and that way we can get new villagers to
trade with

584
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
trade with
 

585
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,110
trade with
and that way we can keep trading with

586
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
and that way we can keep trading with
 

587
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,389
and that way we can keep trading with
them otherwise i'm just going to run out

588
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
them otherwise i'm just going to run out
 

589
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,190
them otherwise i'm just going to run out
of emeralds

590
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
of emeralds
 

591
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,069
of emeralds
really quick here

592
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079

 

593
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,069

so we're out of the village but before

594
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
so we're out of the village but before
 

595
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,230
so we're out of the village but before
we left i counted how many doors were

596
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
we left i counted how many doors were
 

597
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,190
we left i counted how many doors were
there and then

598
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
there and then
 

599
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,870
there and then
in total i found 47 so

600
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
in total i found 47 so
 

601
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,230
in total i found 47 so
you divide that by three and there

602
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
you divide that by three and there
 

603
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,350
you divide that by three and there
should be 15 16 villagers max

604
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
should be 15 16 villagers max
 

605
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,629
should be 15 16 villagers max
in that village but i think there might

606
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
in that village but i think there might
 

607
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,509
in that village but i think there might
be more than that

608
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
be more than that
 

609
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,389
be more than that
already so we might have an infinite

610
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
already so we might have an infinite
 

611
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,310
already so we might have an infinite
villager breeding situation going on

612
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
villager breeding situation going on
 

613
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,670
villager breeding situation going on
in which case death and destruction

614
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
in which case death and destruction
 

615
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,629
in which case death and destruction
is going to have to sweep through that

616
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
is going to have to sweep through that
 

617
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,670
is going to have to sweep through that
village

618
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
village
 

619
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,269
village
and we'll have to try to figure out how

620
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
and we'll have to try to figure out how
 

621
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,269
and we'll have to try to figure out how
to stop that from happening

622
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
to stop that from happening
 

623
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,710
to stop that from happening
but uh anyway we might head back there

624
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
but uh anyway we might head back there
 

625
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,430
but uh anyway we might head back there
later today i'm not sure

626
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
later today i'm not sure
 

627
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,790
later today i'm not sure
but i asked last episode if if you guys

628
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
but i asked last episode if if you guys
 

629
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,550
but i asked last episode if if you guys
are enjoying watching me do

630
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
are enjoying watching me do
 

631
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,150
are enjoying watching me do
work on these old projects or if we

632
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
work on these old projects or if we
 

633
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,590
work on these old projects or if we
should start some new stuff

634
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
should start some new stuff
 

635
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,189
should start some new stuff
up and surprisingly a lot of you

636
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
up and surprisingly a lot of you
 

637
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,750
up and surprisingly a lot of you
seem to enjoy watching me work on old

638
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
seem to enjoy watching me work on old
 

639
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,670
seem to enjoy watching me work on old
projects like get them done

640
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
projects like get them done
 

641
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,949
projects like get them done
um i think that uh the general

642
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
um i think that uh the general
 

643
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,670
um i think that uh the general
feel was i should mostly focus on the

644
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
feel was i should mostly focus on the
 

645
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,629
feel was i should mostly focus on the
older stuff and

646
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
older stuff and
 

647
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,269
older stuff and
have a few new things here and there so

648
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
have a few new things here and there so
 

649
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,949
have a few new things here and there so
that's that's what we'll try to do

650
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
that's that's what we'll try to do
 

651
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,310
that's that's what we'll try to do
oh you know what i need i need some

652
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
oh you know what i need i need some
 

653

00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
glass uh
 

655
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,870
glass uh
so we are gonna do something at the

656
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
so we are gonna do something at the
 

657
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,990
so we are gonna do something at the
library here today not

658
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
library here today not
 

659
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,230
library here today not
really work on the structure just an

660
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
really work on the structure just an
 

661
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,069
really work on the structure just an
idea of what we can put inside the

662
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
idea of what we can put inside the
 

663
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,269
idea of what we can put inside the
library

664
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
library
 

665
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,949
library
this is an experiment i've been wanting

666
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
this is an experiment i've been wanting
 

667
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,430
this is an experiment i've been wanting
to do for a long time

668
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440

 

669
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,829

and it might end up being a cool little

670
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
and it might end up being a cool little
 

671
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,030
and it might end up being a cool little
feature for our library

672
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
feature for our library
 

673
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,550
feature for our library
i keep going around the door we can go

674
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
i keep going around the door we can go
 

675

through it let's just go through the
 

677
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,829
through it let's just go through the
door and fall down

678
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839

 

679
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,310

but i i want to try and make something

but i i want to try and make something
out of mine carts

682
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
out of mine carts
 

683
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,030
out of mine carts
sort of like a sleight of hand game

684
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
sort of like a sleight of hand game
 

685
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,870
sort of like a sleight of hand game
i want to have a bunch of minecarts

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
i want to have a bunch of minecarts
 

687
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,430
i want to have a bunch of minecarts
randomly going around a track here

688
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
randomly going around a track here
 

689
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,629
randomly going around a track here
and see if myself and you guys can

690
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
and see if myself and you guys can
 

691
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,350
and see if myself and you guys can
follow

692
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
follow
 

693
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,750
follow
which which of the minecarts has like

694
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
which which of the minecarts has like
 

695
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,269
which which of the minecarts has like
the diamond in or whatever

696
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
the diamond in or whatever
 

697
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,189
the diamond in or whatever
kind of like you know that cup game

698
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
kind of like you know that cup game
 

699
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,350
kind of like you know that cup game
people play where

700
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
people play where
 

701
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,509
people play where
there's three cups and you gotta find

702
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
there's three cups and you gotta find
 

703
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,509
there's three cups and you gotta find
whatever underneath it and he spins

704
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
whatever underneath it and he spins
 

705
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,670
whatever underneath it and he spins
spins the cups around does all this

706
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
spins the cups around does all this
 

707
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,509
spins the cups around does all this
fancy stuff and it's hard to

708
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
fancy stuff and it's hard to
 

709
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,550
fancy stuff and it's hard to
start to locate the actual one kind of

710
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
start to locate the actual one kind of
 

711
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,509
start to locate the actual one kind of
like that except

712
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
like that except
 

713
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,030
like that except
using minecarts with it

714
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040

 

715
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,230

and i think i might need to dig this out

716
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
and i think i might need to dig this out
 

717
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,150
and i think i might need to dig this out
a little more

718
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
a little more
 

719
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,870
a little more
i would like to be able to see

720
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
i would like to be able to see
 

721
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,430
i would like to be able to see
everything within this three by three

722
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
everything within this three by three
 

723
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,870
everything within this three by three
uh window oh i hit a button there

724
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
uh window oh i hit a button there
 

725
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,189
uh window oh i hit a button there
that i wasn't supposed to in fact i'm

726
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
that i wasn't supposed to in fact i'm
 

727
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,710
that i wasn't supposed to in fact i'm
gonna just put a border around it for

728
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
gonna just put a border around it for
 

729
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,030
gonna just put a border around it for
right now

730
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
right now
 

731
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,910
right now
and this is gonna be the floor to our

732
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
and this is gonna be the floor to our
 

733
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,829
and this is gonna be the floor to our
library actually i built this

734
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
library actually i built this
 

735
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,790
library actually i built this
the wrong height let's go up one more

736
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
the wrong height let's go up one more
 

737
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,069
the wrong height let's go up one more
i'm pretty sure the floor for the

738
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
i'm pretty sure the floor for the
 

739
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,389
i'm pretty sure the floor for the
library is going to be at this height

740
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399

 

741
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,470

okay so i think this is going to work

742
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
okay so i think this is going to work
 

743
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,389
okay so i think this is going to work
let me show you guys

744
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
let me show you guys
 

745
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,230
let me show you guys
uh we can see through this three by

746
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
uh we can see through this three by
 

747
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,509
uh we can see through this three by
three window

748
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
three window
 

749
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,509
three window
everything down there that's that's a

750
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
everything down there that's that's a
 

751
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,110
everything down there that's that's a
nine by nine pad

752
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
nine by nine pad
 

753
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,350
nine by nine pad
and i think it's let me double check

754
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
and i think it's let me double check
 

755
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,550
and i think it's let me double check
this one

756
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
this one
 

757
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,110
this one
two three four five six blocks down

758
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
two three four five six blocks down
 

759
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,550
two three four five six blocks down
and though my idea with this is

760
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
and though my idea with this is
 

761
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,470
and though my idea with this is
release of minecarts with an item in

762
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
release of minecarts with an item in
 

763
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,829
release of minecarts with an item in
that we're supposed to track and then

764
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
that we're supposed to track and then
 

765
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,870
that we're supposed to track and then
release a bunch of

766
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
release a bunch of
 

767
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,350
release a bunch of
uh storage minecarts with that are empty

768
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
uh storage minecarts with that are empty
 

769
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,710
uh storage minecarts with that are empty
when i said minecart the first time i

770
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
when i said minecart the first time i
 

771
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,790
when i said minecart the first time i
meant to storage my car by the way

772
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
meant to storage my car by the way
 

773
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,030
meant to storage my car by the way
um have them going around this track for

774
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
um have them going around this track for
 

775
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,350
um have them going around this track for
a certain amount of time

776
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
a certain amount of time
 

777
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,110
a certain amount of time
and then randomize each of these

778
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
and then randomize each of these
 

779
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,629
and then randomize each of these
junctions so

780
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
junctions so
 

781
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,910
junctions so
all the minecarts will get shuffled

782
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
all the minecarts will get shuffled
 

783
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,069
all the minecarts will get shuffled
around quite a bit

784
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
around quite a bit
 

785
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,269
around quite a bit
and i want to see what it takes to fool

786
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
and i want to see what it takes to fool
 

787
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,509
and i want to see what it takes to fool
fool our eyes into not being able to

788
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
fool our eyes into not being able to
 

789
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,350
fool our eyes into not being able to
uh track the proper item if that's

790
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
uh track the proper item if that's
 

791
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,069
uh track the proper item if that's
possible that's my goal with this to

792
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
possible that's my goal with this to
 

793
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,030
possible that's my goal with this to
make it so you can't actually

794
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
make it so you can't actually
 

795
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,269
make it so you can't actually
follow well not that you can't follow it

796
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
follow well not that you can't follow it
 

797
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,189
follow well not that you can't follow it
that's difficult to follow

798
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
that's difficult to follow
 

799
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,790
that's difficult to follow
the proper item it'll make more sense

800
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
the proper item it'll make more sense
 

801
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,430
the proper item it'll make more sense
once we actually do it i think

802
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
once we actually do it i think
 

803
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,790
once we actually do it i think
so i'm putting power rails uh in a few

804
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
so i'm putting power rails uh in a few
 

805
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,389
so i'm putting power rails uh in a few
places i don't think we need too many

806
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
places i don't think we need too many
 

807
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,749
places i don't think we need too many
mine carts

808
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
mine carts
 

809
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,069
mine carts
keep their momentum pretty good nowadays

810
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079

 

811
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,910

there is one problem i think we will

812
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
there is one problem i think we will
 

813
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,069
there is one problem i think we will
have i don't think i can actually

814
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
have i don't think i can actually
 

815
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,189
have i don't think i can actually
have a junction like this where it goes

816
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
have a junction like this where it goes
 

817
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,029
have a junction like this where it goes
four directions i think you can only do

818
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
four directions i think you can only do
 

819
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,710
four directions i think you can only do
three directions

820
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
three directions
 

821
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,350
three directions
otherwise when you power this i don't

822
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
otherwise when you power this i don't
 

823
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,029
otherwise when you power this i don't
think it switches

824
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
think it switches
 

825
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,230
think it switches
do i have anything i can power with no

826
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
do i have anything i can power with no
 

827
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,189
do i have anything i can power with no
take my word for it i'm pretty sure it

828
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
take my word for it i'm pretty sure it
 

829
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:21,990
take my word for it i'm pretty sure it
doesn't work

830
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
doesn't work
 

831
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,669
doesn't work
so

832
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679

 

833
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,870

i don't know if i like this pattern

834
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
i don't know if i like this pattern
 

835
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,870
i don't know if i like this pattern
actually

836
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
actually
 

837
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,310
actually
anyway i'll try to come up with

838
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
anyway i'll try to come up with
 

839
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,190
anyway i'll try to come up with
something hopefully end up with

840
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
something hopefully end up with
 

841
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,710
something hopefully end up with
see how many junctions is this this

842
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
see how many junctions is this this
 

843
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,990
see how many junctions is this this
might be too many junctions

844
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000

 

845
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,430

i was hoping to end up with like 12

846
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
i was hoping to end up with like 12
 

847
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,710
i was hoping to end up with like 12
different junctions but i might have

848
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
different junctions but i might have
 

849
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,510
different junctions but i might have
went over

850
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
went over
 

851
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,909
went over
over that i might have got carried away

852
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
over that i might have got carried away
 

853
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,830
over that i might have got carried away
here

854
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
here
 

855
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,590
here
um

856
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
um
 

857
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,630
um
oh well i'll i'll try uh finish this up

858
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
oh well i'll i'll try uh finish this up
 

859
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,110
oh well i'll i'll try uh finish this up
and then we will work on randomizing all

860
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
and then we will work on randomizing all
 

861
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,630
and then we will work on randomizing all
of these

862
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640

 

863
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,870

came up with a new pattern might go with

864
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
came up with a new pattern might go with
 

865
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,270
came up with a new pattern might go with
this one uh we'll try it out

866
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
this one uh we'll try it out
 

867
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,870
this one uh we'll try it out
uh creeper just blew up by the way

868
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
uh creeper just blew up by the way
 

869
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,510
uh creeper just blew up by the way
that's what all this junk junk is about

870
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
that's what all this junk junk is about
 

871
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,470
that's what all this junk junk is about
but i lived we're all good um so we're

872
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
but i lived we're all good um so we're
 

873
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,110
but i lived we're all good um so we're
gonna do

874
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
gonna do
 

875
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,510
gonna do
just a default test if none of the

876
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
just a default test if none of the
 

877
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,950
just a default test if none of the
junctions change

878
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
junctions change
 

879
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,110
junctions change
what does the minecart do when we let it

880
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
what does the minecart do when we let it
 

881
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,830
what does the minecart do when we let it
go on here is the question

882
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840

 

883
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,190

that might be cool on its own we'll see

884
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200

 

885
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,470

what's going on

886
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480

 

887
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,390

huh oh did it run out of

888
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
huh oh did it run out of
 

889
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,310
huh oh did it run out of
it ran out of speed because it wasn't

890
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
it ran out of speed because it wasn't
 

891
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,510
it ran out of speed because it wasn't
switching

892
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520

 

893
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,270

oh well yeah i guess it would end up

894
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
oh well yeah i guess it would end up
 

895
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,110
oh well yeah i guess it would end up
there wouldn't it just goes around in a

896
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
there wouldn't it just goes around in a
 

897
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,950
there wouldn't it just goes around in a
loop

898
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960

 

899
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,789

i think if the junctions are switching

900
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
i think if the junctions are switching
 

901
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,590
i think if the junctions are switching
we won't have to worry about

902
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
we won't have to worry about
 

903
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,270
we won't have to worry about
it running out of speed okay so

904
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
it running out of speed okay so
 

905
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,789
it running out of speed okay so
obviously it all ends up here because

906
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
obviously it all ends up here because
 

907
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,630
obviously it all ends up here because
it's a loop

908
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640

 

909
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,549

okay so the next step to making our game

910
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
okay so the next step to making our game
 

911
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,750
okay so the next step to making our game
here is to

912
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
here is to
 

913
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,390
here is to
randomize each of these junctions and i

914
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
randomize each of these junctions and i
 

915
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,150
randomize each of these junctions and i
marked them out with a dirt block over

916
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
marked them out with a dirt block over
 

917
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,950
marked them out with a dirt block over
top

918
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
top
 

919
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,630
top
uh so i could count how many there were

920
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
uh so i could count how many there were
 

921
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,430
uh so i could count how many there were
and and visualize it easier

922
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
and and visualize it easier
 

923
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,830
and and visualize it easier
in total we got three per side so that's

924
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
in total we got three per side so that's
 

925
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,789
in total we got three per side so that's
12 and then

926
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
12 and then
 

927
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,990
12 and then
eight in the middle so 20 total

928
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
eight in the middle so 20 total
 

929
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,190
eight in the middle so 20 total
the ones in the middle are probably

930
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
the ones in the middle are probably
 

931
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,590
the ones in the middle are probably
going to be the toughest to deal with

932
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
going to be the toughest to deal with
 

933
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,950
going to be the toughest to deal with
so let's start on those first and the

934
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
so let's start on those first and the
 

935
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,110
so let's start on those first and the
way i'm going to do this

936
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
way i'm going to do this
 

937
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,110
way i'm going to do this
to do it with redstone alone you would

938
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
to do it with redstone alone you would
 

939
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,270
to do it with redstone alone you would
need a t-flip flop for each of these

940
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
need a t-flip flop for each of these
 

941
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,950
need a t-flip flop for each of these
probably

942
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
probably
 

943
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,230
probably
and like a hopper randomizer and it

944
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
and like a hopper randomizer and it
 

945
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,270
and like a hopper randomizer and it
would just be

946
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
would just be
 

947
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,110
would just be
insane so we're we're not doing a

948
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
insane so we're we're not doing a
 

949
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,630
insane so we're we're not doing a
redstone method

950
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
redstone method
 

951
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,190
redstone method
we are going to use snowman walking

952
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
we are going to use snowman walking
 

953
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,870
we are going to use snowman walking
around on pressure plates to trigger

954
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
around on pressure plates to trigger
 

955
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,150
around on pressure plates to trigger
them

956
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
them
 

957
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,510
them
i think that's the best way of doing

958
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
i think that's the best way of doing
 

959
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,270
i think that's the best way of doing
this

960
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
this
 

961
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,990
this
um so we will have a redstone torch

962
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000

 

963
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,029

below each of these junctions let's

964
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
below each of these junctions let's
 

965
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,590
below each of these junctions let's
see make sure it works okay so it's

966
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
see make sure it works okay so it's
 

967
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,630
see make sure it works okay so it's
going like this right now

968
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
going like this right now
 

969
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,110
going like this right now
remove it yeah okay it's switched good

970
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
remove it yeah okay it's switched good
 

971
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,029
remove it yeah okay it's switched good
here i can show you the the four-way

972
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
here i can show you the the four-way
 

973
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,510
here i can show you the the four-way
junction now i think

974
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520

 

975
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,430

might not affect it because it didn't

976
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
might not affect it because it didn't
 

977
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,990
might not affect it because it didn't
look like that track was connected

978
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
look like that track was connected
 

979
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,149
look like that track was connected
oh yeah okay see it it doesn't switch

980
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
oh yeah okay see it it doesn't switch
 

981
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,430
oh yeah okay see it it doesn't switch
now because it has four options

982
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
now because it has four options
 

983
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,590
now because it has four options
aha keep that in mind if you're ever

984
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
aha keep that in mind if you're ever
 

985
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,430
aha keep that in mind if you're ever
working on a track

986
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
working on a track
 

987
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,070
working on a track
because that confused me for a while i

988
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
because that confused me for a while i
 

989
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,350
because that confused me for a while i
can't remember what project i was

990
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
can't remember what project i was
 

991
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,230
can't remember what project i was
working on

992
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
working on
 

993
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,830
working on
i could not figure out why the junction

994
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
i could not figure out why the junction
 

995
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,789
i could not figure out why the junction
wasn't switching though

996
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
wasn't switching though
 

997
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,310
wasn't switching though
all right i'm gonna go i'm gonna hollow

998
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
all right i'm gonna go i'm gonna hollow
 

999
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,909
all right i'm gonna go i'm gonna hollow
out underneath all this

1000
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
out underneath all this
 

1001
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,310
out underneath all this
probably is the best thing to do and

1002
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
probably is the best thing to do and
 

1003
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,830
probably is the best thing to do and
i'll put a torch under each of the

1004
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
i'll put a torch under each of the
 

1005
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,190
i'll put a torch under each of the
junctions and then it'll be easier to

1006
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
junctions and then it'll be easier to
 

1007
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,350
junctions and then it'll be easier to
work with this

1008
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360

 

1009
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,390

okay very good we got all the redstone

1010
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
okay very good we got all the redstone
 

1011
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,909
okay very good we got all the redstone
in place and i'm quite happy with how

1012
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
in place and i'm quite happy with how
 

1013
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,950
in place and i'm quite happy with how
this turned out

1014
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
this turned out
 

1015
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,070
this turned out
uh was easier to do than i expected even

1016
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
uh was easier to do than i expected even
 

1017
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,070
uh was easier to do than i expected even
so 20 junctions all all wired up here

1018
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
so 20 junctions all all wired up here
 

1019
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,830
so 20 junctions all all wired up here
basically we'll have once i think we're

1020
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
basically we'll have once i think we're
 

1021
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,510
basically we'll have once i think we're
going to try one snowman in each of

1022
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
going to try one snowman in each of
 

1023
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,430
going to try one snowman in each of
these side ones

1024
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
these side ones
 

1025
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,110
these side ones
so one snowman will trigger three of

1026
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
so one snowman will trigger three of
 

1027
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,789
so one snowman will trigger three of
these

1028
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
these
 

1029
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,230
these
and we'll we'll just have him like

1030
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
and we'll we'll just have him like
 

1031
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,029
and we'll we'll just have him like
walking around

1032
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039

 

1033
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,029

in that area so he'll he'll be able to

1034
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
in that area so he'll he'll be able to
 

1035
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,510
in that area so he'll he'll be able to
walk between five blocks there

1036
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
walk between five blocks there
 

1037
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,390
walk between five blocks there
so we'll do that for each of the sides

1038
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
so we'll do that for each of the sides
 

1039
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,350
so we'll do that for each of the sides
and

1040
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
and
 

1041
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,350
and
it's just a pressure plate torch

1042
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
it's just a pressure plate torch
 

1043
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,470
it's just a pressure plate torch
underneath

1044
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
underneath
 

1045
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,830
underneath
goes up to the torch and then the

1046
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
goes up to the torch and then the
 

1047
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,590
goes up to the torch and then the
junction is right above there

1048
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
junction is right above there
 

1049
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,430
junction is right above there
so it's very simple uh the middle was a

1050
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
so it's very simple uh the middle was a
 

1051
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,350
so it's very simple uh the middle was a
little tougher to do

1052
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360
little tougher to do
 

1053
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,549
little tougher to do
but it wasn't too bad either so i got

1054
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
but it wasn't too bad either so i got
 

1055
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,190
but it wasn't too bad either so i got
eight

1056
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
eight
 

1057
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,909
eight
pressure plates and a ring all over

1058
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
pressure plates and a ring all over
 

1059
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,630
pressure plates and a ring all over
there

1060
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
there
 

1061
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,590
there
the ones in the middle these ones that

1062
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
the ones in the middle these ones that
 

1063
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,630
the ones in the middle these ones that
one there that one

1064
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
one there that one
 

1065
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,270
one there that one
that one there that one there those are

1066
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
that one there that one there those are
 

1067
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,390
that one there that one there those are
easy to do just

1068
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
easy to do just
 

1069
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,190
easy to do just
again torch and then up to another torch

1070
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
again torch and then up to another torch
 

1071
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,669
again torch and then up to another torch
in

1072
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
in
 

1073
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,909
in
the junctions right above the corner

1074
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
the junctions right above the corner
 

1075
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,430
the junctions right above the corner
ones were a little tougher

1076
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
ones were a little tougher
 

1077
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,470
ones were a little tougher
i got to go into repeater there's

1078
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
i got to go into repeater there's
 

1079
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,110
i got to go into repeater there's
redstone

1080
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
redstone
 

1081
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,029
redstone
dust up there so the repeater powers the

1082
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
dust up there so the repeater powers the
 

1083
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,230
dust up there so the repeater powers the
redstone dust

1084
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240
redstone dust
 

1085
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,029
redstone dust
goes to this block and then up to a

1086
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
goes to this block and then up to a
 

1087
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,110
goes to this block and then up to a
redstone torch and

1088
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
redstone torch and
 

1089
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,510
redstone torch and
the corner the corner one is right above

1090
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
the corner the corner one is right above
 

1091
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,149
the corner the corner one is right above
there so

1092
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
there so
 

1093
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,510
there so
i think this should be good to go and we

1094
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,520
i think this should be good to go and we
 

1095
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,110
i think this should be good to go and we
might put two snowmen in the middle

1096
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
might put two snowmen in the middle
 

1097
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,390
might put two snowmen in the middle
we're gonna have to try this out just

1098
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
we're gonna have to try this out just
 

1099
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,669
we're gonna have to try this out just
see how it goes we want

1100
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
see how it goes we want
 

1101
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,230
see how it goes we want
the least predictable setup as possible

1102
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
the least predictable setup as possible
 

1103
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,789
the least predictable setup as possible
though is what we're aiming for so let's

1104
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
though is what we're aiming for so let's
 

1105
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,430
though is what we're aiming for so let's
let's try and test this out if i can if

1106
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
let's try and test this out if i can if
 

1107
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,149
let's try and test this out if i can if
i can get out of here

1108
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
i can get out of here
 

1109
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,310
i can get out of here
i sure i had a way out i think it might

1110
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
i sure i had a way out i think it might
 

1111
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,830
i sure i had a way out i think it might
be here yeah

1112
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
be here yeah
 

1113
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,029
be here yeah
okay so to get the snowman in place is

1114
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
okay so to get the snowman in place is
 

1115
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,830
okay so to get the snowman in place is
also gonna be

1116
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
also gonna be
 

1117
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,110
also gonna be
a little tough i think but uh

1118
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120
a little tough i think but uh
 

1119
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,830
a little tough i think but uh
might be able to do it watch out for

1120
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
might be able to do it watch out for
 

1121
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,190
might be able to do it watch out for
creepers

1122
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
creepers
 

1123
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,510
creepers
it was just night time i think we can do

1124
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,520
it was just night time i think we can do
 

1125
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,549
it was just night time i think we can do
it like this pretty

1126
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
it like this pretty
 

1127
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,070
it like this pretty
pretty well just build them in place

1128
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
pretty well just build them in place
 

1129
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,630
pretty well just build them in place
drop them down they won't be able to

1130
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
drop them down they won't be able to
 

1131
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,149
drop them down they won't be able to
escape

1132
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
escape
 

1133
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,830
escape
and hopefully they walk around a fair

1134
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
and hopefully they walk around a fair
 

1135
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,270
and hopefully they walk around a fair
bit if they don't walk around too much

1136
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
bit if they don't walk around too much
 

1137
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,310
bit if they don't walk around too much
we might need more snowmen

1138
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320

 

1139
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,789

okay we'll put him there get one in this

1140
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
okay we'll put him there get one in this
 

1141
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,909
okay we'll put him there get one in this
side

1142
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
side
 

1143
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,350
side
oh i hear him triggering stuff that's a

1144
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
oh i hear him triggering stuff that's a
 

1145
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,190
oh i hear him triggering stuff that's a
good sign

1146
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200

 

1147
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,510

all right snowmen are nice because they

1148
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
all right snowmen are nice because they
 

1149
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,870
all right snowmen are nice because they
don't make noise

1150
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
don't make noise
 

1151
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,710
don't make noise
i'm starting to use them a lot more

1152
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720
i'm starting to use them a lot more
 

1153
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,909
i'm starting to use them a lot more
they're bad if they

1154
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
they're bad if they
 

1155
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,909
they're bad if they
escape though because then they just

1156
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
escape though because then they just
 

1157
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,110
escape though because then they just
leave a snow trail

1158
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
leave a snow trail
 

1159
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,070
leave a snow trail
all over the place uh that you'll never

1160
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
all over the place uh that you'll never
 

1161
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,590
all over the place uh that you'll never
be able to clean up

1162
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
be able to clean up
 

1163
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,710
be able to clean up
so make sure they can't escape if you

1164
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
so make sure they can't escape if you
 

1165
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,430
so make sure they can't escape if you
use them

1166
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
use them
 

1167
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,909
use them
for stuff like this

1168
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919

 

1169
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,510

okay that's four in place

1170
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,520
okay that's four in place
 

1171
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,350
okay that's four in place
honestly not seeing a lot of switching

1172
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
honestly not seeing a lot of switching
 

1173
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,750
honestly not seeing a lot of switching
going on i thought there would be more

1174
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760

 

1175
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,590

oh and this is missing i must have went

1176
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
oh and this is missing i must have went
 

1177
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,430
oh and this is missing i must have went
through here

1178
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440

 

1179
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,190

hmm all right let's get what

1180
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
hmm all right let's get what
 

1181
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,190
hmm all right let's get what
let let's get them going in the middle

1182
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
let let's get them going in the middle
 

1183
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,630
let let's get them going in the middle
too

1184
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640

 

1185
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,870

let's we're for sure putting two here by

1186
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
let's we're for sure putting two here by
 

1187
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,789
let's we're for sure putting two here by
the looks of it because it's pretty slow

1188
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:20,799

 

1189
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,390

move around guys the problem is they

1190
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
move around guys the problem is they
 

1191
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,149
move around guys the problem is they
don't have a lot of blocks to go to with

1192
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
don't have a lot of blocks to go to with
 

1193
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,669
don't have a lot of blocks to go to with
their pathfinding so

1194
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679

 

1195
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,830

okay things are switching now a little

1196
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:30,840
okay things are switching now a little
 

1197
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,149
okay things are switching now a little
bit

1198
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
bit
 

1199
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,630
bit
they also don't walk all the time is the

1200
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
they also don't walk all the time is the
 

1201
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,230
they also don't walk all the time is the
other problem

1202
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240

 

1203
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,590

maybe we should get one more in there

1204
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600

 

1205
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,510

and one more in each of the sides that's

1206
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
and one more in each of the sides that's
 

1207
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,430
and one more in each of the sides that's
what i'm going to do

1208
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440

 

1209
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,830

we'll try that out

1210
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840

 

1211
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,510

so i think we're about ready to try it

1212
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
so i think we're about ready to try it
 

1213
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,950
so i think we're about ready to try it
out it's switching

1214
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
out it's switching
 

1215
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,909
out it's switching
pretty decently might need to be faster

1216
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
pretty decently might need to be faster
 

1217
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,510
pretty decently might need to be faster
yet

1218
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
yet
 

1219
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,710
yet
because it goes through these periods

1220
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
because it goes through these periods
 

1221
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,470
because it goes through these periods
where nothing happens and then stuff

1222
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
where nothing happens and then stuff
 

1223
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,029
where nothing happens and then stuff
happens

1224
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
happens
 

1225
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,390
happens
a lot but uh

1226
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
a lot but uh
 

1227
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,190
a lot but uh
yeah i went and i got some other glass

1228
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
yeah i went and i got some other glass
 

1229
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,430
yeah i went and i got some other glass
too this might be better

1230
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
too this might be better
 

1231
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,070
too this might be better
the white the the clear glass is just

1232
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,080
the white the the clear glass is just
 

1233
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,909
the white the the clear glass is just
not very clear

1234
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
not very clear
 

1235
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,510
not very clear
is the problem

1236
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520

 

1237
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,950

that might be better i wish i could just

1238
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
that might be better i wish i could just
 

1239
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,590
that might be better i wish i could just
float on invisible blocks

1240
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600

 

1241
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,190

it's probably a trick i could do with

1242
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
it's probably a trick i could do with
 

1243
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,950
it's probably a trick i could do with
that

1244
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
that
 

1245
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,149
that
um but yeah we're gonna put a minecart

1246
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159
um but yeah we're gonna put a minecart
 

1247
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,269
um but yeah we're gonna put a minecart
down to see what it does

1248
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
down to see what it does
 

1249
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,630
down to see what it does
start off with i also added some

1250
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
start off with i also added some
 

1251
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,029
start off with i also added some
boosters on the edges hopefully that

1252
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
boosters on the edges hopefully that
 

1253
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,750
boosters on the edges hopefully that
helps it from stalling

1254
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
helps it from stalling
 

1255
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,310
helps it from stalling
we'll give it a little push so it

1256
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
we'll give it a little push so it
 

1257
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,950
we'll give it a little push so it
shouldn't

1258
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
shouldn't
 

1259
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,149
shouldn't
stop i'm pretty sure it and it should be

1260
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
stop i'm pretty sure it and it should be
 

1261
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,750
stop i'm pretty sure it and it should be
hopefully fairly random looks like it

1262
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
hopefully fairly random looks like it
 

1263
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,950
hopefully fairly random looks like it
got stuck in the corner

1264
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960

 

1265
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,510

see if that happens a lot no it doesn't

1266
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
see if that happens a lot no it doesn't
 

1267
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,390
see if that happens a lot no it doesn't
seem to

1268
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
seem to
 

1269
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,990
seem to
that's good it moves fast doesn't it

1270
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
that's good it moves fast doesn't it
 

1271
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,190
that's good it moves fast doesn't it
holy

1272
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200

 

1273
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,510

uh-huh all right let's try add some more

1274
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
uh-huh all right let's try add some more
 

1275
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,909
uh-huh all right let's try add some more
and see if they crash into each other or

1276
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
and see if they crash into each other or
 

1277
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,549
and see if they crash into each other or
what they do

1278
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:16,559
what they do
 

1279
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,390
what they do
exactly i made six total

1280
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
exactly i made six total
 

1281
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,549
exactly i made six total
hopefully they don't like follow each

1282
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
hopefully they don't like follow each
 

1283
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,149
hopefully they don't like follow each
other's path exactly or

1284
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
other's path exactly or
 

1285
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,870
other's path exactly or
or anything like that that's that's why

1286
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
or anything like that that's that's why
 

1287
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,710
or anything like that that's that's why
i'm hoping it switches pretty frequently

1288
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
i'm hoping it switches pretty frequently
 

1289
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,710
i'm hoping it switches pretty frequently
oh if they stack up like that too that's

1290
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:32,720
oh if they stack up like that too that's
 

1291
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,950
oh if they stack up like that too that's
bad i never even thought of that

1292
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960

 

1293
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,990

um

1294
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,000

 

1295
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,149

hopefully they can separate

1296
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159

 

1297
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:54,149

um so two of those are stuck together

1298
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159

 

1299
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,269

all right they're having a hard time

1300
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
all right they're having a hard time
 

1301
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,710
all right they're having a hard time
splitting i don't think

1302
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
splitting i don't think
 

1303
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,830
splitting i don't think
oh they did split oh now they're back up

1304
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840

 

1305
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,110

um

1306
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120

 

1307
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,590

oh this is weird

1308
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600

 

1309
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,669

okay that is a problem i wonder what we

1310
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
okay that is a problem i wonder what we
 

1311
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,789
okay that is a problem i wonder what we
could do about that

1312
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799

 

1313
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,190

and they once they stack together they

1314
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,200
and they once they stack together they
 

1315
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,230
and they once they stack together they
seem to

1316
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240
seem to
 

1317
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,470
seem to
have a hard time separating

1318
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480

 

1319
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,630

when i introduce them into this though

1320
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
when i introduce them into this though
 

1321
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,070
when i introduce them into this though
it's not going to be like all together

1322
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
it's not going to be like all together
 

1323
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,510
it's not going to be like all together
it's going to be one

1324
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
it's going to be one
 

1325
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,070
it's going to be one
every few seconds and they shouldn't

1326
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
every few seconds and they shouldn't
 

1327
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,830
every few seconds and they shouldn't
clump together like this so much maybe i

1328
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
clump together like this so much maybe i
 

1329
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,230
clump together like this so much maybe i
just can't leave it run for very long

1330
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,240

 

1331
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,590

all right i'm gonna stop it we'll try

1332
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:43,600
all right i'm gonna stop it we'll try
 

1333
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,950
all right i'm gonna stop it we'll try
this again

1334
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960

 

1335
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,470

okay we're going to give it another try

1336
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
okay we're going to give it another try
 

1337
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,310
okay we're going to give it another try
here i'm pretty sure the same thing's

1338
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
here i'm pretty sure the same thing's
 

1339
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,230
here i'm pretty sure the same thing's
going to happen again though

1340
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
going to happen again though
 

1341
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,430
going to happen again though
uh got a little launcher here the re the

1342
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
uh got a little launcher here the re the
 

1343
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,510
uh got a little launcher here the re the
real problem is

1344
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
real problem is
 

1345
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,269
real problem is
the junctions just don't switch fast

1346
00:27:59,269 --> 00:27:59,279
the junctions just don't switch fast
 

1347
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,630
the junctions just don't switch fast
enough

1348
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
enough
 

1349
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,950
enough
so they end up taking the same same path

1350
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
so they end up taking the same same path
 

1351
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,750
so they end up taking the same same path
as each other

1352
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
as each other
 

1353
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,430
as each other
quite often sometimes minecarts just

1354
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
quite often sometimes minecarts just
 

1355
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,750
quite often sometimes minecarts just
stop like that too it's weird

1356
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:09,760
stop like that too it's weird
 

1357
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,590
stop like that too it's weird
and rather than bouncing off each other

1358
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,600
and rather than bouncing off each other
 

1359
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,669
and rather than bouncing off each other
minecarts seem to

1360
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
minecarts seem to
 

1361
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,190
minecarts seem to
uh stack up with each other

1362
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,200
uh stack up with each other
 

1363
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,669
uh stack up with each other
unfortunately

1364
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
unfortunately
 

1365
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,070
unfortunately
i was hoping they would like bounce off

1366
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
i was hoping they would like bounce off
 

1367
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,909
i was hoping they would like bounce off
each other and start going opposite ways

1368
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919
each other and start going opposite ways
 

1369
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,470
each other and start going opposite ways
and

1370
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
and
 

1371
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,110
and
and like lots of crazy stuff happening

1372
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
and like lots of crazy stuff happening
 

1373
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,070
and like lots of crazy stuff happening
but they just

1374
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
but they just
 

1375
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,470
but they just
tend to go with the flow

1376
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
tend to go with the flow
 

1377
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,350
tend to go with the flow
so yeah to get this actually working the

1378
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
so yeah to get this actually working the
 

1379
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,710
so yeah to get this actually working the
way i want i'm gonna have to do a

1380
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
way i want i'm gonna have to do a
 

1381
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,549
way i want i'm gonna have to do a
redstone method it looks like oh look

1382
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
redstone method it looks like oh look
 

1383
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,510
redstone method it looks like oh look
they split

1384
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,520
they split
 

1385
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,669
they split
they split come on guys

1386
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
they split come on guys
 

1387
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,269
they split come on guys
get out of that figure eights and do

1388
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
get out of that figure eights and do
 

1389
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,789
get out of that figure eights and do
something cool

1390
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
something cool
 

1391
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,149
something cool
that would be pretty hard to watch

1392
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
that would be pretty hard to watch
 

1393
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,830
that would be pretty hard to watch
though even them even though it's

1394
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
though even them even though it's
 

1395
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,230
though even them even though it's
predictable right now

1396
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
predictable right now
 

1397
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,909
predictable right now
them bouncing around like that is pretty

1398
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
them bouncing around like that is pretty
 

1399
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,070
them bouncing around like that is pretty
hard to follow

1400
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080

 

1401
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,830

but yeah i gotta do a redstone method

1402
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:57,840
but yeah i gotta do a redstone method
 

1403
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,310
but yeah i gotta do a redstone method
that switches the junctions a lot faster

1404
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320

 

1405
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,750

that is just not changing at all

1406
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
that is just not changing at all
 

1407
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,430
that is just not changing at all
look at that that's the problem right

1408
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
look at that that's the problem right
 

1409
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,389
look at that that's the problem right
there oh and they stopped

1410
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
there oh and they stopped
 

1411
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,149
there oh and they stopped
all right it was worth a shot anyway

1412
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
all right it was worth a shot anyway
 

1413
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,549
all right it was worth a shot anyway
i'll i'll try to fix this

1414
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:16,559
i'll i'll try to fix this
 

1415
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,310
i'll i'll try to fix this
and we can try it again later oh

1416
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
and we can try it again later oh
 

1417
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,430
and we can try it again later oh
permanent stop

1418
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440

 

1419
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,950

all right or did we unlock we might have
 

1469

all right or did we unlock we might have
unlocked this earlier i kind of remember

enchantment anyway uh
yes so lots of comments i picked out

1476
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
yes so lots of comments i picked out
 

1477
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,110
yes so lots of comments i picked out
three sort of at random

1478
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
three sort of at random
 

1479
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,269
three sort of at random
so here we go as a response to your

1480

question my most physically painful

1482
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
question my most physically painful
 

1483
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,750
question my most physically painful
experience was when i went to an ice

1484
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:43,760
experience was when i went to an ice
 

1485
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,950
experience was when i went to an ice
skating rink

1486
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:44,960
skating rink
 

1487
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,110
skating rink
with my friend i've never gone ice

1488
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
with my friend i've never gone ice
 

1489
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,389
with my friend i've never gone ice
skating before and i knew

1490
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,399
skating before and i knew
 

1491
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,430
skating before and i knew
i was going to be horrible at it

1492
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,440
i was going to be horrible at it
 

1493
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,590
i was going to be horrible at it
after about two hours with the practice

1494
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
after about two hours with the practice
 

1495
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,870
after about two hours with the practice
walkers

1496
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
walkers
 

1497
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,350
walkers
almost like old people walkers i tried

1498
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
almost like old people walkers i tried
 

1499
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,350
almost like old people walkers i tried
to go without them but i stayed

1500
00:30:59,350 --> 00:30:59,360
to go without them but i stayed
 

1501
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,389
to go without them but i stayed
close to the wall i was doing good but

1502
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:02,399
close to the wall i was doing good but
 

1503
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,389
close to the wall i was doing good but
then my left foot slipped and i fell

1504
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
then my left foot slipped and i fell
 

1505
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,029
then my left foot slipped and i fell
down

1506
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
down
 

1507
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,549
down
grasping the wall let's just say

1508
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559
grasping the wall let's just say
 

1509
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,430
grasping the wall let's just say
