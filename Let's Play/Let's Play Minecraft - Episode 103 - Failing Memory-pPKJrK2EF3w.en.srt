331
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:51,980
branching off into more and more
directions so I think what I'll do I'll

332
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:51,990
directions so I think what I'll do I'll
 

333
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,510
directions so I think what I'll do I'll
just collect whatever resources that

334
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:53,520
just collect whatever resources that
 

335
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,220
just collect whatever resources that
pass so far and then we'll head back

336
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,230
pass so far and then we'll head back
 

337
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,220
pass so far and then we'll head back
because I I got a lot here and I'll

338
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,230
because I I got a lot here and I'll
 

339
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,830
because I I got a lot here and I'll
probably die if I keep going as this

340
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:03,840
probably die if I keep going as this
 

341
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,410

465
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,670
episode I think I'm going to try find a
spot to build like our first main base

466
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:12,680
spot to build like our first main base
 

467
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,350

where the storage room will be that kind
 

469
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,930
where the storage room will be that kind
of thing so I'm going to scout around

470
