00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,320
rail system it's finally set up it's
working pretty good now I might need to

164
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,330
working pretty good now I might need to
 

165
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:33,420
working pretty good now I might need to
change a few things on it I'll I'll show

166
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:33,430
change a few things on it I'll I'll show
 

167
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,920
change a few things on it I'll I'll show
you how it works and then we'll go down

168
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:34,930
you how it works and then we'll go down
 

169
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,730
you how it works and then we'll go down
look at it closer this lever here turns

170
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:38,740
look at it closer this lever here turns
 

171
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,460
look at it closer this lever here turns
the minecarts on and off in order to get

172
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:41,470
the minecarts on and off in order to get
 

173
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,390
the minecarts on and off in order to get
them going and you need to turn this on

174
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
them going and you need to turn this on
 

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,820
them going and you need to turn this on
they won't come just by flicking the

176
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:47,830
they won't come just by flicking the
 

177
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:53,280
they won't come just by flicking the
lever you need to make it a little

178
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,290
lever you need to make it a little
 

179
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,640
lever you need to make it a little
quieter you need to start it kinda like

180
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:56,650
quieter you need to start it kinda like
 

181
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,490
quieter you need to start it kinda like
starting a car usually you can start it

182
00:05:59,490 --> 00:05:59,500
starting a car usually you can start it
 

183
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,680
starting a car usually you can start it
by pressing the button but sometimes you

184
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:01,690
by pressing the button but sometimes you
 

185
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,840
by pressing the button but sometimes you
need to pull this lever instead for like

186
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:03,850
need to pull this lever instead for like
 

187
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:11,940
need to pull this lever instead for like
two seconds

188
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:11,950

 

189
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:21,210

and here they come

190
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,220

 

191
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,540

pretty nice easy to hop off they keep

192
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:25,550
pretty nice easy to hop off they keep
 

193
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:34,150
pretty nice easy to hop off they keep
going hop on again and the reason why I

194
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
going hop on again and the reason why I
 

195
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,950
going hop on again and the reason why I
wanted these power rails all the way

196
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:35,960
wanted these power rails all the way
 

197
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,370
wanted these power rails all the way
around is so that when you're riding in

198
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,380
around is so that when you're riding in
 

199
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,620
around is so that when you're riding in
a carts

200
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,630
a carts
 

201
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,910
a carts
if you don't have these all the way

202
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:42,920
if you don't have these all the way
 

203
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,190
if you don't have these all the way
around you will slowly start catching up

204
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,200
around you will slowly start catching up
 

205
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,120
around you will slowly start catching up
to the empty cart in front of you

206
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,130
to the empty cart in front of you
 

207
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,370
to the empty cart in front of you
because empty carts lose momentum a lot

208
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:51,380
because empty carts lose momentum a lot
 

209
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,210
because empty carts lose momentum a lot
faster but if they're at maximum speed

210
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,220
faster but if they're at maximum speed
 

211
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,340
faster but if they're at maximum speed
the whole time from these power rails

212
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,350
the whole time from these power rails
 

213
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,910
the whole time from these power rails
and that doesn't happen so it prevents

214
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:00,920
and that doesn't happen so it prevents
 

215
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,860
and that doesn't happen so it prevents
you from bumping into an empty cart

216
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:02,870
you from bumping into an empty cart
 

217
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,110
you from bumping into an empty cart
ahead of you uh-huh so you can shut it

218
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,120
ahead of you uh-huh so you can shut it
 

219
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,120
ahead of you uh-huh so you can shut it
off flick this down and my carts will

220
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,130
off flick this down and my carts will
 

221
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:19,030
off flick this down and my carts will
start coming pretty soon yet they

222
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,040
start coming pretty soon yet they
 

223
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,160
start coming pretty soon yet they
stopped that's cool

224
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,170

 

225
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,890

the other ones keep going

226
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:27,900

 

227
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,460

now over here we have a variable delay

228
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,470
now over here we have a variable delay
 

229
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,100
now over here we have a variable delay
timer for the whole thing there's a to

230
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,110
timer for the whole thing there's a to
 

231
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,360
timer for the whole thing there's a to
second base delay so that's the minimum

232
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,370
second base delay so that's the minimum
 

233
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,120
second base delay so that's the minimum
spacing between the minecarts I just had

234
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,130
spacing between the minecarts I just had
 

235
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:51,570
spacing between the minecarts I just had
major like is that two seconds then we

236
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:51,580
major like is that two seconds then we
 

237
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,520
major like is that two seconds then we
have an additional two seconds we can

238
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,530
have an additional two seconds we can
 

239
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,960
have an additional two seconds we can
add an additional one so we can have our

240
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:56,970
add an additional one so we can have our
 

241
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,680
add an additional one so we can have our
minecart space both of these are down

242
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:01,690
minecart space both of these are down
 

243
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,770
minecart space both of these are down
it'll be two seconds this one's up it'll

244
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:04,780
it'll be two seconds this one's up it'll
 

245
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,560
it'll be two seconds this one's up it'll
be three seconds this one's up it'll be

246
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,570
be three seconds this one's up it'll be
 

247
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,720
be three seconds this one's up it'll be
four seconds and if these are both up

248
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:09,730
four seconds and if these are both up
 

249
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:16,970
four seconds and if these are both up
it's five seconds it's pretty cool I

250
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:16,980

 

251
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,290

could have made it shorter than two

252
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:19,300
could have made it shorter than two
 

253
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,150
could have made it shorter than two
seconds if I want to do like half a set

254
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,160
seconds if I want to do like half a set
 

255
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,460
seconds if I want to do like half a set
into a second but didn't really need it

256
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:26,470
into a second but didn't really need it
 

257
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,840
into a second but didn't really need it
to be I don't like I like not having to

258
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:30,850
to be I don't like I like not having to
 

259
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,110
to be I don't like I like not having to
worry about walking on this tracking and

260
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
worry about walking on this tracking and
 

261
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,870
worry about walking on this tracking and
I don't like I don't want to worry about

262
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
I don't like I don't want to worry about
 

263
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,280
I don't like I don't want to worry about
bumping into a minecart all the time

264
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,290

 

265
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:49,300

yeah so it's a few seconds now see

266
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,310

 

267
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:59,530

still get these things here they come

268
00:08:59,530 --> 00:08:59,540
still get these things here they come
 

269
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,249
still get these things here they come
again

270
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:02,259

 

271
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,329

so now they're spaced a little bit

272
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:04,339
so now they're spaced a little bit
 

273
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,889
so now they're spaced a little bit
closer than they were I think I have it

274
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:05,899
closer than they were I think I have it
 

275
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:11,199
closer than they were I think I have it
three seconds before generally if you're

276
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:11,209
three seconds before generally if you're
 

277
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,150
three seconds before generally if you're
gonna switch it timing you need to shut

278
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,160
gonna switch it timing you need to shut
 

279
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,019
gonna switch it timing you need to shut
it off first

280
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:14,029
it off first
 

281
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,710
it off first
otherwise you might mess it up but let's

282
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:17,720
otherwise you might mess it up but let's
 

283
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,900
otherwise you might mess it up but let's
see what happens if you change it when

284
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:19,910
see what happens if you change it when
 

285
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:31,509
see what happens if you change it when
it's running still looks like two

286
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
it's running still looks like two
 

287
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,749
it's running still looks like two
seconds

288
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:33,759
seconds
 

289
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,309
seconds
that was five seconds you see the big

290
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:36,319
that was five seconds you see the big
 

291
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:42,009
that was five seconds you see the big
change in spacing now so they're five

292
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:42,019
change in spacing now so they're five
 

293
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:47,590
change in spacing now so they're five
seconds of parts pretty cool and then

294
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
seconds of parts pretty cool and then
 

295
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:59,710
seconds of parts pretty cool and then
finally we have the flaming minecarts on

296
00:09:59,710 --> 00:09:59,720
finally we have the flaming minecarts on
 

297
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,660
finally we have the flaming minecarts on
and off so one feature I like oh we have

298
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:04,670
and off so one feature I like oh we have
 

299
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:16,389
and off so one feature I like oh we have
a jam here I could use detector rails to

300
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
a jam here I could use detector rails to
 

301
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,030
a jam here I could use detector rails to
stop that from happening I might end up

302
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
stop that from happening I might end up
 

303
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,150
stop that from happening I might end up
doing that because it does happen every

304
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,160
doing that because it does happen every
 

305
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,230
doing that because it does happen every
so often usually only if I'm on that

306
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,240
so often usually only if I'm on that
 

307
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,990
so often usually only if I'm on that
track will it do that if I bump one of

308
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
track will it do that if I bump one of
 

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,549
track will it do that if I bump one of
the money carts they're relatively easy

310
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:36,559
the money carts they're relatively easy
 

311
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,889
the money carts they're relatively easy
to get going you just have to give them

312
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:38,899
to get going you just have to give them
 

313
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:52,100
to get going you just have to give them
a little push

314
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,110

 

315
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,450

all right so let's start it now with

316
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,460
all right so let's start it now with
 

317
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,940
all right so let's start it now with
flaming minecarts turn that on its a

318
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:01,950
flaming minecarts turn that on its a
 

319
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,410
flaming minecarts turn that on its a
button you like turning the key on your

320
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:06,420
button you like turning the key on your
 

321
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:14,990
button you like turning the key on your
car pressing the button dope

322
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,000
car pressing the button dope
 

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,210
car pressing the button dope
oh you know why yeah it's that's another

324
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,220
oh you know why yeah it's that's another
 

325
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,840
oh you know why yeah it's that's another
thing if you have it off still if you

326
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:23,850
thing if you have it off still if you
 

327
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,610
thing if you have it off still if you
press the button it will only send one

328
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:25,620
press the button it will only send one
 

329
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:43,550
press the button it will only send one
out so now it'll keep going

330
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,560

 

331
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,119

so it took me about four or five hours

332
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:47,129
so it took me about four or five hours
 

333
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:53,319
so it took me about four or five hours
working on this to get it to this point

334
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:53,329

 

335
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,579

probably like three or four hours

336
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:55,589
probably like three or four hours
 

337
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,639
probably like three or four hours
yesterday and wondered one or two today

338
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:58,649
yesterday and wondered one or two today
 

339
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,970
yesterday and wondered one or two today
maybe it was six hours had a lot of fun

340
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:01,980
maybe it was six hours had a lot of fun
 

341
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,290
maybe it was six hours had a lot of fun
doing it

342
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,300

 

343
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:13,040

so yeah let's go check it out show you

344
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,050
so yeah let's go check it out show you
 

345
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:23,679
so yeah let's go check it out show you
what it looks like when it's running

346
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:23,689

 

347
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,929

holds ten mine carts in the PES stack

348
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:26,939
holds ten mine carts in the PES stack
 

349
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:34,939
holds ten mine carts in the PES stack
here and then they go here go by the hot

350
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:34,949
here and then they go here go by the hot
 

351
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,210
here and then they go here go by the hot
and cold thing go up and around in the

352
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,220
and cold thing go up and around in the
 

353
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,239
and cold thing go up and around in the
notes and there's a power rails all the

354
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:41,249
notes and there's a power rails all the
 

355
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:46,309
notes and there's a power rails all the
way up so it's so we can make it this

356
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:46,319
way up so it's so we can make it this
 

357
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:48,679
way up so it's so we can make it this
thing goes around and then it freezes on

358
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:48,689
thing goes around and then it freezes on
 

359
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:53,269
thing goes around and then it freezes on
the slope for however long the delay is

360
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
the slope for however long the delay is
 

361
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:03,949
the slope for however long the delay is
and then it gets powered again and goes

362
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:03,959

 

363
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,449

and it goes over this detector rail

364
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:06,459
and it goes over this detector rail
 

365
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:09,630
and it goes over this detector rail
every time it goes around and that's

366
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:09,640
every time it goes around and that's
 

367
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,840
every time it goes around and that's
what keeps the loop going

368
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:14,850

 

369
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,610

and with these PEZ dispenser systems

370
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:20,620
and with these PEZ dispenser systems
 

371
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,329
and with these PEZ dispenser systems
with the new boosters they're a little

372
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:24,339
with the new boosters they're a little
 

373
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,810
with the new boosters they're a little
bit finicky if you're going straight you

374
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:27,820
bit finicky if you're going straight you
 

375
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,460
bit finicky if you're going straight you
can do it if you're going straight I'm

376
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:29,470
can do it if you're going straight I'm
 

377
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,850
can do it if you're going straight I'm
pretty sure but you need to space the

378
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:32,860
pretty sure but you need to space the
 

379
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,710
pretty sure but you need to space the
power rails properly it's really easy to

380
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:37,720
power rails properly it's really easy to
 

381
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,319
power rails properly it's really easy to
do though if you just go have it sloped

382
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:40,329
do though if you just go have it sloped
 

383
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:44,310
do though if you just go have it sloped
up right where it meets your stack here

384
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
up right where it meets your stack here
 

385
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,410
up right where it meets your stack here
like I have here so that's the way I

386
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:49,420
like I have here so that's the way I
 

387
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,670
like I have here so that's the way I
ended up doing it

388
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:50,680
ended up doing it
 

389
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,470
ended up doing it
oh yeah there's um one issue I realized

390
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,480
oh yeah there's um one issue I realized
 

391
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,160
oh yeah there's um one issue I realized
after I had this all built Mayan carts

392
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,170
after I had this all built Mayan carts
 

393
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,400
after I had this all built Mayan carts
no longer get put out by water the

394
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,410
no longer get put out by water the
 

395
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,900
no longer get put out by water the
flames when they're flaming

396
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:03,910
flames when they're flaming
 

397
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,490
flames when they're flaming
I think that's new in the 1.5 patch or

398
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:08,500
I think that's new in the 1.5 patch or
 

399
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,019
I think that's new in the 1.5 patch or
else the one point five point one patch

400
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:15,029
else the one point five point one patch
 

401
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,550
else the one point five point one patch
just a brand new change I don't like

402
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:17,560
just a brand new change I don't like
 

403
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,360
just a brand new change I don't like
that at all

404
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,370

 

405
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,650

till the water and this hot and cold

406
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:22,660
till the water and this hot and cold
 

407
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,380
till the water and this hot and cold
thing does nothing now unfortunately so

408
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,390
thing does nothing now unfortunately so
 

409
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,030
thing does nothing now unfortunately so
the only way to put these flames out is

410
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
the only way to put these flames out is
 

411
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,069
the only way to put these flames out is
to actually destroy the minecarts and

412
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:29,079
to actually destroy the minecarts and
 

413
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,329
to actually destroy the minecarts and
replace them which is really

414
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:33,339
replace them which is really
 

415
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,800
replace them which is really
disappointing I doubt they did that

416
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:37,810
disappointing I doubt they did that
 

417
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:46,290
disappointing I doubt they did that
intentionally okay so I just stopped the

418
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,300
intentionally okay so I just stopped the
 

419
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,650
intentionally okay so I just stopped the
video for a bit so that I could rewatch

420
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:49,660
video for a bit so that I could rewatch
 

421
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,780
video for a bit so that I could rewatch
what I have recorded of the episode so

422
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:51,790
what I have recorded of the episode so
 

423
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,350
what I have recorded of the episode so
far I do that sometimes so that I can

424
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
far I do that sometimes so that I can
 

425
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,480
far I do that sometimes so that I can
see if I missed anything

426
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:57,490
see if I missed anything
 

427
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:04,010
see if I missed anything
no we just happened

428
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,020

 

429
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,880

what the heck man yeah I got that

430
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:08,890
what the heck man yeah I got that
 

431
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,650
what the heck man yeah I got that
detector rails great and I think I just

432
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:13,660
detector rails great and I think I just
 

433
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:24,750
detector rails great and I think I just
lost the minecart yeah I stopped to see

434
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:24,760
lost the minecart yeah I stopped to see
 

435
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:32,100
lost the minecart yeah I stopped to see
if I missed talking about anything and

436
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,110
if I missed talking about anything and
 

437
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,910
if I missed talking about anything and
this world's just full of distractions

438
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:34,920
this world's just full of distractions
 

439
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:45,840
this world's just full of distractions
let's go look at the Thunder don't know

440
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:45,850
let's go look at the Thunder don't know
 

441
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,000
let's go look at the Thunder don't know
why it keeps getting stuck there that

442
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,010
why it keeps getting stuck there that
 

443
00:15:48,010 --> 00:16:06,240
why it keeps getting stuck there that
doesn't make sense

444
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,250

 

445
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:43,150

sweet okay I lost my train of thought

446
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,160
sweet okay I lost my train of thought
 

447
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,560
sweet okay I lost my train of thought
what was I talking about I yeah I

448
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:47,570
what was I talking about I yeah I
 

449
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,360
what was I talking about I yeah I
stopped to see if I I miss talking about

450
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,370
stopped to see if I I miss talking about
 

451
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,290
stopped to see if I I miss talking about
anything and you might self time to

452
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:53,300
anything and you might self time to
 

453
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,000
anything and you might self time to
think of course - and when Yuri watch

454
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,010
think of course - and when Yuri watch
 

455
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,370
think of course - and when Yuri watch
the video like when he actually watches

456
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:00,380
the video like when he actually watches
 

457
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,830
the video like when he actually watches
it but as an observer you notice things

458
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:02,840
it but as an observer you notice things
 

459
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,050
it but as an observer you notice things
that you don't notice when you're

460
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,060
that you don't notice when you're
 

461
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,069
that you don't notice when you're
actually playing the game and like

462
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,079
actually playing the game and like
 

463
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,930
actually playing the game and like
saying start instead of stop but one

464
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:13,940
saying start instead of stop but one
 

465
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,900
saying start instead of stop but one
thing I noticed is as my carts were

466
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:16,910
thing I noticed is as my carts were
 

467
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,900
thing I noticed is as my carts were
going by I said the minimum delay was

468
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:19,910
going by I said the minimum delay was
 

469
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,260
going by I said the minimum delay was
two seconds and I counted one two it's

470
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,270
two seconds and I counted one two it's
 

471
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:31,120
two seconds and I counted one two it's
not two seconds I can safely get out of

472
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,130
not two seconds I can safely get out of
 

473
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:41,290
not two seconds I can safely get out of
here I'll show you what why it's two

474
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:41,300
here I'll show you what why it's two
 

475
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,870
here I'll show you what why it's two
seconds like the torch delays two

476
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:43,880
seconds like the torch delays two
 

477
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,980
seconds like the torch delays two
seconds but I think and I'm really

478
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:47,990
seconds but I think and I'm really
 

479
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:58,700
seconds but I think and I'm really
scared now it's a guy right there

480
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:58,710

 

481
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,740

but it's two seconds plus the time it

482
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,750
but it's two seconds plus the time it
 

483
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,159
but it's two seconds plus the time it
takes this cart to go up here around and

484
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,169
takes this cart to go up here around and
 

485
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,389
takes this cart to go up here around and
hit this detector so it's probably more

486
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:08,399
hit this detector so it's probably more
 

487
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:17,840
hit this detector so it's probably more
like three four seconds yeah anyway yeah

488
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:17,850
like three four seconds yeah anyway yeah
 

489
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,240

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:01,960
control this and it's that determine
 

537
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,940
control this and it's that determine
whether the power can take the shortcuts

538
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:04,950
whether the power can take the shortcuts
 

539
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,620
whether the power can take the shortcuts
if it can't take the shortcut it has to

if it can't take the shortcut it has to
 

541
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,210
if it can't take the shortcut it has to
go through this long way with these

to prevent as a here it sends power this

562
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,490
to prevent as a here it sends power this

way and this way if powers allowed to

564
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,010
way and this way if powers allowed to
 

565
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,250
way and this way if powers allowed to
pass through here it'll keep going down

566
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,260
pass through here it'll keep going down
 

567
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,269
pass through here it'll keep going down
here but the power from here also keeps

568
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:06,279
here but the power from here also keeps
 

569
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:11,009
here but the power from here also keeps
going normally and so the shortcut goes

570
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:11,019
going normally and so the shortcut goes
 

571
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,590
going normally and so the shortcut goes
through and then soon after the long I

572
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
through and then soon after the long I
 

573
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,240
through and then soon after the long I
can't explain this come on you guys can

574

577
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,889
download my world and check it out let's
let's leave it at that if you want to

578
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:25,899
let's leave it at that if you want to
 

579
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:32,669
let's leave it at that if you want to
figure it out yeah so the other thing

580
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:32,679
figure it out yeah so the other thing
 

581
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,769
figure it out yeah so the other thing
sometimes the car gets stuck here I

582
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:36,779

 

583
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:39,000

don't know what oh you know why it's

wrong I think I think I got wolves
 

587
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,289
wrong I think I think I got wolves
running around and that's why it keeps

588
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:43,299
running around and that's why it keeps
 

589
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,019
running around and that's why it keeps
getting missed

590
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:46,029

 

591
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:52,299

looking down from here and I'll be doing
 

601
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,279
looking down from here and I'll be doing
lots of renovating down here to make you

00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:57,610
rails it's about one second of power
 

647
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,610
rails it's about one second of power
which is it just enough time for this

648
00:23:59,610 --> 00:23:59,620
which is it just enough time for this
 

649
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,299
which is it just enough time for this
cart to go up and get off these power

650
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:03,309
cart to go up and get off these power
 

651
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,149
cart to go up and get off these power
rails otherwise it gets stuck on the

652
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
rails otherwise it gets stuck on the
 

653
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:16,100
rails otherwise it gets stuck on the
power rail like up at the slope here

654
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,110

 

655
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,539

sometimes this happens to it like it's

656
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:18,549
sometimes this happens to it like it's
 

657
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:22,440
sometimes this happens to it like it's
stuck on both rails it's very rare

658
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:22,450
stuck on both rails it's very rare
 

659
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:27,550
stuck on both rails it's very rare
though

660
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:27,560

 

661
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,460

yeah so it needs about that solid one

662
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,470
yeah so it needs about that solid one
 

663
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,590
yeah so it needs about that solid one
second of power to make it all the way

664
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:32,600
second of power to make it all the way
 

665
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:39,430
second of power to make it all the way
up here if this after it goes through

666
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
up here if this after it goes through
 

667
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,430
up here if this after it goes through
the two timers the power ends it goes

668
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
the two timers the power ends it goes
 

669
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:55,330
the two timers the power ends it goes
down here that goes to here and then the

670
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:55,340
down here that goes to here and then the
 

671
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,550
down here that goes to here and then the
power rails just beyond this repeater

672
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:57,560
power rails just beyond this repeater
 

673
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,120
power rails just beyond this repeater
here so if this is if this wire is

674
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,130
here so if this is if this wire is
 

675
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,600
here so if this is if this wire is
flashing on off on off it's not going to

676
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:04,610
flashing on off on off it's not going to
 

677
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,610
flashing on off on off it's not going to
work it needs to be on for a solid one

678
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:06,620
work it needs to be on for a solid one
 

679
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,170
work it needs to be on for a solid one
second and it needs to be timed properly

680
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,180
second and it needs to be timed properly
 

681
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:16,000
second and it needs to be timed properly
and so by having an and each on each of

682
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,010
and so by having an and each on each of
 

683
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,420
and so by having an and each on each of
these split wires it prevents the

684
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,430
these split wires it prevents the
 

685
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,240
these split wires it prevents the
unwanted signal from going through and

686
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,250
unwanted signal from going through and
 

687
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,950
unwanted signal from going through and
messing things up basically I think

688
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
messing things up basically I think
 

689
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:37,200
messing things up basically I think
that's as clear as I can explain it and

690
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,210

 

691
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,070

so this is one lever here the one second

692
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
so this is one lever here the one second
 

693
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,110
so this is one lever here the one second
one it splits here gets inverted the

694
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
one it splits here gets inverted the
 

695
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,940
one it splits here gets inverted the
signal and it goes to one of the and

696
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:48,950
signal and it goes to one of the and
 

697
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,790
signal and it goes to one of the and
eats and the other one goes to the other

698
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:51,800
eats and the other one goes to the other
 

699
00:25:51,800 --> 00:26:00,520
eats and the other one goes to the other
end dates so they're opposites little

700
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:00,530
end dates so they're opposites little
 

701
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,760
end dates so they're opposites little
strange not very interesting if you

702
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:03,770
strange not very interesting if you
 

703
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,630
strange not very interesting if you
don't like redstone so my apologies for

704
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:07,640
don't like redstone so my apologies for
 

705
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:23,130
don't like redstone so my apologies for
that

706
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,140

 

707
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,950

peekaboo

708
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:25,960
peekaboo
 

709
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:39,720
peekaboo
peekaboo are you tending them nice

710
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:39,730
peekaboo are you tending them nice
 

711
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,670
peekaboo are you tending them nice
normally this rail system works a lot

712
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:42,680
normally this rail system works a lot
 

713
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,700
normally this rail system works a lot
better this is the worst I've seen it

714
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:45,710
better this is the worst I've seen it
 

715
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,710
better this is the worst I've seen it
working since I've started recording I'm

716
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:47,720
working since I've started recording I'm
 

717
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,610
working since I've started recording I'm
pretty sure it's because of the wolves

718
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:53,620

 

719
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,720

that's the other way is starting it's

720
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:55,730
that's the other way is starting it's
 

721
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:02,470
that's the other way is starting it's
pulling the lever for two seconds yes so

722
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
pulling the lever for two seconds yes so
 

723
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,650
pulling the lever for two seconds yes so
about the wolves I need to stop them

724
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:05,660
about the wolves I need to stop them
 

725
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,950
about the wolves I need to stop them
from coming in here now which means we

726
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:11,960
from coming in here now which means we
 

727
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,650
from coming in here now which means we
need to work on the mob system again and

728
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:17,660
need to work on the mob system again and
 

729
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:24,820
need to work on the mob system again and
find a more permanent solution and so I

730
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:24,830
find a more permanent solution and so I
 

731
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,460
find a more permanent solution and so I
figured out what I want to do I think

732
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:29,470

 

733
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,000

instead of having the pigs the cows and

734
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,010
instead of having the pigs the cows and
 

735
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,510
instead of having the pigs the cows and
the sheep and all that instead of having

736
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
the sheep and all that instead of having
 

737
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,340
the sheep and all that instead of having
all their drops come to here I'm gonna

738
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,350
all their drops come to here I'm gonna
 

739
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:44,530
all their drops come to here I'm gonna
split them up after all

740
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:44,540

 

741
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,140

cows and sheep I'll probably make drop

742
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,150
cows and sheep I'll probably make drop
 

743
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,180
cows and sheep I'll probably make drop
over there the leather and wool and

744
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,190
over there the leather and wool and
 

745
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:58,670
over there the leather and wool and
bacon I'm gonna make fall out here and

746
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:58,680
bacon I'm gonna make fall out here and
 

747
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,540
bacon I'm gonna make fall out here and
I've decided actually episode's probably

748
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:05,550
I've decided actually episode's probably
 

749
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,900
I've decided actually episode's probably
getting a little bit long I'm gonna have

750
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:08,910
getting a little bit long I'm gonna have
 

751
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:19,390
getting a little bit long I'm gonna have
like a glass roof over here not too big

752
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:19,400
like a glass roof over here not too big
 

753
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,980
like a glass roof over here not too big
it's gonna be a little room above the

754
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:21,990
it's gonna be a little room above the
 

755
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:31,700
it's gonna be a little room above the
doors here glass yeah it will make it to

756
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:31,710
doors here glass yeah it will make it to
 

757
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:38,180
doors here glass yeah it will make it to
four by four glass and this is where the

758
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,190
four by four glass and this is where the
 

759
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,920
four by four glass and this is where the
pigs are gonna drop right above us

760
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:39,930
pigs are gonna drop right above us
 

761
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,100
pigs are gonna drop right above us
and they're gonna be set on fire so that

762
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,110
and they're gonna be set on fire so that
 

763
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,480
and they're gonna be set on fire so that
they'll produce cooked pork chops

764
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,490
they'll produce cooked pork chops
 

765
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,380
they'll produce cooked pork chops
instead of just raw ones so there's

766
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,390
instead of just raw ones so there's
 

767
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,360
instead of just raw ones so there's
gonna be a little room and somehow I'm

768
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,370
gonna be a little room and somehow I'm
 

769
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,310
gonna be a little room and somehow I'm
gonna have some stairs to go up to it's

770
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,320
gonna have some stairs to go up to it's
 

771
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,420
gonna have some stairs to go up to it's
probably out here and we can watch the

772
00:28:59,420 --> 00:28:59,430
probably out here and we can watch the
 

773
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,930
probably out here and we can watch the
pigs burning above us

774
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:01,940
pigs burning above us
 

775
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,250
pigs burning above us

777
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:10,170
[Music]
it should be pretty cool I'm gonna check

778
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:10,180
it should be pretty cool I'm gonna check
 

779
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,850
it should be pretty cool I'm gonna check
the time if we have time I'll start

780
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:11,860
the time if we have time I'll start
 

781
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:17,460
the time if we have time I'll start
working on it actually yeah we're like

782
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:17,470
working on it actually yeah we're like
 

783
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,760
working on it actually yeah we're like
30 minutes and so probably can't do it

784
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:20,770
30 minutes and so probably can't do it
 

785
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,020
30 minutes and so probably can't do it
this episode I really wanted to go that

786
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,030
this episode I really wanted to go that
 

787
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,560
this episode I really wanted to go that
wasted wasted all my time talking about

788
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:28,570
wasted wasted all my time talking about
 

789
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,520
wasted wasted all my time talking about
the power rails and stuff so next

790
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:32,530
the power rails and stuff so next
 

791
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,070
the power rails and stuff so next
episode what we're gonna do is we are

792
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,080
episode what we're gonna do is we are
 

793
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,000
episode what we're gonna do is we are
going to rip this out and we're gonna

794
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,010
going to rip this out and we're gonna
 

795
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:45,330
going to rip this out and we're gonna
run a long tube all the way along here

796
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:45,340
run a long tube all the way along here
 

797
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,770
run a long tube all the way along here
to here and then it's gonna drop the

798
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:49,780
to here and then it's gonna drop the
 

799
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:56,790
to here and then it's gonna drop the
pigs onto a flame and then the pigs will

800
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:56,800
pigs onto a flame and then the pigs will
 

801
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,390
pigs onto a flame and then the pigs will
walk off the flame onto the glass and

802
00:29:59,390 --> 00:29:59,400
walk off the flame onto the glass and
 

803
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,410
walk off the flame onto the glass and
they'll they'll roast above the glass I

804
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:04,420
they'll they'll roast above the glass I
 

805
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,770
they'll they'll roast above the glass I
guess you could say and all along like

806
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:07,780
