mechanic we're most likely gonna be
building an endermite Enderman farm

160
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:50,700
building an endermite Enderman farm
 

161
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,640
building an endermite Enderman farm
because those are really fast and easy

162
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,650
because those are really fast and easy
 

163
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,479
because those are really fast and easy
to build and they work insanely well but

164
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:56,489
to build and they work insanely well but
 

165
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:57,800
to build and they work insanely well but
I want to take advantage of the splash

166
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:57,810
I want to take advantage of the splash
 

167
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,920
I want to take advantage of the splash
effect to get with the sword now now I

168
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:00,930
effect to get with the sword now now I
 

169
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,630
effect to get with the sword now now I
want to see that the actual area of

170
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
want to see that the actual area of
 

171
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,870
want to see that the actual area of
effect it looks like maybe three wide to

172
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:08,880
effect it looks like maybe three wide to
 

173
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,039
effect it looks like maybe three wide to
back right like the guys on the gray

174
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,049
back right like the guys on the gray
 

175
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:15,050
back right like the guys on the gray
blocks on the sides they're not getting

176
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,060
blocks on the sides they're not getting
 

177
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,849
blocks on the sides they're not getting
attacked I need to know how big of an

178
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:19,859
attacked I need to know how big of an
 

179
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,300
attacked I need to know how big of an
area to funnel them into basically yeah

180
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,310
area to funnel them into basically yeah
 

181
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,620
area to funnel them into basically yeah
it looks yeah and it looks like the ones

182
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,630
it looks yeah and it looks like the ones
 

183
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,760
it looks yeah and it looks like the ones
in the back room aren't getting hit

184
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,770
in the back room aren't getting hit
 

185
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,110
in the back room aren't getting hit
either

186
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,120

 

187
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,909

ok let's try it again I Shrunk the area

188
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:30,919
ok let's try it again I Shrunk the area
 

189
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,279
ok let's try it again I Shrunk the area
I think we're going for it's three by

190
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:33,289
I think we're going for it's three by
 

191
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:39,790
I think we're going for it's three by
two oh no no no not all of them are

192
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:39,800
two oh no no no not all of them are
 

193
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,379
two oh no no no not all of them are
being hit those guys on the sides unless

194
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:44,389
being hit those guys on the sides unless
 

195
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,760
being hit those guys on the sides unless
you're dead center it looks like and

196
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:48,770
you're dead center it looks like and
 

197
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,219
you're dead center it looks like and
just for fun we have a couple hundred

198
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:51,229
just for fun we have a couple hundred
 

199
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,680
just for fun we have a couple hundred
Enderman in a 1x1 area look what happens

200
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,690
Enderman in a 1x1 area look what happens
 

201
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,980
Enderman in a 1x1 area look what happens
I feel like we need to harness this

202
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,990
I feel like we need to harness this
 

203
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:07,480
I feel like we need to harness this
effect because this is so cool okay guys

204
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,490
effect because this is so cool okay guys
 

205
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,159
effect because this is so cool okay guys
so I think we got it figure it out we're

206
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:09,169
so I think we got it figure it out we're
 

207
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:12,939
so I think we got it figure it out we're
going to aim for a three by one area

208
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:12,949
going to aim for a three by one area
 

209
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,950
going to aim for a three by one area
we're going to try funnel them all into

210
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
we're going to try funnel them all into
 

211
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,110
we're going to try funnel them all into
I think that'll work out okay

212
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
I think that'll work out okay
 

213
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,760
I think that'll work out okay
and if not we might make some

214
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:18,770
and if not we might make some
 

215
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,460
and if not we might make some
adjustments bi over in our end and now

216
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,470
adjustments bi over in our end and now
 

217
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,710
adjustments bi over in our end and now
the original ender ender we built is off

218
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:23,720
the original ender ender we built is off
 

219
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,710
the original ender ender we built is off
that way way down there and ender ender

220
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
that way way down there and ender ender
 

221
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,850
that way way down there and ender ender
2.0 is off that way so 3.0 is going to

222
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:30,860
2.0 is off that way so 3.0 is going to
 

223
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,550
2.0 is off that way so 3.0 is going to
be oh no he was waiting for it

224
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
be oh no he was waiting for it
 

225
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
be oh no he was waiting for it
you knew give me what I was gonna do oh

226
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,370
you knew give me what I was gonna do oh
 

227
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,460
you knew give me what I was gonna do oh
what a jerk okay yeah off this way off

228
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,470
what a jerk okay yeah off this way off
 

229
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,050
what a jerk okay yeah off this way off
this way so something that we might do a

230
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,060
this way so something that we might do a
 

231
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,029
this way so something that we might do a
little bit unique with this firm is

232
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
little bit unique with this firm is
 

233
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,129
little bit unique with this firm is
we're not gonna actually have a a path

234
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:51,139
we're not gonna actually have a a path
 

235
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,249
we're not gonna actually have a a path
or a tunnel to get off to it we're gonna

236
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:54,259
or a tunnel to get off to it we're gonna
 

237
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,379
or a tunnel to get off to it we're gonna
actually make it so we fly to it it's

238
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:56,389
actually make it so we fly to it it's
 

239
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,290
actually make it so we fly to it it's
gonna be off in the middle of the void

240
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,300
gonna be off in the middle of the void
 

241
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,980
gonna be off in the middle of the void
with nothing connecting it which may be

242
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:02,990
with nothing connecting it which may be
 

243
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,689
with nothing connecting it which may be
a good or a bad idea we'll find out

244
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:04,699
a good or a bad idea we'll find out
 

245
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,330
a good or a bad idea we'll find out
later but yeah you can see I got here no

246
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:07,340
later but yeah you can see I got here no
 

247
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,719
later but yeah you can see I got here no
problem it's pretty easy since we're

248
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:10,729
problem it's pretty easy since we're
 

249
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,670
problem it's pretty easy since we're
going to have to fly back to the island

250
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:12,680
going to have to fly back to the island
 

251
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,529
going to have to fly back to the island
though we do want an up in the air a

252
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:14,539
though we do want an up in the air a
 

253
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,320
though we do want an up in the air a
little bit I'm at y8e right now this is

254
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,330
little bit I'm at y8e right now this is
 

255
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,610
little bit I'm at y8e right now this is
where we're gonna actually spawn the

256
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:18,620
where we're gonna actually spawn the
 

257
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,129
where we're gonna actually spawn the
Enderman then we got to drop them 43

258
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:21,139
Enderman then we got to drop them 43
 

259
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,200
Enderman then we got to drop them 43
blocks to get them to half a heart right

260
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,210
blocks to get them to half a heart right
 

261
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,189
blocks to get them to half a heart right
so that'll take it down to why 37 and

262
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
so that'll take it down to why 37 and
 

263
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,260
so that'll take it down to why 37 and
then to get back to the island you know

264
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,270
then to get back to the island you know
 

265
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,850
then to get back to the island you know
I'm gonna have to jump off towards the

266
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm gonna have to jump off towards the
 

267
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,670
I'm gonna have to jump off towards the
void and activate our wings and shoot

268
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
void and activate our wings and shoot
 

269
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,300
void and activate our wings and shoot
myself with the arrow before I fall into

270
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,310
myself with the arrow before I fall into
 

271
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,070
myself with the arrow before I fall into
the void so need a little bit of

272
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,080
the void so need a little bit of
 

273
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,350
the void so need a little bit of
vertical space to do that so

274
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
vertical space to do that so
 

275
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,270
vertical space to do that so
37 blocks should be good enough I think

276
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
37 blocks should be good enough I think
 

277
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,409
37 blocks should be good enough I think
yeah so the first thing I'm gonna do is

278
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:47,419
yeah so the first thing I'm gonna do is
 

279
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,420
yeah so the first thing I'm gonna do is
just build the platform this will go

280
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,430
just build the platform this will go
 

281
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,339
just build the platform this will go
pretty quickly I think

282
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:51,349
pretty quickly I think
 

283
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:55,629
pretty quickly I think
it's not really much to this oh yeah I

284
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:55,639
it's not really much to this oh yeah I
 

285
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,249
it's not really much to this oh yeah I
should probably mention I'm building the

286
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:57,259
should probably mention I'm building the
 

287
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,110
should probably mention I'm building the
platform here out of stone right now I

288
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
platform here out of stone right now I
 

289
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,420
platform here out of stone right now I
will change it out to something else I

290
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,430
will change it out to something else I
 

291
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,820
will change it out to something else I
was thinking a lime lime clay

292
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:03,830
was thinking a lime lime clay
 

293
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,939
was thinking a lime lime clay
maybe with bone we're gonna go for green

294
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:06,949
maybe with bone we're gonna go for green
 

295
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:09,010
maybe with bone we're gonna go for green
and white green and whites and then the

296
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,020
and white green and whites and then the
 

297
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,040
and white green and whites and then the
green glass I think looked pretty good

298
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,050
green glass I think looked pretty good
 

299
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,619
green glass I think looked pretty good
somehow make that work because in the in

300
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:14,629
somehow make that work because in the in
 

301
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,469
somehow make that work because in the in
the end here things are dark right and I

302
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:17,479
the end here things are dark right and I
 

303
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,260
the end here things are dark right and I
think brighter colors are better so the

304
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,270
think brighter colors are better so the
 

305
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,080
think brighter colors are better so the
bone blocks are gonna be the main main

306
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,090
bone blocks are gonna be the main main
 

307
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,629
bone blocks are gonna be the main main
part of this I think pure white - can't

308
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:25,639
part of this I think pure white - can't
 

309
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,600
part of this I think pure white - can't
get much brighter than that okay let's

310
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:28,610
get much brighter than that okay let's
 

311
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,119
get much brighter than that okay let's
see here maybe we will actually run

312
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:31,129
see here maybe we will actually run
 

313
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,909
see here maybe we will actually run
pitch let's actually get the ender byte

314
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
pitch let's actually get the ender byte
 

315
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,529
pitch let's actually get the ender byte
in here already oh I just still feel him

316
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:35,539
in here already oh I just still feel him
 

317
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,649
in here already oh I just still feel him
down there I was walking forward I did

318
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:38,659
down there I was walking forward I did
 

319
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,279
down there I was walking forward I did
it again

320
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:39,289
it again
 

321
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,290
it again
let's get the ender right in here and

322
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:41,300
let's get the ender right in here and
 

323
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,790
let's get the ender right in here and
we'll just do a test here because I

324
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
we'll just do a test here because I
 

325
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,939
we'll just do a test here because I
don't know actually how far the Enderman

326
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:45,949
don't know actually how far the Enderman
 

327
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,890
don't know actually how far the Enderman
will get aggro on them so let's see what

328
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:50,900
will get aggro on them so let's see what
 

329
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,510
will get aggro on them so let's see what
do we want I got actually I think I've

330
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:52,520
do we want I got actually I think I've
 

331
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,219
do we want I got actually I think I've
got everything on me I prepared yes

332
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:56,229
got everything on me I prepared yes
 

333
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,839
got everything on me I prepared yes
let's let's change it so we'll call this

334
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:58,849
let's let's change it so we'll call this
 

335
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,399
let's let's change it so we'll call this
the middle this is where we want the

336
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:00,409
the middle this is where we want the
 

337
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,700
the middle this is where we want the
Enderman to be and your mites and I'll

338
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:03,710
Enderman to be and your mites and I'll
 

339
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,059
Enderman to be and your mites and I'll
just blame clay here so we can remember

340
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:06,069
just blame clay here so we can remember
 

341
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,159
just blame clay here so we can remember
okay and the way I'm gonna trap them I'm

342
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:09,169
okay and the way I'm gonna trap them I'm
 

343
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,860
okay and the way I'm gonna trap them I'm
gonna put down some power rails oh I

344
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:11,870
gonna put down some power rails oh I
 

345
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,850
gonna put down some power rails oh I
didn't bring a minecarts I have tons of

346
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:15,860
didn't bring a minecarts I have tons of
 

347
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,429
didn't bring a minecarts I have tons of
iron on me good this is the trouble

348
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:18,439
iron on me good this is the trouble
 

349
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,839
iron on me good this is the trouble
about building something like far away

350
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:19,849
about building something like far away
 

351
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,179
about building something like far away
it's like if you forget anything it's

352
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:22,189
it's like if you forget anything it's
 

353
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,670
it's like if you forget anything it's
the worst that's why I always keep like

354
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:24,680
the worst that's why I always keep like
 

355
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,529
the worst that's why I always keep like
iron and stuff in my ender chest here

356
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:26,539
iron and stuff in my ender chest here
 

357
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,450
iron and stuff in my ender chest here
cuz I often forget things otherwise okay

358
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:31,460
cuz I often forget things otherwise okay
 

359
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,040
cuz I often forget things otherwise okay
so we got a minecart bouncing back and

360
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,050
so we got a minecart bouncing back and
 

361
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,740
so we got a minecart bouncing back and
forth now we got to get the endermite

362
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:35,750
forth now we got to get the endermite
 

363
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,420
forth now we got to get the endermite
spawned in and I think you got to be

364
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,430
spawned in and I think you got to be
 

365
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,620
spawned in and I think you got to be
careful when you do this if the

366
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:38,630
careful when you do this if the
 

367
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,589
careful when you do this if the
platform's only one thick you can

368
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
platform's only one thick you can
 

369
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,899
platform's only one thick you can
sometimes glitch through it or at least

370
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:43,909
sometimes glitch through it or at least
 

371
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:46,780
sometimes glitch through it or at least
I've done that in the past oh that was

372
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:46,790
I've done that in the past oh that was
 

373
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,300
I've done that in the past oh that was
second try right that's pretty good it's

374
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,310
second try right that's pretty good it's
 

375
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,190
second try right that's pretty good it's
there 3.0

376
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
there 3.0
 

377
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
there 3.0
yeah we named them good so normally they

378
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,210
yeah we named them good so normally they
 

379
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,290
yeah we named them good so normally they
do spawn after two minutes I think but

380
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:57,300
do spawn after two minutes I think but
 

381
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,580
do spawn after two minutes I think but
if you name them then they last forever

382
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:58,590
if you name them then they last forever
 

383
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,430
if you name them then they last forever
okay we got them too and we will do what

384
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:04,440
okay we got them too and we will do what
 

385
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,430
okay we got them too and we will do what
let's shut that off actually no let's

386
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,440
let's shut that off actually no let's
 

387
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,730
let's shut that off actually no let's
just stop him from moving yeah oh wait

388
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:13,740
just stop him from moving yeah oh wait
 

389
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,340
just stop him from moving yeah oh wait
no he's gonna track me that's the thing

390
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,350
no he's gonna track me that's the thing
 

391
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,040
no he's gonna track me that's the thing
that confuses me a lot now mobs can

392
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,050
that confuses me a lot now mobs can
 

393
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,690
that confuses me a lot now mobs can
still like move around in a minecart

394
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:20,700
still like move around in a minecart
 

395
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,990
still like move around in a minecart
even if it's not to be powered babies

396
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
even if it's not to be powered babies
 

397
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,430
even if it's not to be powered babies
are very hard to control them sometimes

398
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
are very hard to control them sometimes
 

399
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,770
are very hard to control them sometimes
how do we own a block like right there

400
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:30,780
how do we own a block like right there
 

401
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,610
how do we own a block like right there
like right there

402
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:33,620
like right there
 

403
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,560
like right there
but we also need them on the track the

404
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:36,570
but we also need them on the track the
 

405
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,379
but we also need them on the track the
middle one

406
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:40,389

 

407
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:42,210

if you would align to the other side

408
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,220
if you would align to the other side
 

409
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,590
if you would align to the other side
that would be great oh hey just stay

410
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:46,600
that would be great oh hey just stay
 

411
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,030
that would be great oh hey just stay
there stay there

412
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,040
there stay there
 

413
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,660
there stay there
yes all right we got him now we got to

414
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:51,670
yes all right we got him now we got to
 

415
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,100
yes all right we got him now we got to
be very careful he doesn't die because

416
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,110
be very careful he doesn't die because
 

417
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,819
be very careful he doesn't die because
if an ender

418
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:53,829
if an ender
 

419
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,400
if an ender
men actually touches him he's gone don

420
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,410
men actually touches him he's gone don
 

421
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,979
men actually touches him he's gone don
skis he's done for so uh how do we do

422
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:01,989
skis he's done for so uh how do we do
 

423
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:05,119
skis he's done for so uh how do we do
this maybe I think we can actually use

424
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:05,129
this maybe I think we can actually use
 

425
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,999
this maybe I think we can actually use
trapdoors if I'm not mistaken I'm gonna

426
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:09,009
trapdoors if I'm not mistaken I'm gonna
 

427
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:14,939
trapdoors if I'm not mistaken I'm gonna
make a couple trapdoors let's do let's

428
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:14,949
make a couple trapdoors let's do let's
 

429
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,999
make a couple trapdoors let's do let's
do three and we will plan to drop the

430
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:18,009
do three and we will plan to drop the
 

431
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,210
do three and we will plan to drop the
Enderman down no not there we would want

432
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:21,220
Enderman down no not there we would want
 

433
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,539
Enderman down no not there we would want
to do it there right yeah yeah let's try

434
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:27,549
to do it there right yeah yeah let's try
 

435
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,660
to do it there right yeah yeah let's try
this out okay it's not gonna be like

436
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:30,670
this out okay it's not gonna be like
 

437
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,650
this out okay it's not gonna be like
super finished right off the bat here is

438
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:34,660
super finished right off the bat here is
 

439
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,299
super finished right off the bat here is
that a good idea wait maybe maybe I

440
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:36,309
that a good idea wait maybe maybe I
 

441
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:39,059
that a good idea wait maybe maybe I
should lower those I'm gonna lower those

442
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:39,069
should lower those I'm gonna lower those
 

443
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,859
should lower those I'm gonna lower those
so instead of being at the top of the

444
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:40,869
so instead of being at the top of the
 

445
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:44,549
so instead of being at the top of the
block let's put them here so they should

446
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:44,559
block let's put them here so they should
 

447
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,619
block let's put them here so they should
see the endermite they'll run towards

448
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:46,629
see the endermite they'll run towards
 

449
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,119
see the endermite they'll run towards
them they'll hit their face on these

450
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:48,129
them they'll hit their face on these
 

451
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,509
them they'll hit their face on these
trapdoors and then fall down right let's

452
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
trapdoors and then fall down right let's
 

453
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,470
trapdoors and then fall down right let's
hope yeah something like that and then

454
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:55,480
hope yeah something like that and then
 

455
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,999
hope yeah something like that and then
to actually make them want to go to the

456
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:57,009
to actually make them want to go to the
 

457
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,119
to actually make them want to go to the
Enderman or the ender mites I keep

458
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:00,129
Enderman or the ender mites I keep
 

459
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:03,210
Enderman or the ender mites I keep
mixing the two up man put down some of

460
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:03,220
mixing the two up man put down some of
 

461
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,150
mixing the two up man put down some of
these we need a couple more use some of

462
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
these we need a couple more use some of
 

463
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,939
these we need a couple more use some of
this ugly jungle wood up finally been

464
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:08,949
this ugly jungle wood up finally been
 

465
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,859
this ugly jungle wood up finally been
taking up a space in my chest forever

466
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:10,869
taking up a space in my chest forever
 

467
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,079
taking up a space in my chest forever
I don't think I've ever once built

468
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:13,089
I don't think I've ever once built
 

469
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,799
I don't think I've ever once built
anything with jungle wood yet all right

470
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:16,809
anything with jungle wood yet all right
 

471
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,439
anything with jungle wood yet all right
there we go I thought there's anything

472
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:19,449
there we go I thought there's anything
 

473
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:23,449
there we go I thought there's anything
wrong with it it just looks likely okay

474
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:23,459
wrong with it it just looks likely okay
 

475
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,189
wrong with it it just looks likely okay
that should work right I'll just put

476
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:26,199
that should work right I'll just put
 

477
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,309
that should work right I'll just put
this here for right now

478
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:28,319
this here for right now
 

479
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:34,499
this here for right now
and take away the torches over here make

480
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:34,509
and take away the torches over here make
 

481
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:36,689
and take away the torches over here make
it completely dark and let's just see

482
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:36,699
it completely dark and let's just see
 

483
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,539
it completely dark and let's just see
how far away they'll track them did I

484
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:39,549
how far away they'll track them did I
 

485
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:43,949
how far away they'll track them did I
mess up anyway they might actually

486
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:43,959
mess up anyway they might actually
 

487
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,600
mess up anyway they might actually
teleport to this side of the platform

488
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,610
teleport to this side of the platform
 

489
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,389
teleport to this side of the platform
this is all kind of temporary that will

490
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
this is all kind of temporary that will
 

491
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,220
this is all kind of temporary that will
actually block this so they don't kill

492
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,230
actually block this so they don't kill
 

493
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,559
actually block this so they don't kill
them that's sealed up good now okay

494
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:52,569
them that's sealed up good now okay
 

495
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:53,730
them that's sealed up good now okay
let's back off

496
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:53,740
let's back off
 

497
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:00,750
let's back off
and just see what happens who they go

498
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:00,760
and just see what happens who they go
 

499
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,550
and just see what happens who they go
pretty fast don't they as soon as they

500
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
pretty fast don't they as soon as they
 

501
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,970
pretty fast don't they as soon as they
spawn that is really cool okay there's

502
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:08,980
spawn that is really cool okay there's
 

503
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,830
spawn that is really cool okay there's
one way in the back there oh he he he

504
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:10,840
one way in the back there oh he he he
 

505
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,850
one way in the back there oh he he he
saw him okay

506
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:11,860
saw him okay
 

507
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,860
saw him okay
so we can make this platform bigger for

508
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:13,870
so we can make this platform bigger for
 

509
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:19,170
so we can make this platform bigger for
sure and it's done no this is the old

510
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:19,180
sure and it's done no this is the old
 

511
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,060
sure and it's done no this is the old
internment farm the first one we built I

512
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,070
internment farm the first one we built I
 

513
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,310
internment farm the first one we built I
just wanted to come check it out cuz I I

514
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,320
just wanted to come check it out cuz I I
 

515
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,510
just wanted to come check it out cuz I I
know it was broken because of the

516
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:24,520
know it was broken because of the
 

517
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,040
know it was broken because of the
pressure plates but we were having them

518
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,050
pressure plates but we were having them
 

519
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,710
pressure plates but we were having them
spawning up here and it looks like it's

520
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
spawning up here and it looks like it's
 

521
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,210
spawning up here and it looks like it's
the Pistons they're spawning on the

522
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:30,220
the Pistons they're spawning on the
 

523
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,900
the Pistons they're spawning on the
pistons now kind of interesting okay

524
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:33,910
pistons now kind of interesting okay
 

525
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,110
pistons now kind of interesting okay
let's go back oh I'm lost

526
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
let's go back oh I'm lost
 

527
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,340
let's go back oh I'm lost
it's this way right yeah I also was

528
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,350
it's this way right yeah I also was
 

529
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,930
it's this way right yeah I also was
trying to get the Enderman to be spawn

530
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:42,940
trying to get the Enderman to be spawn
 

531
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,770
trying to get the Enderman to be spawn
over here so it seems they can track in

532
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:46,780
over here so it seems they can track in
 

533
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,860
over here so it seems they can track in
termites from a very far distance like

534
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:49,870
termites from a very far distance like
 

535
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,060
termites from a very far distance like
crazy far crazy crazy far let's go let's

536
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,070
crazy far crazy crazy far let's go let's
 

537
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,760
crazy far crazy crazy far let's go let's
go back here a little bit's something I

538
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:56,770
go back here a little bit's something I
 

539
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,230
go back here a little bit's something I
want to try out too let's put a water

540
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
want to try out too let's put a water
 

541
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,780
want to try out too let's put a water
bucket here and see what they do like do

542
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:00,790
bucket here and see what they do like do
 

543
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:06,150
bucket here and see what they do like do
they run through it oh they do not maybe

544
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
they run through it oh they do not maybe
 

545
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,520
they run through it oh they do not maybe
they would teleports maybe if we put put

546
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:08,530
they would teleports maybe if we put put
 

547
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,860
they would teleports maybe if we put put
it further back they would teleport no

548
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:13,870
it further back they would teleport no
 

549
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,490
it further back they would teleport no
okay this is really interesting so this

550
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:17,500
okay this is really interesting so this
 

551
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,530
okay this is really interesting so this
guy he's mad at the ender mites but he

552
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:19,540
guy he's mad at the ender mites but he
 

553
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,940
guy he's mad at the ender mites but he
can't figure out how to get past this

554
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:20,950
can't figure out how to get past this
 

555
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,480
can't figure out how to get past this
water remove it is he gonna go then oh

556
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:26,490
water remove it is he gonna go then oh
 

557
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,210
water remove it is he gonna go then oh
that's pretty crazy so yeah we can't get

558
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:30,220
that's pretty crazy so yeah we can't get
 

559
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,430
that's pretty crazy so yeah we can't get
them to teleport to the endermite faster

560
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:32,440
them to teleport to the endermite faster
 

561
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,920
them to teleport to the endermite faster
that would speed up the mod mob firm if

562
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:34,930
that would speed up the mod mob firm if
 

563
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,140
that would speed up the mod mob firm if
we could oh man I think we finally did

564
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,150
we could oh man I think we finally did
 

565
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,720
we could oh man I think we finally did
it guys I better have a trouble this

566
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:42,730
it guys I better have a trouble this
 

567
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,870
it guys I better have a trouble this
platform is getting huge been trying to

568
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:45,880
platform is getting huge been trying to
 

569
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,010
platform is getting huge been trying to
figure out how far they'll actually

570
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:47,020
figure out how far they'll actually
 

571
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,960
figure out how far they'll actually
track an and termites it looks like it's

572
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:48,970
track an and termites it looks like it's
 

573
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,810
track an and termites it looks like it's
about 64 blocks away and then they they

574
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:51,820
about 64 blocks away and then they they
 

575
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,720
about 64 blocks away and then they they
can't see them which is crazy crazy

576
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:54,730
can't see them which is crazy crazy
 

577
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,120
can't see them which is crazy crazy
distance like no way we would want to

578
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,130
distance like no way we would want to
 

579
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,340
distance like no way we would want to
make a circle that big cuz then it would

580
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,350
make a circle that big cuz then it would
 

581
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,260
make a circle that big cuz then it would
take them a very long time to walk to

582
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:01,270
take them a very long time to walk to
 

583
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,930
take them a very long time to walk to
the end of my right oh yeah you see you

584
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:03,940
the end of my right oh yeah you see you
 

585
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,220
the end of my right oh yeah you see you
walked a little bit forward and then you

586
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,230
walked a little bit forward and then you
 

587
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,410
walked a little bit forward and then you
saw

588
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:06,420
saw
 

589
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,290
saw
so he passed the the border

590
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:11,300

 

591
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,780

interesting yeah so probably want to

592
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:14,790
interesting yeah so probably want to
 

593
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,090
interesting yeah so probably want to
keep the circle around 20 to 30 blocks

594
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,100
keep the circle around 20 to 30 blocks
 

595
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,590
keep the circle around 20 to 30 blocks
so that they don't have to walk this far

596
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,600
so that they don't have to walk this far
 

597
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,650
so that they don't have to walk this far
because that takes a lot of time and if

598
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:21,660
because that takes a lot of time and if
 

599
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,000
because that takes a lot of time and if
we're not getting enough Enderman

600
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,010
we're not getting enough Enderman
 

601
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,650
we're not getting enough Enderman
spawning then we're gonna probably want

602
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:24,660
spawning then we're gonna probably want
 

603
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,570
spawning then we're gonna probably want
to look into layering the Enderman farm

604
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:26,580
to look into layering the Enderman farm
 

605
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,550
to look into layering the Enderman farm
here like go up vertically instead of

606
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
here like go up vertically instead of
 

607
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,830
here like go up vertically instead of
going out horizontally just so that they

608
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:33,840
going out horizontally just so that they
 

609
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:44,410
going out horizontally just so that they
can fall down here a lot faster you know

610
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:44,420

 

611
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,150

cool so we got a little bit of a

612
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,160
cool so we got a little bit of a
 

613
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,760
cool so we got a little bit of a
platform built here and I'm just doing

614
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:49,770
platform built here and I'm just doing
 

615
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,800
platform built here and I'm just doing
some testing I'm taking a very low-tech

616
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:51,810
some testing I'm taking a very low-tech
 

617
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,230
some testing I'm taking a very low-tech
approach to this farm if you're

618
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
approach to this farm if you're
 

619
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,910
approach to this farm if you're
wondering how I'm deciding like what

620
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
wondering how I'm deciding like what
 

621
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
wondering how I'm deciding like what
shape the platform is and how big I'm

622
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:57,930
shape the platform is and how big I'm
 

623
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,700
shape the platform is and how big I'm
gonna make it basically trial and error

624
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:01,710
gonna make it basically trial and error
 

625
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,080
gonna make it basically trial and error
here you see like there's a couple

626
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,090
here you see like there's a couple
 

627
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,540
here you see like there's a couple
Enderman there they cannot see the

628
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,550
Enderman there they cannot see the
 

629
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,600
Enderman there they cannot see the
endermite so they're not going to attack

630
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:08,610
endermite so they're not going to attack
 

631
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,070
endermite so they're not going to attack
them so I'm gonna have to shave off a

632
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,080
them so I'm gonna have to shave off a
 

633
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,620
them so I'm gonna have to shave off a
couple blocks there or else changing the

634
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:12,630
couple blocks there or else changing the
 

635
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,600
couple blocks there or else changing the
way I have that set up so that they can

636
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,610
way I have that set up so that they can
 

637
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,250
way I have that set up so that they can
actually see them

638
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:16,260
actually see them
 

639
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,810
actually see them
the other thing I'm checking old man

640
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:17,820
the other thing I'm checking old man
 

641
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,390
the other thing I'm checking old man
that's a big dead zone what happened

642
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,400
that's a big dead zone what happened
 

643
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,670
that's a big dead zone what happened
there the other thing I'm checking here

644
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:22,680
there the other thing I'm checking here
 

645
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,820
there the other thing I'm checking here
is the entity count the number up here

646
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:24,830
is the entity count the number up here
 

647
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,550
is the entity count the number up here
the max spawn spawn Kenter what am I

648
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
the max spawn spawn Kenter what am I
 

649
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,640
the max spawn spawn Kenter what am I
saying the maximum mob count is about

650
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:31,650
saying the maximum mob count is about
 

651
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,660
saying the maximum mob count is about
what was it 79 or something sometimes it

652
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:35,670
what was it 79 or something sometimes it
 

653
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,950
what was it 79 or something sometimes it
goes a little bit over that if it's a

654
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:36,960
goes a little bit over that if it's a
 

655
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,400
goes a little bit over that if it's a
packed spawn but yeah we want our number

656
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,410
packed spawn but yeah we want our number
 

657
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,910
packed spawn but yeah we want our number
to to go up to that pretty much to reach

658
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:42,920
to to go up to that pretty much to reach
 

659
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,470
to to go up to that pretty much to reach
you know a decent size of a mob firm

660
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:45,480
you know a decent size of a mob firm
 

661
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,360
you know a decent size of a mob firm
here right now it's only going up to

662
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,370
here right now it's only going up to
 

663
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,110
here right now it's only going up to
maybe 10 20 30 you know so I got to make

664
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
maybe 10 20 30 you know so I got to make
 

665
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,240
maybe 10 20 30 you know so I got to make
the platform quite a bit bigger here the

666
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,250
the platform quite a bit bigger here the
 

667
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,280
the platform quite a bit bigger here the
green block at the end there is 32

668
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,290
green block at the end there is 32
 

669
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,020
green block at the end there is 32
blocks away from the endermite I might

670
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,030
blocks away from the endermite I might
 

671
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:02,120
blocks away from the endermite I might
go out to 40 maybe even 48 and then it

672
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,130
go out to 40 maybe even 48 and then it
 

673
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,950
go out to 40 maybe even 48 and then it
looks like I might start stacking

674
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:03,960
looks like I might start stacking
 

675
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,700
looks like I might start stacking
vertically but we will see I can't

676
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:07,710
vertically but we will see I can't
 

677
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,560
vertically but we will see I can't
really build on the other side unless I

678
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,570
really build on the other side unless I
 

679
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,570
really build on the other side unless I
build some kind of like distant combiner

680
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:11,580
build some kind of like distant combiner
 

681
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,700
build some kind of like distant combiner
thing to make the Enderman from this

682
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:13,710
thing to make the Enderman from this
 

683
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,860
thing to make the Enderman from this
side join up with the ones on that side

684
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:15,870
side join up with the ones on that side
 

685
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,370
side join up with the ones on that side
you know which would make this a little

686
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:19,380
you know which would make this a little
 

687
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,470
you know which would make this a little
bit more complicated anyways I'm gonna

688
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,480
bit more complicated anyways I'm gonna
 

689
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,079
bit more complicated anyways I'm gonna
keep working on

690
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:23,089
keep working on
 

691
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:30,789
keep working on
Oh snappers so guys this is a little bit

692
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:30,799
Oh snappers so guys this is a little bit
 

693
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,009
Oh snappers so guys this is a little bit
later now oh no I missed really let's

694
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:36,019
later now oh no I missed really let's
 

695
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:36,819
later now oh no I missed really let's
try it again

696
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:36,829
try it again
 

697
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,709
try it again
a little bit later now I've been placing

698
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:38,719
a little bit later now I've been placing
 

699
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:42,009
a little bit later now I've been placing
a lot of blocks and this thing is pretty

700
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:42,019
a lot of blocks and this thing is pretty
 

701
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:45,459
a lot of blocks and this thing is pretty
close to done now oh it's so cool too I

702
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:45,469
close to done now oh it's so cool too I
 

703
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,929
close to done now oh it's so cool too I
just love watching this I've been

704
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:46,939
just love watching this I've been
 

705
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,469
just love watching this I've been
staring at it for like 10 15 minutes at

706
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:50,479
staring at it for like 10 15 minutes at
 

707
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,999
staring at it for like 10 15 minutes at
least just watching all the little black

708
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:52,009
least just watching all the little black
 

709
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,579
least just watching all the little black
specks fall down the hole here it's very

710
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:54,589
specks fall down the hole here it's very
 

711
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,249
specks fall down the hole here it's very
satisfying somehow yeah it's working

712
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:57,259
satisfying somehow yeah it's working
 

713
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,079
satisfying somehow yeah it's working
great though I'm really happy with it

714
00:16:59,079 --> 00:16:59,089
great though I'm really happy with it
 

715
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,739
great though I'm really happy with it
I found a configuration that's not what

716
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:02,749
I found a configuration that's not what
 

717
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:04,329
I found a configuration that's not what
I meant to do or did I look at any of

718
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:04,339
I meant to do or did I look at any of
 

719
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,919
I meant to do or did I look at any of
them I can't look at them because then

720
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:05,929
them I can't look at them because then
 

721
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,169
them I can't look at them because then
they teleport to the tower here that's

722
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:08,179
they teleport to the tower here that's
 

723
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,239
they teleport to the tower here that's
why I got the stained glass to block the

724
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:10,249
why I got the stained glass to block the
 

725
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:13,079
why I got the stained glass to block the
view what was I saying

726
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,089
view what was I saying
 

727
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,669
view what was I saying
yeah I found a nice configuration for

728
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
yeah I found a nice configuration for
 

729
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,889
yeah I found a nice configuration for
like the trapdoors and and the way I did

730
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:17,899
like the trapdoors and and the way I did
 

731
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:21,220
like the trapdoors and and the way I did
the the whole endermite area they don't

732
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,230
the the whole endermite area they don't
 

733
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,789
the the whole endermite area they don't
seem to ever get stuck or fall off the

734
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
seem to ever get stuck or fall off the
 

735
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,239
seem to ever get stuck or fall off the
edge which is great that's really cool

736
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:27,249
edge which is great that's really cool
 

737
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:29,710
edge which is great that's really cool
even with like so many of them falling

738
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:29,720
even with like so many of them falling
 

739
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,379
even with like so many of them falling
falling down here and if you look at our

740
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:32,389
falling down here and if you look at our
 

741
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:35,259
falling down here and if you look at our
f3 thing here at the entity count here

742
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:35,269
f3 thing here at the entity count here
 

743
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:38,259
f3 thing here at the entity count here
again it's not quite at that like eighty

744
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:38,269
again it's not quite at that like eighty
 

745
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:41,980
again it's not quite at that like eighty
mark that I wanted so it could even be a

746
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:41,990
mark that I wanted so it could even be a
 

747
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,989
mark that I wanted so it could even be a
little bit bigger I think and it would

748
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:43,999
little bit bigger I think and it would
 

749
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:46,659
little bit bigger I think and it would
be a bit more efficient or faster XP

750
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:46,669
be a bit more efficient or faster XP
 

751
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:49,869
be a bit more efficient or faster XP
farm but honestly it's probably good you

752
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:49,879
farm but honestly it's probably good you
 

753
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:51,720
farm but honestly it's probably good you
really don't need to make them this big

754
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:51,730
really don't need to make them this big
 

755
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,060
really don't need to make them this big
kind of wet overkill on this already but

756
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,070
kind of wet overkill on this already but
 

757
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,399
kind of wet overkill on this already but
you know maybe maybe I make it a little

758
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:57,409
you know maybe maybe I make it a little
 

759
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,480
you know maybe maybe I make it a little
bit bigger I could do some some extra

760
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,490
bit bigger I could do some some extra
 

761
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,220
bit bigger I could do some some extra
layers too if I want but I don't know

762
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,230
layers too if I want but I don't know
 

763
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,109
layers too if I want but I don't know
let's actually start setting up the

764
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:05,119
let's actually start setting up the
 

765
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,940
let's actually start setting up the
killing area I think before we even

766
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:06,950
killing area I think before we even
 

767
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,249
killing area I think before we even
think of that I would also like to add

768
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:09,259
think of that I would also like to add
 

769
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,129
think of that I would also like to add
some kind of design into the floor but I

770
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:11,139
some kind of design into the floor but I
 

771
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:13,869
some kind of design into the floor but I
that again that as well would be a huge

772
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:13,879
that again that as well would be a huge
 

773
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,330
that again that as well would be a huge
addition so I don't know like some kind

774
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:16,340
addition so I don't know like some kind
 

775
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,359
addition so I don't know like some kind
of pixel art or something would be cool

776
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:18,369
of pixel art or something would be cool
 

777
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:22,509
of pixel art or something would be cool
don't look at any of them but yeah when

778
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:22,519
don't look at any of them but yeah when
 

779
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,419
don't look at any of them but yeah when
you're down here look how big this looks

780
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:24,429
you're down here look how big this looks
 

781
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,560
you're down here look how big this looks
it's crazy

782
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:26,570
it's crazy
 

783
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,129
it's crazy
it's an 81 diameter circle centered on

784
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:30,139
it's an 81 diameter circle centered on
 

785
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:32,320
it's an 81 diameter circle centered on
the endermite here and the minecarts and

786
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,330
the endermite here and the minecarts and
 

787
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,480
the endermite here and the minecarts and
you'll notice I changed this around too

788
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,490
you'll notice I changed this around too
 

789
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,399
you'll notice I changed this around too
I got rid of all the columns that were

790
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:36,409
I got rid of all the columns that were
 

791
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:36,790
I got rid of all the columns that were
blocked

792
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:36,800
blocked
 

793
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,520
blocked
their view and instead of having like

794
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:39,530
their view and instead of having like
 

795
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,890
their view and instead of having like
blocks here I just got trapdoors next to

796
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:41,900
blocks here I just got trapdoors next to
 

797
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,920
blocks here I just got trapdoors next to
the ender meit's six regular trapdoors

798
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:44,930
the ender meit's six regular trapdoors
 

799
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,530
the ender meit's six regular trapdoors
here and then I think there's seven iron

800
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:47,540
here and then I think there's seven iron
 

801
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,770
here and then I think there's seven iron
ones here there's no way of them

802
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:50,780
ones here there's no way of them
 

803
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,690
ones here there's no way of them
actually getting the ender might as far

804
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:52,700
actually getting the ender might as far
 

805
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,730
actually getting the ender might as far
as they can tell and they're all doing

806
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:54,740
as they can tell and they're all doing
 

807
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,460
as they can tell and they're all doing
going down a three by one area I think

808
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:57,470
going down a three by one area I think
 

809
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,680
going down a three by one area I think
but I'll have to I will have to maybe do

810
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:02,690
but I'll have to I will have to maybe do
 

811
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,200
but I'll have to I will have to maybe do
some experiments on that maybe it's not

812
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,210
some experiments on that maybe it's not
 

813
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,480
some experiments on that maybe it's not
I can't place a block what happens if we

814
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:10,490
I can't place a block what happens if we
 

815
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:16,870
I can't place a block what happens if we
do this and let's do loop because it

816
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
do this and let's do loop because it
 

817
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,490
do this and let's do loop because it
might actually be it's three by two I'm

818
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:18,500
might actually be it's three by two I'm
 

819
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,890
might actually be it's three by two I'm
not sure if I'm cheating a little bit on

820
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:20,900
not sure if I'm cheating a little bit on
 

821
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,870
not sure if I'm cheating a little bit on
that it seems okay let's try oh it's not

822
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:25,880
that it seems okay let's try oh it's not
 

823
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,280
that it seems okay let's try oh it's not
gonna let me put one there is it now

824
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,290
gonna let me put one there is it now
 

825
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,710
gonna let me put one there is it now
stupid in termite is in the way he's

826
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:29,720
stupid in termite is in the way he's
 

827
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,420
stupid in termite is in the way he's
bigger than one block for some reason

828
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:31,430
bigger than one block for some reason
 

829
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,370
bigger than one block for some reason
like that I can't place any blocks next

830
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:33,380
like that I can't place any blocks next
 

831
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,310
like that I can't place any blocks next
to the minecart like right here

832
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,320
to the minecart like right here
 

833
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,620
to the minecart like right here
well let me plays anything um

834
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:38,630
well let me plays anything um
 

835
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:45,160
well let me plays anything um
pistons yes let's do Pistons and just

836
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,170
pistons yes let's do Pistons and just
 

837
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,730

temporarily put this here don't have any

838
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:48,740
temporarily put this here don't have any
 

839
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,020
temporarily put this here don't have any
way to activate yeah you could make a

840
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,030
way to activate yeah you could make a
 

841
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,890
way to activate yeah you could make a
lever right yes all right and yes I do

842
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:53,900
lever right yes all right and yes I do
 

843
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,630

have a lot of bone blocks thank you for

844
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:55,640
have a lot of bone blocks thank you for
 

845
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,390
have a lot of bone blocks thank you for
asking even after doing all this I still

846
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
asking even after doing all this I still
 

847
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
asking even after doing all this I still
have lots because I never throw anything

848
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,410
have lots because I never throw anything
 

849
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,920
have lots because I never throw anything
away in my world here and turns out

850
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:02,930
away in my world here and turns out
 

851
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,660
away in my world here and turns out
bones actually have a u s-- now which is

852
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:04,670
bones actually have a u s-- now which is
 

853
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:10,240
bones actually have a u s-- now which is
great alright let's do that dang it I

854
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,250
great alright let's do that dang it I
 

855
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,630
great alright let's do that dang it I
lost the piston that makes me sad okay

856
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:13,640
lost the piston that makes me sad okay
 

857
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,310
lost the piston that makes me sad okay
now what's happening are they jamming up

858
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,320
now what's happening are they jamming up
 

859
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,600
now what's happening are they jamming up
at all that's definitely a 3x1 they're

860
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:19,610
at all that's definitely a 3x1 they're
 

861
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,120
at all that's definitely a 3x1 they're
falling down now seems okay right I

862
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,130
falling down now seems okay right I
 

863
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,770
falling down now seems okay right I
think we're good I'm also tempted to try

864
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:26,780
think we're good I'm also tempted to try
 

865
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,150
think we're good I'm also tempted to try
like a one by one and just see what

866
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,160
like a one by one and just see what
 

867
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,680
like a one by one and just see what
happens out of curiosity is that a big

868
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:32,690
happens out of curiosity is that a big
 

869
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,660
happens out of curiosity is that a big
mistake though I wonder Lee let's find

870
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:34,670
mistake though I wonder Lee let's find
 

871
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,549
mistake though I wonder Lee let's find
out let's put this here and then

872
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:39,559
out let's put this here and then
 

873
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,889
out let's put this here and then
how we did it is that gonna jam up oh

874
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:43,899
how we did it is that gonna jam up oh
 

875
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:45,639
how we did it is that gonna jam up oh
yeah you see they're kind of getting

876
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:45,649
yeah you see they're kind of getting
 

877
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:52,299
yeah you see they're kind of getting
stuck they kind of got a weight freed

878
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:52,309
stuck they kind of got a weight freed
 

879
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:55,629
stuck they kind of got a weight freed
for each other to fall down but it's not

880
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:55,639
for each other to fall down but it's not
 

881
00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:03,220
for each other to fall down but it's not
bad really right although I am down here

882
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,230
bad really right although I am down here
 

883
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,810
bad really right although I am down here
so not as many are spawning

884
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:04,820
so not as many are spawning
 

885
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,070
so not as many are spawning
I should go up here and let's just try

886
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
I should go up here and let's just try
 

887
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,570
I should go up here and let's just try
that out because that would simplify it

888
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:07,580
that out because that would simplify it
 

889
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,919
that out because that would simplify it
even more if I can get them to one by

890
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:08,929
even more if I can get them to one by
 

891
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:14,409
even more if I can get them to one by
one yeah you know it's not that bad

892
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:14,419
one yeah you know it's not that bad
 

893
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,499
one yeah you know it's not that bad
actually we might do this

894
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:16,509
actually we might do this
 

895
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,450
actually we might do this
it does jam up though a little bit and

896
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:19,460
it does jam up though a little bit and
 

897
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,600
it does jam up though a little bit and
sometimes like they do fall off the side

898
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,610
sometimes like they do fall off the side
 

899
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,129
sometimes like they do fall off the side
but maybe if I tweak it a little bit I

900
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:24,139
but maybe if I tweak it a little bit I
 

901
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:27,820
but maybe if I tweak it a little bit I
could I could make it work so you won

902
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:27,830
could I could make it work so you won
 

903
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,999
could I could make it work so you won
just off the side there if they fall off

904
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,009
just off the side there if they fall off
 

905
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:33,480
just off the side there if they fall off
is that a big problem

906
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,490
is that a big problem
 

907
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,710
is that a big problem
probably not especially if we can make

908
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:35,720
probably not especially if we can make
 

909
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,820
probably not especially if we can make
it where they fall into the void

910
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:36,830
it where they fall into the void
 

911
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,289
it where they fall into the void
wouldn't be an issue yeah I think well

912
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:41,299
wouldn't be an issue yeah I think well
 

913
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,279
wouldn't be an issue yeah I think well
well I should do that

914
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:42,289
well I should do that
 

915
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,129
well I should do that
cool so now we're gonna start doing the

916
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:45,139
cool so now we're gonna start doing the
 

917
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:49,060
cool so now we're gonna start doing the
killing chamber area whoa I looked at a

918
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,070
killing chamber area whoa I looked at a
 

919
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,830
killing chamber area whoa I looked at a
bunch I looked at a bunch I'm going to

920
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
bunch I looked at a bunch I'm going to
 

921
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,430
bunch I looked at a bunch I'm going to
run and jump off the edge without my bow

922
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:56,440
run and jump off the edge without my bow
 

923
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,529
run and jump off the edge without my bow
cuz I'm crazy

924
00:21:58,529 --> 00:21:58,539
cuz I'm crazy
 

925
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:11,200
cuz I'm crazy
don't you know all right there's a new

926
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,210
don't you know all right there's a new
 

927
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,119
don't you know all right there's a new
game I like to play on my base here you

928
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:13,129
game I like to play on my base here you
 

929
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:17,590
game I like to play on my base here you
gotta jump off the bush here it's really

930
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
gotta jump off the bush here it's really
 

931
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
gotta jump off the bush here it's really
hard to do jump off the bush there and

932
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,610
hard to do jump off the bush there and
 

933
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,419
hard to do jump off the bush there and
you gotta get through the door here we

934
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:22,429
you gotta get through the door here we
 

935
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,649
you gotta get through the door here we
go nope oh one more try one more try for

936
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:26,659
go nope oh one more try one more try for
 

937
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,470
go nope oh one more try one more try for
the camera I've only done it a few times

938
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:29,480
the camera I've only done it a few times
 

939
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,019
the camera I've only done it a few times
oh oh here we go here we go

940
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:35,029
oh oh here we go here we go
 

941
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:40,239
oh oh here we go here we go

00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:22,049
we're gonna roll with it the only thing
 

971
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,169
we're gonna roll with it the only thing
is we got to shut this off while we work

972
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:24,179
is we got to shut this off while we work
 

973
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,999
is we got to shut this off while we work
down there cuz otherwise anything we

974
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:26,009
down there cuz otherwise anything we
 

975
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,979
down there cuz otherwise anything we
build they're just gonna be like all

976
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:27,989
build they're just gonna be like all
 

977
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,129

like actually in the middle there
 

989
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,609
like actually in the middle there
because they're constantly walking there

1157
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,700
over here but just for now let's have
some fun with this and actually check

1158
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:44,710
some fun with this and actually check
 

1159
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,490
some fun with this and actually check
out the rates and that kind of stuff so

1160
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:47,500
out the rates and that kind of stuff so
 

1161
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,110
out the rates and that kind of stuff so
we have gets a 72 out of 75 one of those

1162
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,120
we have gets a 72 out of 75 one of those
 

1163
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,720
we have gets a 72 out of 75 one of those
is a minecart one of them is endermite

1164
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,730
is a minecart one of them is endermite
 

1165
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,830
is a minecart one of them is endermite
one of them is me maybe that would be

1166
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:58,840
one of them is me maybe that would be
 

1167
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,390
one of them is me maybe that would be
the three missing or there might be one

1168
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:00,400
the three missing or there might be one
 

1169
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:10,560
the three missing or there might be one
stuck up there yes I can't tell it's so

1170
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:10,570
stuck up there yes I can't tell it's so
 

1171
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,510
stuck up there yes I can't tell it's so
crazy

1172
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
crazy
 

1173
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,310
crazy
so as this game that goes on it just

1174
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
so as this game that goes on it just
 

1175
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,670
so as this game that goes on it just
gets easier and easier to build farms

1176
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:19,680

 

1177
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,040

totally nuts like that first ender ender

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,050
totally nuts like that first ender ender
 

1179
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,630
totally nuts like that first ender ender

one since I it's just like oh just put
 

1185
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,120
one since I it's just like oh just put
down a bunch of blocks and it works

1186
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,130
down a bunch of blocks and it works
 

1187
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:36,000
down a bunch of blocks and it works
better than anything ever uh-huh so how

1188
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,010
better than anything ever uh-huh so how
 

1189

better than anything ever uh-huh so how
long was that I figured what like as I

1190
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,230
long was that I figured what like as I
 

1191
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,360
long was that I figured what like as I
was building this it would take no

1192
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,370
was building this it would take no
 

1193
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,110
was building this it would take no
longer than 15 seconds

1194
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,120
longer than 15 seconds
 

1195
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,990
longer than 15 seconds
oh my goodness look at that ah maybe

1196
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
oh my goodness look at that ah maybe
 

1197
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,850
oh my goodness look at that ah maybe
there's about 15 or 20 maybe 20

1198
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:51,860
there's about 15 or 20 maybe 20
 

1199
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,680
there's about 15 or 20 maybe 20

fastest you can get it alright guys so I
just did a little bit more cleanup here

1214
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:27,419
just did a little bit more cleanup here
 

1215
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,269
just did a little bit more cleanup here
I got rid of all the stone and garbage

1216
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
I got rid of all the stone and garbage
 

1217
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,630
I got rid of all the stone and garbage
we had on the back back of it over here

1218
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:31,640
we had on the back back of it over here
 

1219
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,680
we had on the back back of it over here
it's made a little bit of a platform

1220
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:33,690
it's made a little bit of a platform
 

1221
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,659
it's made a little bit of a platform
there I haven't noticed them ever

1222
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:35,669
there I haven't noticed them ever
 

1223
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,970
there I haven't noticed them ever
teleporting past the barrier there if

1224
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:37,980
teleporting past the barrier there if
 

1225
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
teleporting past the barrier there if
they do the endermite is still protected

1226
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:39,990
they do the endermite is still protected
 

1227
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,320
they do the endermite is still protected
but I think because they're agro they

1228
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,330
but I think because they're agro they
 

1229
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,990
but I think because they're agro they
never teleport like even when we did

1230
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,000
never teleport like even when we did
 

1231
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,519
never teleport like even when we did
that water test before they wouldn't

1232
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:46,529
that water test before they wouldn't
 

1233
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:49,130
that water test before they wouldn't
teleport past the water or through it or

1234
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,140
teleport past the water or through it or
 

1235
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,169
teleport past the water or through it or
anything like that so I don't think it's

1236
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:51,179
anything like that so I don't think it's
 

1237
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,720
anything like that so I don't think it's
a problem I do have some torches back

1238
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:53,730
a problem I do have some torches back
 

1239
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,850
a problem I do have some torches back
there and some of that light bleeds over

1240
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:55,860
there and some of that light bleeds over
 

1241
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,940
there and some of that light bleeds over
to here but I don't really care to be

1242
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:58,950
to here but I don't really care to be
 

1243
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,460
to here but I don't really care to be
honest we have so much spawning space

1244
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,470
honest we have so much spawning space
 

1245
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:06,830
honest we have so much spawning space
anyway well I do kind of care but you

1246
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:06,840
anyway well I do kind of care but you
 

1247
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,630
anyway well I do kind of care but you
know I'd rather it look a little light a

1248
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
know I'd rather it look a little light a
 

1249
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,549
know I'd rather it look a little light a
little nicer around the inner mite area

1250
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
little nicer around the inner mite area
 

1251
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,440
little nicer around the inner mite area
then worry about the spawn rights here

1252
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:14,450
then worry about the spawn rights here
 

1253
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:21,110
then worry about the spawn rights here
so the lighting is 6 yeah not a big

1254
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
so the lighting is 6 yeah not a big
 

1255
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,049
so the lighting is 6 yeah not a big
sacrifice anyways I will show you I

1256
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:24,059
sacrifice anyways I will show you I
 

1257
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,480
sacrifice anyways I will show you I
don't think I'm gonna do this I might I

1258
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:26,490
don't think I'm gonna do this I might I
 

1259
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,730
don't think I'm gonna do this I might I
don't think I'm gonna do it though

1260
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:27,740
don't think I'm gonna do it though
 

1261
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,700
don't think I'm gonna do it though
currently we are getting all the

1262
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:31,710
currently we are getting all the
 

1263
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,769
currently we are getting all the
Enderman down in about 17 seconds I

1264
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:33,779
Enderman down in about 17 seconds I
 

1265
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:34,970
Enderman down in about 17 seconds I
checked the recording and it was

1266
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:34,980
checked the recording and it was
 

1267
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,519
checked the recording and it was
consistent 17 seconds every time there

1268
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:37,529
consistent 17 seconds every time there
 

1269
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,610
consistent 17 seconds every time there
which is cool if I want to add more

1270
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:40,620
which is cool if I want to add more
 

1271
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,700
which is cool if I want to add more
space though this was the idea I had

1272
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:43,710
space though this was the idea I had
 

1273
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,029
space though this was the idea I had
like more responding area without making

1274
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:47,039
like more responding area without making
 

1275
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,450
like more responding area without making
it go horizontally there is a problem

1276
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:50,460
it go horizontally there is a problem
 

1277
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,279
it go horizontally there is a problem
that happens because Enderman are 3

1278
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:52,289
that happens because Enderman are 3
 

1279
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:55,250
that happens because Enderman are 3
blocks tall right

1280
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:55,260
blocks tall right
 

1281
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,220
blocks tall right
and you can't the stack another platform

1282
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:58,230
and you can't the stack another platform
 

1283
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,250
and you can't the stack another platform
above here because if if the Enderman

1284
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,260
above here because if if the Enderman
 

1285
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,690
above here because if if the Enderman
sees the endermite here is in walk

1286
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:02,700
sees the endermite here is in walk
 

1287
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,549
sees the endermite here is in walk
forward BAM

1288
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
forward BAM
 

1289
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,039
forward BAM
fall damage right but something or a

1290
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:10,049
fall damage right but something or a
 

1291
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,289
fall damage right but something or a
trick I had in mind is you can use a

1292
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:12,299
trick I had in mind is you can use a
 

1293
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,260
trick I had in mind is you can use a
slab then like that

1294
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,270
slab then like that
 

1295
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,210
slab then like that
you take fall damage if you fall for

1296
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:17,220
you take fall damage if you fall for
 

1297
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,070
you take fall damage if you fall for
blocks you don't take fall damage if you

1298
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,080
blocks you don't take fall damage if you
 

1299
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,010
blocks you don't take fall damage if you
fall three and a half blocks so this

1300
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,020
fall three and a half blocks so this
 

1301
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,490
fall three and a half blocks so this
should work in theory right so the

1302
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:25,500
should work in theory right so the
 

1303
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:35,690
should work in theory right so the
Enderman will see the ender mites in the

1304
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:35,700
Enderman will see the ender mites in the
 

1305
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:44,750
Enderman will see the ender mites in the
past wait a second no way in the past

1306
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:44,760
past wait a second no way in the past
 

1307
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,180
past wait a second no way in the past
you didn't take fall damage if you fell

1308
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,190
you didn't take fall damage if you fell
 

1309
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,650
you didn't take fall damage if you fell
three and a half blocks why do you do it

1310
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:48,660
three and a half blocks why do you do it
 

1311
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,520
three and a half blocks why do you do it
now or does it only work the other way

1312
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:54,530

 

1313
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,710

okay so I had no plan for stacking them

1314
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:57,720
okay so I had no plan for stacking them
 

1315
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,980
okay so I had no plan for stacking them
vertically it seems okay nevermind I'm

1316
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:03,990
vertically it seems okay nevermind I'm
 

1317
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,720
vertically it seems okay nevermind I'm
pretty sure in the past that was the

1318
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,730
pretty sure in the past that was the
 

1319
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,830
pretty sure in the past that was the
thing but I just it isn't anymore okay

1320
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
thing but I just it isn't anymore okay
 

1321
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,570
thing but I just it isn't anymore okay
well what about trapdoors right we could

1322
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:11,580
well what about trapdoors right we could
 

1323
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,700
well what about trapdoors right we could
probably use trapdoors yes okay so yeah

1324
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:16,710
probably use trapdoors yes okay so yeah
 

1325
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,350
probably use trapdoors yes okay so yeah
if you want to stack them vertically

1326
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:18,360
if you want to stack them vertically
 

1327
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,950
if you want to stack them vertically
this is a trick you can use all you got

1328
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:21,960
this is a trick you can use all you got
 

1329
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,360
this is a trick you can use all you got
to do is make sure they still have line

1330
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,370
to do is make sure they still have line
 

1331
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,710
to do is make sure they still have line
of sight to the endermite wherever

1332
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
of sight to the endermite wherever
 

1333
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,390
of sight to the endermite wherever
they're standing on the platform but you

1334
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:26,400
they're standing on the platform but you
 

1335
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,190
they're standing on the platform but you
could add like additional Rings

1336
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,200
could add like additional Rings
 

1337
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,430
could add like additional Rings
vertically probably several layers high

1338
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:31,440
vertically probably several layers high
 

1339
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,539
vertically probably several layers high
even yeah I think that would work maybe

1340
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:35,549
even yeah I think that would work maybe
 

1341
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,950
even yeah I think that would work maybe
I'll do a little bit of a platform here

1342
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
I'll do a little bit of a platform here
 

1343
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,330
I'll do a little bit of a platform here
just to get some spawning and we'll see

1344
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:38,340
just to get some spawning and we'll see
 

1345
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,970
just to get some spawning and we'll see
if we can catch it on camera see if

1346
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:40,980
if we can catch it on camera see if
 

1347
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,549
if we can catch it on camera see if
they'll walk off of there without taking

1348
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:43,559
they'll walk off of there without taking
 

1349
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:49,450
they'll walk off of there without taking
damage oh here we go

1350
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:49,460

 

1351
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,240

what just happened so they that was

1352
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,250
what just happened so they that was
 

1353
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:56,720
what just happened so they that was
weird

1354
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:56,730
weird
 

1355
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,140
weird
that's very weird they teleported after

1356
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,150
that's very weird they teleported after
 

1357
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,909
that's very weird they teleported after
they fell they took fall damage right

1358
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
they fell they took fall damage right
 

1359
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,890
they fell they took fall damage right
I'm not imagining that I'm going to add

1360
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:03,900
I'm not imagining that I'm going to add
 

1361
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,859
I'm not imagining that I'm going to add
another layer in front of it I guess

1362
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:08,869
another layer in front of it I guess
 

1363
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:13,000
another layer in front of it I guess
because they might have walked too fast

1364
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,010

 

1365
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,730

tape okay the one guy he walked up the

1366
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:16,740
tape okay the one guy he walked up the
 

1367
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,409
tape okay the one guy he walked up the
side because it's not centered but the

1368
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:18,419
side because it's not centered but the
 

1369
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:19,970
side because it's not centered but the
one guy that walked forward he

1370
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:19,980
one guy that walked forward he
 

1371
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,849
one guy that walked forward he
definitely he was definitely fine that

1372
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:22,859
definitely he was definitely fine that
 

1373
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:38,909
definitely he was definitely fine that
time so I think I think it could work

1374
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:38,919

 

1375
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:42,520

Sunderman farm has one little problem I

1376
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:42,530
Sunderman farm has one little problem I
 

1377
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,659
Sunderman farm has one little problem I
have to show some restraint with it over

1378
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:46,669
have to show some restraint with it over
 

1379
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,200
have to show some restraint with it over
1,000 entities oh man

1380
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,210
1,000 entities oh man
 

1381
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,700
1,000 entities oh man
yeah I gotta be a little careful with it

1382
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:51,710
yeah I gotta be a little careful with it
 

1383
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,760
yeah I gotta be a little careful with it
if I kill them too quickly I can

1384
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:54,770
if I kill them too quickly I can
 

1385
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,289
if I kill them too quickly I can
probably crash my game eventually yeah

1386
00:34:58,289 --> 00:34:58,299
probably crash my game eventually yeah
 

1387
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:01,240
probably crash my game eventually yeah
anyways I'm gonna add a I'm gonna

1388
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,250
anyways I'm gonna add a I'm gonna
 

1389
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,829
anyways I'm gonna add a I'm gonna
improve this area a little bit - it

1390
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:02,839
improve this area a little bit - it
 

1391
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,559
improve this area a little bit - it
needs a roof so they don't teleport out

1392
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:05,569
needs a roof so they don't teleport out
 

1393
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:07,839
needs a roof so they don't teleport out
of the chamber there so you got one guy

1394
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:07,849
of the chamber there so you got one guy
 

1395
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:11,109
of the chamber there so you got one guy
over here you shouldn't be there also if

1396
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
over here you shouldn't be there also if
 

1397
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,390
over here you shouldn't be there also if
you guys have ideas for like pixel art

1398
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:13,400
you guys have ideas for like pixel art
 

1399
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,690
you guys have ideas for like pixel art
or whatever for that let me know I might

1400
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:16,700
or whatever for that let me know I might
 

1401
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,789
or whatever for that let me know I might
just do like some abstract green clay

1402
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:18,799
just do like some abstract green clay
 

1403
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:21,640
just do like some abstract green clay
mixed in could look cool as well or I

1404
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:21,650
mixed in could look cool as well or I
 

1405
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,349
mixed in could look cool as well or I
might just leave it as it is it's not

1406
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
might just leave it as it is it's not
 

1407
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,990
might just leave it as it is it's not
really a big thing honestly well anyways

1408
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,000
really a big thing honestly well anyways
 

1409
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,029

basically you face-planted to the ground

1488
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:22,990
basically you face-planted to the ground
 

1489
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,270
basically you face-planted to the ground
but before you hit it you quickly look

1490
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
but before you hit it you quickly look
 

1491
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,890
but before you hit it you quickly look
up and then you keep flying there's no

1492
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:29,900
up and then you keep flying there's no
 

1493
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,690
up and then you keep flying there's no
reason I keep like sticking to the

1494
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:31,700
reason I keep like sticking to the
 

1495
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:37,650
reason I keep like sticking to the
ground no I don't know why

1496
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:37,660

 

1497
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:42,430

there we go I did it kind of I don't

1498
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:42,440
there we go I did it kind of I don't
 

1499
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,400
there we go I did it kind of I don't
know the idea is a faceplant towards the

1500
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,410
know the idea is a faceplant towards the
 

1501
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,990
know the idea is a faceplant towards the
ground before you hit it throw ender

1502
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,000
ground before you hit it throw ender
 

1503
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,500
ground before you hit it throw ender
pearl look up and then you fly up again

1504
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,510
pearl look up and then you fly up again
 

1505
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,240
pearl look up and then you fly up again
so you kind of makes it look like you do

1506
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,250
so you kind of makes it look like you do
 

1507
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,780
so you kind of makes it look like you do
a like a v-shape on the ground and would
