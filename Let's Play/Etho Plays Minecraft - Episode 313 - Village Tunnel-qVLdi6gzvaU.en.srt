our emeralds count back up because we
 

165
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:08,040
our emeralds count back up because we

collection
 

197
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,650
collection
not terrible not great I think we should

198
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:56,660
not terrible not great I think we should
 

199
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,020
not terrible not great I think we should
head back to the man cave I'm not

200
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,030
head back to the man cave I'm not
 

201
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,520
head back to the man cave I'm not
exactly sure what we're gonna do today I

202
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:03,530
exactly sure what we're gonna do today I
 

203
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,660
exactly sure what we're gonna do today I
kind of feel like doing a bunch of

204
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:04,670
kind of feel like doing a bunch of
 

205
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,870
kind of feel like doing a bunch of
random stuff maybe repair some stuff at

206
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:07,880
random stuff maybe repair some stuff at
 

207
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,060
random stuff maybe repair some stuff at
the cave maybe expand out or build a

208
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,070
the cave maybe expand out or build a
 

209
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,870
the cave maybe expand out or build a
farm or something you know what I wanted

210
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:13,880
farm or something you know what I wanted
 

211
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,550
farm or something you know what I wanted
to do is figure out how to connect my

212
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:15,560
to do is figure out how to connect my
 

213
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,010
to do is figure out how to connect my
teeth to this village a little better

214
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,020
teeth to this village a little better
 

215
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,230
teeth to this village a little better
actually so we are- 350z 300 y23 about

216
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
actually so we are- 350z 300 y23 about
 

217
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,260
actually so we are- 350z 300 y23 about
because i think my lab yeah my lab you

218
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,270
because i think my lab yeah my lab you
 

219
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,990
because i think my lab yeah my lab you
can see it right here if we could

220
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
can see it right here if we could
 

221
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,560
can see it right here if we could
somehow make a tunnel go from my ethos

222
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:35,570
somehow make a tunnel go from my ethos
 

223
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,060
somehow make a tunnel go from my ethos
lab to the village that would be cool

224
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,070
lab to the village that would be cool
 

225
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,910
lab to the village that would be cool
let's see can we get inside I don't

226
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:42,920
let's see can we get inside I don't
 

227
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,360
let's see can we get inside I don't
think we can get inside we can from the

228
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,370
think we can get inside we can from the
 

229
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,930
think we can get inside we can from the
roof shortcut yeah cuz we got this we

230
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:52,940
roof shortcut yeah cuz we got this we
 

231
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,420
roof shortcut yeah cuz we got this we
got this like tunnel that we can start

232
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,430
got this like tunnel that we can start
 

233
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,250
got this like tunnel that we can start
here and this might go to the village

234
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,260
here and this might go to the village
 

235
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,690
here and this might go to the village
let me let me figure this out okay so I

236
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:01,700
let me let me figure this out okay so I
 

237
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,460
let me let me figure this out okay so I
checked it out here I just dug straight

238
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:03,470
checked it out here I just dug straight
 

239
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,880
checked it out here I just dug straight
from the lab and it is surprisingly

240
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:05,890
from the lab and it is surprisingly
 

241
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,080
from the lab and it is surprisingly
pretty good if we go straight

242
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,090

 

243
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,680

just a random cave here it comes out to

244
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:14,690
just a random cave here it comes out to
 

245
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,090
just a random cave here it comes out to
here which is really close to the

246
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:19,100
here which is really close to the
 

247
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,740
here which is really close to the
village and I'm guessing eventually I'll

248
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:20,750
village and I'm guessing eventually I'll
 

249
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,230
village and I'm guessing eventually I'll
put houses in this part too and this

250
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,240
put houses in this part too and this
 

251
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,560
put houses in this part too and this
will be all grass and stuff whoops so if

252
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,570
will be all grass and stuff whoops so if
 

253
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,800
will be all grass and stuff whoops so if
we just make like a staircase going down

254
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:29,810
we just make like a staircase going down
 

255
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,680
we just make like a staircase going down
here we can have a nice straight shot at

256
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:32,690
here we can have a nice straight shot at
 

257
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:41,260
here we can have a nice straight shot at
it pretty much I will do that also this

258
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,270
it pretty much I will do that also this
 

259
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,320
it pretty much I will do that also this
is a good like path to take because

260
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,330
is a good like path to take because
 

261
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,380
is a good like path to take because
there's a skeleton firm right over here

262
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,390
there's a skeleton firm right over here
 

263
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,480
there's a skeleton firm right over here
I've been wanting to set up like just

264
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,490
I've been wanting to set up like just
 

265
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,480
I've been wanting to set up like just
over here so we could have that in the

266
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,490
over here so we could have that in the
 

267
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,750
over here so we could have that in the
hallway to the rights like over here

268
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:55,760
hallway to the rights like over here
 

269
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,050
hallway to the rights like over here
somewhere I've also been considering

270
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,060
somewhere I've also been considering
 

271
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,720
somewhere I've also been considering
making a mob farm to the left here but

272
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:01,730
making a mob farm to the left here but
 

273
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,960
making a mob farm to the left here but
I'm not sure if I want to do that or not

274
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:03,970
I'm not sure if I want to do that or not
 

275
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,910
I'm not sure if I want to do that or not
but I'm going to

276
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:05,920
but I'm going to
 

277
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,260
but I'm going to
clearing out some space here maybe put

278
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,270
clearing out some space here maybe put
 

279
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:16,230
clearing out some space here maybe put
some grass down yeah yeah yellow grass

280
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
some grass down yeah yeah yellow grass
 

281
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,810
some grass down yeah yeah yellow grass
yellow grass why does there have to be

282
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:19,820
yellow grass why does there have to be
 

283
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,280
yellow grass why does there have to be
desert here that's no good guys we can't

284
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,290
desert here that's no good guys we can't
 

285
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,200
desert here that's no good guys we can't
do this I don't like yellow grass like

286
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,210
do this I don't like yellow grass like
 

287
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:33,490
do this I don't like yellow grass like
this we need a new plan new plan I've

288
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:33,500
this we need a new plan new plan I've
 

289
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,670
this we need a new plan new plan I've
been considering actually wait a minute

290
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
been considering actually wait a minute
 

291
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,250
been considering actually wait a minute
here's the thing I have yellow grass

292
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,260
here's the thing I have yellow grass
 

293
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,120
here's the thing I have yellow grass
here as well which I do not like at all

294
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,130
here as well which I do not like at all
 

295
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,740
here as well which I do not like at all
I've been considering changing this out

296
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:44,750
I've been considering changing this out
 

297
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,470
I've been considering changing this out
with mycelium which would go pretty nice

298
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:47,480
with mycelium which would go pretty nice
 

299
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,630
with mycelium which would go pretty nice
because it's bluish and we have a

300
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:49,640
because it's bluish and we have a
 

301
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,360
because it's bluish and we have a
blueish floor here as well so I think it

302
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,370
blueish floor here as well so I think it
 

303
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,950
blueish floor here as well so I think it
would transition really well

304
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:53,960
would transition really well
 

305
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,550
would transition really well
a problem is I don't have any much you

306
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,560
a problem is I don't have any much you
 

307
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,250
a problem is I don't have any much you
know I haven't found it yet in my world

308
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:00,260
know I haven't found it yet in my world
 

309
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,280
know I haven't found it yet in my world
here I haven't really looked well I've

310
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,290
here I haven't really looked well I've
 

311
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,860
here I haven't really looked well I've
looked a little bit not I never checked

312
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:05,870
looked a little bit not I never checked
 

313
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,060
looked a little bit not I never checked
the oceans and that's where you got to

314
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,070
the oceans and that's where you got to
 

315
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,700
the oceans and that's where you got to
find it as a problem change this out

316
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:12,710
find it as a problem change this out
 

317
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,890
find it as a problem change this out
with my ceiling maybe even glass make a

318
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:14,900
with my ceiling maybe even glass make a
 

319
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,490
with my ceiling maybe even glass make a
cool glass bridge I haven't really built

320

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:32,900
all shaped pretty much so here we have
 

639
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,919
all shaped pretty much so here we have
it lots of digging lots and lots of

640
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:35,929
it lots of digging lots and lots of
 

641
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,490
it lots of digging lots and lots of
digging but it's all done so now we got

642
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:39,500
digging but it's all done so now we got
 

643
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,020
digging but it's all done so now we got
to decide how we're gonna dress it up

644
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,030
to decide how we're gonna dress it up
 

645
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,700
to decide how we're gonna dress it up
because it looks pretty plain just like

646
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:42,710
because it looks pretty plain just like
 

647
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,690
because it looks pretty plain just like
this it's also kind of dark too so I'm

648
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:46,700
this it's also kind of dark too so I'm
 

649
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,630
this it's also kind of dark too so I'm
not entirely sure how I want to do it I

650
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:49,640
not entirely sure how I want to do it I
 

651
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,610
not entirely sure how I want to do it I
don't never see used I think use stone

652
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:51,620
don't never see used I think use stone
 

653
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,230
don't never see used I think use stone
brick a lot for the like the decorative

654
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
brick a lot for the like the decorative
 

655
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,090
brick a lot for the like the decorative
features I want to keep the walls stone

656
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,100
features I want to keep the walls stone
 

657
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,490
features I want to keep the walls stone
I think to match the cave feel I got

658
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:03,500
I think to match the cave feel I got
 

659
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,299
I think to match the cave feel I got
going on so ideally I would like a

660
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:07,309
going on so ideally I would like a
 

661
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,820
going on so ideally I would like a
different color of something for like

662
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:09,830
different color of something for like
 

663
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,970
different color of something for like
the beams and pillars and stuff

664
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:12,980
the beams and pillars and stuff
 

665
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,180
the beams and pillars and stuff
I mean cobble I don't know I know if I

666
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,190
I mean cobble I don't know I know if I
 

667
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,890
I mean cobble I don't know I know if I
want to use a cobble I did bring some

668
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:20,900
want to use a cobble I did bring some
 

669
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,910
want to use a cobble I did bring some
some mossy here I'm not sure he's got

670
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:24,920
some mossy here I'm not sure he's got
 

671
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,400
some mossy here I'm not sure he's got
green in it but yeah I don't know I

672
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,410
green in it but yeah I don't know I
 

673
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,710
green in it but yeah I don't know I
think we might go with a courts theme or

674
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
think we might go with a courts theme or
 

675
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,310
think we might go with a courts theme or
some kind of wood acacia would have the

676
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
some kind of wood acacia would have the
 

677
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,570
some kind of wood acacia would have the
most color if we use planks but the

678
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:40,580
most color if we use planks but the
 

679
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,940
most color if we use planks but the
shape never stood when he did is

680
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:42,950
shape never stood when he did is
 

681
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,160
shape never stood when he did is
originally it was like he had these

682
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,170
originally it was like he had these
 

683
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,630
originally it was like he had these
beams going like this and then every

684
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:49,640
beams going like this and then every
 

685
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,630
beams going like this and then every
three blocks do it again and then in

686
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:55,640
three blocks do it again and then in
 

687
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,669
three blocks do it again and then in
between have water flowing down and

688
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
between have water flowing down and
 

689
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,010
between have water flowing down and
it'll flow down to a big pool of water

690
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,020
it'll flow down to a big pool of water
 

691
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,510
it'll flow down to a big pool of water
here I think I'm gonna have the water

692
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
here I think I'm gonna have the water
 

693
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,100
here I think I'm gonna have the water
start at this level here this I was just

694
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,110
start at this level here this I was just
 

695
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,730
start at this level here this I was just
messing with see what the leaves look

696
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:09,740
messing with see what the leaves look
 

697
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,770
messing with see what the leaves look
like in in the desert biome see if we

698
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:11,780
like in in the desert biome see if we
 

699
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,480
like in in the desert biome see if we
want to use leaves when we're when we're

700
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,490
want to use leaves when we're when we're
 

701
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,049
want to use leaves when we're when we're
dressing this up and this is I think oak

702
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,059
dressing this up and this is I think oak
 

703
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,130
dressing this up and this is I think oak
leaves

704
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,140
leaves
 

705
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,890
leaves
far2 yellow this is dark oak leaves I

706
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:20,900
far2 yellow this is dark oak leaves I
 

707
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,690
far2 yellow this is dark oak leaves I
was curious maybe they wouldn't be

708
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:22,700
was curious maybe they wouldn't be
 

709
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,300
was curious maybe they wouldn't be
affected by the biome but they are

710
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,310
affected by the biome but they are
 

711
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,460
affected by the biome but they are
unfortunately and surprisingly birch

712
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:27,470
unfortunately and surprisingly birch
 

713
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,690
unfortunately and surprisingly birch
leaves are more green than oak leaves in

714
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:31,700
leaves are more green than oak leaves in
 

715
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,970
leaves are more green than oak leaves in
deserts which it's usually vice versa

716
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:33,980
deserts which it's usually vice versa
 

717
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,260
deserts which it's usually vice versa
normally a spruce looks pretty good

718
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,270
normally a spruce looks pretty good
 

719
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,460
normally a spruce looks pretty good
jungle kind of yellow so I don't know if

720
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:42,470
jungle kind of yellow so I don't know if
 

721
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,780
jungle kind of yellow so I don't know if
we're gonna use leaves in here I'm also

722
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:43,790
we're gonna use leaves in here I'm also
 

723
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,310
we're gonna use leaves in here I'm also
not sure if I want to keep this blue

724
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,320
not sure if I want to keep this blue
 

725
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,830
not sure if I want to keep this blue
glass I think I think I might work on

726
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:50,840
glass I think I think I might work on
 

727
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,100
glass I think I think I might work on
this some more another day though let's

728
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,110
this some more another day though let's
 

729
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,810
this some more another day though let's
see that's pretty good I might move

730
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:57,820
see that's pretty good I might move
 

731
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,970
see that's pretty good I might move
these over one more block so we'd have

732
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:00,980
these over one more block so we'd have
 

733
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,100
these over one more block so we'd have
two beams this path is centered in the

734
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,110
two beams this path is centered in the
 

735
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,960
two beams this path is centered in the
middle so there would be two more of

736
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:04,970
middle so there would be two more of
 

737
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,130
middle so there would be two more of
those over there and basically have it

738
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,140
those over there and basically have it
 

739
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:15,880
those over there and basically have it
go like this have I think stairs like

740
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:15,890
go like this have I think stairs like
 

741
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,520
go like this have I think stairs like
that going all the way to the water and

742
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:18,530
that going all the way to the water and
 

743
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:24,340
that going all the way to the water and
then do that for the top as well so all

744
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:24,350
then do that for the top as well so all
 

745
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,510
then do that for the top as well so all
this would become stairs let's see I

746
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:28,520
this would become stairs let's see I
 

747
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:37,620
this would become stairs let's see I
guess maybe like this

748
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:37,630

 

749
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,200

maybe I'm not sure well not the not the

750
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,210
maybe I'm not sure well not the not the
 

751
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,300
maybe I'm not sure well not the not the
last one that would be a straight beam

752
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,310
last one that would be a straight beam
 

753
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,650
last one that would be a straight beam
like this I know that might be might

754
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:47,660
like this I know that might be might
 

755
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,410
like this I know that might be might
need to make that

756
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:49,420
need to make that
 

757
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,690
need to make that
yeah that's not that's not enough the

758
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:52,700
yeah that's not that's not enough the
 

759
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,850
yeah that's not that's not enough the
other material it'd have to be like a

760
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:54,860
other material it'd have to be like a
 

761
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,150
other material it'd have to be like a
block and then stairs if we wanna do it

762
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,160
block and then stairs if we wanna do it
 

763
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,740
block and then stairs if we wanna do it
like that I think yeah I think that

764
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:02,750
like that I think yeah I think that
 

765
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,200
like that I think yeah I think that
would look better anyway I'm gonna mess

766
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,210
would look better anyway I'm gonna mess
 

767
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,910
would look better anyway I'm gonna mess
that with this some more another day I

768
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:06,920
that with this some more another day I
 

769
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,620
that with this some more another day I
think we should try to do something else

770
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:08,630
think we should try to do something else
 

771
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,190
think we should try to do something else
today

772
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
today
 

773
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,380
today
have a little more variety with what

774
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,390
have a little more variety with what
 

775
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,660
have a little more variety with what
we're doing here uh-oh I guess I've been

776
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:16,670
we're doing here uh-oh I guess I've been
 

777
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,270
we're doing here uh-oh I guess I've been
recording for a while here so we don't

778
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
recording for a while here so we don't
 

779
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,800
recording for a while here so we don't
have a lot of time left today but maybe

780
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:20,810
have a lot of time left today but maybe
 

781
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,790
have a lot of time left today but maybe
just really quick we'll be able to dish

782
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:24,800
just really quick we'll be able to dish
 

783
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,590
just really quick we'll be able to dish
something out

784
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:26,600
something out
 

785
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,590
something out
I said last I think was last episode I

786
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
I said last I think was last episode I
 

787
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,630
I said last I think was last episode I
wanted to make a vine farm so we could

788
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:31,640
wanted to make a vine farm so we could
 

789
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,750
wanted to make a vine farm so we could
attempt to make a really tiny one here

790
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:34,760
attempt to make a really tiny one here
 

791
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,480
attempt to make a really tiny one here
it doesn't we don't need a big vine farm

792
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,490
it doesn't we don't need a big vine farm
 

793
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,320
it doesn't we don't need a big vine farm
or anything like that

794
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,330
or anything like that
 

795
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:47,020
or anything like that

this
 

897
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,500
this
and I might mix up a few blocks here so

898
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:07,510
and I might mix up a few blocks here so
 

899
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,900
and I might mix up a few blocks here so
it's not solid mossy cobblestone either

900
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:11,910
it's not solid mossy cobblestone either
 

901

see going down there and we'll change
 

903
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,990
see going down there and we'll change
this out with planks hopefully I don't

904
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
this out with planks hopefully I don't
 

905
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,790
this out with planks hopefully I don't
open up to achieve anywhere here good I

906
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:26,800
open up to achieve anywhere here good I
 

907
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,770

all the torches out changes to that and

910
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,230
all the torches out changes to that and
 

911
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,290
all the torches out changes to that and
let's maybe put a beam across the top

912
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,300
let's maybe put a beam across the top
 

913
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:45,750
let's maybe put a beam across the top
here to make this oops there you go

914
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
here to make this oops there you go
 

915
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,710
here to make this oops there you go
I gotta make a treat those Chapa in my

916
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:49,720
I gotta make a treat those Chapa in my
 

917
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,310
I gotta make a treat those Chapa in my
single-player here okay well it's

918
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
single-player here okay well it's
 

919
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,260
single-player here okay well it's
something so yeah basically let's let's

920
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,270
something so yeah basically let's let's
 

921
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,750
something so yeah basically let's let's
see how well this works I'm guessing a

922
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
see how well this works I'm guessing a
 

923
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,430
see how well this works I'm guessing a
few of them won't fall in the water

924
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
few of them won't fall in the water
 

925
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,590
few of them won't fall in the water
they'll land on the side but then I can

926
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
they'll land on the side but then I can
 

927
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,320
they'll land on the side but then I can
just throw them in the water although

928
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,330
just throw them in the water although
 

929
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,880
just throw them in the water although
I'll probably want to keep them if I'm

930
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:11,890
I'll probably want to keep them if I'm
 

931
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:19,020
I'll probably want to keep them if I'm
looking for vines I may fell in 3 mm

932
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,030
looking for vines I may fell in 3 mm
 

933
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,910
looking for vines I may fell in 3 mm
about 50%

934
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:20,920
about 50%
 

935
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,220
about 50%
I couldn't make it 2 blocks wide but I

936
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,230
I couldn't make it 2 blocks wide but I
 

937
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,730
I couldn't make it 2 blocks wide but I
don't think it's really worth it

938
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:25,740
don't think it's really worth it
 

939
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:33,680
don't think it's really worth it
so there we go very simple vine farm

940
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:33,690

 

941
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,120

well I think it's that time again guys

942
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,130
well I think it's that time again guys
 

943
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,400
well I think it's that time again guys
we should end our episode here but as

944
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,410
we should end our episode here but as
 

945
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,710
we should end our episode here but as
always before we do let's read our

946
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
always before we do let's read our
 

947
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
always before we do let's read our
comment for today and I thought it'd be

948
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:42,970
comment for today and I thought it'd be
 

949
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,790
comment for today and I thought it'd be
fitting if we read it by the gold

950
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:44,800
fitting if we read it by the gold
 

951
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,919
fitting if we read it by the gold
farming here because it's about the gold

952
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:46,929
