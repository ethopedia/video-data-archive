dig straight up and have sunlight
 

399
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,430
dig straight up and have sunlight
here

400
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440

there okay we got
 

417
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,990
there okay we got
we got the sunlight down

418
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
we got the sunlight down
 

419
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,910
we got the sunlight down
right there moonlight right now

420
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
right there moonlight right now
 

421
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,590
right there moonlight right now
goes there so i think

422
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600

 

423
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,509

if we were to do this

424
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519

 

425
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,630

just like that and put a door on here it

426
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
just like that and put a door on here it
 

427
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,990
just like that and put a door on here it
should be a valid one

428
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
should be a valid one
 

429
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,350
should be a valid one
or valid house right

430
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
or valid house right
 

431
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,990
or valid house right
maybe let's make it just a tad bigger

432
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
maybe let's make it just a tad bigger
 

433
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,910
maybe let's make it just a tad bigger
just want to see if you'll run to it

434
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
just want to see if you'll run to it

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,430
just want to see if you'll run to it
or not that's all we're testing

436
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440

00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360

 

443
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,269

459
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,670
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna try to
expand it

460
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
expand it
 

461
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,509
expand it
just by one block

462
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
just by one block
 

463
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,829
just by one block
shoot and see if that makes a difference

464
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839

 

465
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,509

so we're gonna
 

501
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,269
so we're gonna
try something else here we're gonna

502
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
try something else here we're gonna
 

503
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,310

507
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,790
this is where things get fun i hope
uh we're gonna have a pressure plate

508
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
uh we're gonna have a pressure plate
 

509
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,269
uh we're gonna have a pressure plate
here now

510
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
here now
 

511
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,790
here now

512
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800

 

513
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,030

it's just a very crude test

514
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040

 

515
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,430

528
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
do nothing until i wire it up of course
 

529
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,150

533
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,829

it'd probably work even if i inverted

534
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
it'd probably work even if i inverted
 

535
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:33,030
it'd probably work even if i inverted
this

okay it can't be inverted

540
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
okay it can't be inverted
 

541
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,069

i got another test set up for you let's
try this out

570
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
try this out
 

571
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,990

00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
this
 

579
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,069
this
he'll make water come out and see if

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
he'll make water come out and see if
 

581
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,670
he'll make water come out and see if
he'll swim up

582
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
he'll swim up
 

583
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,750
he'll swim up
and then he should come back down just

584
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
and then he should come back down just
 

585
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,990
and then he should come back down just
want to see if he'll do that

oh they're killing each other okay
i need a water flow

608
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079

 

609
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,629

okay now it should work and it should be

610
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
okay now it should work and it should be
 

611
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,110
okay now it should work and it should be
safe

612
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
safe
 

613
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,269
safe
i think i got the dispenser on the side

614
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
i think i got the dispenser on the side
 

615
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,509
i think i got the dispenser on the side
so when they walk on it it'll pull them

616
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
so when they walk on it it'll pull them
 

617
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,470
so when they walk on it it'll pull them
to this wall and they should swim up

618
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
to this wall and they should swim up
 

619
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,710
to this wall and they should swim up
to the top here the whole point of this

620
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
to the top here the whole point of this
 

621
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,550
to the top here the whole point of this
is just to see if we can control them

622
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
is just to see if we can control them
 

623
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,590
is just to see if we can control them
and depending on how this works we might

624
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
and depending on how this works we might
 

625
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,069
and depending on how this works we might
build their houses using this

626
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079

 

627
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,749

and make them swim up to a higher

628
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
and make them swim up to a higher
 

629
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,749
and make them swim up to a higher
platform or something

630
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
platform or something
 

631
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,389
platform or something
like that

632
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399

 

633
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,069

maybe let's just see how this would look
 

797
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,350
maybe let's just see how this would look
if we switched it to

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
if we switched it to
 

799
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,310
if we switched it to
