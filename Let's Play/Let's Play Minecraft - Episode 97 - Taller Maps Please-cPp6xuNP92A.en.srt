00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
I know what am i doing wasting all those

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,200
I know what am i doing wasting all those
arrows well I can now because the mop

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,210
arrows well I can now because the mop

systems up and running so I've extended

6
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,380
systems up and running so I've extended
 

7
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,219
systems up and running so I've extended
it it's now four layers stacked on top

8
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:22,229
it it's now four layers stacked on top
 

9
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,760
it it's now four layers stacked on top
of each other each layer has four pads

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:25,770
of each other each layer has four pads
 

11
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,679
of each other each layer has four pads
each pad is 32 blocks of spawning space

12
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:29,689
each pad is 32 blocks of spawning space
 

13
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,160
each pad is 32 blocks of spawning space
that comes to a total of 32 times 4

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,170
that comes to a total of 32 times 4
 

15
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,510
that comes to a total of 32 times 4
times 4 512 spawning spots inside that

16
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,520
times 4 512 spawning spots inside that
 

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,670
times 4 512 spawning spots inside that
giant cube like box so how does it

18
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
giant cube like box so how does it
 

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,910
giant cube like box so how does it
perform ah so-so

20
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:52,920
perform ah so-so
 

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,550

if you look at your entity thing at the

22
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,560
if you look at your entity thing at the
 

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,250
if you look at your entity thing at the
top over here the first number tells you

24
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:01,260
top over here the first number tells you
 

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,550
top over here the first number tells you
how many entities you're looking at so a

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
how many entities you're looking at so a
 

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,609
how many entities you're looking at so a
mob counts as an entity and I am only

28
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:07,619
mob counts as an entity and I am only
 

29
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,340
mob counts as an entity and I am only
looking at 16 15 14 13 inside of this

30
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,350
looking at 16 15 14 13 inside of this
 

31
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,390
looking at 16 15 14 13 inside of this
cube so could be better but actually

32
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
cube so could be better but actually
 

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
cube so could be better but actually
this rate right now is probably better

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:21,930
this rate right now is probably better
 

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,199
this rate right now is probably better
than my old mob system so I'm looking

36
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,209
than my old mob system so I'm looking
 

37
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,199
than my old mob system so I'm looking
forward to maxing this thing out I think

38
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,209
forward to maxing this thing out I think
 

39
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:37,040
forward to maxing this thing out I think
it'll be pretty good so it on average

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,050
it'll be pretty good so it on average
 

41
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,080
it'll be pretty good so it on average
I'd say it does about 20 to 30 mobs

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,090
I'd say it does about 20 to 30 mobs
 

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,850
I'd say it does about 20 to 30 mobs
right now it's a little slower for some

44
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:40,860
right now it's a little slower for some
 

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,120
right now it's a little slower for some
reason probably have slimes down below

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,130
reason probably have slimes down below
 

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:51,280
reason probably have slimes down below
again so the mob limits is I believe 79

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,290
again so the mob limits is I believe 79
 

49
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,290
again so the mob limits is I believe 79
that means we can make this thing about

50
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:54,300
that means we can make this thing about
 

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,550
that means we can make this thing about
4 times faster at max capacity using

52
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
4 times faster at max capacity using
 

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
4 times faster at max capacity using
this design up in the sky so should be

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,450
this design up in the sky so should be
 

55
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:16,670
this design up in the sky so should be
pretty cool when I get master

56
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:16,680

 

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,850

yeah but lots and lots of resources to

58
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:19,860
yeah but lots and lots of resources to
 

59
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,660
yeah but lots and lots of resources to
build it that's kind of why I recommend

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:22,670
build it that's kind of why I recommend
 

61
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,289
build it that's kind of why I recommend
that original style just because it

62
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:27,299
that original style just because it
 

63
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,270
that original style just because it
requires so many resources to build it

64
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
requires so many resources to build it
 

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,080
requires so many resources to build it
in the sky like this I've used I think 2

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,090
in the sky like this I've used I think 2
 

67
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,130
in the sky like this I've used I think 2
or 2 but 2 double chests cobblestone I

68
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,140
or 2 but 2 double chests cobblestone I
 

69
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,009
or 2 but 2 double chests cobblestone I
think to build this thing four layers

70
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:40,019
think to build this thing four layers
 

71
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,470
think to build this thing four layers
only and I need to make it I think two

72
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
only and I need to make it I think two
 

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,580
only and I need to make it I think two
or three times larger yet I believe is

74
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:46,590
or three times larger yet I believe is
 

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,330
or three times larger yet I believe is
what I'm going to do so it's a lot

76
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,340
what I'm going to do so it's a lot
 

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,830
what I'm going to do so it's a lot
easier to build them underground it's

78
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
easier to build them underground it's
 

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,310
easier to build them underground it's
faster build them underground

80
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:54,320
faster build them underground
 

81
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,680
faster build them underground
and you gain resources building them

82
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:57,690
and you gain resources building them
 

83
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,860
and you gain resources building them
underground and they don't make giant

84
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:00,870
underground and they don't make giant
 

85
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,660
underground and they don't make giant
cubes in your sky if you build them

86
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:02,670
cubes in your sky if you build them
 

87
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,229
cubes in your sky if you build them
underground

88
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,239
underground
 

89
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,160
underground
so there's advantages to both methods

90
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,170
so there's advantages to both methods
 

91
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:13,960
so there's advantages to both methods
this one obviously more efficient though

92
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:13,970

 

93
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,490

yeah I just checked my slime farm here

94
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,500
yeah I just checked my slime farm here
 

95
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,900
yeah I just checked my slime farm here
and it looks like there's tons of guys

96
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:17,910
and it looks like there's tons of guys
 

97
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,120
and it looks like there's tons of guys
down here again and they were

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,130
down here again and they were
 

99
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,770
down here again and they were
interfering what the numbers I just

100
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:21,780
interfering what the numbers I just
 

101
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,020
interfering what the numbers I just
showed you normally I have I think

102
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,030
showed you normally I have I think
 

103
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,350
showed you normally I have I think
around 30 to 40 mobs spawning in that

104
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
around 30 to 40 mobs spawning in that
 

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,350
around 30 to 40 mobs spawning in that
giant Tower I just built but when I

106
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:30,360
giant Tower I just built but when I
 

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,810
giant Tower I just built but when I
showed you is only about 15 to 20 and so

108
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:35,820
showed you is only about 15 to 20 and so
 

109
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,430
showed you is only about 15 to 20 and so
these guys are taking on mob spots that

110
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
these guys are taking on mob spots that
 

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,469
these guys are taking on mob spots that
could be going to this skeletons

112
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:39,479
could be going to this skeletons
 

113
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,029
could be going to this skeletons
creepers zombies etc you need to get rid

114
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:44,039
creepers zombies etc you need to get rid
 

115
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,880
creepers zombies etc you need to get rid
of these guys the two mob systems kind

116
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:49,890
of these guys the two mob systems kind
 

117
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,589
of these guys the two mob systems kind
of work together the slime one and the

118
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:51,599
of work together the slime one and the
 

119
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,050
of work together the slime one and the
other hostile one if you want a really

120
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,060
other hostile one if you want a really
 

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,670
other hostile one if you want a really
good slime farm you need to constantly

122
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:58,680
good slime farm you need to constantly
 

123
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,339
good slime farm you need to constantly
be killing the other hostile mobs

124
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:01,349
be killing the other hostile mobs
 

125
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,200
be killing the other hostile mobs
because these guys have a slim chance of

126
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,210
because these guys have a slim chance of
 

127
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,690
because these guys have a slim chance of
spawning but if you're killing people

128
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:05,700
spawning but if you're killing people
 

129
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,060
spawning but if you're killing people
and that's quite often then ethic every

130
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,070
and that's quite often then ethic every
 

131
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,890
and that's quite often then ethic every
time a new mob spawns there's a slim

132
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:12,900
time a new mob spawns there's a slim
 

133
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,870
time a new mob spawns there's a slim
chance it will be a slime and you're

134
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
chance it will be a slime and you're
 

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,790
chance it will be a slime and you're
just increasing the number of times that

136
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
just increasing the number of times that
 

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,360
just increasing the number of times that
dice roll occurs so you will get more

138
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,370
dice roll occurs so you will get more
 

139
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,950
dice roll occurs so you will get more
slimes if you're killing other mobs

140
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:21,960
slimes if you're killing other mobs
 

141
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,130
slimes if you're killing other mobs
quickly that's why my slime firms

142
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:25,140
quickly that's why my slime firms
 

143
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,899
quickly that's why my slime firms
filling up so fast now but also if you

144
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:29,909
filling up so fast now but also if you
 

145
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,089
filling up so fast now but also if you
want a good hostile mob system you need

146
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:32,099
want a good hostile mob system you need
 

147
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,580
want a good hostile mob system you need
a slime farm that you can shut off so I

148
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:34,590
a slime farm that you can shut off so I
 

149
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,190
a slime farm that you can shut off so I
need some way of letting my slime pads

150
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,200
need some way of letting my slime pads
 

151
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,350
need some way of letting my slime pads
when I get this thing finished but

152
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
when I get this thing finished but
 

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,399
when I get this thing finished but
otherwise you're going to keep

154
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:40,409
otherwise you're going to keep
 

155
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,620
otherwise you're going to keep
interfering with my numbers like they

156
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:42,630
interfering with my numbers like they
 

157
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,469
interfering with my numbers like they
happen

158
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:47,479

 

159
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,219

hehehe

160
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:51,229

 

161
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,479

yeah there's a lot of slimes down there

162
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:53,489
yeah there's a lot of slimes down there
 

163
00:05:53,489 --> 00:06:00,169
yeah there's a lot of slimes down there
I did a test and I uh after I killed

164
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:00,179
I did a test and I uh after I killed
 

165
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,609
I did a test and I uh after I killed
them I let that run for another minute

166
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:01,619
them I let that run for another minute
 

167
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,289
them I let that run for another minute
or two then I went back down and there's

168
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:03,299
or two then I went back down and there's
 

169
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:05,089
or two then I went back down and there's
about another ten slimes down there so

170
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:05,099
about another ten slimes down there so
 

171
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,699
about another ten slimes down there so
they're definitely spawning quickly with

172
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:07,709
they're definitely spawning quickly with
 

173
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:11,179
they're definitely spawning quickly with
that thing running but I just killed

174
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:11,189
that thing running but I just killed
 

175
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,719
that thing running but I just killed
them all again and now this thing should

176
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:14,729
them all again and now this thing should
 

177
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,159
them all again and now this thing should
be running little bit better course it

178
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:19,169
be running little bit better course it
 

179
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:31,279
be running little bit better course it
is slightly random 17 20 30 - so if

180
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,289
is slightly random 17 20 30 - so if
 

181
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,159
is slightly random 17 20 30 - so if
there's no mobs or no slimes I should

182
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,169
there's no mobs or no slimes I should
 

183
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,889
there's no mobs or no slimes I should
say then this thing will handle about 30

184
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:36,899
say then this thing will handle about 30
 

185
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,100
say then this thing will handle about 30
mobs at a time since the limit is 80 we

186
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,110
mobs at a time since the limit is 80 we
 

187
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,529
mobs at a time since the limit is 80 we
want it up to 80 so this will be 2 to 3

188
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:45,539
want it up to 80 so this will be 2 to 3
 

189
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,389
want it up to 80 so this will be 2 to 3
times faster than it is right now which

190
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:47,399
times faster than it is right now which
 

191
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,329
times faster than it is right now which
would be awesome but to get that we

192
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:50,339
would be awesome but to get that we
 

193
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,999
would be awesome but to get that we
neither we either need to make this

194
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,009
neither we either need to make this
 

195
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,329
neither we either need to make this
bigger I'm thinking either expanding it

196
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:56,339
bigger I'm thinking either expanding it
 

197
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:02,379
bigger I'm thinking either expanding it
or making 2 or 3 of them but before I

198
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:02,389
or making 2 or 3 of them but before I
 

199
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,199
or making 2 or 3 of them but before I
think of doing that I'm going to make a

200
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,209
think of doing that I'm going to make a
 

201
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,609
think of doing that I'm going to make a
strong effort to light up every single

202
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:07,619
strong effort to light up every single
 

203
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:11,299
strong effort to light up every single
cave in the area and those are pretty

204
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:11,309
cave in the area and those are pretty
 

205
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:15,499
cave in the area and those are pretty
easy to find if you use f3 like just

206
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:15,509
easy to find if you use f3 like just
 

207
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,689
easy to find if you use f3 like just
looking at the ground there's two mobs

208
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:17,699
looking at the ground there's two mobs
 

209
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,309
looking at the ground there's two mobs
below me somewhere in caves if you look

210
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
below me somewhere in caves if you look
 

211
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,799
below me somewhere in caves if you look
at the an identity thing at the top left

212
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:24,809
at the an identity thing at the top left
 

213
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:32,600
at the an identity thing at the top left
there 3 mom's 7 mom's 10 mom's so if you

214
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:32,610
there 3 mom's 7 mom's 10 mom's so if you
 

215
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,649
there 3 mom's 7 mom's 10 mom's so if you
wander around your perimeter here try to

216
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:38,659
wander around your perimeter here try to
 

217
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,759
wander around your perimeter here try to
even though you can't see the tags

218
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:40,769
even though you can't see the tags
 

219
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:43,429
even though you can't see the tags
necessarily on the mobs you the game

220
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:43,439
necessarily on the mobs you the game
 

221
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,619
necessarily on the mobs you the game
will pick them up at your entity thing

222
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:45,629
will pick them up at your entity thing
 

223
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:52,399
will pick them up at your entity thing
here so it's kind of like radar to moms

224
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:52,409
here so it's kind of like radar to moms
 

225
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,899
here so it's kind of like radar to moms
it's pretty good 3 4 so I would try to

226
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:56,909
it's pretty good 3 4 so I would try to
 

227
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,789
it's pretty good 3 4 so I would try to
find a high concentration of them and

228
00:07:58,789 --> 00:07:58,799
find a high concentration of them and
 

229
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:02,960
find a high concentration of them and
then then dig down there

230
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:02,970
then then dig down there
 

231
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,000
then then dig down there
I think I saw some actually really close

232
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,010
I think I saw some actually really close
 

233
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,580
I think I saw some actually really close
to the surface here before let's check

234
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:07,590
to the surface here before let's check
 

235
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,040
to the surface here before let's check
if let's check if they're there again

236
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,050
if let's check if they're there again
 

237
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,830
if let's check if they're there again
ten eleven so this is a pretty bad spot

238
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:12,840
ten eleven so this is a pretty bad spot
 

239
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,560
ten eleven so this is a pretty bad spot
near here and right below here I saw

240
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,570
near here and right below here I saw
 

241
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:28,970
near here and right below here I saw
some four five don't really see any

242
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:28,980
some four five don't really see any
 

243
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,029
some four five don't really see any
right now but I know there was some so

244
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:32,039
right now but I know there was some so
 

245
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:40,300
right now but I know there was some so
let's go check it out

246
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,310

 

247
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,400

this is how we did you know shion's yeah

248
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,410
this is how we did you know shion's yeah
 

249
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,640
this is how we did you know shion's yeah
there's there's a bunch over there

250
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:51,650

 

251
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,390

digging down is cool

252
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:58,400

 

253
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,090

Wow there's a big cheat where they're

254
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,100
Wow there's a big cheat where they're
 

255
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,750
Wow there's a big cheat where they're
directly below my base let's go check it

256
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:08,760
directly below my base let's go check it
 

257
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,720
directly below my base let's go check it
out to see what's going on so I got to

258
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:14,730
out to see what's going on so I got to
 

259
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,410
out to see what's going on so I got to
find all these tubes that are hidden

260
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:17,420
find all these tubes that are hidden
 

261
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,170
find all these tubes that are hidden
light them up and then I will get many

262
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,180
light them up and then I will get many
 

263
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:31,280
light them up and then I will get many
more mobs in my mob system iron you can

264
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,290
more mobs in my mob system iron you can
 

265
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:40,670
more mobs in my mob system iron you can
hear them the tedious process though

266
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:40,680
hear them the tedious process though
 

267
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,380
hear them the tedious process though
lighting up all the caves but usually

268
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:42,390
lighting up all the caves but usually
 

269
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,330
lighting up all the caves but usually
when you do it to get tons of resources

270
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:44,340
when you do it to get tons of resources
 

271
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,040
when you do it to get tons of resources
so you know I never just over resource

272
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,050
so you know I never just over resource
 

273
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,390
so you know I never just over resource

277
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,890
always I'm always doing two things at
once I'm I'm lighting up caves and

278
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:54,900
once I'm I'm lighting up caves and
 

279
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,920
once I'm I'm lighting up caves and
getting resources and having fun

280
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:56,930
getting resources and having fun
 

281
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,400
getting resources and having fun
exploring underground so kind of like

282
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,410
exploring underground so kind of like
 

283
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:09,050
exploring underground so kind of like
multitasking I know that's not really

284
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,060
multitasking I know that's not really
 

285
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:18,830
multitasking I know that's not really
what multitasking is whoa

286
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:18,840

 

287
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,480

or anything or food so might be
switching to peaceful here wasn't really

292
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:27,730
switching to peaceful here wasn't really
 

293
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:44,790
switching to peaceful here wasn't really
planning to go keep stuff creepy they're

294
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
planning to go keep stuff creepy they're
 

295

just watching me oh yeah I'm going to do
 

297
00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:14,610
just watching me oh yeah I'm going to do
it ah dang so yes is not a huge key but

298
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:14,620
it ah dang so yes is not a huge key but
 

299
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,290

you saw how many moms were in here in

300
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,300
you saw how many moms were in here in
 

301
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,480
you saw how many moms were in here in
such a small cave as you decrease the

302
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:21,490
such a small cave as you decrease the
 

303
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,190
such a small cave as you decrease the
number of spots where they can spawn

304
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
number of spots where they can spawn
 

305
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,680
number of spots where they can spawn
their concentrations will get higher in

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:25,690
their concentrations will get higher in
 

307
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:33,390
their concentrations will get higher in
smaller areas and we can hear there's

308
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,400
smaller areas and we can hear there's
 

309
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,460
smaller areas and we can hear there's
more Teebs near here so let's go check

310
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,470
more Teebs near here so let's go check
 

311
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:46,950
more Teebs near here so let's go check
it out this is a stuff I usually do

312
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:46,960
it out this is a stuff I usually do
 

313
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,690
it out this is a stuff I usually do
off-camera but try something a little

314
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:51,700
off-camera but try something a little
 

315
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,070
off-camera but try something a little
different today just for a brief little

316
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:56,080
different today just for a brief little
 

317
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,920
different today just for a brief little
while

318
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:02,930

 

319
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,930

another small cave nothing major

320
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:05,940
another small cave nothing major
 

321
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,850
another small cave nothing major
probably would never find it without

322
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:07,860
probably would never find it without
 

323
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,710
probably would never find it without
using f3 I'm worried that feature soon

324
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
using f3 I'm worried that feature soon
 

325
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:32,210
using f3 I'm worried that feature soon
be gone soon I use it a lot you so light

326
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:32,220
be gone soon I use it a lot you so light
 

327
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,010
be gone soon I use it a lot you so light
up the caves don't be stingy with the

328
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,020
up the caves don't be stingy with the
 

329
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,860
up the caves don't be stingy with the
torches or you'll regret it later make

330
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:36,870
torches or you'll regret it later make
 

331
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:47,060
torches or you'll regret it later make
sure you have it light enough run

332
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,070
sure you have it light enough run
 

333
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,440
sure you have it light enough run
through here at pretty small cave and I

334
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,450
through here at pretty small cave and I
 

335
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,330
through here at pretty small cave and I
can see there's four more mobs down

336
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:53,340
can see there's four more mobs down
 

337
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,240
can see there's four more mobs down
there very close and I think I saw some

338
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,250
there very close and I think I saw some
 

339
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,470
there very close and I think I saw some
more somewhere over there so I'll do a

340
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
more somewhere over there so I'll do a
 

341
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,060
more somewhere over there so I'll do a
little bit lighting here and I will meet

342
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,070
little bit lighting here and I will meet
 

343
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,010
little bit lighting here and I will meet
you back at the surface and just a

344
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,020
you back at the surface and just a
 

345
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:10,310
you back at the surface and just a
little sec a little while okay so we're

346
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
little sec a little while okay so we're
 

347
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,260
little sec a little while okay so we're
back up here I thought it'd be good to

348
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,270
back up here I thought it'd be good to
 

349
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,470
back up here I thought it'd be good to
take you up to the tower up close and

350
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:15,480
take you up to the tower up close and
 

351
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,120
take you up to the tower up close and
personal

352
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,130
personal
 

353
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,710
personal
I'll show you a little problem I have

354
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
I'll show you a little problem I have
 

355
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:28,580
I'll show you a little problem I have
now pretty big Tower yes here we are

356
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:28,590
now pretty big Tower yes here we are
 

357
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,080
now pretty big Tower yes here we are
this is the top this is how you can get

358
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,090
this is the top this is how you can get
 

359
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,120
this is the top this is how you can get
down so maybe I'll point out one thing

360
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,130
down so maybe I'll point out one thing
 

361
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,020
down so maybe I'll point out one thing
first a lot of people were concerned

362
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,030
first a lot of people were concerned
 

363
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,880
first a lot of people were concerned
that mobs are going to walk into these

364
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:43,890
that mobs are going to walk into these
 

365
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,490
that mobs are going to walk into these
water columns and then drown or get

366
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:46,500
water columns and then drown or get
 

367
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,210
water columns and then drown or get
stuck or something doesn't happen these

368
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,220
stuck or something doesn't happen these
 

369
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,120
stuck or something doesn't happen these
are considered drops so mobs don't walk

370
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,130
are considered drops so mobs don't walk
 

371
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,460
are considered drops so mobs don't walk
off these things unless they're pushed

372
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,470
off these things unless they're pushed
 

373
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,700
off these things unless they're pushed
and even if they are it happens very

374
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:58,710
and even if they are it happens very
 

375
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,850
and even if they are it happens very
rare and they drown if it does happen I

376
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:01,860
rare and they drown if it does happen I
 

377
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,230
rare and they drown if it does happen I
haven't really I think only saw it

378
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,240
haven't really I think only saw it
 

379
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,650
haven't really I think only saw it
happen once

380
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:05,660
happen once
 

381
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,360
happen once
it's very rare it's not a problem so

382
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,370
it's very rare it's not a problem so
 

383
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,200
it's very rare it's not a problem so
don't worry about that we're at the top

384
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,210
don't worry about that we're at the top
 

385
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,790
don't worry about that we're at the top
here we're at y-coordinate 124 basically

386
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
here we're at y-coordinate 124 basically
 

387
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,220
here we're at y-coordinate 124 basically
the top of the world and that presents

388
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,230
the top of the world and that presents
 

389
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,060
the top of the world and that presents
my next problem

390
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,070
my next problem
 

391
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,860
my next problem
this final layer I put on is pretty

392
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:26,870
this final layer I put on is pretty
 

393
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,230
this final layer I put on is pretty
close to the top we only have one two

394
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,240
close to the top we only have one two
 

395
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,950
close to the top we only have one two
three four can we place four blocks down

396
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:32,960
three four can we place four blocks down
 

397
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,860
three four can we place four blocks down
yet before we reach the top of the map

398
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:35,870
yet before we reach the top of the map
 

399
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,650
yet before we reach the top of the map
and I need to build my spider shut off

400
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:41,660
and I need to build my spider shut off
 

401
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,930
and I need to build my spider shut off
thing using water and also my lighting

402
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:46,940
thing using water and also my lighting
 

403
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,620
thing using water and also my lighting
system using lava so I got to get water

404
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:50,630
system using lava so I got to get water
 

405
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,320
system using lava so I got to get water
and labo down these oops these four

406
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,330
and labo down these oops these four
 

407
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,890
and labo down these oops these four
holes here and that's a real challenge

408
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:56,900
holes here and that's a real challenge
 

409
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,660
holes here and that's a real challenge
because we're at the top of the map and

410
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:58,670
because we're at the top of the map and
 

411
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:05,100
because we're at the top of the map and
we have pretty much no working room so

412
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,110

 

413
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,440

yeah I'm a little not really sure what

414
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,450
yeah I'm a little not really sure what
 

415
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,760
yeah I'm a little not really sure what
to do so if I dump water here it'll go

416
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:12,770
to do so if I dump water here it'll go
 

417
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:18,070
to do so if I dump water here it'll go
to three of the holes that's the thing I

418
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,080
to three of the holes that's the thing I
 

419
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,200
to three of the holes that's the thing I
kind of need to put another layer on the

420
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,210
kind of need to put another layer on the
 

421
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:26,970
kind of need to put another layer on the
top so light doesn't get down in and

422
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:26,980
top so light doesn't get down in and
 

423
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,870
top so light doesn't get down in and
interfere because if this isn't covered

424
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:31,880
interfere because if this isn't covered
 

425
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,760
interfere because if this isn't covered
directly above these holes light will

426
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:33,770
directly above these holes light will
 

427
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,530
directly above these holes light will
get down here and then they'll light up

428
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:35,540
get down here and then they'll light up
 

429
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,750
get down here and then they'll light up
the the pads and it will we won't be

430
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:40,760
the the pads and it will we won't be
 

431
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,310
the the pads and it will we won't be
able to shut we won't be able to make it

432
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
able to shut we won't be able to make it
 

433
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,410
able to shut we won't be able to make it
completely dark down there so kind of

434
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:46,420
completely dark down there so kind of
 

435
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,630
completely dark down there so kind of
kind of troubling the other thing is if

436
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:49,640
kind of troubling the other thing is if
 

437
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,560
kind of troubling the other thing is if
I pour lava in there I brought some lava

438
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:53,570
I pour lava in there I brought some lava
 

439
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,900
I pour lava in there I brought some lava
I have that problem where it won't

440
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:55,910
I have that problem where it won't
 

441
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:06,020
I have that problem where it won't
disappear takes forever

442
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,030

 

443
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,710

because it goes horizontally like that

444
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
because it goes horizontally like that
 

445
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:18,680
because it goes horizontally like that
and now if I remove it this this lava

446
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:18,690

 

447
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,570

pile here won't disappear for a long

448
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:21,580
pile here won't disappear for a long
 

449
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,540
pile here won't disappear for a long
time so it is a problem after all so I

450
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:24,550
time so it is a problem after all so I
 

451
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,920
time so it is a problem after all so I
need to figure something out here

452
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:30,930

 

453
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,380

the main annoyance I have with this

454
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,390
the main annoyance I have with this
 

455
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,530
the main annoyance I have with this
design is it's based off of even numbers

456
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:37,540
design is it's based off of even numbers
 

457
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,610
design is it's based off of even numbers
so I put water here it only flows to one

458
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:41,620
so I put water here it only flows to one
 

459
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,470
so I put water here it only flows to one
hole same here so there's no real good

460
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
hole same here so there's no real good
 

461
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,440
hole same here so there's no real good
trick to making it go to all four holes

462
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,450
trick to making it go to all four holes
 

463
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,270
trick to making it go to all four holes
since it's an even number but if it

464
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:54,280
since it's an even number but if it
 

465
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,180
since it's an even number but if it
would like this is a base for thing here

466
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,190
would like this is a base for thing here
 

467
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,740
would like this is a base for thing here
if it was base five I could just put in

468
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:58,750
if it was base five I could just put in
 

469
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,840
if it was base five I could just put in
the center and it would go to all four

470
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:00,850
the center and it would go to all four
 

471
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,760
the center and it would go to all four
holes no problem hmm so I don't know

472
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:05,770
holes no problem hmm so I don't know
 

473
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,560
holes no problem hmm so I don't know
what to do I've just been messing around

474
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:10,570
what to do I've just been messing around
 

475
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,900
what to do I've just been messing around
with a few ideas this one is a

476
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:12,910
with a few ideas this one is a
 

477
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,020
with a few ideas this one is a
possibility it's not perfect it is

478
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,030
possibility it's not perfect it is
 

479
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,240
possibility it's not perfect it is
within one to three blocks like I need

480
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,250
within one to three blocks like I need
 

481
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,240
within one to three blocks like I need
it to be if I flick the sleeper here

482
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,250
it to be if I flick the sleeper here
 

483
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,720
it to be if I flick the sleeper here
water will go to three of the holes and

484
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:29,730
water will go to three of the holes and
 

485
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,680
water will go to three of the holes and
then this one here would cause Labbit to

486
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:34,690
then this one here would cause Labbit to
 

487
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:42,690
then this one here would cause Labbit to
go to the other three like that the only

488
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:42,700
go to the other three like that the only
 

489
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,320
go to the other three like that the only
problem of course is lava takes oops

490
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,330
problem of course is lava takes oops
 

491
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,050
problem of course is lava takes oops
let's well there's two problems that's

492
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,060
let's well there's two problems that's
 

493
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,050
let's well there's two problems that's
another problem can't have them both

494
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,060
another problem can't have them both
 

495
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,470
another problem can't have them both
going at the same time or you'll produce

496
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:55,480
going at the same time or you'll produce
 

497
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,900
going at the same time or you'll produce
cobblestone the other problem is the

498
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:57,910
cobblestone the other problem is the
 

499
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:05,340
cobblestone the other problem is the
lava takes a while to disappear

500
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:05,350

 

501
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,110

so I don't know I'm trying to avoid

502
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,120
so I don't know I'm trying to avoid
 

503
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,330
so I don't know I'm trying to avoid
having to use two pistons for each hole

504
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:12,340

 

505
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:20,110

but it might not be possible at two

506
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,120
but it might not be possible at two
 

507
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,060
but it might not be possible at two
piston per whole idea would probably

508
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,070
piston per whole idea would probably
 

509
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,730
piston per whole idea would probably
work something like this have water and

510
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:24,740
work something like this have water and
 

511
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,980
work something like this have water and
lava piston fuel down water goes down

512
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:29,990
lava piston fuel down water goes down
 

513
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,700
lava piston fuel down water goes down
the hole switch it off

514
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:33,710
the hole switch it off
 

515
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:42,850
the hole switch it off
lap it goes down but again the problem

516
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:42,860
lap it goes down but again the problem
 

517
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,769
lap it goes down but again the problem
is there would be a lot of wiring there

518
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:44,779
is there would be a lot of wiring there
 

519
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:47,799
is there would be a lot of wiring there
would be a lot of Pistons kind of sucked

520
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:47,809
would be a lot of Pistons kind of sucked
 

521
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:52,600
would be a lot of Pistons kind of sucked
the build and you probably have the

522
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:52,610
the build and you probably have the
 

523
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,310
the build and you probably have the
issue where they both can't be on at the

524
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
issue where they both can't be on at the
 

525
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:05,169
issue where they both can't be on at the
same time lap is on and you got a

526
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:05,179
same time lap is on and you got a
 

527
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:10,899
same time lap is on and you got a
cobblestone generator so yeah not the

528
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:10,909
cobblestone generator so yeah not the
 

529
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:11,470
cobblestone generator so yeah not the
best idea

530
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:11,480
best idea
 

531
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,440
best idea
oh man I was just about to give up on

532
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,450
oh man I was just about to give up on
 

533
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,549
oh man I was just about to give up on
the idea of having a lighting system I

534
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
the idea of having a lighting system I
 

535
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,169
the idea of having a lighting system I
decided to give it one more shot and I

536
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:23,179
decided to give it one more shot and I
 

537
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,080
decided to give it one more shot and I
found something that works really well

538
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,090
found something that works really well
 

539
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,070
found something that works really well
and does everything I wanted to it's

540
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
and does everything I wanted to it's
 

541
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,580
and does everything I wanted to it's
still within the three block height

542
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:32,590
still within the three block height
 

543
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,260
still within the three block height
boundary I'm limited limited to here it

544
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,270
boundary I'm limited limited to here it
 

545
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,830
boundary I'm limited limited to here it
has a spider option and a lighting

546
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
has a spider option and a lighting
 

547
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,360
has a spider option and a lighting
option and uses only two Pistons per 4

548
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,370
option and uses only two Pistons per 4
 

549
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,190
option and uses only two Pistons per 4
holes so it's pretty good let's check it

550
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
holes so it's pretty good let's check it
 

551
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:00,530
holes so it's pretty good let's check it
out first of all water water is in there

552
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:00,540

 

553
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,430

and this is how it flows down goes to

554
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440
and this is how it flows down goes to
 

555
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,090
and this is how it flows down goes to
that hole this one and this one and this

556
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,100
that hole this one and this one and this
 

557
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:16,270
that hole this one and this one and this
one so all four it's really good now

558
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:16,280

 

559
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,630

shuts off quick

560
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,640

 

561
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,170

see disappearing down there and we have

562
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,180
see disappearing down there and we have
 

563
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,790
see disappearing down there and we have
the lighting option there's labid

564
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:28,800
the lighting option there's labid
 

565
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,850
the lighting option there's labid
directly above so it flows down only one

566
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:31,860
directly above so it flows down only one
 

567
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,140
directly above so it flows down only one
hole it's a vertical column so it will

568
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,150
hole it's a vertical column so it will
 

569
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:44,620
hole it's a vertical column so it will
disappear quickly when we shut it off

570
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:44,630

 

571
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,810

and here's the real beauty since it's a

572
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:47,820
and here's the real beauty since it's a
 

573
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,020
and here's the real beauty since it's a
vertical thing it'll cut through water

574
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,030
vertical thing it'll cut through water
 

575
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,490
vertical thing it'll cut through water
so if we turn it on when the water is

576
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:55,500
so if we turn it on when the water is
 

577
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:08,030
so if we turn it on when the water is
still on doesn't matter

578
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,040

 

579
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:14,540

coming down pretty cool now there is one

580
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:14,550
coming down pretty cool now there is one
 

581
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,770
coming down pretty cool now there is one
slight problem with this still the very

582
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:18,780
slight problem with this still the very
 

583
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,400
slight problem with this still the very
slight problem if we have lava here then

584
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,410
slight problem if we have lava here then
 

585
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,200
slight problem if we have lava here then
it doesn't fully light up one of these

586
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,210
it doesn't fully light up one of these
 

587
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,660
it doesn't fully light up one of these
pads because this is light level 15

588
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:29,670
pads because this is light level 15
 

589
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:35,330
pads because this is light level 15
there 13 11 9 and 7 in the very corner

590
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,340
there 13 11 9 and 7 in the very corner
 

591
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,600
there 13 11 9 and 7 in the very corner
one mobs can spawn on light level 7 even

592
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,610
one mobs can spawn on light level 7 even
 

593
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,600
one mobs can spawn on light level 7 even
though it's not common the darker it is

594
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:41,610
though it's not common the darker it is
 

595
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,780
though it's not common the darker it is
the more likely there to spawn it is

596
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:44,790
the more likely there to spawn it is
 

597
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,980
the more likely there to spawn it is
possible though so I don't know I don't

598
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:48,990
possible though so I don't know I don't
 

599
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,480
possible though so I don't know I don't
think it's going to be a big enough

600
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,490
think it's going to be a big enough
 

601
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,190
think it's going to be a big enough
issue that it concerns me I think it'll

602
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
issue that it concerns me I think it'll
 

603
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,280
issue that it concerns me I think it'll
be ok even though it is possible for

604
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,290
be ok even though it is possible for
 

605
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,840
be ok even though it is possible for
them to spawn still it would be

606
00:21:59,840 --> 00:21:59,850
them to spawn still it would be
 

607
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,220
them to spawn still it would be
extremely rare I hope because there's

608
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,230
extremely rare I hope because there's
 

609
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,300
extremely rare I hope because there's
only 4 blocks per layer four layers 16

610
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,310
only 4 blocks per layer four layers 16
 

611
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,010
only 4 blocks per layer four layers 16
16 blocks will be at light level 7 in

612
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,020
16 blocks will be at light level 7 in
 

613
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:19,190
16 blocks will be at light level 7 in
this whole thing and the water kind of

614
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
this whole thing and the water kind of
 

615
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:28,960
this whole thing and the water kind of
waits for the Labbit to disappear

616
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:28,970

 

617
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,820

kind of interesting how water does this

618
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:30,830
kind of interesting how water does this
 

619
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,099
kind of interesting how water does this
it doesn't spill out all over the place

620
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:33,109
it doesn't spill out all over the place
 

621
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:37,649
it doesn't spill out all over the place
it stays in a column that's kind of cool

622
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:37,659
it stays in a column that's kind of cool
 

623
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:40,589
it stays in a column that's kind of cool
so I think this is what I'm going to do

624
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:40,599
so I think this is what I'm going to do
 

625
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,839
so I think this is what I'm going to do
it's the best way but please if you have

626
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:43,849
it's the best way but please if you have
 

627
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,639
it's the best way but please if you have
a better idea send me a video response

628
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:45,649
a better idea send me a video response
 

629
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:48,999
a better idea send me a video response
or something and I will maybe use your

630
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:49,009
or something and I will maybe use your
 

631
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:51,339
or something and I will maybe use your
ID instead because this one's not

632
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:51,349
ID instead because this one's not
 

633
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:53,889
ID instead because this one's not
perfect it's the best one I found but

634
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:53,899
perfect it's the best one I found but
 

635
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:59,080
perfect it's the best one I found but
it's not perfect I just made one more

636
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,090
it's not perfect I just made one more
 

637
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,639
it's not perfect I just made one more
refinement to it too

638
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:00,649
refinement to it too
 

639
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,759
refinement to it too
I was using a regular piston before then

640
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:03,769
I was using a regular piston before then
 

641
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,560
I was using a regular piston before then
I realized that the lava the light from

642
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,570
I realized that the lava the light from
 

643
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,589
I realized that the lava the light from
lava above could reach down to the

644
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:08,599
lava above could reach down to the
 

645
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,680
lava above could reach down to the
spawning pads below so now I'm using a

646
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:11,690
spawning pads below so now I'm using a
 

647
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,560
spawning pads below so now I'm using a
sticky piston with a solid block under

648
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:14,570
sticky piston with a solid block under
 

649
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,789
sticky piston with a solid block under
the lava so it will be completely dark

650
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:17,799
the lava so it will be completely dark
 

651
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,320
the lava so it will be completely dark
in here

652
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,330
in here
 

653
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,509
in here
I will probably fill this room with half

654
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:22,519
I will probably fill this room with half
 

655
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,799
I will probably fill this room with half
slabs or something because otherwise

656
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:25,809
slabs or something because otherwise
 

657
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,419
slabs or something because otherwise
light would be able to go down this hole

658
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:28,429
light would be able to go down this hole
 

659
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,310
light would be able to go down this hole
onto the pads which would cause problems

660
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
onto the pads which would cause problems
 

661
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,609
onto the pads which would cause problems
so this should work and the wiring is

662
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:39,619
so this should work and the wiring is
 

663
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,960
so this should work and the wiring is
going to be super simple for this

664
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:40,970
going to be super simple for this
 

665
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,849
going to be super simple for this
because it's really close together here

666
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:44,859
because it's really close together here
 

667
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,799
because it's really close together here
and I don't think I showed you what the

668
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:47,809
and I don't think I showed you what the
 

669
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:55,089
and I don't think I showed you what the
lab is going any turn water on it still

670
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:55,099
lab is going any turn water on it still
 

671
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,769
lab is going any turn water on it still
tries to go to that hole that lab is

672
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:56,779
tries to go to that hole that lab is
 

673
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:00,999
tries to go to that hole that lab is
going down and it won't it won't flow

674
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:01,009
going down and it won't it won't flow
 

675
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,460
going down and it won't it won't flow
out this way it'll just kind of wait for

676
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,470
out this way it'll just kind of wait for
 

677
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,899
out this way it'll just kind of wait for
the lab ax to disappear and then when it

678
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:07,909
the lab ax to disappear and then when it
 

679
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:11,869
the lab ax to disappear and then when it
does it decides to go so

680
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:11,879
does it decides to go so
 

681
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:15,049
does it decides to go so
pretty cool but again if you have a

682
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:15,059
pretty cool but again if you have a
 

683
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,059
pretty cool but again if you have a
better idea let me know because I'm

684
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:17,069
better idea let me know because I'm
 

685
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:22,639
better idea let me know because I'm
always open for better ideas yep so

686
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:22,649
always open for better ideas yep so
 

687
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:24,469
always open for better ideas yep so
that's the plan this is how I'm going to

688
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:24,479
that's the plan this is how I'm going to
 

689
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,059
that's the plan this is how I'm going to
do it unless someone pitches me

690
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:26,069
do it unless someone pitches me
 

691
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:33,019
do it unless someone pitches me
something better and you can see it goes

692
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:33,029
something better and you can see it goes
 

693
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:45,529
something better and you can see it goes
down to every layer it's cool so now we

694
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:45,539
down to every layer it's cool so now we
 

695
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:50,269
down to every layer it's cool so now we
have one other thing to figure out I'm

696
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:50,279
have one other thing to figure out I'm
 

697
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,819
have one other thing to figure out I'm
pretty sure I have most of the caves lit

698
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:52,829
pretty sure I have most of the caves lit
 

699
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:57,229
pretty sure I have most of the caves lit
up like the majority of it and it's

700
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:57,239
up like the majority of it and it's
 

701
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:59,599
up like the majority of it and it's
still not going to be able to keep up at

702
00:24:59,599 --> 00:24:59,609
still not going to be able to keep up at
 

703
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:02,869
still not going to be able to keep up at
this size so I might need to make two of

704
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:02,879
this size so I might need to make two of
 

705
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:09,739
this size so I might need to make two of
these possibly three and then hook them

706
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:09,749
these possibly three and then hook them
 

707
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:13,549
these possibly three and then hook them
together so let's not take up a lot of

708
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:13,559
together so let's not take up a lot of
 

709
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:21,399
together so let's not take up a lot of
space really and a lot of resources yep

710
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:21,409
space really and a lot of resources yep
 

711
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:24,439
space really and a lot of resources yep
anyway that's it for today thank you for

712
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:24,449
anyway that's it for today thank you for

00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:28,189
anyway that's it for today thank you for
watching let me know any suggestions you

714
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:28,199
watching let me know any suggestions you
 

715
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:31,669
watching let me know any suggestions you
have and I will see you again next time
