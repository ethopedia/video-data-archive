00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,790
will be able to repair it without it
ever breaking but we found this works

164
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:14,800
ever breaking but we found this works
 

165
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,620
ever breaking but we found this works
and then we were going to have the sword

166
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:16,630
and then we were going to have the sword
 

167
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,300
and then we were going to have the sword
in our other hand so we get the looting

168
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,310
in our other hand so we get the looting
 

169
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,330
in our other hand so we get the looting
effect if we introduce food into the

170
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:21,340
effect if we introduce food into the
 

171
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,580
effect if we introduce food into the
equation though then we need to have

172
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:23,590
equation though then we need to have
 

173
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,250
equation though then we need to have
that selected as well and hold right

174
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,260
that selected as well and hold right
 

175
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,670
that selected as well and hold right
clear

176
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:26,680
clear
 

177
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,840
clear
so how do we do all this we can't what I

178
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:30,850
so how do we do all this we can't what I
 

179
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,689
so how do we do all this we can't what I
think we're going to try to do now take

180
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:33,699
think we're going to try to do now take
 

181
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,330
think we're going to try to do now take
the thorns off we can't just like wear

182
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:36,340
the thorns off we can't just like wear
 

183
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,100
the thorns off we can't just like wear
thorns pants and then the rest of this

184
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,110
thorns pants and then the rest of this
 

185
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,320
thorns pants and then the rest of this
gear because we found out in that when

186
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,330
gear because we found out in that when
 

187
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,960
gear because we found out in that when
we were doing that Enderman testing I

188
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:41,970
we were doing that Enderman testing I
 

189
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,330
we were doing that Enderman testing I
don't think it's able to repair all four

190
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,340
don't think it's able to repair all four
 

191
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,700
don't think it's able to repair all four
of these pieces if we have thorns on one

192
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:47,710
of these pieces if we have thorns on one
 

193
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,740
of these pieces if we have thorns on one
of them because thorns takes three

194
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:49,750
of them because thorns takes three
 

195
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,770
of them because thorns takes three
durability instead of one every time it

196
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:52,780
durability instead of one every time it
 

197
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,090
durability instead of one every time it
loses your ability so I think to bounce

198
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,100
loses your ability so I think to bounce
 

199
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,640
loses your ability so I think to bounce
it out we have to get rid of most of our

200
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,650
it out we have to get rid of most of our
 

201
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,189
it out we have to get rid of most of our
diamond armor and hopefully the food we

202
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:02,199
diamond armor and hopefully the food we
 

203
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,379
diamond armor and hopefully the food we
get is enough to keep us alive with the

204
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:04,389
get is enough to keep us alive with the
 

205
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,450
get is enough to keep us alive with the
extra damage we're going to take we can

206
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:06,460
extra damage we're going to take we can
 

207
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,129
extra damage we're going to take we can
still put the sword in our offhand that

208
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:08,139
still put the sword in our offhand that
 

209
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,710
still put the sword in our offhand that
way we're not using any cheating method

210
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
way we're not using any cheating method
 

211
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,570
way we're not using any cheating method
of keeping thorns in our offhand because

212
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:12,580
of keeping thorns in our offhand because
 

213
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,250
of keeping thorns in our offhand because
it wasn't taking durability when we did

214
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,260
it wasn't taking durability when we did
 

215
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,560
it wasn't taking durability when we did
that which was pretty cool but they

216
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:16,570
that which was pretty cool but they
 

217
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,960
that which was pretty cool but they
might patch that if it is a glitch um so

218
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:21,970
might patch that if it is a glitch um so
 

219
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,969
might patch that if it is a glitch um so
yeah let's see if this combination works

220
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:23,979
yeah let's see if this combination works
 

221
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,050
yeah let's see if this combination works
and basically we would just do this put

222
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,060
and basically we would just do this put
 

223
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,249
and basically we would just do this put
something heavy on your mouse on the

224
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:29,259
something heavy on your mouse on the
 

225
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,020
something heavy on your mouse on the
right-click key or change your key

226
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,030
right-click key or change your key
 

227
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,339
right-click key or change your key
bindings there's lots of ways of holding

228
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:32,349
bindings there's lots of ways of holding
 

229
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:36,950
bindings there's lots of ways of holding
right click when you're not there and

230
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960

 

231
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,170

here comes the spiders the other problem

232
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,180
here comes the spiders the other problem
 

233
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,659
here comes the spiders the other problem
of this is we can't see the farm working

234
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:41,669
of this is we can't see the farm working
 

235
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,189
of this is we can't see the farm working
this is all we're going to ever see when

236
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:44,199
this is all we're going to ever see when
 

237
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,680
this is all we're going to ever see when
we use this farm but it's meant to be an

238
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:46,690
we use this farm but it's meant to be an
 

239
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,969
we use this farm but it's meant to be an
afk farm anyway

240
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:49,979

 

241
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,710

okay spiders are dying or getting in the

242
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
okay spiders are dying or getting in the
 

243
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,020
okay spiders are dying or getting in the
looting effect from the sword we're able

244
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,030
looting effect from the sword we're able
 

245
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,830
looting effect from the sword we're able
to eat already

246
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
to eat already
 

247
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,330
to eat already
we refilled the stew I'm going to sit

248
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:00,340
we refilled the stew I'm going to sit
 

249
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,680
we refilled the stew I'm going to sit
here for a while and see if our armor

250
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:01,690
here for a while and see if our armor
 

251
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,390
here for a while and see if our armor
durability goes down or if we get close

252
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:03,400
durability goes down or if we get close
 

253
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,279
durability goes down or if we get close
to death all right guys so I left for

254
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,289
to death all right guys so I left for
 

255
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,080
to death all right guys so I left for
about 10-15 minutes here I went to make

256
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,090
about 10-15 minutes here I went to make
 

257
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,750
about 10-15 minutes here I went to make
coffee and I just got back let's check

258
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:12,760
coffee and I just got back let's check
 

259
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,680
coffee and I just got back let's check
out the damage after afk f king for a

260
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,690
out the damage after afk f king for a
 

261
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,320
out the damage after afk f king for a
little while loop took the heavy object

262
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,330
little while loop took the heavy object
 

263
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,600
little while loop took the heavy object
off my mouse due to my preferred method

264
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,610
off my mouse due to my preferred method
 

265
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,520
off my mouse due to my preferred method
i also added in some hoppers here which

266
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:26,530
i also added in some hoppers here which
 

267
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,050
i also added in some hoppers here which
are trapping the experience and my armor

268
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,060
are trapping the experience and my armor
 

269
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,890
are trapping the experience and my armor
is breaking oh oh

270
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:34,900
is breaking oh oh
 

271
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,280
is breaking oh oh
it invalid test I got to do it again I'm

272
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,290
it invalid test I got to do it again I'm
 

273
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,990
it invalid test I got to do it again I'm
gonna put carpet over these hoppers I

274
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
gonna put carpet over these hoppers I
 

275
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
gonna put carpet over these hoppers I
guess whoa

276
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,610
guess whoa
 

277
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:52,020
guess whoa
we're down to half a heart guys okay

278
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,030
we're down to half a heart guys okay
 

279
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,120
we're down to half a heart guys okay
guys so doing another test here this is

280
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,130
guys so doing another test here this is
 

281
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,390
guys so doing another test here this is
about five to 10 minutes of AF King this

282
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,400
about five to 10 minutes of AF King this
 

283
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,490
about five to 10 minutes of AF King this
time we're not anywhere close to dying

284
00:06:59,490 --> 00:06:59,500
time we're not anywhere close to dying
 

285
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,650
time we're not anywhere close to dying
because I got two pieces of diamond

286
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:01,660
because I got two pieces of diamond
 

287
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,540
because I got two pieces of diamond
armor on I got pants and the chest piece

288
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,550
armor on I got pants and the chest piece
 

289
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,529
armor on I got pants and the chest piece
with just one it's very risky even if it

290
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:07,539
with just one it's very risky even if it
 

291
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,420
with just one it's very risky even if it
was a diamond chest piece you would have

292
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:09,430
was a diamond chest piece you would have
 

293
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,879
was a diamond chest piece you would have
to eat some better food I think to stay

294
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:11,889
to eat some better food I think to stay
 

295
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,870
to eat some better food I think to stay
alive like something with higher

296
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
alive like something with higher
 

297
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,210
alive like something with higher
saturation like steak instead of this

298
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,220
saturation like steak instead of this
 

299
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,450
saturation like steak instead of this
mushroom soup garbage that we're eating

300
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:17,460
mushroom soup garbage that we're eating
 

301
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,860
mushroom soup garbage that we're eating
but then you need some way of keeping

302
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:19,870
but then you need some way of keeping
 

303
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,920
but then you need some way of keeping
yourself fed like some dispenser

304
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:22,930
yourself fed like some dispenser
 

305
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,420
yourself fed like some dispenser
throwing state at you and you got to

306
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,430
throwing state at you and you got to
 

307
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,790
throwing state at you and you got to
keep that full and it yeah things get

308
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
keep that full and it yeah things get
 

309
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,779
keep that full and it yeah things get
more complicated then

310
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:27,789
more complicated then
 

311
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,450
more complicated then
anyways let's check out things take the

312
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:30,460
anyways let's check out things take the
 

313
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,510
anyways let's check out things take the
heavy object off my mouse so I do have

314
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
heavy object off my mouse so I do have
 

315
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,310
heavy object off my mouse so I do have
the carpet over the hoppers now so the

316
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,320
the carpet over the hoppers now so the
 

317
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,230
the carpet over the hoppers now so the
XP isn't getting stuck like it was

318
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,240
XP isn't getting stuck like it was
 

319
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,710
XP isn't getting stuck like it was
before is really important how's our

320
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
before is really important how's our
 

321
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,350
before is really important how's our
armor doing the armor is breaking still

on the last video a lot of you guys are
 

343
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,550
on the last video a lot of you guys are
like oh just use regeneration to that'll

344
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:11,560
like oh just use regeneration to that'll
 

345
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,339

with beacons regeneration is a secondary

348
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:17,889
with beacons regeneration is a secondary
 

349
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,680
with beacons regeneration is a secondary
power in the beacon so that means it

350
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:19,690
power in the beacon so that means it

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,110
power in the beacon so that means it
only goes up to tier one while all these

some other way of keeping us alive so I

358
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,270
some other way of keeping us alive so I
 

359
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,000
some other way of keeping us alive so I
have decided guys I'm going to try to do

360
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,010
have decided guys I'm going to try to do
 

361
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,380
have decided guys I'm going to try to do
that potion thing I had in mind

362
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,390
that potion thing I had in mind
 

363
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,839
that potion thing I had in mind
originally so I've entered to build mode

364
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:36,849
originally so I've entered to build mode
 

365
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,240
originally so I've entered to build mode
now and I made a pretty cool little

366
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,250
now and I made a pretty cool little
 

367
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,040
now and I made a pretty cool little
device here I think I'm going to use for

368
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,050
device here I think I'm going to use for
 

369
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,040
device here I think I'm going to use for
it one thing we're gonna have to do if

370
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,050
it one thing we're gonna have to do if
 

371
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,840
it one thing we're gonna have to do if
we're healing ourselves we don't want to

372
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:45,850
we're healing ourselves we don't want to

move me away from any of the spiders and

378
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,430
move me away from any of the spiders and
 

379
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,880
move me away from any of the spiders and
then throw a healing potion at me and

380

then throw a healing potion at me and
 

381
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,950
then throw a healing potion at me and
then bring us back into place it is a

382
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:58,960
then bring us back into place it is a
 

383
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,350
then bring us back into place it is a
plan and to do that I'm going to use the

384
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
plan and to do that I'm going to use the
 

385
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,200
plan and to do that I'm going to use the
piston translocation trick so here's my

386
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,210
piston translocation trick so here's my
 

387
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,890
piston translocation trick so here's my
little my little device that makes it go

388
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:07,900
little my little device that makes it go
 

389
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,930
little my little device that makes it go
down so pretend the armorstand is us

390
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:09,940
down so pretend the armorstand is us
 

391
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,620
down so pretend the armorstand is us
that makes it go down that makes it go

392
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:13,630
that makes it go down that makes it go
 

393
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,600
that makes it go down that makes it go
up pretty simple if you press up again

394
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,610
up pretty simple if you press up again
 

395
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,650
up pretty simple if you press up again
stays up down press it again stays down

396
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:21,660
stays up down press it again stays down
 

397
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,120
stays up down press it again stays down
now really not too much to it this is

398
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,130
now really not too much to it this is
 

399
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,880
now really not too much to it this is
for regular Pistons this allows you to

400
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:26,890
for regular Pistons this allows you to
 

401
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,510
for regular Pistons this allows you to
stay in the same spots to go up and down

402
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:29,520
stay in the same spots to go up and down
 

403
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,970
stay in the same spots to go up and down
which is pretty cool this is a

404
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:31,980
which is pretty cool this is a
 

405
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,620
which is pretty cool this is a
monostable circuits sticky piston with a

406
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:34,630
monostable circuits sticky piston with a
 

407
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,470
monostable circuits sticky piston with a
block above and all these repeaters are

408
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:37,480
block above and all these repeaters are
 

409
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,790
block above and all these repeaters are
set to one so now I've added some more

410
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:41,800
set to one so now I've added some more
 

411
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,220
set to one so now I've added some more
on to it basically it just activates

412
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,230
on to it basically it just activates
 

413
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,530
on to it basically it just activates
this one first and then seven redstone

414
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:46,540
this one first and then seven redstone
 

415
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,390
this one first and then seven redstone
ticks later it activates that one and

416
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,400
ticks later it activates that one and
 

417
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,910
ticks later it activates that one and
there's also a dispenser set up now

418
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:50,920
there's also a dispenser set up now
 

419
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,570
there's also a dispenser set up now
which gets activated by this repeater so

420
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:54,580
which gets activated by this repeater so
 

421
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,960
which gets activated by this repeater so
it does something like this goes down

422
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:57,970
it does something like this goes down
 

423
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,530
it does something like this goes down
goes up now what when it goes down you

424
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:01,540
goes up now what when it goes down you
 

425
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,550
goes up now what when it goes down you
hear that little tick

426
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
hear that little tick
 

427
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,100
hear that little tick
that's the dispenser down here this is

428
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,110
that's the dispenser down here this is
 

429
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,020
that's the dispenser down here this is
what's going to have the potions inside

430
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,030
what's going to have the potions inside
 

431
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,280
what's going to have the potions inside
that'll heal us so this should be fairly

432
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,290
that'll heal us so this should be fairly
 

433
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,020
that'll heal us so this should be fairly
simple let's get rid of this guy and

434
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,030
simple let's get rid of this guy and
 

435
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,570
simple let's get rid of this guy and
just try it on ourselves and I made sure

436
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:15,580
just try it on ourselves and I made sure
 

437
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,700
just try it on ourselves and I made sure
to build this in such a way that we can

438
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:17,710
to build this in such a way that we can
 

439
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,540
to build this in such a way that we can
put blocks all around here too so this

440
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:21,550
put blocks all around here too so this
 

441
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,190
put blocks all around here too so this
should work

442
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,200
should work
 

443
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,560
should work

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,630
project you'll appreciate it more later
I say so yeah that goes to these lamps

640
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:05,640
I say so yeah that goes to these lamps
 

641
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,310
I say so yeah that goes to these lamps
when they turn off it allows the spiders

642
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
when they turn off it allows the spiders
 

643
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,620
when they turn off it allows the spiders
to spawn there's one spider spawner

644
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:10,630
to spawn there's one spider spawner
 

645
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,760
to spawn there's one spider spawner
right below this torch so two diagonals

646
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:14,770
right below this torch so two diagonals
 

647
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,490
right below this torch so two diagonals
from the spawner is I have the lamps and

648
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:17,500
from the spawner is I have the lamps and
 

649
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,450
from the spawner is I have the lamps and
that seems to stop them

650
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:19,460
that seems to stop them
 

651
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,880
that seems to stop them
from spawning while I work here which is

652
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:21,890
from spawning while I work here which is
 

653
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,269
from spawning while I work here which is
good against the inside it is lit up in

654
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
good against the inside it is lit up in
 

655
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,090
good against the inside it is lit up in
there ah the reason for these slabs by

656
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,100
there ah the reason for these slabs by
 

657
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,290
there ah the reason for these slabs by
the way in the front here is just to

658
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:29,300
the way in the front here is just to
 

659
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,170
the way in the front here is just to
block out light entirely but we can

660
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:32,180
block out light entirely but we can
 

661
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,560
block out light entirely but we can
still see through them and I think we

662
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:35,570
still see through them and I think we
 

663
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,500
still see through them and I think we
can get it going might add the switch

664
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,510
can get it going might add the switch
 

665
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,050
can get it going might add the switch
outside there yet but basically if this

666
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,060
outside there yet but basically if this
 

667
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,360
outside there yet but basically if this
is flipped it should run and I don't

668
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,370
is flipped it should run and I don't
 

669
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,650
is flipped it should run and I don't
have many items in here so it's gonna

670
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:47,660
have many items in here so it's gonna
 

671
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,769
have many items in here so it's gonna
trigger pretty frequently yeah so that

672
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:50,779
trigger pretty frequently yeah so that
 

673
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:56,160
trigger pretty frequently yeah so that
go down um yeah here the spiders falling

674
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,170
go down um yeah here the spiders falling
 

675
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,990
go down um yeah here the spiders falling
so that's working and also the brewing

676
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,000
so that's working and also the brewing
 

677
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,690
so that's working and also the brewing
should have engaged yep so everything is

678
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:04,700
should have engaged yep so everything is
 

679
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,410
should have engaged yep so everything is
all three things are controlled by this

680
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:07,420
all three things are controlled by this
 

681
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,810
all three things are controlled by this
which is pretty cool Oh

682
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:13,820

 

683
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,889

two hearts this is getting scary this is

684
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:20,899
two hearts this is getting scary this is
 

685
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:21,910
two hearts this is getting scary this is
very scary

686
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
very scary
 

687
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,740
very scary
I need my healing to activate very soon

688
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:25,750
I need my healing to activate very soon
 

689
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:32,380
I need my healing to activate very soon
got that one and a half hearts oh okay

690
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,390
got that one and a half hearts oh okay
 

691
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,150
got that one and a half hearts oh okay
that only brought us back up to five so

692
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
that only brought us back up to five so
 

693
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
that only brought us back up to five so
I need to speed that thing up right now

694
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,170
I need to speed that thing up right now
 

695
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,579
I need to speed that thing up right now
I have it set to I think seven minutes

696
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:39,589
I have it set to I think seven minutes
 

697
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:42,190
I have it set to I think seven minutes
or so every seven minutes it's gotta be

698
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,200
or so every seven minutes it's gotta be
 

699
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,160
or so every seven minutes it's gotta be
quite a bit faster probably every four

700
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,170
quite a bit faster probably every four
 

701
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,030
quite a bit faster probably every four
minutes by the looks of it if I was to

702
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
minutes by the looks of it if I was to
 

703
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,699
minutes by the looks of it if I was to
stay here any longer I would die my

704
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:51,709
stay here any longer I would die my
 

705
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:59,800
stay here any longer I would die my
armor is doing I don't know the pants

706
00:16:59,800 --> 00:16:59,810
armor is doing I don't know the pants
 

707
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,850
armor is doing I don't know the pants
are really low

708
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:00,860
are really low
 

709
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,480
are really low
they went down 40 maybe I'm not

710
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,490
they went down 40 maybe I'm not
 

711
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,510
they went down 40 maybe I'm not
recovering enough then it's really hard

712
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
recovering enough then it's really hard
 

713
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,439
recovering enough then it's really hard
to say okay let's get out of here this

714
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:11,449
to say okay let's get out of here this
 

715
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,449
to say okay let's get out of here this
is the other problem I'm noticing they

716
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:13,459
is the other problem I'm noticing they
 

717
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,090
is the other problem I'm noticing they
are really getting stuck

718
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,100
are really getting stuck
 

719
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:23,800
are really getting stuck
oh okay we did not get a full heal

720
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:23,810
oh okay we did not get a full heal
 

721
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,550
oh okay we did not get a full heal
they're pretty close to a full heal I

722
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:27,560
they're pretty close to a full heal I
 

723
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,740
they're pretty close to a full heal I
gotta speed it up just a little bit more

724
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:29,750
gotta speed it up just a little bit more
 

725
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:41,770
gotta speed it up just a little bit more
though full heal okay and this spider

726
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:41,780
though full heal okay and this spider
 

727
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,020
though full heal okay and this spider
was close to us let's just check his

728
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,030
was close to us let's just check his
 

729
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,720
was close to us let's just check his
health he still dies in one hit so he

730
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:46,730
health he still dies in one hit so he
 

731
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,280
health he still dies in one hit so he
didn't get healed at all which is good

732
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,290
didn't get healed at all which is good
 

733
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,040
didn't get healed at all which is good
that's what the the whole point of this

734
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,050
that's what the the whole point of this
 

735
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,760
that's what the the whole point of this
contraptions for um I tried raising the

736
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:54,770
contraptions for um I tried raising the
 

737
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,810
contraptions for um I tried raising the
ground in the back there one block but

738
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:58,820
ground in the back there one block but
 

739
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,570
ground in the back there one block but
yeah like those those guys are within my

740
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:01,580
yeah like those those guys are within my
 

741
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,340
yeah like those those guys are within my
line of sight but I guess searching far

742
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:03,350
line of sight but I guess searching far
 

743
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,320
line of sight but I guess searching far
away that they're not tracking me and

744
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,330
away that they're not tracking me and
 

745
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,370
away that they're not tracking me and
like I don't know spiders are dumb

746
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,380
like I don't know spiders are dumb
 

747
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,270
like I don't know spiders are dumb
that's all I gotta say

748
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
that's all I gotta say
 

749
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,790
that's all I gotta say
are there any stuck up there no good how

750
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:21,800
are there any stuck up there no good how
 

751
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,220
are there any stuck up there no good how
do I make them come towards me I really

752
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,230
do I make them come towards me I really
 

753
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:30,010
do I make them come towards me I really
don't know and our armor is like okay I

754
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,020
don't know and our armor is like okay I
 

755
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,280
don't know and our armor is like okay I
think yea the durability is not too low

756
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,290
think yea the durability is not too low
 

757
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,900
think yea the durability is not too low
right now well I think we'll try water

758
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:37,910
right now well I think we'll try water
 

759
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,700
right now well I think we'll try water
streams now it's the only thing I can

760
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:39,710
streams now it's the only thing I can
 

761
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,390
streams now it's the only thing I can
think of to make these guys cooperate if

762
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:43,400
think of to make these guys cooperate if
 

763
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,680
think of to make these guys cooperate if
it works I'm going to set up water

764
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:44,690
it works I'm going to set up water
 

765
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,570
it works I'm going to set up water
streams like on those walls and probably

766
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:46,580
streams like on those walls and probably
 

767
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,240
streams like on those walls and probably
on this wall to bring them right to the

768
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,250
on this wall to bring them right to the
 

769
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,850
on this wall to bring them right to the
middle if they end up over there they

770
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:51,860
middle if they end up over there they
 

771
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,220
middle if they end up over there they
should see us and then come get us

772
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,230
should see us and then come get us
 

773
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,920
should see us and then come get us
I've also extended this platform one

774
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:56,930
I've also extended this platform one
 

775
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,830
I've also extended this platform one
more block forward and I might change

776
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
more block forward and I might change
 

777
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
more block forward and I might change
these out with hoppers this will

778
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,090
these out with hoppers this will
 

779
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,760
these out with hoppers this will
increase the amount of experience we get

780
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:03,770
increase the amount of experience we get
 

781
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,950
increase the amount of experience we get
because I I've noticed the odd time a

782
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:05,960
because I I've noticed the odd time a
 

783
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,040
because I I've noticed the odd time a
little bit will trickle over that should

784
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,050
little bit will trickle over that should
 

785
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,990
little bit will trickle over that should
keep our armor a little bit safer and

786
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,000

 

787
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,130

I'll show you how I did the water here

788
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,140
I'll show you how I did the water here
 

789
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,920
I'll show you how I did the water here

which I might use to push the drops but

842
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:42,710
which I might use to push the drops but
 

843
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,889
which I might use to push the drops but
most of the drops get picked up by the

most of the drops get picked up by the
 

845
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:49,149
most of the drops get picked up by the
hoppers anyway so I don't know if it's

846
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:49,159
hoppers anyway so I don't know if it's
 

847
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,119
hoppers anyway so I don't know if it's
really necessary and the water streams

848
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:52,129
really necessary and the water streams
 

849

things I'm happy about that

884
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,470
things I'm happy about that
 

885
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,419
things I'm happy about that
unfortunately though that took up like

886
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:53,429
unfortunately though that took up like
 

887
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:55,999
unfortunately though that took up like
the whole episode and I usually like to

888
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:56,009
the whole episode and I usually like to
 

889
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,249
the whole episode and I usually like to
do several things in an episode but

890
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:58,259
do several things in an episode but
 

891
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,729
do several things in an episode but
today I'm really tired now I'd spent

892
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:01,739
today I'm really tired now I'd spent
 

893
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:03,349
today I'm really tired now I'd spent
longer than a normal episode on that

894
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:03,359
longer than a normal episode on that
 

895
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,710
longer than a normal episode on that
unfortunately so it's going to be pretty

896
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
unfortunately so it's going to be pretty
 

897
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,049
unfortunately so it's going to be pretty
much just that one thing I thought we

898
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:09,059
much just that one thing I thought we
 

899
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,849
much just that one thing I thought we
could try real quick here just to end it

900
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:10,859
could try real quick here just to end it
 

901
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:12,710
could try real quick here just to end it
though something a little different I

902
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
though something a little different I
 

903
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,799
though something a little different I
don't know when you fly with your Alijah

904

wings I haven't tested yet if you

906
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:17,519
wings I haven't tested yet if you
 

907
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,619
wings I haven't tested yet if you
actually dig slower if you don't you

908
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:21,629
actually dig slower if you don't you
 

909
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:23,779
actually dig slower if you don't you
could potentially speed mine while

910
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:23,789
could potentially speed mine while
 

911
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:26,060
could potentially speed mine while
flying and like since you take up less

912
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,070
flying and like since you take up less
 

913
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,479
flying and like since you take up less
space you might be able to break all the

914
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:29,489
space you might be able to break all the
 

915
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:31,249
space you might be able to break all the
blocks in front of you before you hit

916
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:31,259
blocks in front of you before you hit
 

917
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:34,549
blocks in front of you before you hit
them which would be pretty crazy so

918
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
them which would be pretty crazy so
 

919
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,320
them which would be pretty crazy so
let's try it out here built like a

920
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,330
let's try it out here built like a
 

921
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,149
let's try it out here built like a
little take off the platform

922
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
little take off the platform
 

923
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,979

good it had a lot of fun with that try
it again

928
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:50,899
it again
 

929
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:54,460
it again
yeah you see how much slower it is ah
