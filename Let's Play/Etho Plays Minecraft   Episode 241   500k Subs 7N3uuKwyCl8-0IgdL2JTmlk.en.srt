uh i'll show you show you as this comes
together i guess

208
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
and red dye situation sorted out here
 

213
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,789
and red dye situation sorted out here
and

214
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
and
 

215
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,469
and
and that goes for orange and pink and

216
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
and that goes for orange and pink and
 

217
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,350
and that goes for orange and pink and
all the other sub colors too

218
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
all the other sub colors too
 

219
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,270
all the other sub colors too
that you make with red and yellow so

220
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
that you make with red and yellow so
 

221
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,189
that you make with red and yellow so
i came to use my greenhouse and it

222
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
i came to use my greenhouse and it
 

223
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,189
i came to use my greenhouse and it
didn't work i guess they fixed it like

224
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
didn't work i guess they fixed it like
 

225
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,110
didn't work i guess they fixed it like
before you could just go into a dark

226
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
before you could just go into a dark
 

227
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,110
before you could just go into a dark
room

228
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
room
 

229
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,749
room
when you break the grass and the flowers

230
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
when you break the grass and the flowers
 

231
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,670
when you break the grass and the flowers
they all pop off

232
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
they all pop off
 

233
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,510
they all pop off
so that's a i think i use this once for

234
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
so that's a i think i use this once for
 

235
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,350
so that's a i think i use this once for
getting yellow flowers or something

236
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
getting yellow flowers or something
 

237
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,950
getting yellow flowers or something
i don't know how well you can see but

238
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
i don't know how well you can see but
 

239
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,550
i don't know how well you can see but
now it's like you can't

240
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
now it's like you can't
 

241
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,909
now it's like you can't
plant grass and flowers if it's dark so

242
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
plant grass and flowers if it's dark so
 

243
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,590
plant grass and flowers if it's dark so
you need light

244
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
you need light
 

245
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,710
you need light
but if it's light then they don't uproot

246
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
but if it's light then they don't uproot
 

247
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,090
but if it's light then they don't uproot
so you have to make it dark

248
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,100
so you have to make it dark
 

249
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,590
so you have to make it dark
[Applause]

250
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
[Applause]
 

251
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,670
[Applause]
and even if you make a dart that doesn't

252
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
and even if you make a dart that doesn't
 

253
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,590
and even if you make a dart that doesn't
instantly uproot it takes time

254
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600

 

255
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,710

for an update or if you hit it then

256
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
for an update or if you hit it then
 

257
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,390
for an update or if you hit it then
it'll do it but

258
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
it'll do it but
 

259
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,510
it'll do it but
yeah so what i did is quickly

260
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
yeah so what i did is quickly
 

261
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,710
yeah so what i did is quickly
and very ugly put this together

262
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
and very ugly put this together
 

263
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,350
and very ugly put this together
i got a wire that runs underneath

264
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360

 

265
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,629

to to the center

266
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
to to the center
 

267
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,070
to to the center
it would work better if i did the whole

268
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
it would work better if i did the whole
 

269
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,189
it would work better if i did the whole
thing underneath but this is good enough

270
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
thing underneath but this is good enough
 

271
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,390
thing underneath but this is good enough
um that runs to the center then i got

272
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
um that runs to the center then i got
 

273
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,870
um that runs to the center then i got
this

274
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
this
 

275
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,790
this
monostable thing it's this

276
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
monostable thing it's this
 

277
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,909
monostable thing it's this
clock running very quick clock makes a

278
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
clock running very quick clock makes a
 

279
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,070
clock running very quick clock makes a
piston extend and retract as quick as

280
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
piston extend and retract as quick as
 

281
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,510
piston extend and retract as quick as
possible and that controls our lighting

282
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
possible and that controls our lighting
 

283
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,870
possible and that controls our lighting
if uh this is not covered

284
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
if uh this is not covered
 

285
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,430
if uh this is not covered
so it's going light and dark light dark

286
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
so it's going light and dark light dark
 

287
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,990
so it's going light and dark light dark
if you have

288
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
if you have
 

289
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,350
if you have
uh any issues with pulsating lights

290
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
uh any issues with pulsating lights
 

291
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,909
uh any issues with pulsating lights
maybe close your eyes for a little bit

292
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919

 

293
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,350

all right oh man it's also very laggy

294
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
all right oh man it's also very laggy
 

295
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,110
all right oh man it's also very laggy
but this works this works

296
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
but this works this works
 

297
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,469
but this works this works
now i just spam right click

298
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
now i just spam right click
 

299
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,029
now i just spam right click
and uh this controls the lighting

300
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
and uh this controls the lighting
 

301
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,749
and uh this controls the lighting
and then it also sends that pulse down

302
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
and then it also sends that pulse down
 

303
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,230
and then it also sends that pulse down
and

304
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
and
 

305
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,550
and
down below this this area right below

306
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
down below this this area right below
 

307
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,629
down below this this area right below
the ground here and that causes the

308
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
the ground here and that causes the
 

309
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,070
the ground here and that causes the
update to make it

310
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
update to make it
 

311
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,710
update to make it
pop off

312
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720

 

313
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,670

so yeah die situation is under control

314
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680

 

315
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,309

see that pulsing down there

316
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

317
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,390

okay now we are here getting our our

318
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
okay now we are here getting our our
 

319
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,430
okay now we are here getting our our
paper

320
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
paper
 

321
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,189
paper
for the fireworks

322
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199

 

323
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,110

i love this reed farm

324
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120

 

325
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,390

that's like how it looks when you're

326
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
that's like how it looks when you're
 

327
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,670
that's like how it looks when you're
down here it's like you can't see

328
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
down here it's like you can't see
 

329
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,110
down here it's like you can't see
anything in front of you there's so many

330
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120

 

331
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,230

okay that should be enough

332

okay that should be enough
 

333
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,749
okay that should be enough
and i started just a little very basic

334
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
and i started just a little very basic
 

335
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,070
and i started just a little very basic
cactus farm here eventually in my world

336
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
cactus farm here eventually in my world
 

337
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,070
cactus farm here eventually in my world
i'm going to build a proper cactus farm

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
i'm going to build a proper cactus farm
 

339
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,870
i'm going to build a proper cactus farm
and a proper

340
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
and a proper
 

341
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,830
and a proper
flower farm and all that so today's just

342
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
flower farm and all that so today's just
 

343
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,390
flower farm and all that so today's just
really

344
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
really
 

345
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,430
really
quick and basic ways of doing it

346
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440

 

347
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,710

okay so we're gonna have to wait a

348
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
okay so we're gonna have to wait a
 

349
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,550
okay so we're gonna have to wait a
little bit for our cactuses to grow

350
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
little bit for our cactuses to grow
 

351
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,950
little bit for our cactuses to grow
before we can start making our fireworks

352
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
before we can start making our fireworks
 

353
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,430
before we can start making our fireworks
uh i'm gonna fill you in on the plan the

354
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
uh i'm gonna fill you in on the plan the
 

355
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,950
uh i'm gonna fill you in on the plan the
plan for the fireworks show because we

356
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
plan for the fireworks show because we
 

357
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,870
plan for the fireworks show because we
got a few things to consider

358
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
got a few things to consider
 

359
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,870
got a few things to consider
if you remember if you remember the old

360
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
if you remember if you remember the old
 

361
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,550
if you remember if you remember the old
fireworks setup we had i always had a

362
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
fireworks setup we had i always had a
 

363
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,790
fireworks setup we had i always had a
problem where i

364
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
problem where i
 

365
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,469
problem where i
wasn't able to really add variety to it

366
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
wasn't able to really add variety to it
 

367
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,390
wasn't able to really add variety to it
you know it was always the same

368
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
you know it was always the same
 

369
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,430
you know it was always the same
same sequence of canons going off

370
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
same sequence of canons going off
 

371
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,469
same sequence of canons going off
and it was very hard to to change it up

372
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
and it was very hard to to change it up
 

373
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,350
and it was very hard to to change it up
you know so

374
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
you know so
 

375
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,830
you know so
if you saw it once you saw it every time

376
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
if you saw it once you saw it every time
 

377
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,950
if you saw it once you saw it every time
you know

378
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
you know
 

379
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,309
you know
even though i launched it like five

380
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
even though i launched it like five
 

381
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,150
even though i launched it like five
times or six times throughout the

382
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
times or six times throughout the
 

383
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,830
times or six times throughout the
subscriber specials it always looked the

384
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
subscriber specials it always looked the
 

385
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,550
subscriber specials it always looked the
same

386
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
same
 

387
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,710
same
but i i would try to add a few new

388
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
but i i would try to add a few new
 

389
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,550
but i i would try to add a few new
canons to it every time to change things

390
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
canons to it every time to change things
 

391
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,150
canons to it every time to change things
up a little bit

392
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
up a little bit
 

393
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,589
up a little bit
and i plan on doing that with this one

394
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
and i plan on doing that with this one
 

395
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,869
and i plan on doing that with this one
we're setting up now too we're going to

396
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
we're setting up now too we're going to
 

397
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,589
we're setting up now too we're going to
continue to expand it

398
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
continue to expand it
 

399
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,029
continue to expand it
all the time and launch it every

400
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
all the time and launch it every
 

401
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,869
all the time and launch it every
subscriber special

402
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
subscriber special
 

403
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,469
subscriber special
um now i do want it to be random though

404
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
um now i do want it to be random though
 

405
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,390
um now i do want it to be random though
i want variety so it'll be a different

406
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
i want variety so it'll be a different
 

407
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,909
i want variety so it'll be a different
show every time

408
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
show every time
 

409
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,550
show every time
so the cool thing is we can launch

410
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
so the cool thing is we can launch
 

411
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,909
so the cool thing is we can launch
fireworks out of dispensers and

412
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
fireworks out of dispensers and
 

413
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,749
fireworks out of dispensers and
dispensers have nine slots it'll shoot

414
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
dispensers have nine slots it'll shoot
 

415
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,790
dispensers have nine slots it'll shoot
one out randomly so we can have nine

416
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
one out randomly so we can have nine
 

417
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,230
one out randomly so we can have nine
different colors of fireworks for nine

418
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
different colors of fireworks for nine
 

419
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,189
different colors of fireworks for nine
different types

420
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
different types
 

421
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,909
different types
and it will randomly choose between each

422
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
and it will randomly choose between each
 

423
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,990
and it will randomly choose between each
one as it's launching so that's awesome

424
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
one as it's launching so that's awesome
 

425
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,389
one as it's launching so that's awesome
that's built in and the fireworks

426
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
that's built in and the fireworks
 

427
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,389
that's built in and the fireworks
themselves there's so much variety with

428
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
themselves there's so much variety with
 

429
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,829
themselves there's so much variety with
them

430
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
them
 

431
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,829
them
so again awesome

432
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
so again awesome
 

433
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,949
so again awesome
but as far as the launch

434
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
but as far as the launch
 

435
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,230
but as far as the launch
sequence i said that word lot launch

436
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
sequence i said that word lot launch
 

437
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,750
sequence i said that word lot launch

440
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
sequence why am i having trouble
 

441
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,190
sequence why am i having trouble
speaking launch

442
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
speaking launch
 

443
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,630
speaking launch
sequence yes uh

444
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
sequence yes uh
 

445
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,910
sequence yes uh
as far as the launch sequence goes

446
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
as far as the launch sequence goes
 

447
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,230
as far as the launch sequence goes
uh we want the timing to be random if

448
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
uh we want the timing to be random if
 

449
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,190
uh we want the timing to be random if
possible

450
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
possible
 

451
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,710
possible
but we want to be able to control it

452
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
but we want to be able to control it
 

453
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,190
but we want to be able to control it
also so there's a bit of trouble with

454
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
also so there's a bit of trouble with
 

455
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,949
also so there's a bit of trouble with
that like you can do randomness in

456
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
that like you can do randomness in
 

457
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,110
that like you can do randomness in

i made up a little randomizer thing so
 

491
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,389
i made up a little randomizer thing so
i'll show you that

492

i'll show you that
 

493

it is a little bit flawed unfortunately

494
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
it is a little bit flawed unfortunately
 

495
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,790
it is a little bit flawed unfortunately
but for this

496
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
but for this
 

497
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,470
but for this
purpose what for what we're doing it's

498
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480

499
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,990

actually

500
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
actually
 

501
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,990

uh it's gonna work out pretty good i

502
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
uh it's gonna work out pretty good i
 

503
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,430
uh it's gonna work out pretty good i
think

504
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
think
 

505
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,190

so i'm kind of going by memory here i

506
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
so i'm kind of going by memory here i
 

507
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,750
so i'm kind of going by memory here i
think i had

508
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
think i had
 

509
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,269
think i had
ring of netherrack

510
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279

 

511
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,790

and that's on top then there's going to

512
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
and that's on top then there's going to
 

513
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,190
and that's on top then there's going to
be

514
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
be
 

515
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,310
be
two bud switches with this thing um

516
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
two bud switches with this thing um
 

517
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,509
two bud switches with this thing um
let's see i'm trying to remember i think

518
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
let's see i'm trying to remember i think
 

519
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,550
let's see i'm trying to remember i think
i had a regular piston

520
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
i had a regular piston
 

521
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,910
i had a regular piston
and then a sticky piston

522
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
and then a sticky piston
 

523
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,150
and then a sticky piston
and our goal is to make a fire appear

524
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
and our goal is to make a fire appear
 

525
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,550
and our goal is to make a fire appear
right here so that when a fire appears

526
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
right here so that when a fire appears
 

527
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,590
right here so that when a fire appears
this piston extends and puts it out

528
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
this piston extends and puts it out
 

529
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,670
this piston extends and puts it out
and this one extends and triggers a

530
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
and this one extends and triggers a
 

531
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,670
and this one extends and triggers a
redstone signal so to do that we're

532
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
redstone signal so to do that we're
 

533
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,870
redstone signal so to do that we're
going to want a

534
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
going to want a
 

535
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,509
going to want a
torch there some kind of block

536
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
torch there some kind of block
 

537
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,630
torch there some kind of block
um

538
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640

 

539
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,269

the bud switch we got a power diagonally

540
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
the bud switch we got a power diagonally
 

541
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,470
the bud switch we got a power diagonally
so there's gonna

542
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
so there's gonna
 

543
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,150
so there's gonna
actually yeah that's right i had the

544
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
actually yeah that's right i had the
 

545
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,590
actually yeah that's right i had the
wool

546
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
wool
 

547
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,949
wool
up above in the middle here

548
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959

 

549
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,949

oop this wool blocks very very important

550
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
oop this wool blocks very very important
 

551
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,150
oop this wool blocks very very important
so if that redstone is powered above

552
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
so if that redstone is powered above
 

553
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,230
so if that redstone is powered above
these become bud switches

554
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240

 

555
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,030

uh so let's then run this up

556
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
uh so let's then run this up
 

557
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:22,630
uh so let's then run this up
i think we need to invert it as well

558
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640

 

559
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,470

oh it's fun doing redstone on camera

560
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
oh it's fun doing redstone on camera
 

561
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,030
oh it's fun doing redstone on camera
isn't it um

562
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040

 

563
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,550

oh you know what i think i did it like

564
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
oh you know what i think i did it like
 

565
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,790
oh you know what i think i did it like
this i think i had we need a repeater in

566
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
this i think i had we need a repeater in
 

567
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,030
this i think i had we need a repeater in
here too

568
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
here too
 

569
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,230
here too
otherwise the delay is not going to be

570
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
otherwise the delay is not going to be
 

571
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,670
otherwise the delay is not going to be
long enough yeah and then it just runs

572
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
long enough yeah and then it just runs
 

573
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,150
long enough yeah and then it just runs
to that

574
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
to that
 

575
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,990
to that
i think that's what i did

576
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000

 

577
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,190

yeah so now let's just try this if

578
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
yeah so now let's just try this if
 

579
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,389
yeah so now let's just try this if
if this gets an update

580
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
if this gets an update
 

581
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,629
if this gets an update
nope

582
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639

 

583
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,910

what did i do wrong

584
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920

 

585
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,350

oh there we go

586
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360

 

587
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,269

all right i have to update this one not

588
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
all right i have to update this one not
 

589
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,509
all right i have to update this one not
this one okay

590
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
this one okay
 

591
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,150
this one okay
so that's our basic gist of it here and

592
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
so that's our basic gist of it here and
 

593
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,470
so that's our basic gist of it here and
then we're going to put

594
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
then we're going to put
 

595
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,509
then we're going to put
glass around here so we can see

596
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
glass around here so we can see
 

597
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,550
glass around here so we can see
i guess actually we don't need a glass

598
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
i guess actually we don't need a glass
 

599
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,829
i guess actually we don't need a glass
block there whatever

600
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
block there whatever
 

601
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,829
block there whatever
put one there we have to cover every

602
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
put one there we have to cover every
 

603
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,750
put one there we have to cover every
single side of this wool block so that

604
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
single side of this wool block so that
 

605
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,350
single side of this wool block so that
it doesn't burn

606
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
it doesn't burn
 

607
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,269
it doesn't burn
because fire needs an air block to

608
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
because fire needs an air block to
 

609
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,030
because fire needs an air block to
spread so we want to

610
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
spread so we want to
 

611
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,069
spread so we want to
get rid of that and then there

612
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
get rid of that and then there
 

613
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,069
get rid of that and then there
we're going to leave it exposed to air

614
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
we're going to leave it exposed to air
 

615
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,269
we're going to leave it exposed to air
at the bottom though and that's where

616
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
at the bottom though and that's where
 

617
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,230
at the bottom though and that's where
it's going to catch fire

618
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
it's going to catch fire
 

619
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,350
it's going to catch fire
and light this netherrack

620
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360

 

621
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,710

okay we'll just do that i think that's

622
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
okay we'll just do that i think that's
 

623
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,470
okay we'll just do that i think that's
okay then we can put a dispenser

624
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
okay then we can put a dispenser
 

625
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,230
okay then we can put a dispenser
on top this is what's going to launch

626
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
on top this is what's going to launch
 

627
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,550
on top this is what's going to launch
the fireworks

628
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
the fireworks
 

629
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,350
the fireworks
um put it there and we'll put some

630
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
um put it there and we'll put some
 

631
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,030
um put it there and we'll put some
blocks in

632
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
blocks in
 

633
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,629
blocks in
just so we can see it working i think

634
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
just so we can see it working i think
 

635
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,389
just so we can see it working i think
this is all good to go

636
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
this is all good to go
 

637
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,269
this is all good to go
uh if i remember right i have a flint

638
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
uh if i remember right i have a flint
 

639
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,069
uh if i remember right i have a flint
and steel

640
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
and steel
 

641
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,670
and steel
in one of these there we go

642
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680

 

643
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,750

okay so now i'm gonna light this well i

644
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
okay so now i'm gonna light this well i
 

645
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,030
okay so now i'm gonna light this well i
gotta have i gotta fix this don't i

646
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040

 

647
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,269

oh yeah i can fix it but i didn't nope

648
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
oh yeah i can fix it but i didn't nope
 

649
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,829
oh yeah i can fix it but i didn't nope
not by doing that

650
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839

 

651
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,829

there we go just do it quick enough okay

652
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
there we go just do it quick enough okay
 

653
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,670
there we go just do it quick enough okay
so i think it's all ready to go

654
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
so i think it's all ready to go
 

655
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,430
so i think it's all ready to go
there's a redstone dust on top the wool

656
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
there's a redstone dust on top the wool
 

657
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,110
there's a redstone dust on top the wool
so that'll prevent it from burning on

658
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
so that'll prevent it from burning on
 

659
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,509
so that'll prevent it from burning on
the top

660
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
the top
 

661
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,590
the top
so let's light it up actually i don't

662
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
so let's light it up actually i don't
 

663
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,110
so let's light it up actually i don't
need that there

664
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
need that there
 

665
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,629
need that there
like this

666
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639

 

667
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,710

now the more fire you have the quicker

668
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
now the more fire you have the quicker
 

669
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,550
now the more fire you have the quicker
this is gonna happen so if we have eight

670
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
this is gonna happen so if we have eight
 

671
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,350
this is gonna happen so if we have eight
around it

672
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
around it
 

673
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,550
around it
it should happen oh it's glitched out

674
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
it should happen oh it's glitched out
 

675
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,550
it should happen oh it's glitched out
why is it glitched out

677
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,350
why is it glitched out
because i updated it with the fire see

because i updated it with the fire see
 

679
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,069
because i updated it with the fire see
if we can

oh it's burning on the inside no it's
 

705
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,750
oh it's burning on the inside no it's
gonna burn the wall block again

706
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
gonna burn the wall block again
 

707
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,790
gonna burn the wall block again
stop stop update quick quick

708
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
stop stop update quick quick
 

709
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,910

now we lost it

710
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920

 

711
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,069

uh okay i'm gonna fix this one sec this

712
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
uh okay i'm gonna fix this one sec this
 

713
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,189
uh okay i'm gonna fix this one sec this
is a disaster

714
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
is a disaster
 

715
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,310
is a disaster
yeah i looked this thing over i was

716
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
yeah i looked this thing over i was
 

717
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,829
yeah i looked this thing over i was
trying to figure out why i couldn't get

718
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
trying to figure out why i couldn't get
 

719
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,949
trying to figure out why i couldn't get
this to retract

720
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
this to retract
 

721
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,189
this to retract
and as far as i can tell it should i

722
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
and as far as i can tell it should i
 

723
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,710
and as far as i can tell it should i
think it's glitched out because you can

724
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
think it's glitched out because you can
 

725
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,470
think it's glitched out because you can
see the arm

726
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
see the arm
 

727
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,470
see the arm
is both retracted and extended so i

728
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
is both retracted and extended so i
 

729
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,509
is both retracted and extended so i
think i just gotta

730
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
think i just gotta
 

731
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,949
think i just gotta
break it and fix it that way

732
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
break it and fix it that way
 

733
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,189
break it and fix it that way
i think

734
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199

 

735
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,230

i didn't think uh

736
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
i didn't think uh
 

737
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,829
i didn't think uh
that would be a problem though to be

738
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
that would be a problem though to be
 

739
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,310
that would be a problem though to be
honest

740
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320

 

741
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,790

oh i got the fire inside darn what am i

742
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
oh i got the fire inside darn what am i
 

743
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,629
oh i got the fire inside darn what am i
doing

744
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
doing
 

745
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,150
doing
ah which one do i update i know i can

746
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
ah which one do i update i know i can
 

747
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,629
ah which one do i update i know i can
fix it just by

748
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
fix it just by
 

749
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,310
fix it just by
ah

750
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320

 

751
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,990

what am i doing wrong here

752
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000

 

753
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,189

oh man that burnt fast oh

754
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
oh man that burnt fast oh
 

755
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,710
oh man that burnt fast oh
you know it is i think that had to be

756
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
you know it is i think that had to be
 

757
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,230
you know it is i think that had to be
extended for this to

758
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
extended for this to
 

759
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,150
extended for this to
fix itself let's try this

760
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
fix itself let's try this
 

761
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,430
fix itself let's try this
oh let's try this

762
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
oh let's try this
 

763
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,509
oh let's try this
there we go fixed finally

764
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
there we go fixed finally
 

765
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,749
there we go fixed finally
why was that so hard okay so now it's

766
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
why was that so hard okay so now it's
 

767
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,110
why was that so hard okay so now it's
gonna send these random pulses

768
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
gonna send these random pulses
 

769
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,389
gonna send these random pulses
oh it's broken again what the heck

770
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
oh it's broken again what the heck
 

771
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,470
oh it's broken again what the heck
maybe i gotta extend the repeater

772
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480

 

773
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,829

okay i'm to get this thing working

774
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
okay i'm to get this thing working
 

775
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,509
okay i'm to get this thing working
properly then i'll i'll start recording

776
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
properly then i'll i'll start recording
 

777
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,629
properly then i'll i'll start recording
again

778
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639

 

779
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,310

yeah i think i found the problem here

780
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
yeah i think i found the problem here
 

781
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,470
yeah i think i found the problem here
this was not expected i guess it's a

782
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
this was not expected i guess it's a
 

783
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,389
this was not expected i guess it's a
directional thing

784
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
directional thing
 

785
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,990
directional thing
i i built it facing a different

786
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
i i built it facing a different
 

787
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,150
i i built it facing a different
direction it seems to work

788
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
direction it seems to work
 

789
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,189
direction it seems to work
oh activity put out the fire first

790
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
oh activity put out the fire first
 

791
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,350
oh activity put out the fire first
because this one the piston always

792
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
because this one the piston always
 

793
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,230
because this one the piston always
glitches out

794
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240

 

795
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,710

it's really annoying

796
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720

 

797
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,670

oop all right so let's get this going

798
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680

 

799
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,710

that's fine it's fine

800
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
that's fine it's fine
 

801
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,509
that's fine it's fine
uh this one's working pretty good though

802
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
uh this one's working pretty good though
 

803
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,230
uh this one's working pretty good though
no problem

804
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
no problem
 

805
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,990
no problem
so far

806
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000

 

807
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,029

yeah glitched out again look at that i

808
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
yeah glitched out again look at that i
 

809
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,630
yeah glitched out again look at that i
don't know why it's glitching out it's

810
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
don't know why it's glitching out it's
 

811
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,270
don't know why it's glitching out it's
not like i'm

812
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
not like i'm
 

813
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,949
not like i'm
sending it a rapid pulse or anything

814
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
sending it a rapid pulse or anything
 

815
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,350
sending it a rapid pulse or anything
like that it's uh it's pretty normal

816
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360

 

817
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,110

i would think

818
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120

 

819
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,309

yeah because it's got to go through all

820
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
yeah because it's got to go through all
 

821
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,350
yeah because it's got to go through all
this wiring before it retracts right

822
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
this wiring before it retracts right
 

823
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,870
this wiring before it retracts right
it's not like i'm doing anything crazy

824
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
it's not like i'm doing anything crazy
 

825
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,549
it's not like i'm doing anything crazy
here

826
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
here
 

827
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,190
here
there's a delay in everything i don't

828
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
there's a delay in everything i don't
 

829
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,549
there's a delay in everything i don't
know

830
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
know
 

831
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,230
know
but yeah it'll shoot off one rocket

832
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
but yeah it'll shoot off one rocket
 

833
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,590
but yeah it'll shoot off one rocket
every time it goes

834
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
every time it goes
 

835
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,630
every time it goes
now with this setup though eventually

836
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
now with this setup though eventually
 

837
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,830
now with this setup though eventually
even if it's running properly like this

838
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
even if it's running properly like this
 

839
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,029
even if it's running properly like this
eventually this wool block is going to

840
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
eventually this wool block is going to
 

841
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,909
eventually this wool block is going to
burn

842
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
burn
 

843
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,070
burn
because there's like a two second or not

844
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
because there's like a two second or not
 

845
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,430
because there's like a two second or not
to say to tick delay

846
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
to say to tick delay
 

847
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,070
to say to tick delay
from for the piston to extend and in

848
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
from for the piston to extend and in
 

849
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,150
from for the piston to extend and in
that time it's possible the wool block

850
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
that time it's possible the wool block
 

851
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,430
that time it's possible the wool block
can burn

852
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
can burn
 

853
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,150
can burn
it's very unlikely and for what we're

854
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
it's very unlikely and for what we're
 

855
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,549
it's very unlikely and for what we're
doing

856
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
doing
 

857
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,070
doing
it doesn't really matter too much

858
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
it doesn't really matter too much
 

859
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,830
it doesn't really matter too much
if it does burn up because we're going

860
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
if it does burn up because we're going
 

861
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,270
if it does burn up because we're going
to

862
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
to
 

863
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,270
to
be making a backup of the fireworks show

864
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
be making a backup of the fireworks show
 

865
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,390
be making a backup of the fireworks show
and then loading

866
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
and then loading
 

867
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,710
and then loading
the backup afterwards again so we get

868
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
the backup afterwards again so we get
 

869
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,830
the backup afterwards again so we get
all the fireworks back

870
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
all the fireworks back
 

871
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,870
all the fireworks back
in our dispensers um

872
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
in our dispensers um
 

873
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,630
in our dispensers um
and all the wool blocks that burn we'll

874
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
and all the wool blocks that burn we'll
 

875
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,909
and all the wool blocks that burn we'll
be back too

876
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
be back too
 

877
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,430
be back too
so i think it'll be good

878
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
so i think it'll be good
 

879
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,549
so i think it'll be good
it'll be good uh they're used i think

880
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
it'll be good uh they're used i think
 

881
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,070
it'll be good uh they're used i think
the way i set this up originally i think

882
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
the way i set this up originally i think
 

883
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,630
the way i set this up originally i think
i used a crafting table

884
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
i used a crafting table
 

885
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,710
i used a crafting table
somewhere and crafting tables for the

886
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
somewhere and crafting tables for the
 

887
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,669
somewhere and crafting tables for the
longest time

888
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
longest time
 

889
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,430
longest time
they would cause fire to spread but they

890
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
they would cause fire to spread but they
 

891
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,950
they would cause fire to spread but they
didn't actually burn

892
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
didn't actually burn
 

893
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,470
didn't actually burn
now same with like wooden pressure

894
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
now same with like wooden pressure
 

895
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,590
now same with like wooden pressure
plates and stuff

896
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
plates and stuff
 

897
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,590
plates and stuff
uh they would cause fire to spread but

898
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
uh they would cause fire to spread but
 

899
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,789
uh they would cause fire to spread but
they wouldn't burn now i think they

900
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
they wouldn't burn now i think they
 

901
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,990
they wouldn't burn now i think they
fixed that in the game

902
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
fixed that in the game
 

903
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,190
fixed that in the game
because i don't know i tried it out

904
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
because i don't know i tried it out
 

905
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,390
because i don't know i tried it out
before and it would not

906
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
before and it would not
 

907
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,270
before and it would not
like fire should or it used to spread to

908
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
like fire should or it used to spread to
 

909
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,470
like fire should or it used to spread to
those blocks there

910
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
those blocks there
 

911
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,350
those blocks there
but i can't do it to happen now

912
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360

 

913
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,270

well i've tried reloading minecraft and

914
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
well i've tried reloading minecraft and
 

915
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,789
well i've tried reloading minecraft and
that didn't fix the problem and the

916
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
that didn't fix the problem and the
 

917
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,310
that didn't fix the problem and the
piston is still glitching out

918
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
piston is still glitching out
 

919
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,710
piston is still glitching out
i checked and it's not intersecting any

920
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
i checked and it's not intersecting any
 

921
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,750
i checked and it's not intersecting any
chunk boundaries

922
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
chunk boundaries
 

923
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,870
chunk boundaries
either except maybe vertically it is

924
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
either except maybe vertically it is
 

925
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,710
either except maybe vertically it is
but so is this one you would think they

926
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
but so is this one you would think they
 

927
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,710
but so is this one you would think they
would be affected the same if that was

928
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
would be affected the same if that was
 

929
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,870
would be affected the same if that was
the problem

930
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
the problem
 

931
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,230
the problem
um not a clue so i'll just have to be

932
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
um not a clue so i'll just have to be
 

933
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,590
um not a clue so i'll just have to be
careful when i build these i build them

934
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
careful when i build these i build them
 

935
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,549
careful when i build these i build them
facing the right way

936
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559

 

937
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,750

and there's one other issue

938
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
and there's one other issue
 

939
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,710
and there's one other issue
uh so the way i plan on on doing the

940
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
uh so the way i plan on on doing the
 

941
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,549
uh so the way i plan on on doing the
wiring

942
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
wiring
 

943
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,990
wiring
i'm going to like

944
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
i'm going to like
 

945
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,510
i'm going to like
in general when i'm doing stuff in my

946
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
in general when i'm doing stuff in my
 

947
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,110
in general when i'm doing stuff in my
world this is piston is going to be

948
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
world this is piston is going to be
 

949
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,190
world this is piston is going to be
extended at all times

950
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
extended at all times
 

951
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,990
extended at all times
so that this will block or this thing is

952
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
so that this will block or this thing is
 

953
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,270
so that this will block or this thing is
not running you know

954
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
not running you know
 

955
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,390
not running you know
but then when i want to start the

956
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
but then when i want to start the
 

957
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,310
but then when i want to start the
fireworks show up i'm going to send i'm

958
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,320
fireworks show up i'm going to send i'm
 

959
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,070
fireworks show up i'm going to send i'm
going to have a master switch that

960
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
going to have a master switch that
 

961
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,230
going to have a master switch that
turns all these machines on by

962
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
turns all these machines on by
 

963
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,510
turns all these machines on by
retracting the

964
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
retracting the
 

965
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,789
retracting the
piston there and then it can go

966
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
piston there and then it can go
 

967
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,909
piston there and then it can go
but when i do that

968
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
but when i do that
 

969
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,070
but when i do that
when i initially retract it it's going

970
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
when i initially retract it it's going
 

971
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,590
when i initially retract it it's going
to

972
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
to
 

973
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,430
to
cause one firework to go off from each

974
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440
cause one firework to go off from each
 

975
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,909
cause one firework to go off from each
dispenser

976
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
dispenser
 

977
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,350
dispenser
if i do it like this i might be able to

978
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
if i do it like this i might be able to
 

979
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,430
if i do it like this i might be able to
i haven't tried this but if maybe if i

980
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
i haven't tried this but if maybe if i
 

981
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,190
i haven't tried this but if maybe if i
invert this

982
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
invert this
 

983
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,390
invert this
i i'm not really i really haven't

984
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
i i'm not really i really haven't
 

985
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,590
i i'm not really i really haven't
thought this out or anything

986
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
thought this out or anything
 

987
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,990
thought this out or anything
but usually if something's not working

988
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
but usually if something's not working
 

989
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,630
but usually if something's not working
i'll try invert it

990
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
i'll try invert it
 

991
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,470
i'll try invert it
and see if that fixes it

992
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480

 

993
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,630

maybe if i invert this i won't have that

994
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
maybe if i invert this i won't have that
 

995
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,310
maybe if i invert this i won't have that
problem

996
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
problem
 

997
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,230
problem
but it might cause new problems we don't

998
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
but it might cause new problems we don't
 

999
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,470
but it might cause new problems we don't
know

1000
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
know
 

1001
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,750
know
still only shooting one that's good

1002
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
still only shooting one that's good
 

1003
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,470
still only shooting one that's good
okay let's try this uh when we turn it

1004
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
okay let's try this uh when we turn it
 

1005
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,750
okay let's try this uh when we turn it
off it shoots one

1006
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:49,760
off it shoots one
 

1007
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,950
off it shoots one
okay yeah that's what we're gonna do i

1008
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
okay yeah that's what we're gonna do i
 

1009
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,990
okay yeah that's what we're gonna do i
think gotta make sure we invert it one

1010
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
think gotta make sure we invert it one
 

1011
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,470
think gotta make sure we invert it one
more time

1012
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
more time
 

1013
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,549
more time
still working good okay

1014
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559

 

1015
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,110

aha awesome i think we're gonna have the

1016
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
aha awesome i think we're gonna have the
 

1017
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,230
aha awesome i think we're gonna have the
best color

1018
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
best color
 

1019
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,950
best color
our green dyes in our fireworks show

1020
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960

 

1021
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,830

i'm gonna plant another set of the cacti

1022
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
i'm gonna plant another set of the cacti
 

1023
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,390
i'm gonna plant another set of the cacti
here too

1024
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
here too
 

1025
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,750
here too
because i want to make sure we have

1026
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
because i want to make sure we have
 

1027
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,710
because i want to make sure we have
enough uh i think this first

1028
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
enough uh i think this first
 

1029
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,909
enough uh i think this first
fireworks show is going to be a little

1030
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
fireworks show is going to be a little
 

1031
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,430
fireworks show is going to be a little
bit wimpy though sadly because i

1032
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440

 

1033
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,870

i hate to say it but most of my

1034
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
i hate to say it but most of my
 

1035
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,310
i hate to say it but most of my
gunpowder converted to tnt form already

1036
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,320
gunpowder converted to tnt form already
 

1037
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,390
gunpowder converted to tnt form already
so i only have six stacks i'll probably

1038
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
so i only have six stacks i'll probably
 

1039
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,110
so i only have six stacks i'll probably
try to get some more before we do this

1040
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
try to get some more before we do this
 

1041
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,230
try to get some more before we do this
but

1042
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240

 

1043
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,549

yeah if you if you do the math well i've

1044
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
yeah if you if you do the math well i've
 

1045
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,990
yeah if you if you do the math well i've
done the math already

1046
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
done the math already
 

1047
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,870
done the math already
if we average for gunpowder per firework

1048
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
if we average for gunpowder per firework
 

1049
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,669
if we average for gunpowder per firework
that's not

1050
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
that's not
 

1051
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,909
that's not
very many actually let me do it again

1052
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
very many actually let me do it again
 

1053
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,350
very many actually let me do it again
yeah it's only going to be like 96

1054
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
yeah it's only going to be like 96
 

1055
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,510
yeah it's only going to be like 96
fireworks or so

1056
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
fireworks or so
 

1057
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,909
fireworks or so
so not going to be the most impressive

1058
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
so not going to be the most impressive
 

1059
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,430
so not going to be the most impressive
thing to begin with

1060
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
thing to begin with
 

1061
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,110
thing to begin with
but we will keep building it and i'm not

1062
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
but we will keep building it and i'm not
 

1063
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,950
but we will keep building it and i'm not
going to do it just subscriber specials

1064
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
going to do it just subscriber specials
 

1065
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,590
going to do it just subscriber specials
any kind of special we do or

1066
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
any kind of special we do or
 

1067
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,270
any kind of special we do or
if we just want to do something fun

1068
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
if we just want to do something fun
 

1069
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,870
if we just want to do something fun
every now and then i'll

1070
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
every now and then i'll
 

1071
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,270
every now and then i'll
probably make this thing go off

1072
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
probably make this thing go off
 

1073
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,350
probably make this thing go off
fireworks show go off i mean

1074
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
fireworks show go off i mean
 

1075
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,270
fireworks show go off i mean
and maybe improve it before i do that

1076
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
and maybe improve it before i do that
 

1077
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,870
and maybe improve it before i do that
um but yeah we're going to do it

1078
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
um but yeah we're going to do it
 

1079
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,310
um but yeah we're going to do it
over at our pond there so i'm going to

1080
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
over at our pond there so i'm going to
 

1081
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,390
over at our pond there so i'm going to
start setting it up we'll probably do

1082
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
start setting it up we'll probably do
 

1083
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,669
start setting it up we'll probably do
maybe at least 10 of those randomizer

1084
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
maybe at least 10 of those randomizer
 

1085
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,190
maybe at least 10 of those randomizer
things we set up there

1086
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
things we set up there
 

1087
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,029
things we set up there
and put them in the water

1088
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
and put them in the water
 

1089
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,590
and put them in the water
oh boy okay this is a very important

1090
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
oh boy okay this is a very important
 

1091
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,430
oh boy okay this is a very important
decision time for me

1092
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
decision time for me
 

1093
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,350
decision time for me
because what i decide is either going to

1094
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
because what i decide is either going to
 

1095
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,789
because what i decide is either going to
work out

1096
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
work out
 

1097
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,590
work out
pretty good or it's going to not work

1098
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
pretty good or it's going to not work
 

1099
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,149
pretty good or it's going to not work
out well

1100
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
out well
 

1101
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,110
out well
and take an unbelievable amount of my

1102
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
and take an unbelievable amount of my
 

1103
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,310
and take an unbelievable amount of my
time up

1104
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320
time up
 

1105
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,630
time up

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
in this lake
 

1109
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,990
in this lake
right i want them to shoot out from the

1110
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
right i want them to shoot out from the
 

1111
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,870
right i want them to shoot out from the
bottom of the lake

1112

bottom of the lake
 

1113
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,870
bottom of the lake
and come up i think that'll look cool

1114
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
and come up i think that'll look cool
 

1115
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,390
and come up i think that'll look cool
i want to spread them out as much as i

1116
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
i want to spread them out as much as i
 

1117
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,990
i want to spread them out as much as i
can like i said though for this first

1118
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
can like i said though for this first
 

1119
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,430
can like i said though for this first
launch it's going to be a little wimpy

1120
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
launch it's going to be a little wimpy
 

1121
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,870
launch it's going to be a little wimpy
we're only going to have like 10

1122
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
we're only going to have like 10
 

1123
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,669
we're only going to have like 10
little things set up eventually though i

1124
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
little things set up eventually though i
 

1125
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,870
little things set up eventually though i
want the whole lake

1126
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
want the whole lake
 

1127
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,230
want the whole lake
full full of those machines we'll do our

1128
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
full full of those machines we'll do our
 

1129
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,789
full full of those machines we'll do our
best to spread them out this first time

1130
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
best to spread them out this first time
 

1131
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,310
best to spread them out this first time
but

1132
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320

 

1133
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,830

the way i think i should do it start

1134
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
the way i think i should do it start
 

1135
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,350
the way i think i should do it start
like dig down and cut out

1136
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
like dig down and cut out
 

1137
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,750
like dig down and cut out
a grid pattern every five blocks of part

1138
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
a grid pattern every five blocks of part
 

1139
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,510
a grid pattern every five blocks of part
will space the machines they only take a

1140
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
will space the machines they only take a
 

1141
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,710
will space the machines they only take a
three

1142
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
three
 

1143
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,870
three
by four so i could put them

1144
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880

 

1145
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,430

well no that's about as tight as i would

1146
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
well no that's about as tight as i would
 

1147
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,510
well no that's about as tight as i would
want them i guess

1148
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
want them i guess
 

1149
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,430
want them i guess
so every every five blocks will have a

1150
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
so every every five blocks will have a
 

1151
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,029
so every every five blocks will have a
line for redstone

1152
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
line for redstone
 

1153
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,870
line for redstone
that will go to all the machines in the

1154
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
that will go to all the machines in the
 

1155
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,070
that will go to all the machines in the
lake

1156
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
lake
 

1157
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,470
lake
i have to decide how deep down i'm gonna

1158
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
i have to decide how deep down i'm gonna
 

1159
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,669
i have to decide how deep down i'm gonna
dig though

1160
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
dig though
 

1161
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,990
dig though
because yeah water and redstone they

1162
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
because yeah water and redstone they
 

1163
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,990
because yeah water and redstone they
are a pain to mix and i'm going to be

1164
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
are a pain to mix and i'm going to be
 

1165
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,230
are a pain to mix and i'm going to be
digging below the lake

1166
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
digging below the lake
 

1167
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,750
digging below the lake
the lake has sands in quite a few places

1168
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
the lake has sands in quite a few places
 

1169
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,029
the lake has sands in quite a few places
it's pretty good though there's actually

1170
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
it's pretty good though there's actually
 

1171
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,510
it's pretty good though there's actually
a lot of soil i'm happy to see that

1172
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
a lot of soil i'm happy to see that
 

1173
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,029
a lot of soil i'm happy to see that
but if i dig too close to

1174
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
but if i dig too close to
 

1175
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,470
but if i dig too close to
the bottom of the lake the sand is going

1176
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
the bottom of the lake the sand is going
 

1177
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,750
the bottom of the lake the sand is going
to fall and the water is going to pour

1178
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
to fall and the water is going to pour
 

1179
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,590
to fall and the water is going to pour
on my redstone so i have to go

1180
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600

 

1181
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,510

down i think i'm going to go

1182
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520

 

1183
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,789

15 blocks below this level maybe

1184
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799

 

1185
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,630

it's really hard to know for sure it's

1186
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
it's really hard to know for sure it's
 

1187
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,750
it's really hard to know for sure it's
the deepest right there

1188
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
the deepest right there
 

1189
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,029
the deepest right there
there's also all these like caves

1190
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
there's also all these like caves
 

1191
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,430
there's also all these like caves
uh in in the water here like look over

1192
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
uh in in the water here like look over
 

1193
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,110
uh in in the water here like look over
here there's a cave right here

1194
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120

 

1195
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,909

so i'm gonna have to deal with these two

1196
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919

 

1197
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,110

unexplored even um

1198
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
unexplored even um
 

1199
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,310
unexplored even um
hey get out of here

1200
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320

 

1201
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,710

yeah i think i'm gonna go 15 bucks or so

1202
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720

 

1203
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,070

yeah uh that's what i'll do

1204
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
yeah uh that's what i'll do
 

1205
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,230
yeah uh that's what i'll do
and i'll let you know how how happy i am

1206
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
and i'll let you know how how happy i am
 

1207
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,470
and i'll let you know how how happy i am
later with my decision

1208
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480

 

1209
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,909

yeah there's a lot of work involved to

1210
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
yeah there's a lot of work involved to
 

1211
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,590
yeah there's a lot of work involved to
this so i think for this first launch

1212
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
this so i think for this first launch
 

1213
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,549
this so i think for this first launch
i'm only going to dig

1214
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
i'm only going to dig
 

1215
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,750
i'm only going to dig
up to about x200

1216
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
up to about x200
 

1217
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,230
up to about x200
so our fireworks show our first one the

1218
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
so our fireworks show our first one the
 

1219
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,830
so our fireworks show our first one the
whole whole thing is going to happen in

1220
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
whole whole thing is going to happen in
 

1221
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,950
whole whole thing is going to happen in
this area of the lake

1222
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
this area of the lake
 

1223
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,789
this area of the lake
only and later we'll expand out further

1224
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
only and later we'll expand out further
 

1225
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,149
only and later we'll expand out further
and i figured out my positioning i think

1226
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
and i figured out my positioning i think
 

1227
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,549
and i figured out my positioning i think
it's going to be about i think it's 14

1228
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
it's going to be about i think it's 14
 

1229
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,909
it's going to be about i think it's 14
blocks maybe

1230
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
blocks maybe
 

1231
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,669
blocks maybe
maybe 13 but i'm going by

1232
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:35,679
maybe 13 but i'm going by
 

1233
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,710
maybe 13 but i'm going by
fives it's really important i go by

1234
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
fives it's really important i go by
 

1235
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,909
fives it's really important i go by
fives here

1236
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
fives here
 

1237
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,950
fives here
when i'm figuring this out

1238
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
when i'm figuring this out
 

1239
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,110
when i'm figuring this out
so this tunnel starts at uh at z360

1240
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
so this tunnel starts at uh at z360
 

1241
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,830
so this tunnel starts at uh at z360
this one is at 355. this one's at 350.

1242
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
this one is at 355. this one's at 350.
 

1243
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,990
this one is at 355. this one's at 350.
this main tunnel here is at three

1244
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
this main tunnel here is at three
 

1245
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,430
this main tunnel here is at three
all right negative 245 x our y

1246
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
all right negative 245 x our y
 

1247
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,710
all right negative 245 x our y
is at 50. um

1248
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
is at 50. um
 

1249
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,669
is at 50. um
so this is gonna make it a lot easier

1250
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
so this is gonna make it a lot easier
 

1251
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,750
so this is gonna make it a lot easier
when i'm figuring out where

1252
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
when i'm figuring out where
 

1253
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,269
when i'm figuring out where
i need to go because i'll probably have

1254
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
i need to go because i'll probably have
 

1255
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,590
i need to go because i'll probably have
to go

1256
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
to go
 

1257
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,789
to go
in the lake here and dig down to place

1258
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
in the lake here and dig down to place
 

1259
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,470
in the lake here and dig down to place
my dispensers and stuff

1260
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
my dispensers and stuff
 

1261
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,149
my dispensers and stuff
out after i finish setting up the

1262
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
out after i finish setting up the
 

1263
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,310
out after i finish setting up the
machine down below

1264
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320
machine down below
 

1265
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,149
machine down below
so that'll just make it easier to find

1266
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
so that'll just make it easier to find
 

1267
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,110
so that'll just make it easier to find
stuff

1268
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120

 

1269
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,110

oh this is not what i wanted to see

1270
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120

 

1271
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,750

a huge cave system underneath

1272
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760

 

1273
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,510

okay this is getting pretty close to

1274
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
okay this is getting pretty close to
 

1275
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,029
okay this is getting pretty close to
ready what i'm doing now

1276
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
ready what i'm doing now
 

1277
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,149
ready what i'm doing now
is just connecting the dispensers to the

1278
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
is just connecting the dispensers to the
 

1279
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,909
is just connecting the dispensers to the
things and this is how i'm doing it i

1280
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
things and this is how i'm doing it i
 

1281
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,950
things and this is how i'm doing it i
got

1282
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
got
 

1283
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,870
got
all my positions marked down on paper i

1284
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:44,880
all my positions marked down on paper i
 

1285
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,990
all my positions marked down on paper i
only set up nine of these things

1286
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
only set up nine of these things
 

1287
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,950
only set up nine of these things
um but we we probably don't have enough

1288
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
um but we we probably don't have enough
 

1289
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,029
um but we we probably don't have enough
fireworks to film anyway so

1290
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039
fireworks to film anyway so
 

1291
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,549
fireworks to film anyway so
i think that's good enough for today i

1292
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
i think that's good enough for today i
 

1293
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,310
i think that's good enough for today i
really gotta get to bed here it's

1294
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
really gotta get to bed here it's
 

1295
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,310
really gotta get to bed here it's
getting so late

1296
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
getting so late
 

1297
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,909
getting so late
this project is

1298
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
this project is
 

1299
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,070
this project is
very very time consuming

1300
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
very very time consuming
 

1301
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,470
very very time consuming
but it's okay it's okay it's gonna be

1302
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
but it's okay it's okay it's gonna be
 

1303
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,870
but it's okay it's okay it's gonna be
cool when it's all done

1304
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
cool when it's all done
 

1305
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,549
cool when it's all done
but yeah i've been working pretty much

can't wait to see it though it's going
 

1311
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,990
can't wait to see it though it's going
to be cool

1312
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
to be cool
 

1313
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,789
to be cool
break the ladder got the pumpkin as a

1314
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
break the ladder got the pumpkin as a
 

1315
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,750

connect to all these
 

1361
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,909
connect to all these
redstone things so i have to run a line

1362
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
redstone things so i have to run a line
 

1363
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,830
redstone things so i have to run a line
for each of these paths

1364
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
for each of these paths
 

1365
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,190
for each of these paths
it's going to be it's going to be

1366
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
it's going to be it's going to be

enough still we could put another layer
 

1421
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,190
enough still we could put another layer
of fire below this

1422
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
of fire below this
 

1423
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,830
of fire below this
and have like 16 fires it'll be twice as

1424
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
and have like 16 fires it'll be twice as

00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519

 

1467
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,029

okay i should have made it where i could

1470
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
okay i should have made it where i could
 

1471
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,149
okay i should have made it where i could
fill the dispensers from below here

1472
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
fill the dispensers from below here
 

1473
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,310
fill the dispensers from below here
that might have been better i could

1474
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
that might have been better i could
 

1475
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,870
that might have been better i could
still change it if i really want

1476
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:18,880
still change it if i really want
 

1477
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,029
still change it if i really want
oh i made a little bit of a mistake here

1478
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
oh i made a little bit of a mistake here
 

1479
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,509
oh i made a little bit of a mistake here
i guess this is supposed to be

1480
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:22,519
i guess this is supposed to be
 

1481
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,430
i guess this is supposed to be
extended when we start it otherwise it's

1482
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:25,440
extended when we start it otherwise it's
 

1483
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,190
extended when we start it otherwise it's
not going to work so i have to change

1484
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
not going to work so i have to change
 

1485
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,750
not going to work so i have to change
these again

1486
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760

 

1487
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,190

yeah like that so otherwise it won't

1488
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
yeah like that so otherwise it won't
 

1489
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,190
yeah like that so otherwise it won't
retract which is a problem

1490
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,200

 

1491
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,789

00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
i'm gonna make mostly simple rockets i
 

1511
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,549
i'm gonna make mostly simple rockets i
think this first time

1512
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
think this first time
 

1513
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,310
think this first time
so it'll go the gunpowder will go a

1514
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
so it'll go the gunpowder will go a
 

1515
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,870
so it'll go the gunpowder will go a
little further that way

1516
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
little further that way
 

1517
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,470
little further that way
but yeah let's get this going i'm gonna

1518
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
but yeah let's get this going i'm gonna
 

1519
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,430
but yeah let's get this going i'm gonna
make i think

1520
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440

 

1521
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,549

eight of each color is the big basic

1522
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
eight of each color is the big basic
 

1523
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,509
eight of each color is the big basic
stars you know

1524
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519

 

1525
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,470

i think actually you know what i i've

1526
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
i think actually you know what i i've
 

1527
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,110
i think actually you know what i i've
been wondering

1528
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
been wondering
 

1529
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,269
been wondering
like i think they stack but i don't know

1530
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:25,279
like i think they stack but i don't know
 

1531
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,389
like i think they stack but i don't know
how

1532
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
how
 

1533
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,430
how
how many you can stack you know what i

1534
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
how many you can stack you know what i
 

1535
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,549
how many you can stack you know what i
mean

1536
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
mean
 

1537
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,149
mean
uh let's try this out

1538
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:36,159

 

1539
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,470

that's a low flying

1540
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
that's a low flying
 

1541
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,070
that's a low flying
9 10 11 12 13 14 16

1542
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
9 10 11 12 13 14 16
 

1543
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,710
9 10 11 12 13 14 16
16 and a stack that's crazy

1544
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:50,720

 

1545
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,070

does it go more i i don't want more but

1546
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
does it go more i i don't want more but
 

1547
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,149
does it go more i i don't want more but
i'm curious now how

1548
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:56,159
i'm curious now how
 

1549
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,029
i'm curious now how
we'll do 17.

1550
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,039

 

1551
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,710

that's pretty cool man i can fit a lot

1552
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
that's pretty cool man i can fit a lot
 

1553
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,909
that's pretty cool man i can fit a lot
of these in each dispenser

1554
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
of these in each dispenser
 

1555
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,470
of these in each dispenser
17 even wow oh man

1556
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,480

 

1557
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,470

yeah i don't want to that's too many

1558
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:14,480
yeah i don't want to that's too many
 

1559
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,669
yeah i don't want to that's too many
though i don't want to do

1560
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
though i don't want to do
 

1561
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,269
though i don't want to do
more than that but i'll probably make

1562
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:17,279
more than that but i'll probably make
 

1563
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,870
more than that but i'll probably make
eight of each

1564
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
eight of each
 

1565
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,070
eight of each
each color just a basic level one

1566
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
each color just a basic level one
 

1567
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,230
each color just a basic level one
flight uh basic explosion i guess

1568
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,240
flight uh basic explosion i guess
 

1569
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,630
flight uh basic explosion i guess
uh so that that'll be 16 times eight how

1570
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
uh so that that'll be 16 times eight how
 

1571
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,230
uh so that that'll be 16 times eight how
many is that

1572
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
many is that
 

1573
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,669
many is that
it's not going to use all my gunpowder

1574
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:33,679
it's not going to use all my gunpowder
 

1575
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,070
it's not going to use all my gunpowder
16 times eight

1576
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
16 times eight
 

1577
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,350
16 times eight
it's going to use two stacks of it darn

1578
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360

 

1579
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,870

yeah it's a good start though i'm gonna

1580
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
yeah it's a good start though i'm gonna
 

1581
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,470
yeah it's a good start though i'm gonna
do it

1582
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480

 

1583
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,710

oh you know what it was actually 16

1584
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
oh you know what it was actually 16
 

1585
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,070
oh you know what it was actually 16
times eight times

1586
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
times eight times
 

1587
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,669
times eight times
two because each of them needs two

1588
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:51,679
two because each of them needs two
 

1589
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,509
two because each of them needs two
gunpowder for

1590
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:53,519
gunpowder for
 

1591
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,029
gunpowder for
eight of the basic rockets for each

1592
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,039
eight of the basic rockets for each
 

1593
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,430
eight of the basic rockets for each
color

1594
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440

 

1595
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,990

but yeah i mean i made those and i made

1596

uh so i'm gonna start distributing these
 

1607
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,829
uh so i'm gonna start distributing these
through our dispensers i'm gonna put

1608
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
through our dispensers i'm gonna put
 

1609
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,669
through our dispensers i'm gonna put
two stacks for each and that's

1610
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
two stacks for each and that's
 

1611
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,869
two stacks for each and that's
yeah it's not they're not even going to

1612
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
yeah it's not they're not even going to
 

1613
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,270
yeah it's not they're not even going to
become close to full so

1614
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,280
become close to full so
 

1615
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,470
become close to full so

with a grain of salt though it's

1658
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
with a grain of salt though it's
 

1659
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,750
with a grain of salt though it's
it's probably going to be a little bit

1660
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
it's probably going to be a little bit
 

1661
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,829
it's probably going to be a little bit
slow there's not as many

1662
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
slow there's not as many
 

1663
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,910
slow there's not as many
firework dispensers as i'd like and

1664
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
firework dispensers as i'd like and
 

1665
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,069
firework dispensers as i'd like and
there's not as many fireworks as i'd

1666
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
there's not as many fireworks as i'd
 

1667
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,990

like and all that
 

1669

like and all that
but you know what something i thought

1670
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
but you know what something i thought
 

1671
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,510
but you know what something i thought
about too i could probably change the

1672
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
about too i could probably change the
 

1673
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,109
about too i could probably change the
speed of this thing by adjusting the

1674
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119

1813
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,470
our fireworks show i
came down to inspect what happened

00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,480
came down to inspect what happened
 

1815
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,829
came down to inspect what happened
because it seemed like it slowed down

1816
00:38:58,829 --> 00:38:58,839
because it seemed like it slowed down
 

1817
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,310

actually and yeah the wolf got on fire

1818
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
actually and yeah the wolf got on fire
 

1819
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,870
actually and yeah the wolf got on fire
what i did before the show is i i ended

1820
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
what i did before the show is i i ended
 

1821
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,349
what i did before the show is i i ended
up

1822
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:05,359
up
 

1823
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,550
up
extending this repeater because

1824
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
extending this repeater because
 

1825
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,790
extending this repeater because
this torch was flickering too quickly

1826
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
this torch was flickering too quickly
 

1827
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,390
this torch was flickering too quickly
for the dispenser it wasn't shooting the

1828
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,400
for the dispenser it wasn't shooting the
 

1829
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,710
for the dispenser it wasn't shooting the
fireworks so i had to

1830
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
fireworks so i had to
 

1831
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,310
fireworks so i had to
extend the the pulse length on this wire

1832
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:18,320
extend the the pulse length on this wire
 

1833
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,710
extend the the pulse length on this wire
and because of that the wool burnt a lot

1834
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:20,720
and because of that the wool burnt a lot
 

1835
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,510
and because of that the wool burnt a lot
faster

1836
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:21,520
faster
 

1837
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,990
faster
so it ended the show quickly there

1838
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,000
so it ended the show quickly there
 

1839
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,270
so it ended the show quickly there
