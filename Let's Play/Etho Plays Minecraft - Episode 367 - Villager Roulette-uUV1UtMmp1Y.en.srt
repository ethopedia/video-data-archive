00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,670
there's windmill keepers but I don't
think there actually is right I think

482
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
think there actually is right I think
 

483
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,340
think there actually is right I think
that's something I made up in my head

484
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,350
that's something I made up in my head
 

485
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,180
that's something I made up in my head
anyway that's that's the style we'll

486
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,190
anyway that's that's the style we'll
 

487
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,860
anyway that's that's the style we'll
probably use the amplified terrain but

488
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:07,870
probably use the amplified terrain but
 

489
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,300
probably use the amplified terrain but
it's not what we're going to be using at

490
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,310
it's not what we're going to be using at
 

491
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,300
it's not what we're going to be using at
our next project here I scouted out a

492
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,310
our next project here I scouted out a
 

493
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,240
our next project here I scouted out a
location and I think over here is pretty

494
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,250
location and I think over here is pretty
 

495
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,760
location and I think over here is pretty
sweet this is where we are going to

496
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:17,770
sweet this is where we are going to
 

497
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,580
sweet this is where we are going to
build the Nexus so yeah

498
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,590
build the Nexus so yeah
 

499
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,530
build the Nexus so yeah
so I know I said I wouldn't start this

500
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:23,540
so I know I said I wouldn't start this
 

501
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,010
so I know I said I wouldn't start this
until we got all the the supplies ready

502
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,020
until we got all the the supplies ready
 

503
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,600
until we got all the the supplies ready
but I think we can at least lay the

504
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:28,610
but I think we can at least lay the
 

505
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,400
but I think we can at least lay the
groundwork this is not like a something

506
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,410
groundwork this is not like a something
 

507
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,519
groundwork this is not like a something
I can do in a single episode anyway so

508
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:33,529
I can do in a single episode anyway so
 

509
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,170
I can do in a single episode anyway so
we'll just like do some of the

510
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,180
we'll just like do some of the
 

511
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,570
we'll just like do some of the
groundwork framing and that kind of

512
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:37,580
groundwork framing and that kind of
 

513
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,750
groundwork framing and that kind of
stuff get started on it anyway and that

514
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:40,760
stuff get started on it anyway and that
 

515
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,980
stuff get started on it anyway and that
way I don't build the whole thing and

516
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:41,990
way I don't build the whole thing and
 

517
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,470
way I don't build the whole thing and
then find out at the end of the episode

518
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:43,480
then find out at the end of the episode
 

519
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,170
then find out at the end of the episode
you guys don't like it or something so I

520
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,180
you guys don't like it or something so I
 

521
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,260
you guys don't like it or something so I
can sort of play around with the looks a

522
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,270
can sort of play around with the looks a
 

523
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,579
can sort of play around with the looks a
little bit and then get your feedback

524
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:51,589
little bit and then get your feedback
 

525
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,570
little bit and then get your feedback
before I finish the whole thing

526
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:55,580
before I finish the whole thing
 

527
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,329
before I finish the whole thing
so Plains biome is pretty nice because

528
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:58,339
so Plains biome is pretty nice because
 

529
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,940
so Plains biome is pretty nice because
it's nice and flat here so here's make

530
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:00,950
it's nice and flat here so here's make
 

531
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,150
it's nice and flat here so here's make
setting this up easy I think I'm going

532
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
setting this up easy I think I'm going
 

533
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,070
setting this up easy I think I'm going
to build it partially in the hill and

534
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,080
to build it partially in the hill and
 

535
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,980
to build it partially in the hill and
partially out of it and if we want it to

536
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:08,990
partially out of it and if we want it to
 

537
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,670
partially out of it and if we want it to
look more in the hill later we can just

538
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
look more in the hill later we can just
 

539
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,690
look more in the hill later we can just
cover it with dirt or something

540
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:13,700
cover it with dirt or something
 

541
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,079
cover it with dirt or something
afterwards and like build a mountain

542
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:17,089
afterwards and like build a mountain
 

543
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,920
afterwards and like build a mountain
around it building a mountain on our

544
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,930
around it building a mountain on our
 

545
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,600
around it building a mountain on our
building around the building sounds like

546
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:22,610
building around the building sounds like
 

547
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,510
building around the building sounds like
a big job but compared to how much work

548
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:25,520
a big job but compared to how much work
 

549
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
a big job but compared to how much work
this projects gonna be over all that's

550
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,530
this projects gonna be over all that's
 

551
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,030
this projects gonna be over all that's
gonna be a really small thing to do if

552
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
gonna be a really small thing to do if
 

553
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,620
gonna be a really small thing to do if
we do end up doing that um

554
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:34,630
we do end up doing that um
 

555
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:45,510
we do end up doing that um
TNT woo let's see how messy this is

556
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:45,520

 

557
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,860

Oh Oh

558
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:49,870

 

559
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,940

okay good so far

560
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:53,950

 

561
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,050

whoo

562
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,060
whoo
 

563
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,040
whoo
Oh how far down this go a little deeper

564
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,050
Oh how far down this go a little deeper
 

565
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,620
Oh how far down this go a little deeper
than I wanted

566
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:01,630
than I wanted
 

567
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,760
than I wanted
looks like cleared up most of it that

568
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:03,770
looks like cleared up most of it that
 

569
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,780
looks like cleared up most of it that
whoa I wasn't too careful with how I

570
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:07,790
whoa I wasn't too careful with how I
 

571
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,400
whoa I wasn't too careful with how I
placed the TNT there I just sort of

572
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,410
placed the TNT there I just sort of
 

573
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,800
placed the TNT there I just sort of
spammed it and I wasn't sure if it would

574
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:11,810
spammed it and I wasn't sure if it would
 

575
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:18,070
spammed it and I wasn't sure if it would
be too clean looks okay though yeah I

576
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,080
be too clean looks okay though yeah I
 

577
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,120
be too clean looks okay though yeah I
think this cleared out a pretty good

578
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,130
think this cleared out a pretty good
 

579
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,420
think this cleared out a pretty good
area so I'm going to clean the rest of

580
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:22,430
area so I'm going to clean the rest of
 

581
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,570
area so I'm going to clean the rest of
this up I have a haste to begin on top

582
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:25,580
this up I have a haste to begin on top
 

583
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,910
this up I have a haste to begin on top
of the mountain right now so I can - out

584
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
of the mountain right now so I can - out
 

585
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,620
of the mountain right now so I can - out
pretty quick the TNT was more just for

586
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:29,630
pretty quick the TNT was more just for
 

587
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,930
pretty quick the TNT was more just for
fun although it does clear out a pretty

588
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:31,940
fun although it does clear out a pretty
 

589
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,210
fun although it does clear out a pretty
good area - when you use a lot of it

590
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:36,220

 

591
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,260

over there some weird cave over top and

598
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,310
over there some weird cave over top and
 

599
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,750
over there some weird cave over top and
down goes the Sun so I'm just chipping

600
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:49,760
down goes the Sun so I'm just chipping
 

601
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,010
down goes the Sun so I'm just chipping
away here this is a scary part for me

602
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,020
away here this is a scary part for me
 

603
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,900
away here this is a scary part for me
this is when the thoughts go in my head

604
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:55,910
this is when the thoughts go in my head
 

605
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,790
this is when the thoughts go in my head
like did I did I start this wrong is

606
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:57,800
like did I did I start this wrong is
 

607
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,860
like did I did I start this wrong is
this was this a bad idea to TNT the

608
00:15:59,860 --> 00:15:59,870
this was this a bad idea to TNT the
 

609
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,990
this was this a bad idea to TNT the
mountain should I have built it a little

610
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
mountain should I have built it a little
 

611
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,940
mountain should I have built it a little
lower a little higher a different spot I

612
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:03,950
lower a little higher a different spot I
 

613
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,880
lower a little higher a different spot I
don't know and I always get worried

614
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:06,890
don't know and I always get worried
 

615
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,890
don't know and I always get worried
could with such a big project like this

616
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:08,900
could with such a big project like this
 

617
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,590
could with such a big project like this
any little mistake can have huge

618
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
any little mistake can have huge
 

619
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,590
any little mistake can have huge
consequences later and this is not a

620
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:14,600
consequences later and this is not a
 

621
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,510
consequences later and this is not a
fully planned out project either like

622
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:16,520
fully planned out project either like
 

623
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,130
fully planned out project either like
don't don't think I've got this all

624
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:18,140
don't don't think I've got this all
 

625
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,140
don't don't think I've got this all
figured out I have the redstone

626
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,150
figured out I have the redstone
 

627
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,930
figured out I have the redstone
mechanics figured out but the actual

628
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:22,940
mechanics figured out but the actual
 

629
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,270
mechanics figured out but the actual
looks and shape of the place I have not

630
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,280
looks and shape of the place I have not
 

631
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,310
looks and shape of the place I have not
planned yet so we're going to be doing

632
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:27,320
planned yet so we're going to be doing
 

633
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,410
planned yet so we're going to be doing
probably a little bit of problem-solving

634
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:29,420
probably a little bit of problem-solving
 

635
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,090
probably a little bit of problem-solving
together as we build this but not much

636
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,100
together as we build this but not much
 

637
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,550
together as we build this but not much
today we're just laying the framework in

638
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
today we're just laying the framework in
 

639
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,220
today we're just laying the framework in
the yeah getting things set up here so

640
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,230
the yeah getting things set up here so
 

641
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,870
the yeah getting things set up here so
that we can start building it basically

642
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
that we can start building it basically
 

643
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,810
that we can start building it basically
I think this is as far in as I will go

644
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:43,820
I think this is as far in as I will go
 

645
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,030
I think this is as far in as I will go
with my planning I figured that would be

646
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,040
with my planning I figured that would be
 

647
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,100
with my planning I figured that would be
40 blocks long for the main room there's

648
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,110
40 blocks long for the main room there's
 

649
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,630
40 blocks long for the main room there's
gonna be three rooms to this there's

650
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:52,640
gonna be three rooms to this there's
 

651
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,130
gonna be three rooms to this there's
going to be the main room with the

652
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,140
going to be the main room with the
 

653
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,230
going to be the main room with the
chests that store stuff there's going to

654
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
chests that store stuff there's going to
 

655
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,450
chests that store stuff there's going to
be a control room in front of that and

656
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:58,460
be a control room in front of that and
 

657
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,450
be a control room in front of that and
then I think an overflow storage room is

658
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:03,460
then I think an overflow storage room is
 

659
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,710
then I think an overflow storage room is
the way I'm planning on doing this in

660
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:05,720
the way I'm planning on doing this in
 

661
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,850
the way I'm planning on doing this in
the main room

662
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:06,860
the main room
 

663
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,020
the main room
I'm going to give every single item the

664
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,030
I'm going to give every single item the
 

665
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,210
I'm going to give every single item the
same amount of storage then for things

666
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:13,220
same amount of storage then for things
 

667
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,549
same amount of storage then for things
like cobble and sand and and that kind

668
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:15,559
like cobble and sand and and that kind
 

669
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,960
like cobble and sand and and that kind
of stuff that will probably go to the

670
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:16,970
of stuff that will probably go to the
 

671
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,850
of stuff that will probably go to the
overflow room and then we'll have to

672
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:18,860
overflow room and then we'll have to
 

673
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,189
overflow room and then we'll have to
figure something special Oh special to

674
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
figure something special Oh special to
 

675
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,960
figure something special Oh special to
do with that yeah with this build I am

676
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:25,970
do with that yeah with this build I am
 

677
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,329
do with that yeah with this build I am
focusing more on function than looks so

678
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:28,339
focusing more on function than looks so
 

679
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,430
focusing more on function than looks so
I'm just going to say that right off the

680
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm just going to say that right off the
 

681
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,370
I'm just going to say that right off the
bat here JC works expecting something

682
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:33,380
bat here JC works expecting something
 

683
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,370
bat here JC works expecting something
looking incredibly amazing I just want

684
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:36,380
looking incredibly amazing I just want
 

685
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,669
looking incredibly amazing I just want
this thing to work and if it looks looks

686
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
this thing to work and if it looks looks
 

687
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,980
this thing to work and if it looks looks
good all the better but I just want it

688
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:41,990
good all the better but I just want it
 

689
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,039
good all the better but I just want it
to work so we're trying to just get it

690
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,049
to work so we're trying to just get it
 

691
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,580
to work so we're trying to just get it
get it together here anyway I was

692
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:48,590
get it together here anyway I was
 

693
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:54,520
get it together here anyway I was
backing a little bit oh boy the doubts

694
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,530
backing a little bit oh boy the doubts
 

695
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,169
backing a little bit oh boy the doubts
are setting in guys I'm starting to have

696
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:56,179
are setting in guys I'm starting to have
 

697
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:58,000
are setting in guys I'm starting to have
second thoughts about how I'm doing this

698
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,010
second thoughts about how I'm doing this
 

699
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,030
second thoughts about how I'm doing this
now now that I see it now that I'm

700
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,040
now now that I see it now that I'm
 

701
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,539
now now that I see it now that I'm
thinking about it a little more so let's

702
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:04,549
thinking about it a little more so let's
 

703
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:07,210
thinking about it a little more so let's
run through this okay so first off the

704
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,220
run through this okay so first off the
 

705
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,760
run through this okay so first off the
storage room with the chests I expect is

706
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:09,770
storage room with the chests I expect is
 

707
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,159
storage room with the chests I expect is
going to be at least 40 blocks long so

708
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:12,169
going to be at least 40 blocks long so
 

709
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,730
going to be at least 40 blocks long so
that's from this Storch to the back wall

710
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:14,740
that's from this Storch to the back wall
 

711
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,700
that's from this Storch to the back wall
probably 45 to 50 though really and then

712
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:18,710
probably 45 to 50 though really and then
 

713
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,130
probably 45 to 50 though really and then
we'll have the control room in front of

714
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,140
we'll have the control room in front of
 

715
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,100
we'll have the control room in front of
it so that would be like from here to I

716
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,110
it so that would be like from here to I
 

717
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,539
it so that would be like from here to I
don't know how big it's gonna be but

718
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:25,549
don't know how big it's gonna be but
 

719
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,799
don't know how big it's gonna be but
maybe like here let's say I feel like

720
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:29,809
maybe like here let's say I feel like
 

721
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,930
maybe like here let's say I feel like
maybe we should go further that way so

722
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:31,940
maybe we should go further that way so
 

723
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,480
maybe we should go further that way so
it's more built into the mountain but

724
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,490
it's more built into the mountain but
 

725
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,990
it's more built into the mountain but
also I'm starting to think it would be

726
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
also I'm starting to think it would be
 

727
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,260
also I'm starting to think it would be
cool if we went down some stairs from

728
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,270
cool if we went down some stairs from
 

729
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,980
cool if we went down some stairs from
the control room

730
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:41,990
the control room
 

731
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,539
the control room
into the storage room like if we went

732
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:43,549
into the storage room like if we went
 

733
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:46,539
into the storage room like if we went
down maybe five to seven blocks of

734
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:46,549
down maybe five to seven blocks of
 

735
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:49,840
down maybe five to seven blocks of
stairs and like this is one two three so

736
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:49,850
stairs and like this is one two three so
 

737
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,400
stairs and like this is one two three so
we wouldn't want to go at least four

738
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,410
we wouldn't want to go at least four
 

739
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,490
we wouldn't want to go at least four
blocks down which makes me think I took

740
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:54,500
blocks down which makes me think I took
 

741
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,380
blocks down which makes me think I took
out too much of the ceiling here it's

742
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,390
out too much of the ceiling here it's
 

743
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,150
out too much of the ceiling here it's
like it should be maybe that high which

744
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:01,160
like it should be maybe that high which
 

745
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,980
like it should be maybe that high which
isn't a problem really because I can

746
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:02,990
isn't a problem really because I can
 

747
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,730
isn't a problem really because I can
just like put some dirt over over top in

748
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:06,740
just like put some dirt over over top in
 

749
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,110
just like put some dirt over over top in
front of it and it'll look like it's

750
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,120
front of it and it'll look like it's
 

751
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:16,630
front of it and it'll look like it's
it's shorter hmm yeah so there's going

752
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
it's shorter hmm yeah so there's going
 

753
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,730
it's shorter hmm yeah so there's going
to be basically two tunnels to this

754
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:18,740
to be basically two tunnels to this
 

755
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,070
to be basically two tunnels to this
thing I think is the way I'm going

756
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
thing I think is the way I'm going
 

757
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,289
thing I think is the way I'm going
do it so there'll be one there one there

758
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:22,299
do it so there'll be one there one there
 

759
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,060
do it so there'll be one there one there
they'll probably connect at the back so

760
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,070
they'll probably connect at the back so
 

761
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,399
they'll probably connect at the back so
you can like go around do a horseshoe

762
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:26,409
you can like go around do a horseshoe
 

763
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:29,009
you can like go around do a horseshoe
type of thing and then from the control

764
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:29,019
type of thing and then from the control
 

765
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:31,500
type of thing and then from the control
room the stairs will probably split two

766
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:31,510
room the stairs will probably split two
 

767
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,799
room the stairs will probably split two
ways so like a fork that goes either to

768
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:34,809
ways so like a fork that goes either to
 

769
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:41,759
ways so like a fork that goes either to
the right or the left yeah tell you what

770
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:41,769
the right or the left yeah tell you what
 

771
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:45,389
the right or the left yeah tell you what
I'm going to show you the faceplate to

772
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:45,399
I'm going to show you the faceplate to
 

773
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,039
I'm going to show you the faceplate to
the Redstone I don't want to show you as

774
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,049
the Redstone I don't want to show you as
 

775
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,500
the Redstone I don't want to show you as
to much like how it's gonna work just

776
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,510
to much like how it's gonna work just
 

777
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,720
to much like how it's gonna work just
yet I want to build up a bit of a shock

778
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:51,730
yet I want to build up a bit of a shock
 

779
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,240
yet I want to build up a bit of a shock
and awe factor to it because when you

780
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,250
and awe factor to it because when you
 

781
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,789
and awe factor to it because when you
see it you're gonna be like oh he plans

782
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:56,799
see it you're gonna be like oh he plans
 

783
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,750
see it you're gonna be like oh he plans
to do that are you serious and a lot of

784
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:00,760
to do that are you serious and a lot of
 

785
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,180
to do that are you serious and a lot of
this will make more sense later but I

786
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,190
this will make more sense later but I
 

787
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,460
this will make more sense later but I
just want to show you maybe how will do

788
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,470
just want to show you maybe how will do
 

789
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,190
just want to show you maybe how will do
the faceplate to the storage units

790
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,200
the faceplate to the storage units
 

791
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,009
the faceplate to the storage units
alright guys so my plan is to build it

792
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:14,019
alright guys so my plan is to build it
 

793
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,240
alright guys so my plan is to build it
out of quartz

794
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,250
out of quartz
 

795
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,669
out of quartz
maybe hardened clay maybe some glass

796
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
maybe hardened clay maybe some glass
 

797
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,919
maybe hardened clay maybe some glass
maybe some coal blocks if we can work it

798
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:19,929
maybe some coal blocks if we can work it
 

799
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,980
maybe some coal blocks if we can work it
all out I'm not sure you'll have to let

800
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:22,990
all out I'm not sure you'll have to let
 

801
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,590
all out I'm not sure you'll have to let
me know if you like that idea my my

802
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
me know if you like that idea my my
 

803
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,450
me know if you like that idea my my
thinking behind it is it's like a

804
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:27,460
thinking behind it is it's like a
 

805
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,180
thinking behind it is it's like a
high-tech redstone a futuristic crazy

806
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,190
high-tech redstone a futuristic crazy
 

807
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,419
high-tech redstone a futuristic crazy
you know type of building maybe it

808
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:36,429
you know type of building maybe it
 

809
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,930
you know type of building maybe it
should be like quartz and clean type of

810
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:39,940
should be like quartz and clean type of
 

811
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,549
should be like quartz and clean type of
building instead of like medieval or

812
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:41,559
building instead of like medieval or
 

813
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,070
building instead of like medieval or
something like that that's why I chose

814
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
something like that that's why I chose
 

815
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,860
something like that that's why I chose
quartz I have a pretty decent supply of

816
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:46,870
quartz I have a pretty decent supply of
 

817
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,440
quartz I have a pretty decent supply of
it built up right now so hopefully I

818
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,450
it built up right now so hopefully I
 

819
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,509
it built up right now so hopefully I
have enough to make it happen it's kind

820
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:54,519
have enough to make it happen it's kind
 

821
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,899
have enough to make it happen it's kind
of gonna go like this so basically row

822
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:57,909
of gonna go like this so basically row
 

823
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:01,580
of gonna go like this so basically row
of chess and then hoppers above those

824
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,590
of chess and then hoppers above those
 

825
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,720
of chess and then hoppers above those
and then more chess no I didn't bring

826
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:06,730
and then more chess no I didn't bring
 

827
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,720
and then more chess no I didn't bring
enough chess start it above like this

828
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:11,730
enough chess start it above like this
 

829
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,190
enough chess start it above like this
this will be a double chest oh I do have

830
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
this will be a double chest oh I do have
 

831
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,220
this will be a double chest oh I do have
enough what was I thinking there I don't

832
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,230
enough what was I thinking there I don't
 

833
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,490
enough what was I thinking there I don't
know

834
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:20,500
know
 

835
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,269
know
I'm crazy alright I can't jump and then

836
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:24,279
I'm crazy alright I can't jump and then
 

837
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,940
I'm crazy alright I can't jump and then
maybe this will go up one more one more

838
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:26,950
maybe this will go up one more one more
 

839
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,060
maybe this will go up one more one more
and then stairs running across like so

840
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,070
and then stairs running across like so
 

841
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,779
and then stairs running across like so
creeper

842
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:33,789
creeper
 

843
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,659
creeper
no there's still a few dark spots on I'm

844
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:36,669
no there's still a few dark spots on I'm
 

845
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:41,129
no there's still a few dark spots on I'm
trying to be careful and then mmm so

846
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:41,139
trying to be careful and then mmm so
 

847
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,529
trying to be careful and then mmm so
that's pretty plain as it is so maybe we

848
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:43,539
that's pretty plain as it is so maybe we
 

849
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,869
that's pretty plain as it is so maybe we
will try add some 3d depth to it so I

850
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:45,879
will try add some 3d depth to it so I
 

851
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,729
will try add some 3d depth to it so I
like bringing this out one more or

852
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:47,739
like bringing this out one more or
 

853
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:53,340
like bringing this out one more or
something I don't know exactly like so

854
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,350
something I don't know exactly like so
 

855
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,719
something I don't know exactly like so
and then some half slabs on the ground

856
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:57,729
and then some half slabs on the ground
 

857
00:21:57,729 --> 00:22:00,690
and then some half slabs on the ground
here I don't know how I'm going to work

858
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:00,700
here I don't know how I'm going to work
 

859
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,259
here I don't know how I'm going to work
the clay in yet though like any ideas

860
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:04,269
the clay in yet though like any ideas
 

861
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:09,979
the clay in yet though like any ideas
guys any ideas maybe could we do this

862
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:09,989

 

863
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:12,719

maybe I'll have it in the ground in

864
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:12,729
maybe I'll have it in the ground in
 

865
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:14,669
maybe I'll have it in the ground in
places I don't know exactly what I'm

866
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:14,679
places I don't know exactly what I'm
 

867
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:17,700
places I don't know exactly what I'm
going to do I haven't planned planned

868
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,710
going to do I haven't planned planned
 

869
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,859
going to do I haven't planned planned
this out too much just yet

870
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:19,869
this out too much just yet
 

871
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:22,469
this out too much just yet
but then if I want to do item frames

872
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:22,479
but then if I want to do item frames
 

873
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,659
but then if I want to do item frames
that's will they'll go and I'll most

874
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:24,669
that's will they'll go and I'll most
 

875
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,239
that's will they'll go and I'll most
likely have signs saying what each item

876
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:27,249
likely have signs saying what each item
 

877
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:33,180
likely have signs saying what each item
is all right so that's the basic just do

878
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,190
is all right so that's the basic just do
 

879
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,269
is all right so that's the basic just do
it the basic gist of it I'm mumbling

880
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:36,279
it the basic gist of it I'm mumbling
 

881
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:40,019
it the basic gist of it I'm mumbling
here I don't like this I don't know how

882
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:40,029
here I don't like this I don't know how
 

883
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,330
here I don't like this I don't know how
to use the clay it's going to be all

884
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:42,340
to use the clay it's going to be all
 

885
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,729
to use the clay it's going to be all
quartz nothing but quartz pure white as

886
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:44,739
quartz nothing but quartz pure white as
 

887
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:49,680
quartz nothing but quartz pure white as
far as I can see yeah so the idea is I

888
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:49,690
far as I can see yeah so the idea is I
 

889
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,869
far as I can see yeah so the idea is I
would then mirror it on the opposite

890
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:51,879
would then mirror it on the opposite
 

891
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:53,700
would then mirror it on the opposite
side I don't know how wide I'm making

892
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:53,710
side I don't know how wide I'm making
 

893
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,320
side I don't know how wide I'm making
this either yet but I'm guessing I want

894
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,330
this either yet but I'm guessing I want
 

895
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,049
this either yet but I'm guessing I want
at least at least that probably even

896
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:01,059
at least at least that probably even
 

897
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:07,259
at least at least that probably even
more maybe maybe this far and then we'll

898
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:07,269
more maybe maybe this far and then we'll
 

899
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,210
more maybe maybe this far and then we'll
like have another one mirrored on this

900
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:09,220
like have another one mirrored on this
 

901
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,460
like have another one mirrored on this
side oops type of thing I'm also

902
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,470
side oops type of thing I'm also
 

903
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,599
side oops type of thing I'm also
planning on maybe stacking another unit

904
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:18,609
planning on maybe stacking another unit
 

905
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:21,269
planning on maybe stacking another unit
on a second layer though and that will

906
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:21,279
on a second layer though and that will
 

907
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,249
on a second layer though and that will
probably end at that height there so

908
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:23,259
probably end at that height there so
 

909
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,019
probably end at that height there so
it's going to be a big room which makes

910
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:25,029
it's going to be a big room which makes
 

911
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,349
it's going to be a big room which makes
me think this is too narrow so like if

912
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:28,359
me think this is too narrow so like if
 

913
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,820
me think this is too narrow so like if
it's really tall you don't want it super

914
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:29,830
it's really tall you don't want it super
 

915
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,489
it's really tall you don't want it super
narrow or you feel claustrophobic so it

916
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:32,499
narrow or you feel claustrophobic so it
 

917
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:34,919
narrow or you feel claustrophobic so it
might need to be even wider and then

918
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:34,929
might need to be even wider and then
 

919
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:37,519
might need to be even wider and then
there'll be about 15 blocks like three

920
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:37,529
there'll be about 15 blocks like three
 

921
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:43,680
there'll be about 15 blocks like three
six nine twelve fifteen and then same

922
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:43,690
six nine twelve fifteen and then same
 

923
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,139
six nine twelve fifteen and then same
thing over here and then it'll be

924
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:46,149
thing over here and then it'll be
 

925
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:47,310
thing over here and then it'll be
mirrored over

926
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,320
mirrored over
 

927
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,810
mirrored over
years so this will be the second tunnel

928
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:48,820
years so this will be the second tunnel
 

929
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,400
years so this will be the second tunnel
I need all this space for the redstone

930
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,410
I need all this space for the redstone
 

931
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,200
I need all this space for the redstone
it's there's a lot of redstone I can

932
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,210
it's there's a lot of redstone I can
 

933
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:00,030
it's there's a lot of redstone I can
simplify it a lot if I add a gap that's

934
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,040
simplify it a lot if I add a gap that's
 

935
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,510
simplify it a lot if I add a gap that's
two blocks wide like if this isn't just

936
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
two blocks wide like if this isn't just
 

937
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,660
two blocks wide like if this isn't just
a single wide thing between I didn't

938
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:06,670
a single wide thing between I didn't
 

939
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,870
a single wide thing between I didn't
really explain this but basically

940
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:08,880
really explain this but basically
 

941
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,460
really explain this but basically
there'd be another section over here and

942
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:11,470
there'd be another section over here and
 

943
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,370
there'd be another section over here and
it would just continue on forever

944
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:14,380
it would just continue on forever
 

945
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,180
it would just continue on forever
basically

946
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,190
basically
 

947
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:22,650
basically
and then you know like this and yeah the

948
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:22,660
and then you know like this and yeah the
 

949
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,380
and then you know like this and yeah the
exact same thing copied over here if we

950
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,390
exact same thing copied over here if we
 

951
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,060
exact same thing copied over here if we
have a lot of these that's going to look

952
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,070
have a lot of these that's going to look
 

953
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,760
have a lot of these that's going to look
pretty plain too so maybe every few

954
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:29,770
pretty plain too so maybe every few
 

955
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,950
pretty plain too so maybe every few
sections mate maybe every two or so I

956
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:31,960
sections mate maybe every two or so I
 

957
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,620
sections mate maybe every two or so I
would have to add another layer of depth

958
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:34,630
would have to add another layer of depth
 

959
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,350
would have to add another layer of depth
to it just to break it up a bit but I'm

960
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
to it just to break it up a bit but I'm
 

961
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,990
to it just to break it up a bit but I'm
not sure I don't want to spread it out

962
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
not sure I don't want to spread it out
 

963
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,700
not sure I don't want to spread it out
too much because it's really important

964
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:44,710
too much because it's really important
 

965
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,110
too much because it's really important
everything is kind of closed and compact

966
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,120
everything is kind of closed and compact
 

967
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,330
everything is kind of closed and compact
together because items have to travel

968
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:48,340
together because items have to travel
 

969
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,110
together because items have to travel
down a nice stream and if it's too long

970
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,120
down a nice stream and if it's too long
 

971
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,610
down a nice stream and if it's too long
they're going to de-spawn before they

972
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:53,620
they're going to de-spawn before they
 

973
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,740
they're going to de-spawn before they
get to the end of it so I can't be too

974
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:55,750
get to the end of it so I can't be too
 

975
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,510
get to the end of it so I can't be too
fancy with the details mmm did I say

least two blocks wider here at least

986
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:14,590
least two blocks wider here at least
 

987
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,190
least two blocks wider here at least
maybe four even we could have something

988
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
maybe four even we could have something
 

989
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,050
maybe four even we could have something
fancy in the middle if this is really

990
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,060
fancy in the middle if this is really
 

991
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,850
fancy in the middle if this is really
wide then I know what I forgot to tell

992
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:23,860
wide then I know what I forgot to tell
 

993
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,520
wide then I know what I forgot to tell
you so there's going to be 256 different

994
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:26,530
you so there's going to be 256 different
 

995
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,490
you so there's going to be 256 different
items in the storage room so each one of

996
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:29,500
items in the storage room so each one of
 

997
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,730
items in the storage room so each one of
these columns is one item two three four

998
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:32,740
these columns is one item two three four
 

999
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,940
these columns is one item two three four
so each of these sections is four items

1000
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:34,950
so each of these sections is four items
 

1001
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,530
so each of these sections is four items
since it's mirrored that's that's eight

1002
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:37,540
since it's mirrored that's that's eight
 

1003
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,590
since it's mirrored that's that's eight
items and since there's two tunnels

1004
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:40,600
items and since there's two tunnels
 

1005
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,560
items and since there's two tunnels
that's 16 and if we stack it vertically

1006
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,570
that's 16 and if we stack it vertically
 

1007
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:51,510
that's 16 and if we stack it vertically
that's 32 so 32 times something 16 is it

1008
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
that's 32 so 32 times something 16 is it
 

1009
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,570
that's 32 so 32 times something 16 is it
I know it's going to be 8 right I'm

1010
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:54,580
I know it's going to be 8 right I'm
 

1011
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,870
I know it's going to be 8 right I'm
using my calculator now 8 yes so there's

1012
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:57,880
using my calculator now 8 yes so there's
 

1013
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
using my calculator now 8 yes so there's
going to be 8 of these sections why it's

1014
00:25:59,880 --> 00:25:59,890
going to be 8 of these sections why it's
 

1015
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,570
going to be 8 of these sections why it's
so 1

1016
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:00,580
so 1
 

1017
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,159
so 1

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,370
spawning space for wither skeleton
because the game checks

1108
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:14,380
because the game checks
 

1109
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,870
because the game checks
like 20 blocks all around I think it is

1110
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:17,880
like 20 blocks all around I think it is
 

1111
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,169
like 20 blocks all around I think it is
unless that's changed which is a huge

1112
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:22,179
unless that's changed which is a huge
 

1113
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,810
unless that's changed which is a huge
area right but the ones that really

1114
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:24,820
area right but the ones that really
 

1115
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,889
area right but the ones that really
matter are the ones closest to it like

1116
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:27,899
matter are the ones closest to it like
 

1117
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:30,749
matter are the ones closest to it like
two or three blocks from it it's very

1118
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:30,759
two or three blocks from it it's very
 

1119
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,460
two or three blocks from it it's very
important there's air spaces two or

1120
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,470
important there's air spaces two or
 

1121
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,490
important there's air spaces two or
three blocks from each spawning space so

1122
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:35,500
three blocks from each spawning space so
 

1123
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,379
three blocks from each spawning space so
I got rid of all the railings I've put

1124
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:37,389
I got rid of all the railings I've put
 

1125
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:39,720
I got rid of all the railings I've put
in this like raised railing all along

1126
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:39,730
in this like raised railing all along
 

1127
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,789
in this like raised railing all along
the sides here everything is nice and

1128
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:41,799
the sides here everything is nice and
 

1129
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,190
the sides here everything is nice and
flat these half slabs are below the

1130
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,200
flat these half slabs are below the
 

1131
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,230
flat these half slabs are below the
walkway so that they don't take up air

1132
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
walkway so that they don't take up air
 

1133
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,999
walkway so that they don't take up air
spaces like if they were here that

1134
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:48,009
spaces like if they were here that
 

1135
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:48,629
spaces like if they were here that
wouldn't be good

1136
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:48,639
wouldn't be good
 

1137
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:53,039
wouldn't be good
so you want it one lower and did some

1138
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,049
so you want it one lower and did some
 

1139
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:56,399
so you want it one lower and did some
modifications around here so that I can

1140
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:56,409
modifications around here so that I can
 

1141
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,110
modifications around here so that I can
see it a little easier if there's wither

1142
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,120
see it a little easier if there's wither
 

1143
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,019
see it a little easier if there's wither
skeletons like inside the fortress these

1144
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:04,029
skeletons like inside the fortress these
 

1145
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,360
skeletons like inside the fortress these
intersections I've reworked a bit like

1146
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,370
intersections I've reworked a bit like
 

1147
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,210
intersections I've reworked a bit like
this used to just be a pathway then I've

1148
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:09,220
this used to just be a pathway then I've
 

1149
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,159
this used to just be a pathway then I've
added in like the six by six corners on

1150
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:14,169
added in like the six by six corners on
 

1151
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,499
added in like the six by six corners on
each of these and that adds a lot of

1152
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:16,509
each of these and that adds a lot of
 

1153
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:18,269
each of these and that adds a lot of
extra space for wither skeletons to

1154
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:18,279
extra space for wither skeletons to
 

1155
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:21,060
extra space for wither skeletons to
spawn might add a few layers I might

1156
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,070
spawn might add a few layers I might
 

1157
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,919
spawn might add a few layers I might
start automating things with pistons

1158

1161
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,869
later I'm not sure here's another one it
just helps to add more spawning spaces

1162
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:30,879
just helps to add more spawning spaces
 

1163
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:34,619
