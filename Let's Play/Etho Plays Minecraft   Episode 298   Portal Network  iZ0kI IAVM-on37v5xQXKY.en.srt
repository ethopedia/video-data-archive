map um
 

125
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,710
map um
you can't really see a whole lot from it

126
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
you can't really see a whole lot from it
 

127
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,509
you can't really see a whole lot from it
from a distance except for maybe the

128
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
from a distance except for maybe the
 

129
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,470
from a distance except for maybe the
basic terrain um as i was doing this was

130
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
basic terrain um as i was doing this was
 

131
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,630
basic terrain um as i was doing this was
actually kind of sad because

132
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
actually kind of sad because
 

133
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,390
actually kind of sad because
you know it wasn't surprising but a lot

134
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
you know it wasn't surprising but a lot
 

135
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,229
you know it wasn't surprising but a lot
of the stuff i've built is underground

136
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
of the stuff i've built is underground
 

137
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,990
of the stuff i've built is underground
and you can't actually see it on the map

138
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
and you can't actually see it on the map
 

139
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,470
and you can't actually see it on the map
so there's not a lot to see

140
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
so there's not a lot to see
 

141
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,589
so there's not a lot to see
from it but it's kind of encouraged me

142
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
from it but it's kind of encouraged me
 

143
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,190
from it but it's kind of encouraged me
maybe we should start building on the

144
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
maybe we should start building on the
 

145
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,670
maybe we should start building on the
surface a bit more in fact as i was

146
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
surface a bit more in fact as i was
 

147
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,470
surface a bit more in fact as i was
running around

148
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480

for this actually
 

173
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,589
for this actually
we might uh we might set up more maps in

174
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
we might uh we might set up more maps in
 

175
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,190
we might uh we might set up more maps in
other places

176
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
other places
 

177
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,390
other places
these aren't too bad on your computer

178
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
these aren't too bad on your computer
 

179
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,110
these aren't too bad on your computer
anymore

180
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
anymore
 

181
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,789
anymore
because dinner bone has it so it only

182
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
because dinner bone has it so it only
 

183
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,350
because dinner bone has it so it only
renders the map i think

184
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
renders the map i think
 

185
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,110
renders the map i think
when it loads now instead of like every

186
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
when it loads now instead of like every
 

187
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,509
when it loads now instead of like every
frame like it was doing before

188
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
frame like it was doing before
 

189
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,949
frame like it was doing before
so it's a lot easier on your computer

190
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
so it's a lot easier on your computer
 

191
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,750
so it's a lot easier on your computer
but

192
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
but
 

193
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,229
but
we are right there you can see my little

194

we are right there you can see my little
 

195
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,589
we are right there you can see my little
wooden bridge

196

wooden bridge
 

197
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,229
wooden bridge
over here that goes over top the river

over here that goes over top the river
 

199
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,509
over here that goes over top the river
this is my man-made

this is my man-made
river that goes all the way down here we

202
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
river that goes all the way down here we
 

203
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,629
river that goes all the way down here we
got the trees on the sides

204
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
got the trees on the sides
 

205
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,310
got the trees on the sides
that are all lit up it also splits off

206
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
that are all lit up it also splits off
 

207
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,990
that are all lit up it also splits off
this way this is that

208
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
this way this is that
 

209
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,230
this way this is that
fake overhang fake terrain i built over

210
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
fake overhang fake terrain i built over
 

211
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,469
fake overhang fake terrain i built over

now we got the snowflake over there this

214
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
now we got the snowflake over there this
 

215
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,870

that i first saw in the world close to
 

219
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,030
that i first saw in the world close to
close to spawn that's the glowing tree

220
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
close to spawn that's the glowing tree
 

221
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,790
close to spawn that's the glowing tree
up there on the

that's also where my sand pit is i

234
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
that's also where my sand pit is i
 

235
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,270
that's also where my sand pit is i
covered that all up

236

here
 

247
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,990
here
and you see it's all flattened out and

248
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
and you see it's all flattened out and
 

249
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,830
and you see it's all flattened out and
yeah we gotta build that still um

250
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
yeah we gotta build that still um
 

251
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,670
yeah we gotta build that still um
let's see what else this little thing is

252
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
let's see what else this little thing is
 

253
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,029
let's see what else this little thing is
the spawn platform right up in the sky

254
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
the spawn platform right up in the sky
 

255
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,150
the spawn platform right up in the sky
and little sheep farm over here this

256
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
and little sheep farm over here this
 

257
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,189
and little sheep farm over here this
is the lake firework lake over here with

258
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
is the lake firework lake over here with
 

259
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,510
is the lake firework lake over here with

there um there's a desert up this way

262
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
there um there's a desert up this way
 

263
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,790
there um there's a desert up this way
which i didn't really know about i

264
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
which i didn't really know about i
 

265
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,870
which i didn't really know about i
usually don't go up this way because

266
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
usually don't go up this way because
 

267
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,230
usually don't go up this way because
it's mostly water

268
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
it's mostly water
 

269
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,990
it's mostly water
but yeah if we go a little further

270
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
but yeah if we go a little further
 

271
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,590
but yeah if we go a little further
there's a desert

272
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
there's a desert
 

273
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,950
there's a desert
and let's see down

274
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
and let's see down
 

275
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,350
and let's see down
this way is towards the strongholds base

276
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
this way is towards the strongholds base
 

277
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,629
this way is towards the strongholds base
if we go down

278
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
if we go down
 

279
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,710
if we go down
uh it's actually about 800 blocks from

280
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
uh it's actually about 800 blocks from
 

281
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,629
uh it's actually about 800 blocks from
here go straight down

282
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
here go straight down
 

283
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,430
here go straight down
and apparently this is within range on

284
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
and apparently this is within range on
 

285
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,230
and apparently this is within range on
the map

286
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
the map
 

287
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,550
the map
this is what my new pit for getting sand

288
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
this is what my new pit for getting sand
 

289
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,629
this is what my new pit for getting sand
where i've been moving the silver fish

290
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
where i've been moving the silver fish
 

291
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,950
where i've been moving the silver fish
and where we fight the withers usually

292
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
and where we fight the withers usually
 

293
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,070
and where we fight the withers usually
it's over there um pretty much

294
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
it's over there um pretty much
 

295
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,510
it's over there um pretty much
all this section here

296
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
all this section here
 

297
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,309
all this section here
to the right is mountains and you can

298
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
to the right is mountains and you can
 

299
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,309
to the right is mountains and you can
see some places where the snow's falling

300
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
see some places where the snow's falling
 

301
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,430
see some places where the snow's falling
already

302
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
already
 

303
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,950
already
this is probably where we're going to be

304
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
this is probably where we're going to be
 

305
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,390
this is probably where we're going to be
expanding in the future if we want to

306
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
expanding in the future if we want to
 

307
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,430
expanding in the future if we want to
build on the surface

308
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
build on the surface
 

309
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,150
build on the surface
let's go this way because round here is

310
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
let's go this way because round here is
 

311
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,350
let's go this way because round here is
a very nice

312
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
a very nice
 

313
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,430
a very nice
nice area and we might want to try

314
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
nice area and we might want to try
 

315
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,110
nice area and we might want to try
extend

316
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
extend
 

317
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,670
extend
the water like try to make rivers that

318
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
the water like try to make rivers that
 

319
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,469
the water like try to make rivers that
go out that way

320
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
go out that way
 

321
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,070
go out that way
if we take out the land here

322
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
if we take out the land here
 

323
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,830
if we take out the land here
uh there's just little land pieces

324
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
uh there's just little land pieces
 

325
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,469
uh there's just little land pieces
connecting or preventing the water from

326
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
connecting or preventing the water from
 

327
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,469
connecting or preventing the water from
connecting all the way through or we

328
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
connecting all the way through or we
 

329
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,550
connecting all the way through or we
could go over top and do the same

330
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
could go over top and do the same
 

331
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,270
could go over top and do the same
pretty much and make it go down maybe

332
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
pretty much and make it go down maybe
 

333
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,790
pretty much and make it go down maybe
and yeah

334
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
and yeah
 

335
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,029
and yeah
there's a snow biome there i think up to

336
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
there's a snow biome there i think up to
 

337
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,150
there's a snow biome there i think up to
the left

338
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
the left
 

339
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,110
the left
here is a jungle biome if i remember

340
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
here is a jungle biome if i remember
 

341
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,189
here is a jungle biome if i remember
right

342
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
right
 

343
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,469
right
and yeah so that's our world this part

344
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
and yeah so that's our world this part
 

345
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,350
and yeah so that's our world this part
of it

346
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
of it
 

347
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,790
of it
there's actually quite a bit around the

348
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
there's actually quite a bit around the
 

349
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,469
there's actually quite a bit around the
stronghold base too

350
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
stronghold base too
 

351
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,749
stronghold base too
that we can't see on here like the

352
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
that we can't see on here like the
 

353
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,749
that we can't see on here like the
village and all that

354
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
village and all that
 

355
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,830
village and all that
but uh nice little overview of our world

356
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840
but uh nice little overview of our world
 

357
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,589
but uh nice little overview of our world
anyway

358
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
anyway
 

359
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,430
anyway
i'll give you a quick overview of the

360
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
i'll give you a quick overview of the
 

361
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,189
i'll give you a quick overview of the
world too from on top this tree you can

362
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
world too from on top this tree you can
 

363
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,230
world too from on top this tree you can
see a lot of

364
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
see a lot of
 

365
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,950
see a lot of
the things i pointed out give you a

366
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
the things i pointed out give you a
 

367
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,950
the things i pointed out give you a
better idea help you visualize where

368
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
better idea help you visualize where
 

369
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,830
better idea help you visualize where
things are

370
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
things are
 

371
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,589
things are
um that's the water that way mountains

372
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
um that's the water that way mountains
 

373
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,510
um that's the water that way mountains
that way stronghold is that way

374
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
that way stronghold is that way
 

375
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,629
that way stronghold is that way
and not much is back that way but

376
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
and not much is back that way but
 

377
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,510
and not much is back that way but
yeah what do you guys think of the new

378
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
yeah what do you guys think of the new
 

379
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,469
yeah what do you guys think of the new
rendering code in the snapshot

380
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
rendering code in the snapshot
 

381
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,710
rendering code in the snapshot
personally i find it makes everything

382
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
personally i find it makes everything
 

383
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,629
personally i find it makes everything
look pretty good like especially stuff

384
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
look pretty good like especially stuff
 

385
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,909
look pretty good like especially stuff
in the background

386
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
in the background
 

387
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,749
in the background
except for maybe the leaves i don't like

388
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
except for maybe the leaves i don't like
 

389
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,390
except for maybe the leaves i don't like
the way leaves look very much

390
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
the way leaves look very much
 

391
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,990
the way leaves look very much
and i've tried changing the settings you

392
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
and i've tried changing the settings you
 

393
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,749
and i've tried changing the settings you
can't get them to look the way they used

394
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
can't get them to look the way they used
 

395
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,110
can't get them to look the way they used
to i don't think

396
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
to i don't think
 

397
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,469
to i don't think
like not too sure what is it's like

398
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
like not too sure what is it's like
 

399
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,390
like not too sure what is it's like
they're more transparent now you can

400
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
they're more transparent now you can
 

401
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,150
they're more transparent now you can
really see the birchwood through those

402
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
really see the birchwood through those
 

403
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,150
really see the birchwood through those
trees for example

404
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
trees for example
 

405
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,230
trees for example
it really stands out and then when

406
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
it really stands out and then when
 

407
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,790
it really stands out and then when
there's a big clump of leaves like

408
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
there's a big clump of leaves like
 

409
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,950
there's a big clump of leaves like
in pretty much all these trees it looks

410
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
in pretty much all these trees it looks
 

411
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,029
in pretty much all these trees it looks
like they're solid blocks like

412
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
like they're solid blocks like
 

413
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,710
like they're solid blocks like
they're very non-transparent

414
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
they're very non-transparent
 

415
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,189
they're very non-transparent
so it's like it's like they they're

416
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
so it's like it's like they they're
 

417
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,110
so it's like it's like they they're
really transparent but they're not

418
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
really transparent but they're not
 

419
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,869
really transparent but they're not
they're they're really untransparent

420
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
they're they're really untransparent
 

421
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,950
they're they're really untransparent
non-transparent whatever

422
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
non-transparent whatever
 

423
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,710
non-transparent whatever
so i don't know maybe they'll they'll

424
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
so i don't know maybe they'll they'll
 

425
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,390
so i don't know maybe they'll they'll
change the leaves up a bit

426
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
change the leaves up a bit
 

427
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,909
change the leaves up a bit
but everything else i think looks pretty

428
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
but everything else i think looks pretty
 

429
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,909
but everything else i think looks pretty
good

430
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
good
 

431
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,430
good
um different acts

432
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
um different acts
 

433
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,589
um different acts
so the plan for today guys you don't

434
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
so the plan for today guys you don't
 

435
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,670
so the plan for today guys you don't
often see this i'm chopping down trees

436
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
often see this i'm chopping down trees
 

437
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,469
often see this i'm chopping down trees
right now

438
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
right now
 

439
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,509
right now
and i actually do a lot of things in my

440
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
and i actually do a lot of things in my
 

441
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,509
and i actually do a lot of things in my
worlds that take a bit of time that you

442
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
worlds that take a bit of time that you
 

443
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,470
worlds that take a bit of time that you
don't really see

444
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
don't really see
 

445
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,590
don't really see
like chopping trees collecting sand

446
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
like chopping trees collecting sand
 

447
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,750
like chopping trees collecting sand
collecting clay collecting quartz going

448
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
collecting clay collecting quartz going
 

449
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,710
collecting clay collecting quartz going
caving

450
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
caving
 

451
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,190
caving
and something we touched on last episode

452
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
and something we touched on last episode
 

453
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,470
and something we touched on last episode
that we're going to

454
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
that we're going to
 

455
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,710
that we're going to
maybe work on a bit more today except in

456
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
maybe work on a bit more today except in
 

457
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,550
maybe work on a bit more today except in
a different way

458
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
a different way
 

459
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,070
a different way
is moving items around and just general

460
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
is moving items around and just general
 

461
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,389
is moving items around and just general
general transport and that in my world

462
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
general transport and that in my world
 

463
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,470
general transport and that in my world
takes quite a bit of time

464
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
takes quite a bit of time
 

465
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,230
takes quite a bit of time
yeah i don't mind if that breaks um

466
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
yeah i don't mind if that breaks um
 

467
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,310
yeah i don't mind if that breaks um
so i had this idea today it's a little

468
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,320
so i had this idea today it's a little
 

469
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,590
so i had this idea today it's a little
complicated um

470
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
complicated um
 

471
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,550
complicated um
might not work perfectly but we will see

472
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
might not work perfectly but we will see
 

473
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,030
might not work perfectly but we will see
i

474
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
i
 

475
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,190
i
i did mess with it in creative already

476
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
i did mess with it in creative already
 

477
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,310
i did mess with it in creative already
and i think i got it to work

478
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
and i think i got it to work
 

479
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,030
and i think i got it to work
actually spent like i spent two or three

480
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
actually spent like i spent two or three
 

481
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,630
actually spent like i spent two or three
hours oh there it goes

482
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
hours oh there it goes
 

483
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,829
hours oh there it goes
uh trying to get this idea to work like

484
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
uh trying to get this idea to work like
 

485
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,590
uh trying to get this idea to work like
just the basics of it

486
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
just the basics of it
 

487
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,310
just the basics of it
and i finally figured out a way to do it

488
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
and i finally figured out a way to do it
 

489
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,630
and i finally figured out a way to do it
uh it was actually kind of frustrating

490
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
uh it was actually kind of frustrating
 

491
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,470
uh it was actually kind of frustrating
because it used to work no problem and

492
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
because it used to work no problem and
 

493
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,310
because it used to work no problem and
now it's like game mechanics have

494
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
now it's like game mechanics have
 

495
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,750
now it's like game mechanics have
changed and i had a lot of trouble with

496
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
changed and i had a lot of trouble with
 

497
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,630
changed and i had a lot of trouble with
it

498
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
it
 

499
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,670
it
but the idea is we're going to try

500
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
but the idea is we're going to try
 

501
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,150
but the idea is we're going to try
build a portal network

502
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
build a portal network
 

503
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,790
build a portal network
almost like the internet in my world i

504
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
almost like the internet in my world i
 

505
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,509
almost like the internet in my world i

which could be pretty cool um
 

553
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,949
which could be pretty cool um
but we'll see how it goes and it's going

but we'll see how it goes and it's going
 

555
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,110
but we'll see how it goes and it's going
to take a little while to set up

556
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
to take a little while to set up
 

557
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,230
to take a little while to set up
for all the portals but

558
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
for all the portals but
 

559
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,150
for all the portals but
let's let's get to it i'm going to hop

let's let's get to it i'm going to hop
 

561
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,430
let's let's get to it i'm going to hop
over to the nether

562
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
over to the nether
 

563
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,430
over to the nether
we'll try rig up one of one of the

564
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
we'll try rig up one of one of the
 

565
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,870
we'll try rig up one of one of the
portals the way it needs to be

566
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
portals the way it needs to be
 

567
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,490
portals the way it needs to be
for the stronghold base first off

568
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:18,500
for the stronghold base first off
 

569
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,069
for the stronghold base first off

[Music]
 

571
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,470
[Music]
all right so the stronghold portal was

572
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
all right so the stronghold portal was
 

573
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,870
all right so the stronghold portal was
over here before i'm moving it right now

574
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
over here before i'm moving it right now
 

575
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,790
over here before i'm moving it right now
uh just in case this becomes a more

576
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
uh just in case this becomes a more
 

577
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,550
uh just in case this becomes a more
permanent thing i want it in a better

578
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
permanent thing i want it in a better
 

579
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,990
permanent thing i want it in a better
spot

580
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
spot
 

581
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,710
spot
and i want to try and make a 3x3

582
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720

 

583
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,949

i think it looks cooler i like odd

584
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
i think it looks cooler i like odd
 

585
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,110
i think it looks cooler i like odd
numbers a lot more than even numbers

586
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
numbers a lot more than even numbers
 

587
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,150
numbers a lot more than even numbers
in this game

588
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
in this game
 

589
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,670
in this game
that should work good

590
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680

 

591
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,509

and stronghold

592
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519

 

593
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,230

oh okay yeah we're here good

594
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
oh okay yeah we're here good
 

595
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,470
oh okay yeah we're here good
and will we go back

596
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480

 

597
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,990

yes we will awesome

598
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000

 

599
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,350

i think as we work here i'm going to

600
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
i think as we work here i'm going to
 

601
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,030
i think as we work here i'm going to
just disable this one

602
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
just disable this one
 

603
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,190
just disable this one
so we don't hear it the whole time uh

604
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
so we don't hear it the whole time uh
 

605
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,670
so we don't hear it the whole time uh
the idea is actually really simple and i

606
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
the idea is actually really simple and i
 

607
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,069
the idea is actually really simple and i
can

608
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
can
 

609
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,430
can
demonstrate it real quick here i'm

610
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
demonstrate it real quick here i'm
 

611
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,590
demonstrate it real quick here i'm
sure you're familiar with it let's

612
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
sure you're familiar with it let's
 

613
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,110
sure you're familiar with it let's
pretend

614
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
pretend
 

615
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,829
pretend
let's pretend uh soil blocks are nether

616
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
let's pretend uh soil blocks are nether
 

617
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,550
let's pretend uh soil blocks are nether
portals

618
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
portals
 

619
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,269
portals
like like this one here so if you have a

620
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
like like this one here so if you have a
 

621
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,190
like like this one here so if you have a
nether portal

622
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
nether portal
 

623
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,350
nether portal
and we'll use stone bricks for an

624
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
and we'll use stone bricks for an
 

625
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,350
and we'll use stone bricks for an
overworld portal

626
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
overworld portal
 

627
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,910
overworld portal
so those two are linked together and

628
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
so those two are linked together and
 

629
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,629
so those two are linked together and
they're

630
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
they're
 

631
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,269
they're
in the correct position in overworld and

632
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
in the correct position in overworld and
 

633
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,030
in the correct position in overworld and
and the nether right

634
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
and the nether right
 

635
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,110
and the nether right
now if you build another overworld

636
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
now if you build another overworld
 

637
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,629
now if you build another overworld
portal

638
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
portal
 

639
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,750
portal
like a thousand blocks away and you go

640
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
like a thousand blocks away and you go
 

641
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,430
like a thousand blocks away and you go
in this one it's gonna take you to the

642
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
in this one it's gonna take you to the
 

643
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,069
in this one it's gonna take you to the
nether portal all the way over here and

644
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
nether portal all the way over here and
 

645
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,430
nether portal all the way over here and
then when you go through this nether

646
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
then when you go through this nether
 

647
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,389
then when you go through this nether
portal again

648
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
portal again
 

649
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,790
portal again
it takes you to that one so

650
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800

 

651
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,150

when you when you go through

652
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
when you when you go through
 

653
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,590
when you when you go through
an overworld portal it checks 128 block

654
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
an overworld portal it checks 128 block
 

655
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,069
an overworld portal it checks 128 block
radius

656
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
radius
 

657
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,310
radius
in the nether for uh for another portal

658
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
in the nether for uh for another portal
 

659
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,670
in the nether for uh for another portal
so that 1024 divided by 8

660
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
so that 1024 divided by 8
 

661
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,509
so that 1024 divided by 8
is 128 blocks and if there is one in

662
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
is 128 blocks and if there is one in
 

663
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,389
is 128 blocks and if there is one in
that range it will link to that but then

664
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
that range it will link to that but then
 

665
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:20,790
that range it will link to that but then
it

666
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
it
 

667
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,790
it
when it goes back to the overworld it

668
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
when it goes back to the overworld it
 

669
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,550
when it goes back to the overworld it
checks for the nearest one within i

670
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
checks for the nearest one within i
 

671
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,110
checks for the nearest one within i
think 256 blocks

672
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
think 256 blocks
 

673
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,910
think 256 blocks
radius so it's only going to check like

674
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
radius so it's only going to check like
 

675
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,350
radius so it's only going to check like
up to here and of course since there's

676
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
up to here and of course since there's
 

677
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,949
up to here and of course since there's
one right where it's supposed to be it's

678
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
one right where it's supposed to be it's
 

679
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:33,990
one right where it's supposed to be it's
going to link up with that

680
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
going to link up with that
 

681
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,030
going to link up with that
one right

682
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
one right
 

683
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,310
one right
so you can use that to

684
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
so you can use that to
 

685
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,629
so you can use that to
to get quick transport like a long

686
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
to get quick transport like a long
 

687
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,509
to get quick transport like a long
distance

688
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
distance
 

689
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,829
distance
because you go you go into the nether

690
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
because you go you go into the nether
 

691
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,870
because you go you go into the nether
and then you go

692
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
and then you go
 

693
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,470
and then you go
back to the overworld you've moved a

694
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
back to the overworld you've moved a
 

695
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,030
back to the overworld you've moved a
thousand blocks just by going through

696
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
thousand blocks just by going through
 

697
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,310
thousand blocks just by going through
two portals which is pretty cool

698
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
two portals which is pretty cool
 

699
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,829
two portals which is pretty cool
uh the thing is you can't get back there

700
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
uh the thing is you can't get back there
 

701
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,790
uh the thing is you can't get back there
right

702
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
right
 

703
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,829
right
you can't um you have to walk it right

704
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
you can't um you have to walk it right
 

705
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,750
you can't um you have to walk it right
so that's why people set up several

706
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
so that's why people set up several
 

707
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,590
so that's why people set up several
like multiple portals in the nether

708
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
like multiple portals in the nether
 

709
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,790
like multiple portals in the nether
right so if you put the

710
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
right so if you put the
 

711
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,870
right so if you put the
nether portal another one linked up

712
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
nether portal another one linked up
 

713
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,350
nether portal another one linked up
properly with this one

714
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
properly with this one
 

715
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,030
properly with this one
if you go through this one you go to

716
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
if you go through this one you go to
 

717
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,430
if you go through this one you go to
that one then you can walk in the nether

718
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
that one then you can walk in the nether
 

719
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,670
that one then you can walk in the nether
it's only 128 blocks or so

720
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
it's only 128 blocks or so
 

721
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,509
it's only 128 blocks or so
and then go to that one and then when

722
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
and then go to that one and then when
 

723
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,949
and then go to that one and then when
you go through that you go back down and

724
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
you go through that you go back down and
 

725
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,350
you go through that you go back down and
you go

726
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
you go
 

727
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,230
you go
there and so forth but you don't go from

728
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
there and so forth but you don't go from
 

729
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,230
there and so forth but you don't go from
there to there anymore or from there to

730
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
there to there anymore or from there to
 

731
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,269
there to there anymore or from there to
there

732
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
there
 

733
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,350
there
unless you do what i'm trying to do and

734
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
unless you do what i'm trying to do and
 

735
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,550
unless you do what i'm trying to do and
that is

736
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
that is
 

737
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,590
that is
uh enable and disable the nether portals

738
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
uh enable and disable the nether portals
 

739
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,269
uh enable and disable the nether portals
so that for example even though we still

740
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
so that for example even though we still
 

741
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,629
so that for example even though we still
have the nether portal set up

742
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
have the nether portal set up
 

743
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,110
have the nether portal set up
i want to disable them so i can go from

744
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
i want to disable them so i can go from
 

745
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,750
i want to disable them so i can go from
like

746
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
like
 

747
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,069
like
from there to there you know and send

748
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
from there to there you know and send
 

749
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,670
from there to there you know and send
items or animals

750
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
items or animals
 

751
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,470
items or animals
through the portal go to there then i

752
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
through the portal go to there then i
 

753
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,829
through the portal go to there then i
can send them through again

754
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
can send them through again
 

755
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,470
can send them through again
and they'll end up here you know and i

756
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
and they'll end up here you know and i
 

757
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,710
and they'll end up here you know and i
can do that with many many portals if i

758
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
can do that with many many portals if i
 

759
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,710
can do that with many many portals if i
set it up right

760
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
set it up right
 

761
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,550
set it up right
which is what we're attempting to do

762
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
which is what we're attempting to do
 

763
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,629
which is what we're attempting to do
right now

764
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
right now
 

765
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,670
right now
maybe all uh

766
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680

 

767
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,590

actually you know an easy way of

768
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
actually you know an easy way of
 

769
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,189
actually you know an easy way of
disabling a portal

770
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
disabling a portal
 

771
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,870
disabling a portal
there we go much quieter

772
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
there we go much quieter
 

773
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,230
there we go much quieter
so let's begin this is

774
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
so let's begin this is
 

775
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,509
so let's begin this is
how we are going to do it

776
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
how we are going to do it
 

777
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,150
how we are going to do it
um see if i can remember how to build

778
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
um see if i can remember how to build
 

779
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,710
um see if i can remember how to build
this so

780
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
this so
 

781
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,870
this so
dispensers this one's going to have

782
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
dispensers this one's going to have
 

783
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,629
dispensers this one's going to have
flint and steel in

784
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
flint and steel in
 

785
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,310
flint and steel in
if you have flint and stealing you can

786
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
if you have flint and stealing you can
 

787
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,550
if you have flint and stealing you can
lights

788
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
lights
 

789
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,310
lights
like the portal with that no problem

790
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320

 

791
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,590

and obviously

792
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600

 

793
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,629

we will put that in there so we got to

794
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
we will put that in there so we got to
 

795
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,150
we will put that in there so we got to
send two pulses to that

796
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160

 

797
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,470

it'll pick up the the lava and it'll

798
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
it'll pick up the the lava and it'll
 

799
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,710
it'll pick up the the lava and it'll
break the portal

800
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
break the portal
 

801
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,069
break the portal
and that's how we're going to enable and

802
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
and that's how we're going to enable and
 

803
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,470
and that's how we're going to enable and
disable the portals flint and steel

804
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
disable the portals flint and steel
 

805
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,350
disable the portals flint and steel
and lava bucket pretty simple

806
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
and lava bucket pretty simple
 

807
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,430
and lava bucket pretty simple
uh we'll get a button maybe we'll just

808
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
uh we'll get a button maybe we'll just
 

809
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,949
uh we'll get a button maybe we'll just
put the button down

810
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
put the button down
 

811
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,629
put the button down
here

812
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639

 

813
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,310

and

814
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320

 

815
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,990

do that so now when you press a button

816
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
do that so now when you press a button
 

817
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,430
do that so now when you press a button
it'll light the portal

818
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
it'll light the portal
 

819
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,110
it'll light the portal
and we want it to go

820
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120

 

821
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,949

let's see let's take out some of this

822
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
let's see let's take out some of this
 

823
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,829
let's see let's take out some of this
let's set up the

824
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
let's set up the
 

825
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,949
let's set up the
the lava budget thing so that's a little

826
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
the lava budget thing so that's a little
 

827
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,470
the lava budget thing so that's a little
more complicated but there is an easy

828
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
more complicated but there is an easy
 

829
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,189
more complicated but there is an easy
way to do

830
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
way to do
 

831
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,670
way to do
it if we

832
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680

 

833
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,629

see i think uh

834
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
see i think uh
 

835
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,749
see i think uh
you get a sticky piston a block

836
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
you get a sticky piston a block
 

837
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,069
you get a sticky piston a block
and send a repeater

838
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
and send a repeater
 

839
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,590
and send a repeater
through it like that so when that goes

840
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
through it like that so when that goes
 

841
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,670
through it like that so when that goes
it'll it'll activate it once and now to

842
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
it'll it'll activate it once and now to
 

843
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,509
it'll it'll activate it once and now to
get it to activate again

844
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
get it to activate again
 

845
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,590
get it to activate again
we will also split the signal

846
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600

 

847
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,350

go this way we got to set it to two to

848
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
go this way we got to set it to two to
 

849
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,829
go this way we got to set it to two to
give it enough time

850
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839

 

851
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,069

and

852
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
and
 

853
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,189
and
block like that like that

854
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
block like that like that
 

855
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,309
block like that like that
and that so go into the dispenser then

856
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
and that so go into the dispenser then
 

857
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,630
and that so go into the dispenser then
it

858
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
it
 

859
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,270
it
does two ticks goes to that dust and

860
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
does two ticks goes to that dust and
 

861
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,829
does two ticks goes to that dust and
back to the dispenser and it'll click it

862
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
back to the dispenser and it'll click it
 

863
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,949
back to the dispenser and it'll click it
again

864
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
again
 

865
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,069
again
two clicks very good and all we need to

866
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
two clicks very good and all we need to
 

867
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,789
two clicks very good and all we need to
do now

868
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
do now
 

869
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,069
do now
is connect um

870
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
is connect um
 

871
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,909
is connect um
oops this button to

872
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919

 

873
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,110

i think 10 to 10 or 11 repeaters it's

874
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
i think 10 to 10 or 11 repeaters it's
 

875
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,630
i think 10 to 10 or 11 repeaters it's
got to have 41 ticks

876
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
got to have 41 ticks
 

877
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,710
got to have 41 ticks
so i'll set that up

878
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720

 

879
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,390

oh you can tell i've been here for a

880
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
oh you can tell i've been here for a
 

881
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,190
oh you can tell i've been here for a
little while we got tons and tons of gas

882
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
little while we got tons and tons of gas
 

883
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,990
little while we got tons and tons of gas
out there but i think i got it working

884
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
out there but i think i got it working
 

885
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,350
out there but i think i got it working
now

886
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
now
 

887
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,549
now
um so yeah if we go around we have

888
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
um so yeah if we go around we have
 

889
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,110
um so yeah if we go around we have
one two three four five six

890
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120

 

891
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,230

seven eight nine ten eleven repeaters

892
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
seven eight nine ten eleven repeaters
 

893
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,230
seven eight nine ten eleven repeaters
all of these are set to four except for

894
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
all of these are set to four except for
 

895
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,310
all of these are set to four except for
this one it's set at one

896
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
this one it's set at one
 

897
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,909
this one it's set at one
so it's 41 redstone ticks total

898
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
so it's 41 redstone ticks total
 

899
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,909
so it's 41 redstone ticks total
and i also set up two more buttons here

900
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
and i also set up two more buttons here
 

901
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,430
and i also set up two more buttons here
this is just a manual

902
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
this is just a manual
 

903
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,430
this is just a manual
uh enable for the portal this bottom one

904
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
uh enable for the portal this bottom one
 

905
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,510
uh enable for the portal this bottom one
goes right to that dispenser like so

906
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
goes right to that dispenser like so
 

907
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,830
goes right to that dispenser like so
and the top one is a manual disable

908
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
and the top one is a manual disable
 

909
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,830
and the top one is a manual disable
which goes right to

910
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
which goes right to
 

911
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,150
which goes right to
the disable mechanism up there

912
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
the disable mechanism up there
 

913
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,470
the disable mechanism up there
nice and simple so this is for the timer

914
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
nice and simple so this is for the timer
 

915
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,230
nice and simple so this is for the timer
takes four seconds to go through the

916
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
takes four seconds to go through the
 

917
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,310
takes four seconds to go through the
portal

918
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
portal
 

919
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,830
portal
and then it disables it so

920
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
and then it disables it so
 

921
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,070
and then it disables it so
ah this is what gave me all the trouble

922
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
ah this is what gave me all the trouble
 

923
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,029
ah this is what gave me all the trouble
though because in the past

924
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
though because in the past
 

925
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,029
though because in the past
let's say we had an eight second timer

926
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
let's say we had an eight second timer
 

927
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,630
let's say we had an eight second timer
on this thing eight second redstone

928
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
on this thing eight second redstone
 

929
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,669
on this thing eight second redstone
timer

930
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
timer
 

931
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,150
timer
uh you could go in within the first four

932
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
uh you could go in within the first four
 

933
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,110
uh you could go in within the first four
seconds and then

934
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
seconds and then
 

935
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,870
seconds and then
the redstone would continue after you

936
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
the redstone would continue after you
 

937
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,870
the redstone would continue after you
went through for another four seconds

938
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
went through for another four seconds
 

939
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,470
went through for another four seconds
and disable it all on its own no problem

940
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
and disable it all on its own no problem
 

941
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,669
and disable it all on its own no problem
not anymore in the game when you go

942
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
not anymore in the game when you go
 

943
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,230
not anymore in the game when you go
through

944
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
through
 

945
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,710
through
a portal and you leave the nether the

946
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
a portal and you leave the nether the
 

947
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,430
a portal and you leave the nether the
redstone

948
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
redstone
 

949
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,470
redstone
stops it actually stops where it's at

950
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
stops it actually stops where it's at
 

951
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,510
stops it actually stops where it's at
and remembers

952
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
and remembers
 

953
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,150
and remembers
next time you load up the chunks unless

954
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
next time you load up the chunks unless
 

955
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,590
next time you load up the chunks unless
you got some special

956
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
you got some special
 

957
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,789
you got some special
chunk loading setup going on it will not

958
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
chunk loading setup going on it will not
 

959
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,870
chunk loading setup going on it will not
disable the portal

960
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
disable the portal
 

961
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,830
disable the portal
so i had to figure out how to make it do

962
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
so i had to figure out how to make it do
 

963
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,710
so i had to figure out how to make it do
that

964
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
that
 

965
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,830
that
and i team up with a bit of a cheaty way

966
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
and i team up with a bit of a cheaty way
 

967
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,430
and i team up with a bit of a cheaty way
so it takes us four 40 ticks to go

968
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
so it takes us four 40 ticks to go
 

969
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,110
so it takes us four 40 ticks to go
through and then there's one tick

970
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
through and then there's one tick
 

971
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,549
through and then there's one tick
left let's hope this works

972
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559

 

973
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,350

you heard the piston go right as we went

974
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
you heard the piston go right as we went
 

975
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,430
you heard the piston go right as we went
in there

976
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
in there
 

977
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,549
in there
so now i'm gonna drink this just in case

978
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
so now i'm gonna drink this just in case
 

979
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,150
so now i'm gonna drink this just in case
we have trouble i can't remember if this

980
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
we have trouble i can't remember if this
 

981
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,190
we have trouble i can't remember if this
was still a problem

982
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200

 

983
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,120

um we go through

984
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,130
um we go through
 

985
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,230
um we go through

oh did it actually work what the heck

988
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
oh did it actually work what the heck
 

989
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,190
oh did it actually work what the heck
uh usually i have to do something else

990
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
uh usually i have to do something else
 

991
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,950
uh usually i have to do something else
to make it work

992
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
to make it work
 

993
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,590
to make it work
but that just worked on its own

994
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600

 

995
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,789

that's interesting okay

996
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
that's interesting okay
 

997
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,390
that's interesting okay
is that a good thing or a bad thing i

998
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
is that a good thing or a bad thing i
 

999
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,950
is that a good thing or a bad thing i
kind of liked it the way it was before

1000
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960

 

1001
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,029

hmm let's try one more

1002
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039
hmm let's try one more
 

1003
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,149
hmm let's try one more
time maybe maybe there's mobs here that

1004
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
time maybe maybe there's mobs here that
 

1005
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:26,870
time maybe maybe there's mobs here that
are keeping it

1006
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
are keeping it
 

1007
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,590
are keeping it
loaded or something

1008
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600

 

1009
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,430

okay i'm gonna go back through

1010
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
okay i'm gonna go back through
 

1011
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,350
okay i'm gonna go back through
oh unless yeah this was taking us to

1012
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
oh unless yeah this was taking us to
 

1013
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,870
oh unless yeah this was taking us to
that portal before right

1014
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880

 

1015
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,149

ah anyway i guess that works so

1016
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
ah anyway i guess that works so
 

1017
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,390
ah anyway i guess that works so
if we go through this one we we got

1018
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
if we go through this one we we got
 

1019
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,710
if we go through this one we we got
teleported a little bit of ways

1020
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
teleported a little bit of ways
 

1021
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,549
teleported a little bit of ways
in the nether here because this takes us

1022
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
in the nether here because this takes us
 

1023
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,870
in the nether here because this takes us
to the village now

1024
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
to the village now
 

1025
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,029
to the village now
instead of to the stronghold so that is

1026
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
instead of to the stronghold so that is
 

1027
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,310
instead of to the stronghold so that is
the general idea

1028
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
the general idea
 

1029
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,430
the general idea
behind it the real complicated part to

1030
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
behind it the real complicated part to
 

1031
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,149
behind it the real complicated part to
all of this

1032
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
all of this
 

1033
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,190
all of this
now

1034
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200

 

1035
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,310

is what i would like to do is set up

1036
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
is what i would like to do is set up
 

1037
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,750
is what i would like to do is set up
like a destination selector outside of

1038
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
like a destination selector outside of
 

1039
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,669
like a destination selector outside of
each of these portals so

1040
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
each of these portals so
 

1041
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,830
each of these portals so
have like a wall of buttons and let's

1042
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
have like a wall of buttons and let's
 

1043
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,950
have like a wall of buttons and let's
say go to stronghold hit the button

1044
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
say go to stronghold hit the button
 

1045
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,270
say go to stronghold hit the button
and then that needs to disable all the

1046
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
and then that needs to disable all the
 

1047
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,549
and then that needs to disable all the
nether portals

1048
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
nether portals
 

1049
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,789
nether portals
except for the stronghold one it needs

1050
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
except for the stronghold one it needs
 

1051
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,390
except for the stronghold one it needs
to turn that one on

1052
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
to turn that one on
 

1053
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,390
to turn that one on
which is not by us it might have to

1054
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
which is not by us it might have to
 

1055
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,549
which is not by us it might have to
send a redstone signal like 100 blocks

1056
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
send a redstone signal like 100 blocks
 

1057
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,310
send a redstone signal like 100 blocks
or more

1058
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
or more
 

1059
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,669
or more
to turn that portal on

1060
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
to turn that portal on
 

1061
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,190
to turn that portal on
and then we would go through here

1062
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
and then we would go through here
 

1063
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,549
and then we would go through here
on the timer and then when we go back

1064
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
on the timer and then when we go back
 

1065
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,590
on the timer and then when we go back
out

1066
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
out
 

1067
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,029
out
uh we should end up at the stronghold so

1068
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
uh we should end up at the stronghold so
 

1069
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,110
uh we should end up at the stronghold so
we have to set up like a redstone

1070
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
we have to set up like a redstone
 

1071
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,789
we have to set up like a redstone
network now

1072
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
network now
 

1073
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,830
network now
to enable and disable the portals

1074
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
to enable and disable the portals
 

1075
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,270
to enable and disable the portals
properly

1076
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
properly
 

1077
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,029
properly
but first we should set up a few more of

1078
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
but first we should set up a few more of
 

1079
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,870
but first we should set up a few more of
these which i'll do off camera

1080
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
these which i'll do off camera
 

1081
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,310
these which i'll do off camera
because we only have one right now we

1082
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
because we only have one right now we
 

1083
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,390
because we only have one right now we
can't make a network without

1084
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
can't make a network without
 

1085
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,029
can't make a network without
a whole bunch of them

1086
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039

 

1087
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,270

okay i actually decided to get started

1088
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280
okay i actually decided to get started
 

1089
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,590
okay i actually decided to get started
on the redstone network after all

1090
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
on the redstone network after all
 

1091
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,350
on the redstone network after all
and that needs to connect to all the

1092
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
and that needs to connect to all the
 

1093
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,510
and that needs to connect to all the
portals and i need to set up in such a

1094
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
portals and i need to set up in such a
 

1095
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,710
portals and i need to set up in such a
way where they can send

1096
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
way where they can send
 

1097
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,110
way where they can send
information between themselves and

1098
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
information between themselves and
 

1099
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,510
information between themselves and
figure out which one needs to be on

1100
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
figure out which one needs to be on
 

1101
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,270
figure out which one needs to be on
which ones need to be off and

1102
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
which ones need to be off and
 

1103
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,830
which ones need to be off and
not that simple of a feat really

1104
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
not that simple of a feat really
 

1105
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,070
not that simple of a feat really
i tried planning this out on paper like

1106
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
i tried planning this out on paper like
 

1107
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,510
i tried planning this out on paper like
trying to figure out how many wires i

1108
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
trying to figure out how many wires i
 

1109
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,590
trying to figure out how many wires i
was going to need to do all this

1110
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
was going to need to do all this
 

1111
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,110
was going to need to do all this
even using tricky tricky methods and all

1112
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
even using tricky tricky methods and all
 

1113
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,909
even using tricky tricky methods and all
that i

1114
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
that i
 

1115
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,549
that i
figured i'd need at least three

1116
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
figured i'd need at least three
 

1117
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,390
figured i'd need at least three
connecting to all the portals

1118
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400

 

1119
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,590

turns out i only need one

1120
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
turns out i only need one
 

1121
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,710
turns out i only need one
thanks to a very awesome little device

1122
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
thanks to a very awesome little device
 

1123
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,830
thanks to a very awesome little device
um and by the way right now

1124
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
um and by the way right now
 

1125
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,230
um and by the way right now
i've connected the redstone network to

1126
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
i've connected the redstone network to
 

1127
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,350
i've connected the redstone network to
the lava

1128
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
the lava
 

1129
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,470
the lava
bucket so the idea is when i select the

1130
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
bucket so the idea is when i select the
 

1131
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,990
bucket so the idea is when i select the
destination from the panel

1132
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
destination from the panel
 

1133
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,190
destination from the panel
it's going to disable all the portals

1134
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
it's going to disable all the portals
 

1135
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,870
it's going to disable all the portals
and then it's going to turn one of them

1136
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:12,880
and then it's going to turn one of them
 

1137
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,750
and then it's going to turn one of them
on the one that we selected

1138
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
on the one that we selected
 

1139
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,870
on the one that we selected
so the network's going to

1140
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:18,880
so the network's going to
 

1141
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,870
so the network's going to
disable all the portals first of all so

1142
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
disable all the portals first of all so
 

1143
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,990
disable all the portals first of all so
this wire goes to the

1144
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
this wire goes to the
 

1145
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,190
this wire goes to the
disable for this portal

1146
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
disable for this portal
 

1147
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,149
disable for this portal
and this is the awesome little thing

1148
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159
and this is the awesome little thing
 

1149
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,190
and this is the awesome little thing
right here

1150
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
right here
 

1151
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,230
right here
this is a two-way repeater i saw this on

1152
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
this is a two-way repeater i saw this on
 

1153
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,830
this is a two-way repeater i saw this on
a youtube channel called redstone

1154
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840
a youtube channel called redstone
 

1155
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,590
a youtube channel called redstone
innovation and it is the best two-way

1156
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
innovation and it is the best two-way
 

1157
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,590
innovation and it is the best two-way
repeater i've ever seen

1158
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
repeater i've ever seen
 

1159
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,789
repeater i've ever seen
in minecraft to date it is so good

1160
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
in minecraft to date it is so good
 

1161
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,110
in minecraft to date it is so good
um these are two sticky pistons

1162
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
um these are two sticky pistons
 

1163
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,470
um these are two sticky pistons
redstone block it's a little more

1164
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
redstone block it's a little more
 

1165
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,310
redstone block it's a little more
expensive than some of them because you

1166
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
expensive than some of them because you
 

1167
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,669
expensive than some of them because you
got to use redstone

1168
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
got to use redstone
 

1169
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,750
got to use redstone
blocks but there's no repeaters

1170
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760

 

1171
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,070

i think it's pretty good like regarding

1172
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
i think it's pretty good like regarding
 

1173
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,830
i think it's pretty good like regarding
like lighting updates

1174
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
like lighting updates
 

1175
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,870
like lighting updates
and a nice thing about it is actually

1176
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
and a nice thing about it is actually
 

1177
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,710
and a nice thing about it is actually
carries the length of the signal through

1178
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
carries the length of the signal through
 

1179
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,230
carries the length of the signal through
it

1180
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
it
 

1181
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,070
it
um so

1182
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
um so
 

1183
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,669
um so
let's see i'm just going to break this

1184
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
let's see i'm just going to break this
 

1185
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,350
let's see i'm just going to break this
for right now

1186
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
for right now
 

1187
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,710
for right now
actually you know we can do a little

1188
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
actually you know we can do a little
 

1189
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,870
actually you know we can do a little
test here let's go up let's go back

1190
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
test here let's go up let's go back
 

1191
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,029
test here let's go up let's go back
up here

1192
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039

 

1193
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,029

so the way this works we'll just turn

1194
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
so the way this works we'll just turn
 

1195
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,070
so the way this works we'll just turn
this on manually

1196
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,080
this on manually
 

1197
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,590
this on manually
this is not the timer so it's going to

1198
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
this is not the timer so it's going to
 

1199
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,830
this is not the timer so it's going to
stay stay on

1200
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
stay stay on
 

1201
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,669
stay stay on
and as i use my nether portals i can

1202
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
and as i use my nether portals i can
 

1203
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,510
and as i use my nether portals i can
keep them on too if i want

1204
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
keep them on too if i want
 

1205
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,789
keep them on too if i want
because this thing is going to be able

1206
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
because this thing is going to be able
 

1207
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,510
because this thing is going to be able
to disable all of them at once

1208
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
to disable all of them at once
 

1209
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,190
to disable all of them at once
oh don't you don't you shoot at me

1210
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
oh don't you don't you shoot at me
 

1211
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,950
oh don't you don't you shoot at me
and i've also tested these two-way

1212
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
and i've also tested these two-way
 

1213
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,310
and i've also tested these two-way
repeaters

1214
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
repeaters
 

1215
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,070
repeaters
in creative to make sure that they work

1216
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
in creative to make sure that they work
 

1217
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,510
in creative to make sure that they work
in unloaded chunks and they do

1218
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
in unloaded chunks and they do
 

1219
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,750
in unloaded chunks and they do
so if we go all the way over here this

1220
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
so if we go all the way over here this
 

1221
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,990
so if we go all the way over here this
is about where

1222
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
is about where
 

1223
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,149
is about where
another portal is going to be

1224
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159

 

1225
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,830

this is like the start of the nether hub

1226
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
this is like the start of the nether hub
 

1227
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,110
this is like the start of the nether hub
right here

1228
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,120
right here
 

1229
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,870
right here
up here so if we send a signal down here

1230
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
up here so if we send a signal down here
 

1231
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,750
up here so if we send a signal down here
uh what it does is it pushes or makes a

1232
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
uh what it does is it pushes or makes a
 

1233
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,750
uh what it does is it pushes or makes a
sticky piston extend

1234
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
sticky piston extend
 

1235
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,390
sticky piston extend
this goes out and then

1236
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
this goes out and then
 

1237
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,710
this goes out and then
when this block comes out instead of the

1238
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
when this block comes out instead of the
 

1239
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,789
when this block comes out instead of the
wire going straight into that block

1240
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
wire going straight into that block
 

1241
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,669
wire going straight into that block
it connects to this and that prevents it

1242
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
it connects to this and that prevents it
 

1243
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,950
it connects to this and that prevents it
from looping back

1244
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
from looping back
 

1245
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,590
from looping back
and to towards itself again which is

1246
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
and to towards itself again which is
 

1247
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,789
and to towards itself again which is
what

1248
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
what
 

1249
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,310
what
uh you gotta do when you're making a

1250
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
uh you gotta do when you're making a
 

1251
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,190
uh you gotta do when you're making a
two-way repeater

1252
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
two-way repeater
 

1253
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,710
two-way repeater
but yeah that goes all the way down so

1254
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720

 

1255
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,590

let's disable that this will take care

1256
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
let's disable that this will take care
 

1257
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,789
let's disable that this will take care
of

1258
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
of
 

1259
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,950
of
um disabling all the portals but we

1260
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
um disabling all the portals but we
 

1261
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,070
um disabling all the portals but we
still need to tell

1262
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
still need to tell
 

1263
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,750
still need to tell
a specific one to turn on

1264
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
a specific one to turn on
 

1265
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,590
a specific one to turn on
nice thing about this is we can connect

1266
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
nice thing about this is we can connect
 

1267
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,269
nice thing about this is we can connect
anywhere in the system like if we have a

1268
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
anywhere in the system like if we have a
 

1269
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,029
anywhere in the system like if we have a
portal here we can connect between

1270
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
portal here we can connect between
 

1271
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,269
portal here we can connect between
two of these repeaters and it will still

1272
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
two of these repeaters and it will still
 

1273
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,230
two of these repeaters and it will still
send

1274
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
send
 

1275
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,230
send
the redstone signal to all the portals

1276
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
the redstone signal to all the portals
 

1277
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,430
the redstone signal to all the portals
no problem

1278
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440

 

1279
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,310

um two-way repeaters would be very nice

1280
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
um two-way repeaters would be very nice
 

1281
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,909
um two-way repeaters would be very nice
to have in the game

1282
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:07,919
to have in the game
 

1283
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,830
to have in the game
like their own block actually because

1284
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:11,840
like their own block actually because
 

1285
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,310
like their own block actually because
they are really cool so yeah that

1286
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
they are really cool so yeah that
 

1287
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,430
they are really cool so yeah that
disabled the portal

1288
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,440
disabled the portal
 

1289
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,070
disabled the portal
all the way from over there and it would

1290
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
all the way from over there and it would
 

1291
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,630
all the way from over there and it would
work

1292
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
work
 

1293
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,830
work
going from here down that way too

1294
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:22,840

 

1295
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,350

um

1296
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
um
 

1297
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,950
um
what was i gonna do i had something else

1298
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
what was i gonna do i had something else
 

1299
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,830
what was i gonna do i had something else
i was gonna do

1300
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840

 

1301
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,510

oh yeah i gotta talk about so how am i

1302
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
oh yeah i gotta talk about so how am i
 

1303
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,870
oh yeah i gotta talk about so how am i
gonna enable

1304
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
gonna enable
 

1305
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,149
gonna enable
a specific portal well this

1306
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
a specific portal well this
 

1307
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,950
a specific portal well this
this carries the length of the signal so

1308
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
this carries the length of the signal so
 

1309
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,230
this carries the length of the signal so
let's say this

1310
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,240
let's say this
 

1311
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,630
let's say this
this redstone wire turns on for 10 ticks

1312
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
this redstone wire turns on for 10 ticks
 

1313
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,909
this redstone wire turns on for 10 ticks
and then off

1314
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
and then off
 

1315
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,230
and then off
uh with that pulse we're going to

1316
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
uh with that pulse we're going to
 

1317
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,830
uh with that pulse we're going to
disable the portals but i'm

1318
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
disable the portals but i'm
 

1319
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,669
disable the portals but i'm
also going to try invent some kind of

1320
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
also going to try invent some kind of
 

1321
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,430
also going to try invent some kind of
decoder

1322
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
decoder
 

1323
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,029
decoder
that will only let a signal through if

1324
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
that will only let a signal through if
 

1325
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,430
that will only let a signal through if
like for example this is on for 10 ticks

1326
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
like for example this is on for 10 ticks
 

1327
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,909
like for example this is on for 10 ticks
it'll let a signal through if it's on 9

1328
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
it'll let a signal through if it's on 9
 

1329
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,630
it'll let a signal through if it's on 9
or 11 ticks it won't

1330
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
or 11 ticks it won't
 

1331
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,990
or 11 ticks it won't
and that will be the unique code to turn

1332
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,000
and that will be the unique code to turn
 

1333
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,430
and that will be the unique code to turn
one of the portals on and one of them

1334
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
one of the portals on and one of them
 

1335
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,269
one of the portals on and one of them
might be for nine ticks one for ten

1336
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
might be for nine ticks one for ten
 

1337
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,430
might be for nine ticks one for ten
one for eleven so we can send

1338
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
one for eleven so we can send
 

1339
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,549
one for eleven so we can send
information through

1340
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
information through
 

1341
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,590
information through
the single wire uh depending on how long

1342
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
the single wire uh depending on how long
 

1343
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,230
the single wire uh depending on how long
it's on for uh to all the portals as

1344
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
it's on for uh to all the portals as
 

1345
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,630
it's on for uh to all the portals as
well

1346
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,640
well
 

1347
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,029
well
so that's how we're going to turn a

1348
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
so that's how we're going to turn a
 

1349
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,029
so that's how we're going to turn a
specific one on we'll give each one its

1350
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
specific one on we'll give each one its
 

1351
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,990
specific one on we'll give each one its
own unique

1352
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,000
own unique
 

1353
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,510
own unique
uh timing and that makes uh

1354
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
uh timing and that makes uh
 

1355
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,269
uh timing and that makes uh
sending the signal pretty easy too we

1356
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
sending the signal pretty easy too we
 

1357
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,110
sending the signal pretty easy too we
just need to

1358
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
just need to
 

1359
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,269
just need to
send a certain length of pulse to the

1360
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
send a certain length of pulse to the
 

1361
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,149
send a certain length of pulse to the
wire

1362
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
wire
 

1363
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,070
wire
which isn't really that complicated

1364
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080

 

1365
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,710

and that is the plan but it's going to

1366
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
and that is the plan but it's going to
 

1367
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,389
and that is the plan but it's going to
take a little bit of time to set it all

1368
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
take a little bit of time to set it all
 

1369
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,110
take a little bit of time to set it all
up

1370
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
up
 

1371
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,310
up
which we won't do all today but that

1372
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
which we won't do all today but that
 

1373
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,149
which we won't do all today but that
is that's what i got in mind

1374
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
is that's what i got in mind
 

1375
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,630
is that's what i got in mind
um kind of a fun little technical

1376
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
um kind of a fun little technical
 

1377
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,909
um kind of a fun little technical
project

1378
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
project
 

1379
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,870
project
that will probably be really useful too

1380
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880

 

1381
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,430

so we have a little bit of a problem

1382
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
so we have a little bit of a problem
 

1383
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,070
so we have a little bit of a problem
here

1384
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
here
 

1385
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,789
here
the map the map is doing something very

1386
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
the map the map is doing something very
 

1387
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,549
the map the map is doing something very
strange it's almost like it's

1388
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
strange it's almost like it's
 

1389
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,310
strange it's almost like it's
all the colors started to run and now

1390
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
all the colors started to run and now
 

1391
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,750
all the colors started to run and now
it's a liquid surface on it or something

1392
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
it's a liquid surface on it or something
 

1393
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,350
it's a liquid surface on it or something
i think what it's doing actually is it's

1394
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
i think what it's doing actually is it's
 

1395
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,070
i think what it's doing actually is it's
like rendering the map properly but now

1396
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
like rendering the map properly but now
 

1397
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,830
like rendering the map properly but now
also rendering some layer above it

1398
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840

 

1399
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,230

yeah i don't know and the weird thing is

1400
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
yeah i don't know and the weird thing is
 

1401
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,230
yeah i don't know and the weird thing is
i've tried reloading

1402
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240

 

1403
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,669

and it's still doing it so i might need

1404
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
and it's still doing it so i might need
 

1405
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,590
and it's still doing it so i might need
to completely reload the game or leave

1406
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,600
to completely reload the game or leave
 

1407
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,110
to completely reload the game or leave
the area and come back and that might

1408
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
the area and come back and that might
 

1409
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,149
the area and come back and that might
fix it

1410
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:36,159
fix it
 

1411
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,230
fix it
we'll see but yeah here is the comment i

1412
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
we'll see but yeah here is the comment i

that you should not just buy a computer

1428
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
that you should not just buy a computer
 

1429

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
expensive or it's too hard
 

1433
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,830
expensive or it's too hard
it's not it's less expensive and it's

also for two grand you could build a

1442
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
also for two grand you could build a
 

1443
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,990
also for two grand you could build a
very very

1444
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
very very
 

1445
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,669
very very
very beastly computer much better than

1446
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
very beastly computer much better than
 

1447
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,990
very beastly computer much better than
anything you can buy with the same

1448
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
anything you can buy with the same
 

1449
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,190
anything you can buy with the same
amount today

1450
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,200

 

1451
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,950

and that kind of goes along with what

1452
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:22,960
and that kind of goes along with what
 

1453
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,190
and that kind of goes along with what
most people said uh

1454
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
most people said uh
 

1455
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,630
most people said uh
as far as i could tell though people

1456
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
as far as i could tell though people
 

1457
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,870
as far as i could tell though people
said the one i was looking at was a good

1458
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
said the one i was looking at was a good
 

1459
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,110
said the one i was looking at was a good
good computer good value but that i

1460
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
good computer good value but that i
 

1461
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,029
good computer good value but that i
should build a custom one and i would

1462
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
should build a custom one and i would
 

1463
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,350
should build a custom one and i would
get

1464
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
get
 

1465
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,789
get
more for my money

1466
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799

 

1467
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,549

um i don't know

1468
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
um i don't know
 

1469
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,870
um i don't know
i i used to always build custom

1470
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
i i used to always build custom
 

1471
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,029
i i used to always build custom
computers in the past

1472
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
computers in the past
 

1473
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,110
computers in the past
and then one day i was this lazy and i

1474
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
and then one day i was this lazy and i
 

1475
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,310
and then one day i was this lazy and i
decided i would just buy

1476
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,320
decided i would just buy
 

1477
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,110
decided i would just buy
a store-bought one i was very happy with

1478
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120
a store-bought one i was very happy with
 

1479
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,149
a store-bought one i was very happy with
that computer then

1480
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
that computer then
 

1481
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,389
that computer then
the next one i got was also store-bought

1482
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
the next one i got was also store-bought
 

1483
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,510
the next one i got was also store-bought
this is going to be my

1484
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
this is going to be my
 

1485
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,190
this is going to be my
third store-bought one um

1486
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
third store-bought one um
 

1487
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,710
third store-bought one um
i've actually been really happy with

1488
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
i've actually been really happy with
 

1489
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,310
i've actually been really happy with
store-bought computers compared to

1490
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
store-bought computers compared to
 

1491
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,909
store-bought computers compared to
custom ones i was

1492
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
custom ones i was
 

1493
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,310
custom ones i was
i always had some weird technical

1494
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
i always had some weird technical
 

1495
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,750
i always had some weird technical
problem with the custom ones like

1496
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
problem with the custom ones like
 

1497
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,149
problem with the custom ones like
oh i don't know what i don't know what

1498
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:12,159
oh i don't know what i don't know what
 

1499
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,669
oh i don't know what i don't know what
the deal was like

1500
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
the deal was like
 

1501
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,590
the deal was like
stuff would fry every now and then of

1502
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
stuff would fry every now and then of
 

1503
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,110
stuff would fry every now and then of
course it was a long time ago when

1504
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,120
course it was a long time ago when
 

1505
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,870
course it was a long time ago when
windows wasn't as good and that kind of

1506
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
windows wasn't as good and that kind of

i'll say one positive thing about custom

1514
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
i'll say one positive thing about custom
 

1515
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,549
i'll say one positive thing about custom
computers somebody brought out a really

1516
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
computers somebody brought out a really
 

1517
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,750
computers somebody brought out a really
good point

1518
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
good point
 

1519
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,190
good point
that when you buy a store-bought one

1520
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
that when you buy a store-bought one
 

1521
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,389
that when you buy a store-bought one
chances are they're going to put in a

1522
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:38,399
chances are they're going to put in a
 

1523
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,310
chances are they're going to put in a
really cheap motherboard or

1524
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
really cheap motherboard or
 

1525
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,789
really cheap motherboard or
very basic motherboard that's a really

1526
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:42,799
very basic motherboard that's a really
 

1527
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,070
very basic motherboard that's a really
important part of the computer because

1528
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
important part of the computer because
 

1529
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,190
important part of the computer because
that's what

1530
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200

 

1531
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,510

connects everything together basically

1532
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:49,520
connects everything together basically
 

1533
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,549
connects everything together basically
and you'll want a good quality one

1534
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
and you'll want a good quality one
 

1535
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,909
and you'll want a good quality one
which you probably won't get with a

1536
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
which you probably won't get with a
 

1537
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,510
which you probably won't get with a
store-bought and if you build a custom

1538
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
store-bought and if you build a custom
 

1539
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,230
store-bought and if you build a custom
one you can

1540
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
one you can
 

1541
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,269
one you can
choose whichever motherboard you want

1542
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
choose whichever motherboard you want
 

1543
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,149

that almost had me consider building a

1544
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
that almost had me consider building a
 

1545
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,830
that almost had me consider building a
custom computer actually but

1546
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
custom computer actually but
 

1547
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,190

and
if i'm unhappy with it i'll probably do

1560
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
if i'm unhappy with it i'll probably do
 

1561
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,190
if i'm unhappy with it i'll probably do
a custom one next time

1562
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
a custom one next time
 

1563
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,950
a custom one next time
the thing is in canada i don't think

custom computers are much
 

1567
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,909
custom computers are much
cheaper i've priced it out in the past

1568
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
cheaper i've priced it out in the past
 

1569
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,509

and just the time i save not doing it

1590
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
and just the time i save not doing it
 

1591
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,269

1597
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,990
i don't have a lot of free time so if i
can get out of building a computer

1598
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
can get out of building a computer
 

1599
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,029
can get out of building a computer
definitely going to go that way

1600
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
definitely going to go that way
 

1601
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,590

we're gonna get that store-bought one i
was talking about and hopefully it works

1614
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,159
was talking about and hopefully it works
 

1615
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,509
was talking about and hopefully it works
out the main thing i'm worried about

1616
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
out the main thing i'm worried about
 

1617
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,710
out the main thing i'm worried about
actually is a fan

1618
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
actually is a fan
 

1619
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,710
actually is a fan
i since it's from the web i'm not sure

1620
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
i since it's from the web i'm not sure
 

1621
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,669
i since it's from the web i'm not sure
if the fan is quiet on it or not

1622
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
if the fan is quiet on it or not
 

1623
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,350
if the fan is quiet on it or not
and if it's loud it will get picked up

1624
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360
and if it's loud it will get picked up
 

1625
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,190
and if it's loud it will get picked up
and recording which would really suck

1626
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
and recording which would really suck
 

1627
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,190
and recording which would really suck
so we'll see what happens

1628
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
so we'll see what happens
 

1629
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,110
so we'll see what happens
anyway that's going to be it for today
