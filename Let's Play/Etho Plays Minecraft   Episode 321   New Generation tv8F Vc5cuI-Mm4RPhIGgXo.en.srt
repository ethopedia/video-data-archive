sort of uh situation
you can see it's it's kind of working

26
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
you can see it's it's kind of working
 

27
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,830
you can see it's it's kind of working
it's working pretty good we got creepers

28
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
it's working pretty good we got creepers
 

29
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,910
it's working pretty good we got creepers
skeletons zombies there's a creeper in

30
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
skeletons zombies there's a creeper in
 

31
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,830
skeletons zombies there's a creeper in
the skeletons

32
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840

 

33
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,470

um the mobs are still trying to

34
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
um the mobs are still trying to
 

35
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,110
um the mobs are still trying to
pathfind out of there like

36
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120

 

37
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,950

they're looking this way i i changed it

38
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
they're looking this way i i changed it
 

39
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,029
they're looking this way i i changed it
up so they fall four blocks now

40
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
up so they fall four blocks now
 

41
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,150
up so they fall four blocks now
thinking that would fix it and it didn't

42
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
thinking that would fix it and it didn't
 

43
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,709
thinking that would fix it and it didn't
um this is not something i can replicate

44
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
um this is not something i can replicate
 

45
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,549
um this is not something i can replicate
either in a creative world if i rebuild

46
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
either in a creative world if i rebuild
 

47
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,750
either in a creative world if i rebuild
this

48
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
this
 

49
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,590
this
in a creative world i don't have this

50
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
in a creative world i don't have this
 

51
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,350
in a creative world i don't have this
problem so it's something to do with my

52
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
problem so it's something to do with my
 

53
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,109
problem so it's something to do with my
cave here they're seeing something they

54
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
cave here they're seeing something they
 

55
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,109
cave here they're seeing something they
want to go to

56
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
want to go to
 

57
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,149
want to go to
and i don't know what so it's

58
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
and i don't know what so it's
 

59
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,670
and i don't know what so it's
really tough to uh to stop it because i

60
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
really tough to uh to stop it because i
 

61
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,350
really tough to uh to stop it because i
have no idea what's going on

62
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
have no idea what's going on
 

63
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,350
have no idea what's going on
without looking at how the pathfinding

64
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
without looking at how the pathfinding
 

65
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,630
without looking at how the pathfinding
code works i guess

66
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
code works i guess
 

67
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,350
code works i guess
and even then probably pretty tough to

68
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
and even then probably pretty tough to
 

69
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,149
and even then probably pretty tough to
figure it out

70
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
figure it out
 

71
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,510
figure it out
but the good news i have made a few

72
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
but the good news i have made a few
 

73
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,030
but the good news i have made a few
adjustments to it and

74
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
adjustments to it and
 

75
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,190
adjustments to it and
it has helped it quite a bit i have

76
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200

 

77
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,670

you see where that sloped rail is i have

78
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
you see where that sloped rail is i have
 

79
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,789
you see where that sloped rail is i have
a glass block

80
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
a glass block
 

81
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,630
a glass block
right above that now which means

82
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
right above that now which means
 

83
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,469
right above that now which means
when the minecart goes through up there

84
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
when the minecart goes through up there
 

85
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,469
when the minecart goes through up there
it cannot come back anymore

86
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
it cannot come back anymore
 

87
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,389
it cannot come back anymore
so even though they're trying to fight

88
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
so even though they're trying to fight
 

89
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,469
so even though they're trying to fight
and go this way

90
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
and go this way
 

91
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,069
and go this way
they can't and also i put up

92
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
they can't and also i put up
 

93
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,270
they can't and also i put up
another piston up there which makes sure

94
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
another piston up there which makes sure
 

95
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,990
another piston up there which makes sure
they can't fall off that hopper until

96
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
they can't fall off that hopper until
 

97
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,190
they can't fall off that hopper until
until it's time to which is good i've

98
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
until it's time to which is good i've
 

99
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,910
until it's time to which is good i've
also lengthened the timing on

100
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
also lengthened the timing on
 

101
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,150
also lengthened the timing on
uh how long that block is out for so it

102
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
uh how long that block is out for so it
 

103
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,270
uh how long that block is out for so it
gives the creepers and

104
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
gives the creepers and
 

105
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,110
gives the creepers and
and the zombies a little bit more time

106
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
and the zombies a little bit more time
 

107
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,670
and the zombies a little bit more time
to figure out which way to go

108
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
to figure out which way to go
 

109
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,229
to figure out which way to go
and that seems to help quite a bit

110
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
and that seems to help quite a bit
 

111
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,910
and that seems to help quite a bit
although skeletons

112
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
although skeletons
 

113
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,869
although skeletons
also get more time to figure out where

114
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
also get more time to figure out where
 

115
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,070
also get more time to figure out where
they shouldn't go

116
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
they shouldn't go
 

117
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,630
they shouldn't go
so sometimes they go to the creepers or

118
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
so sometimes they go to the creepers or
 

119
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,070
so sometimes they go to the creepers or
the zombies but

120
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
the zombies but
 

121
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,830
the zombies but
it's working a lot better it's working a

122
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
it's working a lot better it's working a
 

123
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,150
it's working a lot better it's working a
lot better

124
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
lot better
 

125
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,830
lot better
so i am happy with that very good

126
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840

 

127
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,309

um yeah

128
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319

 

129
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,030

but i've been here for for a few hours

130
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
but i've been here for for a few hours
 

131
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,949
but i've been here for for a few hours
adjusting things and trying to

132
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
adjusting things and trying to
 

133
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,949
adjusting things and trying to
figure out the problems uh i am ready

134
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
figure out the problems uh i am ready
 

135
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,390
figure out the problems uh i am ready
to go do something else so we're not

136
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
to go do something else so we're not
 

137
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,710
to go do something else so we're not
gonna work on this uh

138
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
gonna work on this uh
 

139
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,190

at this moment anyway we're gonna go to
do something else because

142
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400

i'm
 

153
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,470
i'm

154
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
in the new snapshot and there has been a
 

155
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,229
in the new snapshot and there has been a
lot of changes

with villagers and trading and all that
there's new villager types

160
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
there's new villager types
 

161
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,070
there's new villager types

that's not so great for this village but
 

473
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,230
that's not so great for this village but
you could automate it

474
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
you could automate it
 

475
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,269

00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
for sure but uh not with these ones
 

477
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,350
for sure but uh not with these ones
because they've already been automated a

478
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
because they've already been automated a
 

479
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,710
because they've already been automated a
different way

480
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
different way
 

481
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,150
different way
but you could get a hopper minecart

482
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
but you could get a hopper minecart
 

483
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,230
but you could get a hopper minecart
running below

484

quickly just by
hunting them in the water so

1178
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
hunting them in the water so
 

1179
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,950
hunting them in the water so
we're gonna build a

1180
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
we're gonna build a
 

1181
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,149

00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,360
from before the 1.8 or whatever
 

1341
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,350
from before the 1.8 or whatever
uh i guess they they can't carry stuff

1342
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
uh i guess they they can't carry stuff
 

1343
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,950
uh i guess they they can't carry stuff
like these new ones so they they won't

1344
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
like these new ones so they they won't
 

1345
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,470
like these new ones so they they won't
pick up bread they won't pick up

1346
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
pick up bread they won't pick up
 

1347
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,430
pick up bread they won't pick up
wheat you could use them for farming the

1348
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
wheat you could use them for farming the
 

1349
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,029
wheat you could use them for farming the
wheat really easily

1350
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
wheat really easily
 

1351
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,990
wheat really easily
because you don't have to worry about

1352
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
because you don't have to worry about
 

1353
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,990
because you don't have to worry about
them picking up before you can you can

1354
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
them picking up before you can you can
 

1355
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,950
them picking up before you can you can
steal it from them you know

1356
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
steal it from them you know
 

1357
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,590
steal it from them you know
you could also even set them up where

1358
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
you could also even set them up where
 

1359
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,669
you could also even set them up where
if if you position them on top of a

1360
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
if if you position them on top of a
 

1361
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,789
if if you position them on top of a
hopper the other villagers

1362
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,799
hopper the other villagers
 

1363
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,830
hopper the other villagers
will throw bread at them

1364
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
will throw bread at them
 

1365
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,909
will throw bread at them
and you can turn it into like a bread

1366
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
and you can turn it into like a bread
 

1367
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,110
and you can turn it into like a bread
farm

1368
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
farm
 

1369
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,549
farm
um because because other villagers will

1370
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:06,559
um because because other villagers will
 

1371
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,909
um because because other villagers will
make bread from wheat

1372
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
make bread from wheat
 

1373
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,830
make bread from wheat
and then they'll chuck it at the old

1374
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,840
and then they'll chuck it at the old
 

1375
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,750
and then they'll chuck it at the old
villager and then the old villager won't

1376
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
villager and then the old villager won't
 

1377
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,710
villager and then the old villager won't
pick it up

1378
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
pick it up
 

1379
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,669
pick it up
and the hopper will get it instead so

1380
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
and the hopper will get it instead so
 

1381
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,190
and the hopper will get it instead so
that could be pretty cool

1382
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
that could be pretty cool
 

1383
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,590
that could be pretty cool

uh so i built this little thing here
 

1413
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,510
uh so i built this little thing here
this dropper has

1414
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
this dropper has
 

1415
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,110
this dropper has
book and quills in and this is for

1416
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,120
book and quills in and this is for
 

1417
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,190
book and quills in and this is for
the books the written books we're gonna

1418
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
the books the written books we're gonna
 

1419
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,149
the books the written books we're gonna
have to make a few

1420
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:12,159

 

1421
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,029

oh hey how did you get up here did you

1422
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
oh hey how did you get up here did you
 

1423
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,789
oh hey how did you get up here did you
climb the ladder

1424
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
climb the ladder
 

1425
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,149
climb the ladder
i think he's trapped here

1426
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159

 

1427
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,470

uh this is all reserved for the book and

1428
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
uh this is all reserved for the book and
 

1429
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,590
uh this is all reserved for the book and
quills because those

1430
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
quills because those
 

1431
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,630
quills because those
don't stack and uh

1432
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
don't stack and uh
 

1433
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,230
don't stack and uh
you drop them off in the top chest and

1434
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
you drop them off in the top chest and
 

1435
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,870
you drop them off in the top chest and
you can have a huge reserve

1436
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
you can have a huge reserve
 

1437
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,110
you can have a huge reserve
all the way down there then if we cut

1438
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
all the way down there then if we cut
 

1439
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,070
all the way down there then if we cut
through here

1440
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
through here
 

1441
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,470
through here
this is basically just a standard

1442
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
this is basically just a standard
 

1443
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,350
this is basically just a standard
storage cell

1444
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
storage cell
 

1445
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,870
storage cell
sort of thing where

1446
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880

 

1447
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,990

where you got three hoppers here uh this

1448
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
where you got three hoppers here uh this
 

1449
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,669
where you got three hoppers here uh this
one we're gonna put the books in

1450
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
one we're gonna put the books in
 

1451
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,669
one we're gonna put the books in
so it'll sort through them i think if

1452
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:49,679
so it'll sort through them i think if
 

1453
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,669
so it'll sort through them i think if
you have one more

1454
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679
you have one more
 

1455
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,909
you have one more
yeah it'll go down oh i heard a book

1456
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
yeah it'll go down oh i heard a book
 

1457
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,430
yeah it'll go down oh i heard a book
fall

1458
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
fall
 

1459
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,950
fall
which ended up in there because we

1460
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
which ended up in there because we
 

1461
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,549
which ended up in there because we
weren't standing in the right place

1462
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:00,559

 

1463
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,110

um then the written books will get put

1464
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,120
um then the written books will get put
 

1465
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,630
um then the written books will get put
into here and i'll

1466
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:04,640
into here and i'll
 

1467
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,509
into here and i'll
put some way of being able to collect

1468
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:07,519
put some way of being able to collect
 

1469
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,630
put some way of being able to collect
them

1470
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
them
 

1471
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,950
them
and this wire also goes up over top here

1472
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
and this wire also goes up over top here
 

1473
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,389
and this wire also goes up over top here
to the dropper which is behind this

1474
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:16,399
to the dropper which is behind this
 

1475
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:16,950
to the dropper which is behind this
block

1476
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:16,960
block
 

1477
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,750
block
so i think if we let's try it out

1478
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
so i think if we let's try it out
 

1479
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,710
so i think if we let's try it out
hopefully it works

1480
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720

 

1481
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,549

get that back okay so i think if we

1482
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
get that back okay so i think if we
 

1483
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,310
get that back okay so i think if we
stand here

1484
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
stand here
 

1485
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,830
stand here
we'll have to get a few books to get it

1486
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:30,840
we'll have to get a few books to get it
 

1487
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,950
we'll have to get a few books to get it
started

1488
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960

1506
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
and yeah let's get a
 

1507
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,269
and yeah let's get a
couple more i suppose

1508
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:01,279
couple more i suppose
 

1509
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,870
couple more i suppose
okay so you put the book in the middle

1510
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
okay so you put the book in the middle
 

1511
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,630
okay so you put the book in the middle
now i can use the

1512
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,640
now i can use the
 

1513
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,669
now i can use the
the number keys so four five

1514
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
the number keys so four five
 

1515
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,470
the number keys so four five
six seven eight nine and quickly get

1516
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
six seven eight nine and quickly get
 

1517
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,590
six seven eight nine and quickly get
them going there

1518
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600

 

1519
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,029

treat the books drop them is it going to

1520
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
treat the books drop them is it going to
 

1521
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,710
treat the books drop them is it going to
pick it up again

1522
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
pick it up again
 

1523
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,909
pick it up again
only oh i've only dispensed two oh

1524
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919

 

1525
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,549

oh uh there seems to be a flaw

1526
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
oh uh there seems to be a flaw
 

1527
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,549
oh uh there seems to be a flaw
somewhere it only gave me two

1528
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559

 

1529
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:40,830

they're not there that's not messed up

1530
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,840

 

1531
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,310

okay not quite working right

1532
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,320

 

1533
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,990

let's try this again i'm going to throw

1534
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
let's try this again i'm going to throw
 

1535
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,549
let's try this again i'm going to throw
10 and just see how many it gives me

1536
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559

 

1537
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,190

just two again okay hmm

1538
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
just two again okay hmm
 

1539
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,070
just two again okay hmm
hmm what's going on guy what's wrong

1540
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
hmm what's going on guy what's wrong
 

1541
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,370
hmm what's going on guy what's wrong
with the redstone

1542
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:06,380

 

1543
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,710

[Applause]

1544
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,720
[Applause]
 

1545
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,909
[Applause]
i think that's fine i'll have to

1546
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
i think that's fine i'll have to
 

1547
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,990
i think that's fine i'll have to
i'll try have to try work this out give

1548
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
i'll try have to try work this out give
 

1549
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,710
i'll try have to try work this out give
me a second

1550
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720

 

1551
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,549

so it's a very subtle problem but i

1552
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
so it's a very subtle problem but i
 

1553
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,389
so it's a very subtle problem but i
think i know what it is

1554
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
think i know what it is
 

1555
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,990
think i know what it is
this comparator behaves differently

1556
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
this comparator behaves differently
 

1557
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,909
this comparator behaves differently
depending on on what's going on

1558
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:25,919
depending on on what's going on
 

1559
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,190
depending on on what's going on
above this hopper so uh if this is a

1560
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200
above this hopper so uh if this is a
 

1561
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,750
above this hopper so uh if this is a
chest it will work properly

1562
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
chest it will work properly
 

1563
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,870
chest it will work properly
or if the hopper is facing towards a

1564
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
or if the hopper is facing towards a
 

1565
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,149
or if the hopper is facing towards a
block instead of down

1566
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
block instead of down
 

1567
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,710
block instead of down
it will also work right otherwise it

1568
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:38,720
it will also work right otherwise it
 

1569
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,549
it will also work right otherwise it
doesn't detect every item passing

1570
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
doesn't detect every item passing
 

1571
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,590
doesn't detect every item passing
through

1572
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600
through
 

1573
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,029
through
so we're going to have that facing

1574
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039
so we're going to have that facing
 

1575
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,669
so we're going to have that facing
towards the clay block now

1576
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
towards the clay block now
 

1577
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,430
towards the clay block now
and i think that will do the trick let

1578
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
and i think that will do the trick let
 

1579
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,950
and i think that will do the trick let
me get my books back

1580
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
me get my books back
 

1581
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,630
me get my books back
try this again

1582
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640
try this again
 

1583
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,590
try this again
didn't i have more books oh there they

1584
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
didn't i have more books oh there they
 

1585
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,269
didn't i have more books oh there they
are

1586
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,279
are
 

1587
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,190
are
that was weird i only saw one when i

1588
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
that was weird i only saw one when i
 

1589
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,710
that was weird i only saw one when i
first looked was there only

1590
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720
first looked was there only
 

1591
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,630
first looked was there only
did it say 10 because i didn't see the

1592
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
did it say 10 because i didn't see the
 

1593
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,909
did it say 10 because i didn't see the
10. i might be losing my mind

1594
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919

 

1595
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,710

that was weird all right so

1596
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720

 

1597
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,430

uh when i throw this five we should get

1598
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
uh when i throw this five we should get
 

1599
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,510
uh when i throw this five we should get
five book and quills

1600
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:17,520
five book and quills
 

1601
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,629
five book and quills
two three four five perfect that's the

1602
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
two three four five perfect that's the
 

1603
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,149
two three four five perfect that's the
way it's supposed to work

1604
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:22,159
way it's supposed to work
 

1605
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,750
way it's supposed to work
so now uh this should allow us to craft

1606
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
so now uh this should allow us to craft
 

1607
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,389
so now uh this should allow us to craft
the books

1608
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
the books
 

1609
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,909
the books
pretty quickly i hope

1610
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919
pretty quickly i hope
 

1611
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,990
pretty quickly i hope

the other eight

1620
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320

 

1621
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,669

yeah that's that's exactly what i wanted

1622
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
yeah that's that's exactly what i wanted
 

1623
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,109
yeah that's that's exactly what i wanted
that works out pretty good you just keep

1624
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
that works out pretty good you just keep
 

1625
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,470
that works out pretty good you just keep
doing it over and over

1626
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480

 

1627
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,470

and in fact if you're quick i guess you

1628
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
and in fact if you're quick i guess you
 

1629
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,190
and in fact if you're quick i guess you
could just press the 2 key

1630
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
could just press the 2 key
 

1631
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,470
could just press the 2 key
really quickly you don't have to keep

1632
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,480
really quickly you don't have to keep
 

1633
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,069
really quickly you don't have to keep
yeah just press two

1634
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079

 

1635
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,109

i like it yeah that's the way to do

1636
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
i like it yeah that's the way to do
 

1637
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,349
i like it yeah that's the way to do
written books

1638
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,359

 

1639
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,230

oh and we're out i ran out of the ink

1640
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,240
oh and we're out i ran out of the ink
 

1641
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,069
oh and we're out i ran out of the ink
pretty quickly i gotta say

1642
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
pretty quickly i gotta say
 

1643
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,230
pretty quickly i gotta say
so that's good though that's

1644
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,240
so that's good though that's
 

1645
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,910
so that's good though that's
probably i think i did 64 there

1646
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
probably i think i did 64 there
 

1647
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,950
probably i think i did 64 there
just about 64. so that's that's like 64

1648
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
just about 64. so that's that's like 64
 

1649
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,390
just about 64. so that's that's like 64
emeralds right there so that's pretty

1650
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400
emeralds right there so that's pretty
 

1651
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,510
emeralds right there so that's pretty
cool

1652
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
cool
 

1653
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,870
cool
um so just a nice little machine to have

1654
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
um so just a nice little machine to have
 

1655
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,390
um so just a nice little machine to have
around our village because we will

1656
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
around our village because we will
 

1657
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,910
around our village because we will
probably be trading the books for

1658
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
probably be trading the books for
 

1659
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,950
probably be trading the books for
emeralds

1660
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
emeralds
 

1661
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,870
emeralds
quite a bit

1662
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
quite a bit
 

1663
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,630
quite a bit
yeah actually i think uh

1664
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
yeah actually i think uh
 

1665
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,990
yeah actually i think uh
i think we should probably call it an

1666
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
i think we should probably call it an
 

1667
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,150
i think we should probably call it an
end here for the village stuff and

1668
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,160
end here for the village stuff and
 

1669
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,750
end here for the village stuff and
probably go do the comments because this

1670
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:53,760
probably go do the comments because this
