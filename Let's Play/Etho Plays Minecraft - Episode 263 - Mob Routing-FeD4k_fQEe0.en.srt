00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:41,540
just because of that guy they're
 

23
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,670
just because of that guy they're
constantly meowing

constantly meowing
 

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,639
constantly meowing
it is very realistic that meow I gotta

26
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:46,649
it is very realistic that meow I gotta
 

27
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,180
it is very realistic that meow I gotta
say I bet you they got it off of a real

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,190
say I bet you they got it off of a real
 

29
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,380
say I bet you they got it off of a real
cat in fact but yeah so what I would

30
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,390
cat in fact but yeah so what I would
 

31
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,779
cat in fact but yeah so what I would
like to do with this thing

32
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:56,789
like to do with this thing
 

33
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,180
like to do with this thing
is eventually build like a command

34
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,190
is eventually build like a command
 

35
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,819
is eventually build like a command
central room where I can control all the

36
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:01,829
central room where I can control all the
 

37
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,429
central room where I can control all the
things it does from a single a single

38
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:04,439
things it does from a single a single
 

39
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,210
things it does from a single a single
room so like all the different options

40
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:07,220
room so like all the different options
 

41
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,560
room so like all the different options
so one thing we can do with our mob

42
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:09,570
so one thing we can do with our mob
 

43
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,300
so one thing we can do with our mob
system is turn it on and off we have a

44
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,310
system is turn it on and off we have a
 

45
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,429
system is turn it on and off we have a
lighting system built in so that's one

46
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
lighting system built in so that's one
 

47
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,640
lighting system built in so that's one
one feature we want to control we have

48
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:16,650
one feature we want to control we have
 

49
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,440
one feature we want to control we have
this thing here which switches between

50
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,450
this thing here which switches between
 

51
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,990
this thing here which switches between
Auto killing the mobs and sending them

52
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
Auto killing the mobs and sending them
 

53
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,050
Auto killing the mobs and sending them
to this order so that's a second option

54
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,060
to this order so that's a second option
 

55
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,359
to this order so that's a second option
and then it's really up to us we're

56
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:32,369
and then it's really up to us we're
 

57
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,830
and then it's really up to us we're
still in the middle of making this thing

58
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
still in the middle of making this thing
 

59
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,109
still in the middle of making this thing
so we have to figure that out what else

60
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:36,119
so we have to figure that out what else
 

61
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,740
so we have to figure that out what else
do we want to include with our mob

62
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:39,750
do we want to include with our mob
 

63
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,120
do we want to include with our mob
system well let's see I want to do that

64
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,130
system well let's see I want to do that
 

65
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,670
system well let's see I want to do that
bomb factory thing our ultimate goal is

66
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680
bomb factory thing our ultimate goal is
 

67
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,050
bomb factory thing our ultimate goal is
to make an automatic wood harvesting

68
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,060
to make an automatic wood harvesting
 

69
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,710
to make an automatic wood harvesting
system also a cobble harvesting system

70
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
system also a cobble harvesting system
 

71
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,609
system also a cobble harvesting system
would be nice so those are two options

72
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:57,619
would be nice so those are two options
 

73
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,740
would be nice so those are two options
to get them into the bomb factory though

74
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:02,750
to get them into the bomb factory though
 

75
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,569
to get them into the bomb factory though
we can either send the creepers and

76
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:05,579
we can either send the creepers and
 

77
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,859
we can either send the creepers and
skeletons direct but we might also want

78
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:09,869
skeletons direct but we might also want
 

79
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,809
skeletons direct but we might also want
to use the bomb factory as a record

80
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:11,819
to use the bomb factory as a record
 

81
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,480
to use the bomb factory as a record
factory because it's basically the same

82
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,490
factory because it's basically the same
 

83
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,310
factory because it's basically the same
set up all we have to do instead though

84
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:16,320
set up all we have to do instead though
 

85
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,980
set up all we have to do instead though
is get the creepers down to one hit

86
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:18,990
is get the creepers down to one hit
 

87
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,630
is get the creepers down to one hit
before we send them to it and then

88
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
before we send them to it and then
 

89
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,340
before we send them to it and then
they'll get one shot killed by the

90
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,350
they'll get one shot killed by the
 

91
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,630
they'll get one shot killed by the
skeleton so we got some figuring out to

92
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:29,640
skeleton so we got some figuring out to
 

93
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,880
skeleton so we got some figuring out to
do here but basically let's let's start

94
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:33,890
do here but basically let's let's start
 

95
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,960
do here but basically let's let's start
messing around with stuff here so this

96
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:35,970
messing around with stuff here so this
 

97
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,560
messing around with stuff here so this
is where the creepers fall down here

98
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,570
is where the creepers fall down here
 

99
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,870
is where the creepers fall down here
zombies their skeletons is there I think

100
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:44,880
zombies their skeletons is there I think
 

101
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,840
zombies their skeletons is there I think
what we should do is try to position

102
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:50,850
what we should do is try to position
 

103
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,020
what we should do is try to position
them all like like three tubes that we

104
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,030
them all like like three tubes that we
 

105
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,580
them all like like three tubes that we
can actually interact with down there

106
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:58,590
can actually interact with down there
 

107
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,110
can actually interact with down there
somewhere so let's let's go down here

108
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,120
somewhere so let's let's go down here
 

109
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,420
somewhere so let's let's go down here
the fall and then we want them to get

110
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,430
the fall and then we want them to get
 

111
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,800
the fall and then we want them to get
moved a little bit which way I guess we

112
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:12,810
moved a little bit which way I guess we
 

113
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,580
moved a little bit which way I guess we
would have to move them maybe the hmm

114
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:18,590
would have to move them maybe the hmm
 

115
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,870
would have to move them maybe the hmm
let's make them go this way

116
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:22,880

 

117
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,300

okay so we'll have water here you can

118
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,310
okay so we'll have water here you can
 

119
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,920
okay so we'll have water here you can
even put that there just so that we

120
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:27,930
even put that there just so that we
 

121
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,610
even put that there just so that we
remember water will push creepers over

122
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:31,620
remember water will push creepers over
 

123
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,750
remember water will push creepers over
here and we'll make them go maybe one

124
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:38,760
here and we'll make them go maybe one
 

125
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,110
here and we'll make them go maybe one
block away from that make it bend around

126
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120
block away from that make it bend around
 

127
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,610
block away from that make it bend around
and go here okay

128
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:45,620
and go here okay
 

129
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,500
and go here okay
skeletons they fall into this swing and

130
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:48,510
skeletons they fall into this swing and
 

131
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,300
skeletons they fall into this swing and
then we'll have a water stream push them

132
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,310
then we'll have a water stream push them
 

133
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,630
then we'll have a water stream push them
out that way and zombies they fall in

134
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
out that way and zombies they fall in
 

135
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,970
out that way and zombies they fall in
there let's make them just come out over

136
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:58,980
there let's make them just come out over
 

137
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:10,220
there let's make them just come out over
this way like so and then I guess we're

138
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,230
this way like so and then I guess we're
 

139
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,050
this way like so and then I guess we're
getting close to our auto thing

140
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,060

 

141
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,220

hmm how do we want to do this because

142
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,230
hmm how do we want to do this because
 

143
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,510
hmm how do we want to do this because
we're gonna need a lot of space to build

144
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,520
we're gonna need a lot of space to build
 

145
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,440
we're gonna need a lot of space to build
other stuff too let's just think this

146
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,450
other stuff too let's just think this
 

147
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:34,530
other stuff too let's just think this
through oh there we go

148
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:34,540
through oh there we go
 

149
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,210
through oh there we go
everything's gone it's fine it's

150
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,220
everything's gone it's fine it's
 

151
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,710
everything's gone it's fine it's
happened before I'm sure okay

152
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:43,720
happened before I'm sure okay
 

153
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,430
happened before I'm sure okay
that's that's one way we could do it

154
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,440

 

155
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,610

okay

156
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:51,620
okay
 

157
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,070
okay
here's the thing I stopped a moment just

158
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
here's the thing I stopped a moment just
 

159
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,050
here's the thing I stopped a moment just
to plan this and think it through a

160
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,060
to plan this and think it through a
 

161
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,960
to plan this and think it through a
little bit better as many of you pointed

162
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,970
little bit better as many of you pointed
 

163
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,020
little bit better as many of you pointed
out before there's absolutely no points

164
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,030
out before there's absolutely no points
 

165
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,900
out before there's absolutely no points
no point whatsoever to sorting mobs and

166
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:04,910
no point whatsoever to sorting mobs and
 

167
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,730
no point whatsoever to sorting mobs and
then automatically killing them and

168
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:06,740
then automatically killing them and
 

169
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,850
then automatically killing them and
you're much better off automatically

170
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:09,860
you're much better off automatically
 

171
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,000
you're much better off automatically
killing mobs and then sorting their loot

172
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,010
killing mobs and then sorting their loot
 

173
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,450
killing mobs and then sorting their loot
using hoppers and that kind of stuff so

174
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:15,460
using hoppers and that kind of stuff so
 

175
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,520
using hoppers and that kind of stuff so
our goal with this is not to kill them

176
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:18,530
our goal with this is not to kill them
 

177
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,340
our goal with this is not to kill them
at this point what we want to do ideally

178
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,350
at this point what we want to do ideally
 

179
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:28,060
at this point what we want to do ideally
is get them down to 1 hit kill right the

180
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,070
is get them down to 1 hit kill right the
 

181
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,800
is get them down to 1 hit kill right the
reason we would want to do that is to

182
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:29,810
reason we would want to do that is to
 

183
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,450
reason we would want to do that is to
get XP from them or to get like if

184
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:34,460
get XP from them or to get like if
 

185
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,820
get XP from them or to get like if
they're wearing it armor of some sort we

186
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:36,830
they're wearing it armor of some sort we
 

187
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,940
they're wearing it armor of some sort we
can possibly get that off of them also I

188
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:41,950
can possibly get that off of them also I
 

189
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,640
can possibly get that off of them also I
would like to set up a thing where

190
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:44,650
would like to set up a thing where
 

191
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,680
would like to set up a thing where
zombies and skeletons automatically get

192
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:47,690
zombies and skeletons automatically get
 

193
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,830
zombies and skeletons automatically get
killed but creepers stay alive in

194
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
killed but creepers stay alive in
 

195
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,800
killed but creepers stay alive in
stockpile somewhere so that we can use a

196
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:53,810
stockpile somewhere so that we can use a
 

197
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,390
stockpile somewhere so that we can use a
looting sword on them and get more

198
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,400
looting sword on them and get more
 

199
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,200
looting sword on them and get more
gunpowder if if we want this this is

200
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,210
gunpowder if if we want this this is
 

201
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,630
gunpowder if if we want this this is
kind of something fancy we could do the

202
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:01,640
kind of something fancy we could do the
 

203
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,360
kind of something fancy we could do the
issue I'm running into now is space we

204
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,370
issue I'm running into now is space we
 

205
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,680
issue I'm running into now is space we
really don't have a lot of space to work

206
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:08,690
really don't have a lot of space to work
 

207
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,520
really don't have a lot of space to work
at the moment I thought of making a

208
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,530
at the moment I thought of making a
 

209
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,290
at the moment I thought of making a
water elevator and then dropping them

210
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,300
water elevator and then dropping them
 

211
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,290
water elevator and then dropping them
down just the right height so that they

212
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,300
down just the right height so that they
 

213
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,740
down just the right height so that they
would be one hit away from death but as

214
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:20,750
would be one hit away from death but as
 

215
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,810
would be one hit away from death but as
you can see we have a lot of glass and

216
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:22,820
you can see we have a lot of glass and
 

217
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,130
you can see we have a lot of glass and
stuff above here that's not actually

218
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,140
stuff above here that's not actually
 

219
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,870
stuff above here that's not actually
possible

220
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
possible
 

221
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,480
possible
so I just wanted to create it for a

222
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,490
so I just wanted to create it for a
 

223
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,250
so I just wanted to create it for a
second and I thought of another way we

224
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:32,260
second and I thought of another way we
 

225
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,590
second and I thought of another way we
could do this instead of using fall

226
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:34,600
could do this instead of using fall
 

227
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,680
could do this instead of using fall
damage to get them down to one-hit kill

228
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,690
damage to get them down to one-hit kill
 

229
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:46,710
damage to get them down to one-hit kill
we could do something like this yeah so

230
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
we could do something like this yeah so
 

231
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,050
we could do something like this yeah so
we just stepped into a creative world

232
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,060
we just stepped into a creative world
 

233
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,610
we just stepped into a creative world
for a moment here I just want to show

234
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:50,620
for a moment here I just want to show
 

235
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,370
for a moment here I just want to show
you how to get them down to a one-hit

236
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:53,380
you how to get them down to a one-hit
 

237
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,970
you how to get them down to a one-hit
kill or how I planted with the system

238
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:55,980
kill or how I planted with the system
 

239
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,160
kill or how I planted with the system
this actually gets them down to two

240
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,170
this actually gets them down to two
 

241
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,880
this actually gets them down to two
punches to kill them not just one but in

242
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:02,890
punches to kill them not just one but in
 

243
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,680
punches to kill them not just one but in
the sorting system they take a little

244
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:04,690
the sorting system they take a little
 

245
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,570
the sorting system they take a little
bit of fall damage like half a Hertz so

246
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:06,580
bit of fall damage like half a Hertz so
 

247
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,090
bit of fall damage like half a Hertz so
I think they will be down to a one punch

248
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,100
I think they will be down to a one punch
 

249
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,870
I think they will be down to a one punch
kill and we want to get them down to

250
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
kill and we want to get them down to
 

251
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,580
kill and we want to get them down to
ground level without taking any more

252
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:14,590
ground level without taking any more
 

253
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,500
ground level without taking any more
fall damage and we will hook up one of

254
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,510
fall damage and we will hook up one of
 

255
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,960
fall damage and we will hook up one of
these lava budget things to each of the

256
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:21,970
these lava budget things to each of the
 

257
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,690
these lava budget things to each of the
the mob things so one for the zombies

258
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:24,700
the mob things so one for the zombies
 

259
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,490
the mob things so one for the zombies
one for the skeletons and one for the

260
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:26,500
one for the skeletons and one for the
 

261
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,690
one for the skeletons and one for the
creepers and then I'll just I'll be able

262
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:30,700
creepers and then I'll just I'll be able
 

263
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,180
creepers and then I'll just I'll be able
to hit a button you know I'll get them

264
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,190
to hit a button you know I'll get them
 

265
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,110
to hit a button you know I'll get them
all down to one hit I hope and we might

266
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
all down to one hit I hope and we might
 

267
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,720
all down to one hit I hope and we might
just do the record firm down at ground

268
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:39,730
just do the record firm down at ground
 

269
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,800
just do the record firm down at ground
level too because the way I plan on

270
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:43,810
level too because the way I plan on
 

271
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,219
level too because the way I plan on
doing the tubes skeletons will be like

272
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:47,229
doing the tubes skeletons will be like
 

273
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,760
doing the tubes skeletons will be like
just right here so if we get just one

274
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:50,770
just right here so if we get just one
 

275
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,420
just right here so if we get just one
skeleton in there now we could set up in

276
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:54,430
skeleton in there now we could set up in
 

277
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:01,830
skeleton in there now we could set up in
a way where this where this is open and

278
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
a way where this where this is open and
 

279
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,990
a way where this where this is open and
this is open and we get a skeleton

280
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,000
this is open and we get a skeleton
 

281
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,560
this is open and we get a skeleton
that's not burning to death get out of

282
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,570
that's not burning to death get out of
 

283
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:20,670
that's not burning to death get out of
here like so and if we go to game-mode 0

284
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:20,680

 

285
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,050

Oh is he dropping they're not dropping

286
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,060
Oh is he dropping they're not dropping
 

287
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,189
Oh is he dropping they're not dropping
records huh I'll Ariel okay

288
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
records huh I'll Ariel okay
 

289
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,370
records huh I'll Ariel okay
maybe there but yeah that might be an

290
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,380
maybe there but yeah that might be an
 

291
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,399
maybe there but yeah that might be an
easier way of doing the Oh you didn't

292
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:35,409
easier way of doing the Oh you didn't
 

293
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:41,850
easier way of doing the Oh you didn't
die or maybe you did I'm confused I

294
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:41,860
die or maybe you did I'm confused I
 

295
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,900
die or maybe you did I'm confused I
think this will work okay though

296
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,910
think this will work okay though
 

297
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,030
think this will work okay though
like that's pretty simple and then I

298
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,040
like that's pretty simple and then I
 

299
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,950
like that's pretty simple and then I
don't really plan on using a record firm

300
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:49,960
don't really plan on using a record firm
 

301
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,750
don't really plan on using a record firm
all that often so I don't need anything

302
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
all that often so I don't need anything
 

303
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,730
all that often so I don't need anything
super fancy okay so it's gonna be

304
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:58,740
super fancy okay so it's gonna be
 

305
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,430
super fancy okay so it's gonna be
zombies skeleton creeper all right

306
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:02,440
zombies skeleton creeper all right
 

307
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,000
zombies skeleton creeper all right
they'll fall down here there we go

308
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,010
they'll fall down here there we go
 

309
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,730
they'll fall down here there we go
let's go down the land right there

310
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:13,740
let's go down the land right there
 

311
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,000
let's go down the land right there
so we're gonna have we're gonna have a

312
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,010
so we're gonna have we're gonna have a
 

313
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,800
so we're gonna have we're gonna have a
wall of like tubes for them over here

314
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:24,810

 

315
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,440

the way I plan on doing this is we'll

316
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,450
the way I plan on doing this is we'll
 

317
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,780
the way I plan on doing this is we'll
have like this is all getting torn out

318
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:30,790
have like this is all getting torn out
 

319
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,400
have like this is all getting torn out
this stuff here I don't have to worry

320
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,410
this stuff here I don't have to worry
 

321
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,000
this stuff here I don't have to worry
about that but there'll be a wall over

322
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,010
about that but there'll be a wall over
 

323
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,970
about that but there'll be a wall over
here like that kind of wraps around us I

324
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:38,980
here like that kind of wraps around us I
 

325
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,370
here like that kind of wraps around us I
think would look cool and we'll be able

326
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:41,380
think would look cool and we'll be able
 

327
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,680
think would look cool and we'll be able
to see zombies skeletons creepers and

328
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:43,690
to see zombies skeletons creepers and
 

329
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,900
to see zombies skeletons creepers and
we'll also be able to get around to the

330
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:45,910
we'll also be able to get around to the
 

331
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,510
we'll also be able to get around to the
other side and see them falling over

332
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:48,520
other side and see them falling over
 

333
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,230
other side and see them falling over
here I think and we should probably set

334
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,240
here I think and we should probably set
 

335
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,760
here I think and we should probably set
up where we can kill these guys too

336
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:56,770
up where we can kill these guys too
 

337
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,560
up where we can kill these guys too
because I think the ones that have armor

338
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:58,570
because I think the ones that have armor
 

339
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:06,000
because I think the ones that have armor
on have a chance of surviving but we're

340
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,010
on have a chance of surviving but we're
 

341
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,730
on have a chance of surviving but we're
gonna have the dispensers like over here

342
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:08,740
gonna have the dispensers like over here
 

343
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,420
gonna have the dispensers like over here
here and here with lava in and we'll

344
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:12,430
here and here with lava in and we'll
 

345
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,730
here and here with lava in and we'll
have a button on the side we can press

346
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:14,740
have a button on the side we can press
 

347
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,460
have a button on the side we can press
and and a piston thing to open up so the

348
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,470
and and a piston thing to open up so the
 

349
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,290
and and a piston thing to open up so the
skeletons can see us if we're standing

350
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:22,300
skeletons can see us if we're standing
 

351
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,320
skeletons can see us if we're standing
like right here to get records from them

352
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,330

 

353
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,120

well that's the general plan for what

354
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,130
well that's the general plan for what
 

355
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,560
well that's the general plan for what
happens to some moms after they go

356
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,570
happens to some moms after they go
 

357
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,460
happens to some moms after they go
through this order I will add if if it's

358
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:36,470
through this order I will add if if it's
 

359
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,350
through this order I will add if if it's
not too tough I'm gonna add Auto killers

360
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,360
not too tough I'm gonna add Auto killers
 

361
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,390
not too tough I'm gonna add Auto killers
for each of them individually - like if

362
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:43,400
for each of them individually - like if
 

363
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,340
for each of them individually - like if
we want creepers to stockpile for

364
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,350
we want creepers to stockpile for
 

365
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,080
we want creepers to stockpile for
example we need to automatically kill

366
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,090
example we need to automatically kill
 

367
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,410
example we need to automatically kill
the zombies and the skeletons and then

368
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:50,420
the zombies and the skeletons and then
 

369
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,410
the zombies and the skeletons and then
we'll get like up to 80 creepers into

370
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:53,420
we'll get like up to 80 creepers into
 

371
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,190
we'll get like up to 80 creepers into
one - which would be pretty cool so if

372
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
one - which would be pretty cool so if
 

373
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,080
one - which would be pretty cool so if
that's not tough too tough to do I'll do

374
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,090
that's not tough too tough to do I'll do
 

375
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,990
that's not tough too tough to do I'll do
that but the other thing we gotta do is

376
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
that but the other thing we gotta do is
 

377
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,630
that but the other thing we gotta do is
route the mobs to our bomb factory which

378
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:07,640
route the mobs to our bomb factory which
 

379
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,120
route the mobs to our bomb factory which
I want to build over here because

380
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,130
I want to build over here because
 

381
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,500
I want to build over here because
there's a lot of space by the way the

382
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:14,510
there's a lot of space by the way the
 

383
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,340
there's a lot of space by the way the
nice thing about having our sort of our

384
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,350
nice thing about having our sort of our
 

385
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,050
nice thing about having our sort of our
standing area right there is that's

386
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,060
standing area right there is that's
 

387
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,790
standing area right there is that's
exactly where I want to be to get the

388
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:21,800
exactly where I want to be to get the
 

389
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,760
exactly where I want to be to get the
silverfish firm working like that's

390
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:24,770
silverfish firm working like that's
 

391
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,620
silverfish firm working like that's
that's where we want to be to activate

392
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:26,630
that's where we want to be to activate
 

393
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,190
that's where we want to be to activate
the mob spawner for the silverfish

394
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
the mob spawner for the silverfish
 

395
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,040
the mob spawner for the silverfish
now now to get the mobs to go this way

396
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,050
now now to get the mobs to go this way
 

397
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,680
now now to get the mobs to go this way
we have to create junctions we don't

398
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:35,690
we have to create junctions we don't
 

399
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,210
we have to create junctions we don't
need the zombies for anything so they

400
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,220
need the zombies for anything so they
 

401
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,430
need the zombies for anything so they
they're free to go that way and and

402
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
they're free to go that way and and
 

403
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
they're free to go that way and and
we're done with them but the skeletons

404
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,450
we're done with them but the skeletons
 

405
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,060
we're done with them but the skeletons
they're gonna have to go this way and

406
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,070
they're gonna have to go this way and
 

407
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,360
they're gonna have to go this way and
same with the creepers to get the

408
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,370
same with the creepers to get the
 

409
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,250
same with the creepers to get the
skeletons out is going to be tough

410
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:51,260
skeletons out is going to be tough
 

411
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,410
skeletons out is going to be tough
because they're sandwiched between both

412
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:53,420
because they're sandwiched between both
 

413
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,650
because they're sandwiched between both
of them I think we'll have to change the

414
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:56,660
of them I think we'll have to change the
 

415
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,810
of them I think we'll have to change the
route on the zombies to make it easier

416
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:58,820
route on the zombies to make it easier
 

417
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:06,210
route on the zombies to make it easier
let's maybe go like this and then over

418
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,220
let's maybe go like this and then over
 

419
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,440
let's maybe go like this and then over
here

420
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,450

 

421
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:15,130

and I will try that so lock that back up

422
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,140
and I will try that so lock that back up
 

423
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:23,180
and I will try that so lock that back up
come up this way and wrap around like

424
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,190
come up this way and wrap around like
 

425
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,420
come up this way and wrap around like
that all right it's all sealed can I do

426
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,430
that all right it's all sealed can I do
 

427
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,880
that all right it's all sealed can I do
this dad that gives us like an extra

428
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:34,890
this dad that gives us like an extra
 

429
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,710
this dad that gives us like an extra
block to work with the skeletons if if

430
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:39,720
block to work with the skeletons if if
 

431
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,320
block to work with the skeletons if if
we make a piston come up right here then

432
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,330
we make a piston come up right here then
 

433
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,390
we make a piston come up right here then
the water will flow another way or the

434
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,400
the water will flow another way or the
 

435
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,640
the water will flow another way or the
mobs will fall another way if like for

436
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:49,650
mobs will fall another way if like for
 

437
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,760
mobs will fall another way if like for
example we remove over here just going

438
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:52,770
example we remove over here just going
 

439
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,320
example we remove over here just going
to pick this up for a sec they go this

440
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,330
to pick this up for a sec they go this
 

441
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:05,810
to pick this up for a sec they go this
way and we get them out of here yeah I

442
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:05,820
way and we get them out of here yeah I
 

443
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,340
way and we get them out of here yeah I
think we can we just have to route the

444
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,350
think we can we just have to route the
 

445
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,920
think we can we just have to route the
creepers a little different too but

446
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:09,930
creepers a little different too but
 

447
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,970
creepers a little different too but
that's what we'll do we'll have our

448
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:10,980
that's what we'll do we'll have our
 

449
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,790
that's what we'll do we'll have our
water source here piston right below

450
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:13,800
water source here piston right below
 

451
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,340
water source here piston right below
this and one right below there and we'll

452
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,350
this and one right below there and we'll
 

453
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,050
this and one right below there and we'll
alternate depending on which way we want

454
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,060
alternate depending on which way we want
 

455
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:25,430
alternate depending on which way we want
them to go well it doesn't seem like I

456
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
them to go well it doesn't seem like I
 

457
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,350
them to go well it doesn't seem like I
can get the skeletons out with the way

458
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
can get the skeletons out with the way
 

459
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,200
can get the skeletons out with the way
it's set up currently so what we're

460
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,210
it's set up currently so what we're
 

461
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,170
it's set up currently so what we're
going to do is move this whole zombie

462
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,180
going to do is move this whole zombie
 

463
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,570
going to do is move this whole zombie
chain one more block over to the left so

464
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:37,580
chain one more block over to the left so
 

465
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,340
chain one more block over to the left so
villager and trapdoors and everything

466
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,350
villager and trapdoors and everything
 

467
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,540
villager and trapdoors and everything
we're gonna move one block to the left

468
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,550
we're gonna move one block to the left
 

469
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,120
we're gonna move one block to the left
and that will give us enough space to

470
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,130
and that will give us enough space to
 

471
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,860
and that will give us enough space to
squeeze the skeletons out of there I

472
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:45,870
squeeze the skeletons out of there I
 

473
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,730
squeeze the skeletons out of there I
think yeah

474
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:49,740
think yeah
 

475
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,700
think yeah
in the meantime I have prepared a very

476
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:52,710
in the meantime I have prepared a very
 

477
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,950
in the meantime I have prepared a very
special clip for you guys I went teaming

478
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:54,960
special clip for you guys I went teaming
 

479
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,100
special clip for you guys I went teaming
I never recorded myself caving but I I
