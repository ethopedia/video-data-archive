00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,770
regular kind from regular trees this
color here is from the birch trees I

164
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:36,780
color here is from the birch trees I
 

165
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,940
color here is from the birch trees I
believe and then this blueish is from

166
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:40,950
believe and then this blueish is from
 

167
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,210
believe and then this blueish is from
the evergreen type trees and snowy

168
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,220
the evergreen type trees and snowy
 

169
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,500
the evergreen type trees and snowy
regions and to pick this stuff up you

170
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:48,510
regions and to pick this stuff up you
 

171
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,260
regions and to pick this stuff up you
need a separate inventory for all three

172
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,270
need a separate inventory for all three
 

173
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:58,709
need a separate inventory for all three
kinds

174
00:05:58,709 --> 00:05:58,719

 

175
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,939

although I can't pick this one up for

176
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:00,949
although I can't pick this one up for
 

177
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:09,149
although I can't pick this one up for
some reason so maybe there's four kinds

178
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:09,159

 

179
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:19,779

well very strange anyway so I really

180
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:19,789
well very strange anyway so I really
 

181
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:24,909
well very strange anyway so I really
like that new feature I was playing

182
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:24,919
like that new feature I was playing
 

183
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,589
like that new feature I was playing
around with the Pistons a bit already

184
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:28,599

 

185
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:30,969

gays will show you some things I tried

186
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:30,979
gays will show you some things I tried
 

187
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,420
gays will show you some things I tried
one thing I see if you could use them to

188
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,430
one thing I see if you could use them to
 

189
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,480
one thing I see if you could use them to
harvest reeds without destroying the

190
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,490
harvest reeds without destroying the
 

191
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:44,139
harvest reeds without destroying the
plant you can so that's really cool so

192
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:44,149
plant you can so that's really cool so
 

193
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,279
plant you can so that's really cool so
that's probably how I'm going to do my

194
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,289
that's probably how I'm going to do my
 

195
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:47,799
that's probably how I'm going to do my
Reed farm whenever I get around to doing

196
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:47,809
Reed farm whenever I get around to doing
 

197
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:53,159
Reed farm whenever I get around to doing
that if you do it from above it kind of

198
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,169
that if you do it from above it kind of
 

199
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,070
that if you do it from above it kind of
knocks the reed block onto the soil

200
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,080
knocks the reed block onto the soil
 

201
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,179
knocks the reed block onto the soil
block below so okay I need to do it from

202
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:01,189
block below so okay I need to do it from
 

203
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:09,299
block below so okay I need to do it from
a side like this and it pushes it aside

204
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:09,309

 

205
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,889

that's one neat thing as also playing

206
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:11,899
that's one neat thing as also playing
 

207
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,249
that's one neat thing as also playing
around with light switches now they do

208
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:15,259
around with light switches now they do
 

209
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,469
around with light switches now they do
work for making light switches I got a

210
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
work for making light switches I got a
 

211
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,399
work for making light switches I got a
little switch here completely dark and

212
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:26,409
little switch here completely dark and
 

213
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:29,859
little switch here completely dark and
it a sticky piston which is pulls a

214
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:29,869
it a sticky piston which is pulls a
 

215
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:35,930
it a sticky piston which is pulls a
block back

216
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:35,940

 

217
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,030

that's cool definitely some uses for

218
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,040
that's cool definitely some uses for
 

219
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,460
that's cool definitely some uses for
that um all right I'm going to collect

220
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,470
that um all right I'm going to collect
 

221
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,800
that um all right I'm going to collect
my thoughts a bit I'll actually you know

222
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:48,810
my thoughts a bit I'll actually you know
 

223
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,010
my thoughts a bit I'll actually you know
what I wanted to do fix this guy so now

224
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,020
what I wanted to do fix this guy so now
 

225
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,620
what I wanted to do fix this guy so now
that we can place leaf blocks it's very

226
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:54,630
that we can place leaf blocks it's very
 

227
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:01,700
that we can place leaf blocks it's very
easy to do stuff with leaves don't have

228
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:01,710
easy to do stuff with leaves don't have
 

229
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,250
easy to do stuff with leaves don't have
to grow trees to make the leaves take

230
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,260
to grow trees to make the leaves take
 

231
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,830
to grow trees to make the leaves take
the shape you want just put them

232
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:06,840
the shape you want just put them
 

233
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,490
the shape you want just put them
wherever you want yeah I'm going to

234
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,500
wherever you want yeah I'm going to
 

235
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,730
wherever you want yeah I'm going to
collect my thoughts and then we'll we

236
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:13,740
collect my thoughts and then we'll we
 

237
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,580
collect my thoughts and then we'll we
got a look at pistons yet and maybe a

238
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:16,590
got a look at pistons yet and maybe a
 

239
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,960
got a look at pistons yet and maybe a
few other things

240
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:19,970

 

241
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,240

all right maybe we'll do a sheep test I

242
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,250
all right maybe we'll do a sheep test I
 

243
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,940
all right maybe we'll do a sheep test I
know if you kill them and they still

244
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:25,950
know if you kill them and they still
 

245
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,640
know if you kill them and they still
have their wool they will always drop

246
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:28,650
have their wool they will always drop
 

247
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,409
have their wool they will always drop
one every time I want to see how much on

248
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:33,419
one every time I want to see how much on
 

249
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,770
one every time I want to see how much on
average you get shearing them four four

250
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:39,780
average you get shearing them four four
 

251
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,330
average you get shearing them four four
four so I'm guessing it's for every time

252
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:44,340
four so I'm guessing it's for every time
 

253
00:08:44,340 --> 00:09:02,270
four so I'm guessing it's for every time
oh that guy dropped two for the four was

254
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,280
oh that guy dropped two for the four was
 

255
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,210
oh that guy dropped two for the four was
at five

256
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,220
at five
 

257
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,580
at five
that was three get quite a bit more than

258
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:09,590
that was three get quite a bit more than
 

259
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,780
that was three get quite a bit more than
punching them before

260
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:11,790
punching them before
 

261
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,990
punching them before
a lot more

262
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000

 

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,320

three three so it seems to be between

264
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,330
three three so it seems to be between
 

265
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,920
three three so it seems to be between
two and four although I've gotten for a

266
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:28,930
two and four although I've gotten for a
 

267
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:37,470
two and four although I've gotten for a
lot more often that's pretty cool okay

268
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:37,480
lot more often that's pretty cool okay
 

269
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,530
lot more often that's pretty cool okay
let's go over to my experiment island

270
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:40,540
let's go over to my experiment island
 

271
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,730
let's go over to my experiment island
one other thing that's changed too I

272
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:43,740
one other thing that's changed too I
 

273
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,890
one other thing that's changed too I
noticed this right away the cobblestone

274
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:46,900
noticed this right away the cobblestone
 

275
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,650
noticed this right away the cobblestone
texture is different it's a lot there's

276
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:52,660
texture is different it's a lot there's
 

277
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,510
texture is different it's a lot there's
a lot less contrast to it so it looks

278
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,520
a lot less contrast to it so it looks
 

279
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,430
a lot less contrast to it so it looks
softer I think I like it more but I know

280
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
softer I think I like it more but I know
 

281
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,880
softer I think I like it more but I know
some people are complaining about it

282
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:01,890
some people are complaining about it
 

283
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,600
some people are complaining about it
it'll kind of blend in a little bit

284
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:06,610
it'll kind of blend in a little bit
 

285
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,550
it'll kind of blend in a little bit
better to the other blocks they'll match

286
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
better to the other blocks they'll match
 

287
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,180
better to the other blocks they'll match
other blocks a little bit better alright

288
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,190
other blocks a little bit better alright
 

289
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,460
other blocks a little bit better alright
let's go to the test area alright let's

290
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,470
let's go to the test area alright let's
 

291
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,930
let's go to the test area alright let's
have some fun with pistons shall we uh

292
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:20,940
have some fun with pistons shall we uh
 

293
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,990
have some fun with pistons shall we uh
actually the pistons look like I don't

294
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,000
actually the pistons look like I don't
 

295
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,730
actually the pistons look like I don't
like them as much as the way the mod

296
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:26,740
like them as much as the way the mod
 

297
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,250
like them as much as the way the mod
look the mod ones look they looked like

298
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,260
look the mod ones look they looked like
 

299
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,910
look the mod ones look they looked like
iron blocks these ones kind of look like

300
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
iron blocks these ones kind of look like
 

301
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,610
iron blocks these ones kind of look like
dispensers which I've never really been

302
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:35,620
dispensers which I've never really been
 

303
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,370
dispensers which I've never really been
fond of the texture for dispensers but

304
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:40,380
fond of the texture for dispensers but
 

305
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,700
fond of the texture for dispensers but
that's just the way it is and don't send

306
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:44,710
that's just the way it is and don't send
 

307
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,110
that's just the way it is and don't send
me a texture pack because I won't use it

308
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,120
me a texture pack because I won't use it
 

309
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,760
me a texture pack because I won't use it
but anyway pointing a fist ends they

310
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:53,770
but anyway pointing a fist ends they
 

311
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,450
but anyway pointing a fist ends they
move blocks I'm sure you know that once

312
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:57,460
move blocks I'm sure you know that once
 

313
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,970
move blocks I'm sure you know that once
you send power to them so the normal

314
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:02,980
you send power to them so the normal
 

315
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,480
you send power to them so the normal
Pistons move them the sticky pistons

316
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,490

 

317
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,570

retract the block with them as well so

318
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:12,580
retract the block with them as well so
 

319
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,340
retract the block with them as well so
this is the difference normal piston

320
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,350
this is the difference normal piston
 

321
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,200
this is the difference normal piston
over here

322
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,210

 

323
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,240

sticky one here looks the same right

324
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,250
sticky one here looks the same right
 

325
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,130
sticky one here looks the same right
well when they retract this is the

326
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,140
well when they retract this is the
 

327
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,350
well when they retract this is the
difference normal one the block stays

328
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,360
difference normal one the block stays
 

329
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,430
difference normal one the block stays
sticky one the block comes with it again

330
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440

 

331
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,110

to harvest them you can just punch them

332
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,120
to harvest them you can just punch them
 

333
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,700
to harvest them you can just punch them
there relieves your harvest and you can

334
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:40,710
there relieves your harvest and you can
 

335
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,350
there relieves your harvest and you can
place pistons six directions put them

336
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
place pistons six directions put them
 

337
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,810
place pistons six directions put them
straight down like that every every

338
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:50,820
straight down like that every every
 

339
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,120
straight down like that every every
which way and they're lit I find they're

340
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,130
which way and they're lit I find they're
 

341
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,120
which way and they're lit I find they're
a little bit hard to place but they

342
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,130
a little bit hard to place but they
 

343
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,620
a little bit hard to place but they
probably just require a little practice

344
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:00,630
probably just require a little practice
 

345
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:11,120
probably just require a little practice
and directly down like that um powering

346
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,130
and directly down like that um powering
 

347
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:17,680
and directly down like that um powering
them is much like powering dispensers oh

348
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:17,690
them is much like powering dispensers oh
 

349
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,100
them is much like powering dispensers oh
yeah another new change with the 1.7 so

350
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,110
yeah another new change with the 1.7 so
 

351
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,860
yeah another new change with the 1.7 so
with the repeaters now you don't need to

352
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:26,870
with the repeaters now you don't need to
 

353
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,450
with the repeaters now you don't need to
run the redstone and extra block light

354
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:29,460
run the redstone and extra block light
 

355
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,680
run the redstone and extra block light
before you would have to do that forward

356
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:33,690
before you would have to do that forward
 

357
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,660
before you would have to do that forward
to work but now you can just have the

358
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:35,670
to work but now you can just have the
 

359
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,810
to work but now you can just have the
redstone wire adjacent to the repeater

360
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:40,820

 

361
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,620

which is very nice should save space on

362
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:45,630
which is very nice should save space on
 

363
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,410
which is very nice should save space on
wiring stuff okay let's have a little

364
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:51,420
wiring stuff okay let's have a little
 

365
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,560
wiring stuff okay let's have a little
bit fun with pistons shall we something

366
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:57,570
bit fun with pistons shall we something
 

367
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,860
bit fun with pistons shall we something
people are wondering they don't launch

368
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:00,870
people are wondering they don't launch
 

369
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,540
people are wondering they don't launch
you they just move you up one block they

370
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:05,550
you they just move you up one block they
 

371
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,740
you they just move you up one block they
do not launch sands just move it up one

372
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:09,750
do not launch sands just move it up one
 

373
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,050
do not launch sands just move it up one
block and drop it a Pistons to move up

374
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,060
block and drop it a Pistons to move up
 

375
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,800
block and drop it a Pistons to move up
to twelve blocks

376
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,810

 

377
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,840

so if I could have a stack of 12 sand

378
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:21,850
so if I could have a stack of 12 sand
 

379
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:30,329
so if I could have a stack of 12 sand
and it should move it no problem one

380
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:30,339
and it should move it no problem one
 

381
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:32,249
and it should move it no problem one
really neat thing about pistons is they

382
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:32,259
really neat thing about pistons is they
 

383
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:36,090
really neat thing about pistons is they
can move items upward like these item

384
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,100
can move items upward like these item
 

385
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,679
can move items upward like these item
blocks this is the first thing in

386
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:37,689
blocks this is the first thing in
 

387
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:42,600
blocks this is the first thing in
Minecraft that can do it so now there's

388
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:42,610
Minecraft that can do it so now there's
 

389
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,280
Minecraft that can do it so now there's
finally a possible way to transfer items

390
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,290
finally a possible way to transfer items
 

391
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,429
finally a possible way to transfer items
from below up to your base or whatever

392
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:52,439

 

393
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:58,590

so that's neat I might try to make a

394
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:58,600
so that's neat I might try to make a
 

395
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,309
so that's neat I might try to make a
nice design with that and I'm sure many

396
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:02,319
nice design with that and I'm sure many
 

397
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:10,799
nice design with that and I'm sure many
other people have already one thing I

398
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:10,809
other people have already one thing I
 

399
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,650
other people have already one thing I
was playing around with the sticky ones

400
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:12,660
was playing around with the sticky ones
 

401
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,420
was playing around with the sticky ones
is doing this and having repeaters every

402
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,430
is doing this and having repeaters every
 

403
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:27,900
is doing this and having repeaters every
second block do that set this one to one

404
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:27,910
second block do that set this one to one
 

405
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,999
second block do that set this one to one
one two two three and four now when you

406
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:33,009
one two two three and four now when you
 

407
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:42,929
one two two three and four now when you
apply power does that Pistons can move

408
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:42,939
apply power does that Pistons can move
 

409
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:50,759
apply power does that Pistons can move
other Pistons if they are not I know

410
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:50,769
other Pistons if they are not I know
 

411
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,329
other Pistons if they are not I know
what you call it extracted or if they're

412
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:54,339
what you call it extracted or if they're
 

413
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,980
what you call it extracted or if they're
like that they won't move if they're

414
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:55,990
like that they won't move if they're
 

415
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,340
like that they won't move if they're
like that so if I apply power can't move

416
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,350
like that so if I apply power can't move
 

417
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,129
like that so if I apply power can't move
it it's like that then it can move it so

418
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:05,139
it it's like that then it can move it so
 

419
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:12,270
it it's like that then it can move it so
that's kinda neat

420
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:12,280

 

421
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,250

but these won't reject each other you

422
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:15,260
but these won't reject each other you
 

423
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,450
but these won't reject each other you
need to they can only move one block at

424
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:19,460
need to they can only move one block at
 

425
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,070
need to they can only move one block at
a time

426
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:23,080

 

427
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,570

so when this one goes bad it's not going

428
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:25,580
so when this one goes bad it's not going
 

429
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,950
so when this one goes bad it's not going
to pull both of them it's only going to

430
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:26,960
to pull both of them it's only going to
 

431
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:42,940
to pull both of them it's only going to
pull one no they're pretty fun

432
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:42,950

 

433
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,230

these things are going to be very useful

434
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,240
these things are going to be very useful
 

435
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,079
these things are going to be very useful
for many things I also played around

436
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:51,089
for many things I also played around
 

437
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,960
for many things I also played around
using them as the water gates they do

438
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:53,970
using them as the water gates they do
 

439
00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:05,389
using them as the water gates they do
work here's a crude example so when is

440
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:05,399
work here's a crude example so when is
 

441
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,639
work here's a crude example so when is
it extended like that the water won't

442
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:07,649
it extended like that the water won't
 

443
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:21,350
it extended like that the water won't
flow it's back it will and you can use

444
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
flow it's back it will and you can use
 

445
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:36,019
flow it's back it will and you can use
that for lava and stuff too so on their

446
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:36,029
that for lava and stuff too so on their
 

447
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,340

now still fine a little tight in there

466
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:21,650
now still fine a little tight in there
 

467
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,610
now still fine a little tight in there
though um today's episode does contain

so kinda neat so when I was playing

476
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
so kinda neat so when I was playing
 

477
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
so kinda neat so when I was playing
around with pistons today I came across

478
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:01,850
around with pistons today I came across
 

479
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,830
around with pistons today I came across
something very cool this is going to be

480
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
something very cool this is going to be
 

481
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,410
something very cool this is going to be
very fundamental to a lot of things I do

482
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:08,420
very fundamental to a lot of things I do
 

483
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,680
very fundamental to a lot of things I do
I'm sure what you do is you dig one hole

484
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:13,690
I'm sure what you do is you dig one hole
 

485

I'm sure what you do is you dig one hole
get your get your piston above like that

486
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,180
get your get your piston above like that
 

487
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,210
get your get your piston above like that
place the redstone wire below and a

488
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:22,220
place the redstone wire below and a
 

489
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:28,030
place the redstone wire below and a
lever next to it turn it on and this

490
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,040
lever next to it turn it on and this
 

491
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,750
lever next to it turn it on and this
what you have here this is a block

492
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
what you have here this is a block
 

493
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:41,180
what you have here this is a block
sensor piston

494
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,190

 

495
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,100

so as soon as you place a block in front

496
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,110
so as soon as you place a block in front
 

497
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:55,400
so as soon as you place a block in front
of it it pushes it which is very neat

498
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,410

 

499
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,190

let's see if you use a sticky piston

500
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
let's see if you use a sticky piston
 

501
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:07,920
let's see if you use a sticky piston
something kind of strange happens just

502
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:07,930
something kind of strange happens just
 

503
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,450
something kind of strange happens just
like a real pistol

504
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:10,460
like a real pistol
 

505
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,500
like a real pistol
you can flip it off and on

506
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,510
you can flip it off and on
 

507
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,790
you can flip it off and on
this is a really neat sensor very

508
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:17,800
this is a really neat sensor very
 

509
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:24,810
this is a really neat sensor very
compact here's something else playing

510
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:24,820
compact here's something else playing
 

511
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,020
compact here's something else playing
around with I made a loop of them that's

512
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,030
around with I made a loop of them that's
 

513
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,040
around with I made a loop of them that's
a sticky one so you can chain many of

514
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,050
a sticky one so you can chain many of
 

515
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,050
a sticky one so you can chain many of
these together and you can make self

516
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,060
these together and you can make self
 

517
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,500
these together and you can make self
building structures that way of of

518
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:37,510
building structures that way of of
 

519
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,210
building structures that way of of
whatever proportion you want without

520
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,220
whatever proportion you want without
 

521
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,380
whatever proportion you want without
needing any majorly complicated redstone

522
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,390
needing any majorly complicated redstone
 

523
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:52,950
needing any majorly complicated redstone
wiring so let's flip this on this is

524
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
wiring so let's flip this on this is
 

525
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,990
wiring so let's flip this on this is
four of them going around in them very

526
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,000
four of them going around in them very
 

527
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,150
four of them going around in them very
tiny loop

528
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160

 

529
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,860

but you can make the loop as big as you

530
00:19:59,860 --> 00:19:59,870
but you can make the loop as big as you
 

531
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:07,130
but you can make the loop as big as you
want really

532
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,140

 

533
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,390

maybe I'll set up another example

534
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:11,400

 

535
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,620

alright here's another example I just

536
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:13,630
alright here's another example I just
 

537
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,549
alright here's another example I just
set up three of the auto sensor piston

538
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:17,559
set up three of the auto sensor piston
 

539
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:25,950
set up three of the auto sensor piston
things so this is what happens oh I

540
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:25,960
things so this is what happens oh I
 

541
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:45,830
things so this is what happens oh I
don't look that one

542
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840

 

543
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,980

if you can't move it will destroy the

544
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:48,990
if you can't move it will destroy the
 

545
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:57,980
if you can't move it will destroy the
lever so keep that in mind but pretty

546
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:57,990
lever so keep that in mind but pretty
 

547
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,570
lever so keep that in mind but pretty
cool you can make self building

548
00:20:59,570 --> 00:20:59,580
cool you can make self building
 

549
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,620
cool you can make self building
structures doing that and mixing it with

550
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:03,630
structures doing that and mixing it with
 

551
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,330
structures doing that and mixing it with
cobblestone generators or stuff like

552
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:05,340
cobblestone generators or stuff like
 

553
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:05,900
cobblestone generators or stuff like
that

554
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:05,910
that
 

555
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,380
that
I'm sure haven't had much time to play

556
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,390
I'm sure haven't had much time to play
 

557
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,980
I'm sure haven't had much time to play
around with this day put on you're

558
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:11,990
around with this day put on you're
 

559
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,000
around with this day put on you're
pretty sure you can do some cool stuff

560
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,010
pretty sure you can do some cool stuff
 

561
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,900
pretty sure you can do some cool stuff
with distance maybe I'll make a sand

562
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:17,910
with distance maybe I'll make a sand
 

563
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,500
with distance maybe I'll make a sand
hour oh wait no that won't work like

564
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:21,510
hour oh wait no that won't work like
 

565
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:27,970
hour oh wait no that won't work like
that you have to do a less fancy way I

566
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:27,980
that you have to do a less fancy way I
 

567
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:37,050
that you have to do a less fancy way I
set up a repeater um your piston

568
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,060

 

569
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:44,910

like that block there and redstone wire

570
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:44,920
like that block there and redstone wire
 

571
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,840
like that block there and redstone wire
like that this is kind of a another way

572
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:48,850
like that this is kind of a another way
 

573
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,010
like that this is kind of a another way
of doing a sensor a little bit more

574
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,020
of doing a sensor a little bit more
 

575
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:59,150
of doing a sensor a little bit more
takes up more space and more resources

576
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,160

 

577
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:08,490

but there's no hole underneath so I'm

578
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:08,500
but there's no hole underneath so I'm
 

579
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,200
but there's no hole underneath so I'm
gonna shut this off we'll make a big

580
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,210
gonna shut this off we'll make a big
 

581
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:31,100
gonna shut this off we'll make a big
sand Tower ah then when you flip it on

582
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,110

 

583
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,200

fun stuff having a lot of fun with

584
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,210
fun stuff having a lot of fun with
 

585
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:40,140
fun stuff having a lot of fun with
pistons alright then the last thing is

586
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,150
pistons alright then the last thing is
 

587
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,940
pistons alright then the last thing is
playing around with today was this this

588
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:41,950
playing around with today was this this
 

589
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,680
playing around with today was this this
is kind of like an auto harvesting tree

590
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:46,690
is kind of like an auto harvesting tree
 

591
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,480
is kind of like an auto harvesting tree
farm idea I had so if you have a block

592
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:51,490
farm idea I had so if you have a block
 

593
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:57,590
farm idea I had so if you have a block
here it moves all five of those Pistons

594
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600

 

595
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,170

this is the sensor it's running on a

596
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,180
this is the sensor it's running on a
 

597
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:07,500
this is the sensor it's running on a
loop to updates when a tree grows um and

598
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,510
loop to updates when a tree grows um and
 

599
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,750
loop to updates when a tree grows um and
there's this wire running up to all five

600
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
there's this wire running up to all five
 

601
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,620
there's this wire running up to all five
Pistons so when the tree grows guess

602
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:13,630
Pistons so when the tree grows guess
 

603
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:19,410
Pistons so when the tree grows guess
what happens automatically moves all the

604
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:19,420
what happens automatically moves all the
 

605
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:26,670
what happens automatically moves all the
logs I'm stuck here let's grow a few

606
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:26,680
logs I'm stuck here let's grow a few
 

607
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:36,450
logs I'm stuck here let's grow a few
trees so the loop the clock here updates

608
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:36,460
trees so the loop the clock here updates
 

609
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,840
trees so the loop the clock here updates
when the tree grows otherwise that it

610
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:39,850
when the tree grows otherwise that it
 

611
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,810
when the tree grows otherwise that it
won't detect that the tree has grown you

612
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:42,820
won't detect that the tree has grown you
 

613
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,540
won't detect that the tree has grown you
need that at excuse me you need a

614
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:45,550
need that at excuse me you need a
 

615
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,950
need that at excuse me you need a
adjacent block to update for this sensor

616
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:49,960
adjacent block to update for this sensor
 

617
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,620
adjacent block to update for this sensor
too

618
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:50,630
too
 

619
00:23:50,630 --> 00:24:00,510
too
detect the tree is round oops

620
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:00,520
detect the tree is round oops
 

621
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:13,690
detect the tree is round oops
this kind of fun idea I might try make

622
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:13,700
this kind of fun idea I might try make
 

623
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,750
this kind of fun idea I might try make
it tree farm doing something similar to

624
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:16,760
it tree farm doing something similar to
 

625
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,540
it tree farm doing something similar to
this maybe a little bit more fancy

626
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:19,550
this maybe a little bit more fancy
 

627
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:34,360
this maybe a little bit more fancy
though but ya have a lot of fun with

628
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,370
though but ya have a lot of fun with
 

629
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,150
though but ya have a lot of fun with
pistons

630
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,160

 

631
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,360

those are our trees and then you would

632
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,370
those are our trees and then you would
 

633
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,250
those are our trees and then you would
just go harvest them really easily

634
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:45,260
just go harvest them really easily
 

635
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:53,110
just go harvest them really easily
because they're all in a line but anyway

636
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
because they're all in a line but anyway
 

637
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,210
because they're all in a line but anyway
that's all I figured out with pistons so

638
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:55,220
that's all I figured out with pistons so
 

639
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,480
that's all I figured out with pistons so
far a lot of fun like I said I do kind

640
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,490
far a lot of fun like I said I do kind
 

641
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,700
far a lot of fun like I said I do kind
of plan on making a new base I don't

642
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:03,710
of plan on making a new base I don't
 

643
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,870
of plan on making a new base I don't
know if I'm gonna do it right away but

644
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
know if I'm gonna do it right away but
 

645
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,590
know if I'm gonna do it right away but
sometime soon and I'll probably start

646
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:08,600
sometime soon and I'll probably start
 

647
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,850
sometime soon and I'll probably start
using pistons for a lot of things in the

648
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:12,860
using pistons for a lot of things in the
 

649
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,400
using pistons for a lot of things in the
