up to do a little experiment here I was

64
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:41,970
up to do a little experiment here I was
 

65
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,380
up to do a little experiment here I was
thinking about mining new speeds and I

66
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:45,390
thinking about mining new speeds and I
 

67
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,260
thinking about mining new speeds and I
want to play around with maybe gold

68
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,270
want to play around with maybe gold
 

69
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,319
want to play around with maybe gold
pickaxes and gold axes see if there's

70
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,329
pickaxes and gold axes see if there's
 

71
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,200
pickaxes and gold axes see if there's
any way to instant mine wood or or

72
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,210
any way to instant mine wood or or
 

73
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,920
any way to instant mine wood or or
cobblestone because yeah we have taste

74
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,930
cobblestone because yeah we have taste
 

75
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,870
cobblestone because yeah we have taste
too here you can instant mine a few

76
00:01:59,870 --> 00:01:59,880
too here you can instant mine a few
 

77
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,700
too here you can instant mine a few
blocks like clay for example pretty

78
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:01,710
blocks like clay for example pretty
 

79
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,179
blocks like clay for example pretty
easily stone but you can't break

80
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:05,189
easily stone but you can't break
 

81
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,059

cobblestone instantly with a diamond

82
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:08,069
cobblestone instantly with a diamond
 

83
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,940
cobblestone instantly with a diamond
pickaxe there's no way to err let's try

84
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:10,950
pickaxe there's no way to err let's try
 

85
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,449
pickaxe there's no way to err let's try
it out

86
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:12,459
it out
 

87
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,550
it out
so I'm wondering if you switch over to a

88
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
so I'm wondering if you switch over to a
 

89
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,890
so I'm wondering if you switch over to a
gold pickaxe if it could do it because

90
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:16,900
gold pickaxe if it could do it because
 

91
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,479
gold pickaxe if it could do it because
it can mine almost twice as fast as a

92
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:18,489
it can mine almost twice as fast as a
 

93
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,500
it can mine almost twice as fast as a
diamond one for a lot of blocks yeah so

94
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,510
diamond one for a lot of blocks yeah so
 

95
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,660
diamond one for a lot of blocks yeah so
we want to get an efficiency 5 pick and

96
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:24,670
we want to get an efficiency 5 pick and
 

97
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,399
we want to get an efficiency 5 pick and
axe for this test let's do some

98
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:26,409
axe for this test let's do some
 

99
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,490
axe for this test let's do some
enchanting here got 70 levels to waste

100
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:29,500
enchanting here got 70 levels to waste
 

101
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,020
enchanting here got 70 levels to waste
Oh

102
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,030
Oh
 

103
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,869
Oh
efficiency for so give us a chance to

104
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:33,879
efficiency for so give us a chance to
 

105
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,660
efficiency for so give us a chance to
hear the sound some more - it's so weird

106
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:39,670
hear the sound some more - it's so weird
 

107
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:48,589
hear the sound some more - it's so weird
that sound I do like it though 11 levels

108
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:48,599
that sound I do like it though 11 levels
 

109
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,220
that sound I do like it though 11 levels
wait a minute

110
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,230
wait a minute
 

111
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,080
wait a minute
twenty three levels oh no let's go back

112
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,090
twenty three levels oh no let's go back
 

113
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,649
twenty three levels oh no let's go back
go back I like that more cool so we got

114
00:02:58,649 --> 00:02:58,659
go back I like that more cool so we got
 

115
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,809
go back I like that more cool so we got
our tools ready to go here efficiency 5

116
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:00,819
our tools ready to go here efficiency 5
 

117
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,420
our tools ready to go here efficiency 5
on both of them I really hope this works

118
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:03,430
on both of them I really hope this works
 

119
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,309
on both of them I really hope this works
because now that we have mending in the

120
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:05,319
because now that we have mending in the
 

121
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,619
because now that we have mending in the
game you could actually you could

122
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:07,629
game you could actually you could
 

123
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,240
game you could actually you could
actually use gold tools so the mending

124
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,250
actually use gold tools so the mending
 

125
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,640
actually use gold tools so the mending
would counter the low durability they

126
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:11,650
would counter the low durability they
 

127
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,159
would counter the low durability they
have so I'm hoping they can do something

128
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,169
have so I'm hoping they can do something
 

129
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,640
have so I'm hoping they can do something
diamond tools can't yeah they go through

130
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:17,650
diamond tools can't yeah they go through
 

131
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,599
diamond tools can't yeah they go through
stone like you would expect let's try

132
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:20,609
stone like you would expect let's try
 

133
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,159
stone like you would expect let's try
let's try the next tier up so the next

134
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,169
let's try the next tier up so the next
 

135
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,020
let's try the next tier up so the next
tier up after stone would be like

136
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,030
tier up after stone would be like
 

137
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,879
tier up after stone would be like

few different things here that we might
 

147
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,379
few different things here that we might
be able to instant miner if we could oh

148
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:40,389
be able to instant miner if we could oh
 

149
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,749
be able to instant miner if we could oh
that would be amazing

150

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,880
think I ever done it so I was curious
looks like it doesn't work though

164
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:10,890

 

165
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,240

alright guys so today we are back in the

166
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,250
alright guys so today we are back in the
 

167
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,789
alright guys so today we are back in the
nether here again last episode we

168
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:17,799
nether here again last episode we
 

169
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,180
nether here again last episode we
started building this gold farm which is

170
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,190
started building this gold farm which is
 

171
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,760
started building this gold farm which is
kind of working already but we got to

172
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:23,770
kind of working already but we got to
 

173
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,140
kind of working already but we got to
improve it a lot

174
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,150
improve it a lot
 

175
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,930
improve it a lot
we need more spawning space probably

176
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:27,940
we need more spawning space probably
 

177
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,420
we need more spawning space probably
start making more layers to it to begin

178
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,430
start making more layers to it to begin
 

179
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,120
start making more layers to it to begin
with here and then we got to try

180
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,130
with here and then we got to try
 

181
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,920
with here and then we got to try
optimize it once we get a decent amount

182
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:34,930
optimize it once we get a decent amount
 

183
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,590
optimize it once we get a decent amount
of these guys spawning there's a chicken

184
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
of these guys spawning there's a chicken
 

185
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,430
of these guys spawning there's a chicken
over there chickens all alone uh-huh

186
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,440
over there chickens all alone uh-huh
 

187
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,170
over there chickens all alone uh-huh
yeah so to begin with here I'm gonna go

188
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,180
yeah so to begin with here I'm gonna go
 

189
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,150
yeah so to begin with here I'm gonna go
underneath this pink donut we got and

190
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
underneath this pink donut we got and
 

191
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,860
underneath this pink donut we got and
I'm gonna totally copy it three blocks

192
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm gonna totally copy it three blocks
 

193
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm gonna totally copy it three blocks
down just to increase the amount of

194
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:51,970
down just to increase the amount of
 

195
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,510
down just to increase the amount of
spawning area we have for the big men so

196
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
spawning area we have for the big men so
 

197
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,000
spawning area we have for the big men so
hopefully we get a lot more and then

198
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,010
hopefully we get a lot more and then
 

199
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,590
hopefully we get a lot more and then
we'll check out the spawning rates after

200
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:58,600
we'll check out the spawning rates after
 

201
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
we'll check out the spawning rates after
this and decide what we do from there I

202
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,610
this and decide what we do from there I
 

203
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,980
this and decide what we do from there I
guess you know I was thinking about why

204
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,990
guess you know I was thinking about why
 

205
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,830
guess you know I was thinking about why
our zombie pigmen so mad what makes them

206
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
our zombie pigmen so mad what makes them
 

207
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,480
our zombie pigmen so mad what makes them
so mad it's because they can't have ice

208
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,490
so mad it's because they can't have ice
 

209
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,409
so mad it's because they can't have ice
cream in the nether it melts so I'm

210
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:13,419
cream in the nether it melts so I'm
 

211
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,670
cream in the nether it melts so I'm
giving them Donuts at least okay so I

212
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
giving them Donuts at least okay so I
 

213
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,219
giving them Donuts at least okay so I
got the second layer in here each layer

214
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:20,229
got the second layer in here each layer
 

215
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,290
got the second layer in here each layer
is actually pretty big I'm sure it's at

216
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,300
is actually pretty big I'm sure it's at
 

217
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,120
is actually pretty big I'm sure it's at
least 500 bucks I'm gonna count it

218
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,130
least 500 bucks I'm gonna count it
 

219
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,950
least 500 bucks I'm gonna count it
though if I have to do another one but

220
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:25,960
though if I have to do another one but
 

221
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,010
though if I have to do another one but
let's just see what happens now I also

222
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,020
let's just see what happens now I also
 

223
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,690
let's just see what happens now I also
don't give those guys a path to get to

224
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:30,700
don't give those guys a path to get to
 

225
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,790
don't give those guys a path to get to
me I just yet I want to see what happens

226
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
me I just yet I want to see what happens
 

227
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,300
me I just yet I want to see what happens
when we shoot shoot these guys cuz if

228
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,310
when we shoot shoot these guys cuz if
 

229
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,050
when we shoot shoot these guys cuz if
they can't get to me what do they do oh

230
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,060
they can't get to me what do they do oh
 

231
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,029
they can't get to me what do they do oh
they're still trying to get to me that

232
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:42,039
they're still trying to get to me that
 

233
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,779
they're still trying to get to me that
looked really really crazy like I was

234
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:45,789
looked really really crazy like I was
 

235
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:47,490
looked really really crazy like I was
definitely getting some lag there and

236
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:47,500
definitely getting some lag there and
 

237
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,290
definitely getting some lag there and
they were like stuttering and then they

238
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:49,300
they were like stuttering and then they
 

239
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,390
they were like stuttering and then they
moved very quickly and looked pretty

240
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,400
moved very quickly and looked pretty
 

241
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:01,560
moved very quickly and looked pretty
weird let's try it again alright still

242
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,570
weird let's try it again alright still
 

243
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,940
weird let's try it again alright still
not really getting an infinite loop

244
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:02,950
not really getting an infinite loop
 

245
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:10,080
not really getting an infinite loop
going of death and they're still not

246
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,090
going of death and they're still not
 

247
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,000
going of death and they're still not
refilling the platform's very quickly so

248
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,010
refilling the platform's very quickly so
 

249
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,250
refilling the platform's very quickly so
yeah we need more space more space I'm

250
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,260
yeah we need more space more space I'm
 

251
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,440
yeah we need more space more space I'm
going to add a third layer I guess and

252
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,450
going to add a third layer I guess and
 

253
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,800
going to add a third layer I guess and
take it from there building building

254
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:19,810
take it from there building building
 

255
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,570
take it from there building building
building building tastes more blocks

256
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:21,580
building building tastes more blocks
 

257
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,080
building building tastes more blocks
placed more counters

258
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,090
placed more counters
 

259
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,080
placed more counters
yeah so this is pretty repetitive by the

260
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,090
yeah so this is pretty repetitive by the
 

261
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,960
yeah so this is pretty repetitive by the
way I've been doing this for a couple

262
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:28,970
way I've been doing this for a couple
 

263
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,629
way I've been doing this for a couple
hours now just about done the third

264
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:31,639
hours now just about done the third
 

265
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,290
hours now just about done the third
layer here though and then probably have

266
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:35,300
layer here though and then probably have
 

267
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:43,030
layer here though and then probably have
to add more and done alright it's very

268
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,040
to add more and done alright it's very
 

269
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,100
to add more and done alright it's very
cool so we got three rings all done now

270
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,110
cool so we got three rings all done now
 

271
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,590
cool so we got three rings all done now
while I built this third one I decided

272
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
while I built this third one I decided
 

273
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,270
while I built this third one I decided
to count how many blocks it took as well

274
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
to count how many blocks it took as well
 

275
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,690
to count how many blocks it took as well
and I thought like before I counted I

276
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:52,700
and I thought like before I counted I
 

277
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,580
and I thought like before I counted I
thought it was maybe 500 maybe a little

278
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:54,590
thought it was maybe 500 maybe a little
 

279
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:00,250
thought it was maybe 500 maybe a little
bit more guess how much no really yes no

280
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,260
bit more guess how much no really yes no
 

281
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,190
bit more guess how much no really yes no
it's actually sixteen hundred and twenty

282
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,200
it's actually sixteen hundred and twenty
 

283
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,350
it's actually sixteen hundred and twenty
per per ring so yeah I was a little bit

284
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,360
per per ring so yeah I was a little bit
 

285
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,659
per per ring so yeah I was a little bit
low on that yes three rings that's four

286
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:10,669
low on that yes three rings that's four
 

287
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,490
low on that yes three rings that's four
thousand eight hundred sixty blocks

288
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:12,500
thousand eight hundred sixty blocks
 

289
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,610
thousand eight hundred sixty blocks
that's roughly seventy five stacks of

290
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:15,620
that's roughly seventy five stacks of
 

291
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,250
that's roughly seventy five stacks of
blocks to make this currently and we

292
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,260
blocks to make this currently and we
 

293
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,020
blocks to make this currently and we
might need to go bigger let's let's find

294
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,030
might need to go bigger let's let's find
 

295
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,659
might need to go bigger let's let's find
out let's shoot them see what happens to

296
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:22,669
out let's shoot them see what happens to
 

297
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,540
out let's shoot them see what happens to
the lower guy's as well well that guy

298
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,550
the lower guy's as well well that guy
 

299
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,969
the lower guy's as well well that guy
fell off those guys fell off in a weird

300
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:27,979
fell off those guys fell off in a weird
 

301
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,100
fell off those guys fell off in a weird
place so the guys on the lowest ring

302
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,110
place so the guys on the lowest ring
 

303
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,640
place so the guys on the lowest ring
there are still tracking us that's great

304
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:32,650
there are still tracking us that's great
 

305
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,779
there are still tracking us that's great
even though they don't have a path to

306
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:34,789
even though they don't have a path to
 

307
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:39,159
even though they don't have a path to
get up to me here and we got a bit of an

308
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,169
get up to me here and we got a bit of an
 

309
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,440
get up to me here and we got a bit of an
infinite loop going on that's good

310
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,450
infinite loop going on that's good
 

311
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,150
infinite loop going on that's good
they are falling farther than they need

312
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,160
they are falling farther than they need
 

313
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,719
they are falling farther than they need
to so when we actually put a floor to

314
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:46,729
to so when we actually put a floor to
 

315
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,550
to so when we actually put a floor to
kill them they won't have to follows far

316
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
kill them they won't have to follows far
 

317
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,090
kill them they won't have to follows far
and they'll spawn a bit quicker again

318
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,100
and they'll spawn a bit quicker again
 

319
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,900
and they'll spawn a bit quicker again
yeah look at this we're getting the

320
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:52,910
yeah look at this we're getting the
 

321
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,000
yeah look at this we're getting the
infinite loop going that's good still

322
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,010
infinite loop going that's good still
 

323
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,460
infinite loop going that's good still
seems a little bit on the low slow side

324
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,470
seems a little bit on the low slow side
 

325
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,400
seems a little bit on the low slow side
though doesn't it I feel like we should

326
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,410
though doesn't it I feel like we should
 

327
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,440
though doesn't it I feel like we should
be getting more Pigman oh I really don't

328
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,450
be getting more Pigman oh I really don't
 

329
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,900
be getting more Pigman oh I really don't
want to build more rings we might have

330
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:07,910
want to build more rings we might have
 

331
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,129
want to build more rings we might have
to add another one oh you're not

332
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:12,139
to add another one oh you're not
 

333
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:19,840
to add another one oh you're not
supposed to be here got him awesome no

334
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:19,850
supposed to be here got him awesome no
 

335
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,480
supposed to be here got him awesome no
more building that's it guys I've had

336
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,490
more building that's it guys I've had
 

337
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,969
more building that's it guys I've had
enough here we got five layers that's

338
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:24,979
enough here we got five layers that's
 

339
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,620
enough here we got five layers that's
eight thousand one hundred spawning

340
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,630
eight thousand one hundred spawning
 

341
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,129
eight thousand one hundred spawning
spots for these fools and I think we're

342
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:30,139
spots for these fools and I think we're
 

343
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,140
spots for these fools and I think we're
gonna call it there for extending the

344
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,150
gonna call it there for extending the
 

345
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,000
gonna call it there for extending the
platforms we're gonna actually get to

346
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,010
platforms we're gonna actually get to
 

347
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,700
platforms we're gonna actually get to
building the killing mechanisms and

348
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:36,710
building the killing mechanisms and
 

349
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,709
building the killing mechanisms and
gathering the drop mechanisms that kind

350
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
gathering the drop mechanisms that kind
 

351
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,740
gathering the drop mechanisms that kind
of fun stuff the reason I keep adding

352
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:41,750
of fun stuff the reason I keep adding
 

353
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,579
of fun stuff the reason I keep adding
more here though is for one thing it

354
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:45,589
more here though is for one thing it
 

355
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,800
more here though is for one thing it
gives us more more spawns it's more

356
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:47,810
gives us more more spawns it's more
 

357
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,360
gives us more more spawns it's more
likely when they tries to spawn a zombie

358
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,370
likely when they tries to spawn a zombie
 

359
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,170
likely when they tries to spawn a zombie
pigman it'll be successful but also I'm

360
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,180
pigman it'll be successful but also I'm
 

361
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,579
pigman it'll be successful but also I'm
having a little bit of trouble getting

362
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:54,589
having a little bit of trouble getting
 

363
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,090
having a little bit of trouble getting
this infinite loop thing going so that

364
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,100
this infinite loop thing going so that
 

365
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,579
this infinite loop thing going so that
after they die the next the next wave of

366
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:03,589
after they die the next the next wave of
 

367
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:05,050
after they die the next the next wave of
zombie pigman that spawn are gonna be

368
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,060
zombie pigman that spawn are gonna be
 

369
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,490
zombie pigman that spawn are gonna be
mad at us too like those guys over there

370
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:06,500
mad at us too like those guys over there
 

371
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,960
mad at us too like those guys over there
I think they might have lost interest

372
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:09,970
I think they might have lost interest
 

373
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,120
I think they might have lost interest
and I've never made a zombie pigman farm

374
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,130
and I've never made a zombie pigman farm
 

375
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,940
and I've never made a zombie pigman farm
like this before so I don't know exactly

376
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:14,950
like this before so I don't know exactly
 

377
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,110
like this before so I don't know exactly
why it stops working like I walked and

378
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,120
why it stops working like I walked and
 

379
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,940
why it stops working like I walked and
this guy saw me I think and I needed his

380
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:21,950
this guy saw me I think and I needed his
 

381
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,660
this guy saw me I think and I needed his
call and then that attracted these guys

382
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:25,670
call and then that attracted these guys
 

383
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,889
call and then that attracted these guys
I'm still trying to figure it out

384
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:26,899
I'm still trying to figure it out
 

385
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,620
I'm still trying to figure it out
exactly I tried looking for a tutorial

386
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:29,630
exactly I tried looking for a tutorial
 

387
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,530
exactly I tried looking for a tutorial
on gold farms just to try shed some more

388
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:32,540
on gold farms just to try shed some more
 

389
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,420
on gold farms just to try shed some more
light on I didn't find the information I

390
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,430
light on I didn't find the information I
 

391
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,090
light on I didn't find the information I
wanted I did see a good good gold farm

392
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,100
wanted I did see a good good gold farm
 

393
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,060
wanted I did see a good good gold farm
by a snow crash though I think I'm gonna

394
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,070
by a snow crash though I think I'm gonna
 

395
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,780
by a snow crash though I think I'm gonna
mimic some of his designs because he's

396
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:43,790
mimic some of his designs because he's
 

397
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,100
mimic some of his designs because he's
pretty much doing the same thing I had

398
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,110
pretty much doing the same thing I had
 

399
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,380
pretty much doing the same thing I had
going on here but to collect the the

400
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,390
going on here but to collect the the
 

401
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,210
going on here but to collect the the
drops in the XP he uses slime launchers

402
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,220
drops in the XP he uses slime launchers
 

403
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,500
drops in the XP he uses slime launchers
horizontal slime launchers on ice and

404
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,510
horizontal slime launchers on ice and
 

405
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,480
horizontal slime launchers on ice and
that is a really clever idea so I think

406
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,490
that is a really clever idea so I think
 

407
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,250
that is a really clever idea so I think
I'm gonna do that as well okay yeah

408
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,260
I'm gonna do that as well okay yeah
 

409
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,870
I'm gonna do that as well okay yeah
let's start adding the other mechanisms

410
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:01,880
let's start adding the other mechanisms
 

411
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,240
let's start adding the other mechanisms
to our gold farm now so I checked that

412
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,250
to our gold farm now so I checked that
 

413
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,710
to our gold farm now so I checked that
bottom ring is at y 241 we got to drop

414
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
bottom ring is at y 241 we got to drop
 

415
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,290
bottom ring is at y 241 we got to drop
the zombie pigmen I believe 24 blocks to

416
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,300
the zombie pigmen I believe 24 blocks to
 

417
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,180
the zombie pigmen I believe 24 blocks to
kill them so we got to go down to I

418
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,190
kill them so we got to go down to I
 

419
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,569
kill them so we got to go down to I
think Y 217 which is a little bit tricky

420
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:18,579
think Y 217 which is a little bit tricky
 

421
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:21,610
think Y 217 which is a little bit tricky
cuz my elevator here isn't the best it

422
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:21,620
cuz my elevator here isn't the best it
 

423
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,010
cuz my elevator here isn't the best it
doesn't have like a way out anywhere on

424
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,020
doesn't have like a way out anywhere on
 

425
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,880
doesn't have like a way out anywhere on
the way to 12 to 22 oh I missed missed

426
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:30,890
the way to 12 to 22 oh I missed missed
 

427
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,260
the way to 12 to 22 oh I missed missed
clicked yeah this is a good way of stair

428
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,270
clicked yeah this is a good way of stair
 

429
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,519
clicked yeah this is a good way of stair
casing down though if you guys didn't

430
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:36,529
casing down though if you guys didn't
 

431
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,769
casing down though if you guys didn't
didn't know this trick in place like

432
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:38,779
didn't know this trick in place like
 

433
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,650
didn't know this trick in place like
three blocks down every time to 18 let's

434
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:41,660
three blocks down every time to 18 let's
 

435
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,210
three blocks down every time to 18 let's
go down one more and that's good okay so

436
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:46,220
go down one more and that's good okay so
 

437
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,670
go down one more and that's good okay so
I think that's a good level now since I

438
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,680
I think that's a good level now since I
 

439
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,079
I think that's a good level now since I
can't use water but it's like it's hard

440
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:50,089
can't use water but it's like it's hard
 

441
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:50,380
can't use water but it's like it's hard
to

442
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,390
to
 

443
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,550
to
to maneuver through in the nether here

444
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:53,560
to maneuver through in the nether here
 

445
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,810
to maneuver through in the nether here
okay so I'm just gonna put a floor down

446
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:55,820
okay so I'm just gonna put a floor down
 

447
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,250
okay so I'm just gonna put a floor down
here and make sure it kills all the

448
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:57,260
here and make sure it kills all the
 

449
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,810
here and make sure it kills all the
zombie pigmen on all the Rings when they

450
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:58,820
zombie pigmen on all the Rings when they
 

451
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:09,030
zombie pigmen on all the Rings when they
fall down looks good yeah got them all

452
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040

 

453
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,560

okay so check this out guys if I stand

454
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:11,570
okay so check this out guys if I stand
 

455
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,690
okay so check this out guys if I stand
at the very middle here the middle of

456
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:13,700
at the very middle here the middle of
 

457
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,090
at the very middle here the middle of
the Rings instead of at the very top it

458
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:16,100
the Rings instead of at the very top it
 

459
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,150
the Rings instead of at the very top it
seems to work a lot better the infinite

460
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,160
seems to work a lot better the infinite
 

461
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,970
seems to work a lot better the infinite
loop just keeps going and going then I

462
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:20,980
loop just keeps going and going then I
 

463
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,300
loop just keeps going and going then I
haven't had it stopped yet the number of

464
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,310
haven't had it stopped yet the number of
 

465
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,010
haven't had it stopped yet the number of
zombie pigman is thinning out I think

466
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,020
zombie pigman is thinning out I think
 

467
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,190
zombie pigman is thinning out I think
they're all where are they all ending up

468
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,200
they're all where are they all ending up
 

469
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,470
they're all where are they all ending up
there's a bunch over there they're not

470
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
there's a bunch over there they're not
 

471
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,640
there's a bunch over there they're not
supposed to be there we'll fix that

472
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:33,650
supposed to be there we'll fix that
 

473
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,110
supposed to be there we'll fix that
later don't worry magma cubes I guess

474
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,120
later don't worry magma cubes I guess
 

475
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,750
later don't worry magma cubes I guess
they'll just jump off right and these

476
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:40,760
they'll just jump off right and these
 

477
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,250
they'll just jump off right and these
spawn when they fall down I don't think

478
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:42,260
spawn when they fall down I don't think
 

479
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,810
spawn when they fall down I don't think
fall damage and kills them though yeah

480
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:46,820
fall damage and kills them though yeah
 

481
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,700
fall damage and kills them though yeah
it's working pretty good it's working

482
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:48,710
it's working pretty good it's working
 

483
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,320
it's working pretty good it's working
pretty good I'm happy with this so we've

484
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,330
pretty good I'm happy with this so we've
 

485
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,830
pretty good I'm happy with this so we've
got our ice platforms over there now I

486
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:53,840
got our ice platforms over there now I
 

487
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,640
got our ice platforms over there now I
think what we'll do is add a bit of a

488
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:57,650
think what we'll do is add a bit of a
 

489
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,040
think what we'll do is add a bit of a
cage to keep them from flying out all

490
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,050
cage to keep them from flying out all
 

491
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,390
cage to keep them from flying out all
over the place when they fall down here

492
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:01,400
over the place when they fall down here
 

493
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,840
over the place when they fall down here
we'll try to keep them all contained so

494
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:04,850
we'll try to keep them all contained so
 

495
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,700
we'll try to keep them all contained so
they fall into lay a one by one area

496
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:06,710
they fall into lay a one by one area
 

497
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,310
they fall into lay a one by one area
down below there and that keeps

498
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,320
down below there and that keeps
 

499
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,510
down below there and that keeps
happening you have no idea

500
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:12,520
happening you have no idea
 

501
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,290
happening you have no idea
it's not safe anywhere but if I get

502
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:16,300
it's not safe anywhere but if I get
 

503
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,890
it's not safe anywhere but if I get
anywhere near these guys oh of course he

504
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:19,900
anywhere near these guys oh of course he
 

505
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,490
anywhere near these guys oh of course he
just has to have a flame sore too right

506
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:25,500

 

507
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,050

it's very dangerous around here yeah so

508
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,060
it's very dangerous around here yeah so
 

509
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,340
it's very dangerous around here yeah so
this is what we're gonna try to do we're

510
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,350
this is what we're gonna try to do we're
 

511
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,010
this is what we're gonna try to do we're
gonna build up the sides here out of

512
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,020
gonna build up the sides here out of
 

513
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,740
gonna build up the sides here out of
glass all the way up to try contain the

514
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:37,750
glass all the way up to try contain the
 

515
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,570
glass all the way up to try contain the
zombie pigmen so they don't fly all over

516
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:39,580
zombie pigmen so they don't fly all over
 

517
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,570
zombie pigmen so they don't fly all over
the place like they were doing and we're

518
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:42,580
the place like they were doing and we're
 

519
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,920
the place like they were doing and we're
gonna keep the kill zone over here

520
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:43,930
gonna keep the kill zone over here
 

521
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,380
gonna keep the kill zone over here
though I think like we could make the

522
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:46,390
though I think like we could make the
 

523
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,000
though I think like we could make the
zombie pigmen walk all the way to the

524
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,010
zombie pigmen walk all the way to the
 

525
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,130
zombie pigmen walk all the way to the
middle to where we are the advantage of

526
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,140
middle to where we are the advantage of
 

527
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,870
middle to where we are the advantage of
that is it makes it a lot easier to

528
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:51,880
that is it makes it a lot easier to
 

529
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,820
that is it makes it a lot easier to
collect the drops because I'll be kind

530
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:53,830
collect the drops because I'll be kind
 

531
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,250
collect the drops because I'll be kind
of in the center that way the downside

532
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,260
of in the center that way the downside
 

533
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,120
of in the center that way the downside
though is if they got to walk all the

534
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,130
though is if they got to walk all the
 

535
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,970
though is if they got to walk all the
way to the middle where we are that's a

536
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:02,980
way to the middle where we are that's a
 

537
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,100
way to the middle where we are that's a
lot of time a lot of watching time we

538
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,110
lot of time a lot of watching time we
 

539
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,080
lot of time a lot of watching time we
want to kill them as fast as possible so

540
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,090
want to kill them as fast as possible so
 

541
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,970
want to kill them as fast as possible so
that more will spawn so we get better

542
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:08,980
that more will spawn so we get better
 

543
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,510
that more will spawn so we get better
drops or more drops I should say so yeah

544
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:12,520
drops or more drops I should say so yeah
 

545
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,220
drops or more drops I should say so yeah
we'll try to keep the killing zone over

546
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,230
we'll try to keep the killing zone over
 

547
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,440
we'll try to keep the killing zone over
here we may even experiment at adding

548
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,450
here we may even experiment at adding
 

549
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,960
here we may even experiment at adding
more kill zones at the diagonal so

550
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:18,970
more kill zones at the diagonal so
 

551
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,400
more kill zones at the diagonal so
they'll have to walk all the way from

552
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,410
they'll have to walk all the way from
 

553
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,270
they'll have to walk all the way from
there to here

554
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,280
there to here
 

555
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,450
there to here
if they could just like maximum distance

556
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:24,460
if they could just like maximum distance
 

557
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,220
if they could just like maximum distance
from here to here that would be a very

558
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,230
from here to here that would be a very
 

559
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,490
from here to here that would be a very
quick kill but it will complicate the

560
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:29,500
quick kill but it will complicate the
 

561
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
quick kill but it will complicate the
farm more and more the more kill zones

562
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:31,510
farm more and more the more kill zones
 

563
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,870
farm more and more the more kill zones
we have yeah let's build this up and

564
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:35,880
we have yeah let's build this up and
 

565
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,740
we have yeah let's build this up and
take it from there

566
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:37,750
take it from there
 

567
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,240
take it from there
are we at the top oh we are at the top

568
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,250
are we at the top oh we are at the top
 

569
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,560
are we at the top oh we are at the top
awesome maybe I don't have to cut all

570
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,570
awesome maybe I don't have to cut all
 

571
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,150
awesome maybe I don't have to cut all
right let's just go a little bit more

572
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,160
right let's just go a little bit more
 

573
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,340
right let's just go a little bit more
here oh my out of glass I'm gonna have

574
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:47,350
here oh my out of glass I'm gonna have
 

575
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,280
here oh my out of glass I'm gonna have
to go get more glass I think before we

576
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,290
to go get more glass I think before we
 

577
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,290
to go get more glass I think before we
didn't finish this all right I'll just

578
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,300
didn't finish this all right I'll just
 

579
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,430
didn't finish this all right I'll just
go a little bit higher here

580
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
go a little bit higher here
 

581
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,350
go a little bit higher here
I should put slabs at the top though I

582
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
I should put slabs at the top though I
 

583
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
I should put slabs at the top though I
don't have a mommy just threw away a

584
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,130
don't have a mommy just threw away a
 

585
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,560
don't have a mommy just threw away a
bunch of glass for no reason don't ask

586
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,570
bunch of glass for no reason don't ask
 

587
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,860
bunch of glass for no reason don't ask
me why all right let's let's try that

588
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:01,870
me why all right let's let's try that
 

589
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,069
me why all right let's let's try that
out just see what it does boom

590
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
out just see what it does boom
 

591
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,960
out just see what it does boom
okay so are they going to all go into

592
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:08,970
okay so are they going to all go into
 

593
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,769
okay so are they going to all go into
there yeah it looks good looks good yeah

594
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:12,779
there yeah it looks good looks good yeah
 

595
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,509
there yeah it looks good looks good yeah
so that keeps them from flying out all

596
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:14,519
so that keeps them from flying out all
 

597
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,609
so that keeps them from flying out all
over the sides I would like to get this

598
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:16,619
over the sides I would like to get this
 

599
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,470
over the sides I would like to get this
down to a one by one if we can kind of

600
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
down to a one by one if we can kind of
 

601
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,960
down to a one by one if we can kind of
like we did with the Enderman farm what

602
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:20,970
like we did with the Enderman farm what
 

603
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,160
like we did with the Enderman farm what
happens if we put trap doors here oh you

604
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,170
happens if we put trap doors here oh you
 

605
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,369
happens if we put trap doors here oh you
guys are on the wrong level all right I

606
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:28,379
guys are on the wrong level all right I
 

607
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:29,540
guys are on the wrong level all right I
gotta take a step back or else they

608
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:29,550
gotta take a step back or else they
 

609
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,910
gotta take a step back or else they
won't spawn again so are they gonna try

610
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
won't spawn again so are they gonna try
 

611
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,069
won't spawn again so are they gonna try
goat they do try to go okay that's good

612
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
goat they do try to go okay that's good
 

613
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,629
goat they do try to go okay that's good
that means we can get them into a one by

614
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:35,639
that means we can get them into a one by
 

615
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,650
that means we can get them into a one by
one yeah so I'm gonna do this on all the

616
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:39,660
one yeah so I'm gonna do this on all the
 

617
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,210
one yeah so I'm gonna do this on all the
layers yeah I don't know really what's

618
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,220
layers yeah I don't know really what's
 

619
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,400
layers yeah I don't know really what's
going on but I can't stop dancing here

620
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,410
going on but I can't stop dancing here
 

621
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:54,049
going on but I can't stop dancing here
oh I got a dance partner now great this

622
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:54,059
oh I got a dance partner now great this
 

623
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,919
oh I got a dance partner now great this
is so weird

624
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:56,929
is so weird
 

625
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:01,400
is so weird
alright and if I change perspectives it

626
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,410
alright and if I change perspectives it
 

627
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,869
alright and if I change perspectives it
looks like this I think I'm stuck in the

628
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:02,879
looks like this I think I'm stuck in the
 

629
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,629
looks like this I think I'm stuck in the
ice block or something

630
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
ice block or something
 

631
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,210
ice block or something
aha what is going on this ain't the gold

632
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,220
aha what is going on this ain't the gold

from now I saw some people asking about
 

679
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,539
from now I saw some people asking about
it because I've been mining from it for

680
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:17,549
it because I've been mining from it for
 

681
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,010

quite a while now and it's
 

683
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,790
quite a while now and it's
it's getting depleted a little bit oh I

684
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
it's getting depleted a little bit oh I
 

685
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,780

it's it's over here
 

689
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:36,240
it's it's over here
I think right nope I'm lost

690
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,250

 

691
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,160

yeah so this is all mined out now like

694
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,270
yeah so this is all mined out now like
 

695
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,290
yeah so this is all mined out now like
this is all sandstone pretty much up to

696
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,300
this is all sandstone pretty much up to
 

697
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,820
this is all sandstone pretty much up to
up to here and on top a lot of the hills

698

up to here and on top a lot of the hills
 

699
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,700
up to here and on top a lot of the hills
are mined out now so I was just doing a

700
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:53,710
are mined out now so I was just doing a
 

701
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,960
are mined out now so I was just doing a
bit of exploring this make sure the

702
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:54,970
bit of exploring this make sure the
 

703
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,150
bit of exploring this make sure the
biome keeps going there and yeah looks

704
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,160
biome keeps going there and yeah looks
 

705
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,660
biome keeps going there and yeah looks
like it's a huge huge desert am I filled

706
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:00,670
like it's a huge huge desert am I filled
 

707
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,500
like it's a huge huge desert am I filled
up yeah I'm a porcupine okay I'm gonna

708
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,510
up yeah I'm a porcupine okay I'm gonna
 

709
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,790
up yeah I'm a porcupine okay I'm gonna
get a little bit more sand here we'll

710
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:05,800
get a little bit more sand here we'll
 

711
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,390
get a little bit more sand here we'll
get back to work

712
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
get back to work
 

713
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:28,380
get back to work
oh man I'm getting excited now guys this

714
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,390
oh man I'm getting excited now guys this
 

715
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,780
oh man I'm getting excited now guys this
firm is getting pretty close to done now

716
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:30,790
firm is getting pretty close to done now
 

717
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,450
firm is getting pretty close to done now
I would say I got our spawning platforms

718
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:33,460
I would say I got our spawning platforms
 

719
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,840
I would say I got our spawning platforms
we got our glass tunnels so they they're

720
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:36,850
we got our glass tunnels so they they're
 

721
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,700
we got our glass tunnels so they they're
falling down a one by one we're gonna

722
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:38,710
falling down a one by one we're gonna
 

723
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,260
falling down a one by one we're gonna
test it in just the second to make sure

724
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,270
test it in just the second to make sure
 

725
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,460
test it in just the second to make sure
it works so we did that one over here

726
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,470
it works so we did that one over here
 

727
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,990
it works so we did that one over here
this is how I'm doing the trapdoors by

728
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
this is how I'm doing the trapdoors by
 

729
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,330
this is how I'm doing the trapdoors by
the way so I'm flipping this one up and

730
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:48,340
the way so I'm flipping this one up and
 

731
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,850
the way so I'm flipping this one up and
then at the top of every every block

732
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:50,860
then at the top of every every block
 

733
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,270
then at the top of every every block
year trap door but then down here I

734
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,280
year trap door but then down here I
 

735
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,710
year trap door but then down here I
switch over to glass I don't know if I

736
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:55,720
switch over to glass I don't know if I
 

737
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,450
switch over to glass I don't know if I
have to use trapdoors here or if I can

738
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:57,460
have to use trapdoors here or if I can
 

739
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,580
have to use trapdoors here or if I can
use glass I didn't test it I was gonna

740
00:17:59,580 --> 00:17:59,590
use glass I didn't test it I was gonna
 

741
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,310
use glass I didn't test it I was gonna
use trapdoors because running a little

742
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
use trapdoors because running a little
 

743
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,220
use trapdoors because running a little
on time you guys can experiment with

744
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,230
on time you guys can experiment with
 

745
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,400
on time you guys can experiment with
this if you can do something similar

746
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,410
this if you can do something similar
 

747
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,940
this if you can do something similar
okay here we go

748
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:08,950
okay here we go
 

749
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,610
okay here we go
um I should go to the the level that was

750
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:11,620
um I should go to the the level that was
 

751
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,280
um I should go to the the level that was
good for us a third one here I think

752
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,290
good for us a third one here I think
 

753
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,250
good for us a third one here I think
line-of-sight is important for reang

754
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:17,260
line-of-sight is important for reang
 

755
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,330
line-of-sight is important for reang
growing them weird where do we want to

756
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:21,340
growing them weird where do we want to
 

757
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,220
growing them weird where do we want to
stand let's stand here this should also

758
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,230
stand let's stand here this should also
 

759
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,960
stand let's stand here this should also
hopefully make it so they can't get to

760
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:24,970
hopefully make it so they can't get to
 

761
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,610
hopefully make it so they can't get to
the middle here anymore unless there's

762
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:26,620
the middle here anymore unless there's
 

763
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,320
the middle here anymore unless there's
any spawned on on the middle already

764
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,330
any spawned on on the middle already
 

765
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,500
any spawned on on the middle already
that was a good shot there we go oh he's

766
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,510
that was a good shot there we go oh he's
 

767
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,270
that was a good shot there we go oh he's
down so this should be good hopefully

768
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,280
down so this should be good hopefully
 

769
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,460
down so this should be good hopefully

790
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:15,970
shouldn't be able to get to me
 

791
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,650
shouldn't be able to get to me
right okay they're still going they're

792
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:19,660
right okay they're still going they're
 

793
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:27,210
right okay they're still going they're
still going good good yeah I'm really

794
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,220
still going good good yeah I'm really
 

795
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,460
still going good good yeah I'm really
happy with this do exactly what I wanted

796
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:29,470
happy with this do exactly what I wanted
 

797
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,770
happy with this do exactly what I wanted
to do I'm not seeing any baby guys

798
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:31,780
to do I'm not seeing any baby guys
 

799
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,450
to do I'm not seeing any baby guys
fitting through those trap doors I'm not

800
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:33,460
fitting through those trap doors I'm not
 

801
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,590
fitting through those trap doors I'm not
sure if they can I didn't test that

802
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:34,600
sure if they can I didn't test that
 

803
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,590
sure if they can I didn't test that
either but it's looking good let's go

804
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
either but it's looking good let's go
 

805
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,270
either but it's looking good let's go
down here oh yeah this is a not perfect

806
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
down here oh yeah this is a not perfect
 

807
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,100
down here oh yeah this is a not perfect
down here just yet I should really seal

808
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,110
down here just yet I should really seal
 

809
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,940
down here just yet I should really seal
this in but yeah all the XP you should

810
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:50,950
this in but yeah all the XP you should
 

811
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,400
this in but yeah all the XP you should
be in this one by one all the drops

812
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,410

 

813
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,730

that's so cool and let's go down below

814
00:19:59,730 --> 00:19:59,740
that's so cool and let's go down below
 

815
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,610
that's so cool and let's go down below
as well just an idea what's happening I

816
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:02,620
as well just an idea what's happening I
 

817
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,090
as well just an idea what's happening I
said magma cubes don't take fall damage

818
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,100
said magma cubes don't take fall damage
 

819
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,730
said magma cubes don't take fall damage
I'm pretty sure they do what I meant is

820
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:08,740
I'm pretty sure they do what I meant is
 

821
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,680
I'm pretty sure they do what I meant is
if they fall down here I think they

822
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:10,690
if they fall down here I think they
 

823
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,549
if they fall down here I think they
split right if they hit the bedrock they

824
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
split right if they hit the bedrock they
 

825
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,320
split right if they hit the bedrock they
split so it doesn't get rid of them they

826
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,330
split so it doesn't get rid of them they
 

827
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,830
split so it doesn't get rid of them they
just jump around down here and then I'll

828
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
just jump around down here and then I'll
 

829
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,360
just jump around down here and then I'll
I think they'll be spawn over time

830
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,370
I think they'll be spawn over time
 

831
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:32,340
I think they'll be spawn over time
though well I've done something wrong

832
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,350
though well I've done something wrong
 

833
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,090
though well I've done something wrong
over here

834
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,100
over here
 

835
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,419
over here
let's take a look I'm missing it I'm

836
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:36,429
let's take a look I'm missing it I'm
 

837
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:38,430
let's take a look I'm missing it I'm
missing a glass block

838
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:38,440
missing a glass block
 

839
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:46,230
missing a glass block
aha okay we just hit a new record 2500

840
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
aha okay we just hit a new record 2500
 

841
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,640
aha okay we just hit a new record 2500
entities this firm is gonna be crazy

842
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:50,650
entities this firm is gonna be crazy
 

843
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,900
entities this firm is gonna be crazy
guys oh did I just walk off the edge no

844
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:54,910
guys oh did I just walk off the edge no
 

845
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,480
guys oh did I just walk off the edge no
I did I'm fine yeah we got to start

846
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,490
I did I'm fine yeah we got to start
 

847
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,920
I did I'm fine yeah we got to start
picking up these drops now that's our

848
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:58,930
picking up these drops now that's our
 

849
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,690
picking up these drops now that's our
next step I removed the platform in the

850
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:00,700
next step I removed the platform in the
 

851
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,090
next step I removed the platform in the
middle here and it's working great

852
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,100
middle here and it's working great
 

853
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,440
middle here and it's working great
without it yeah definitely got to do

854
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,450
without it yeah definitely got to do
 

855
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,130
without it yeah definitely got to do
something about these entities okay you

856
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:11,140
something about these entities okay you
 

857
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,050
something about these entities okay you
know what this is actually a little bit

858
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,060
know what this is actually a little bit
 

859
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
know what this is actually a little bit
of a tricky thing cuz if we remove any

860
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,070
of a tricky thing cuz if we remove any
 

861
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,520
of a tricky thing cuz if we remove any
of the blocks on the side here of the

862
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:17,530
of the blocks on the side here of the
 

863
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,210
of the blocks on the side here of the
one by one when the zombie pigmen fall

864
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,220
one by one when the zombie pigmen fall
 

865
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,550
one by one when the zombie pigmen fall
down and splat a bunch of the items are

866
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:23,560
down and splat a bunch of the items are
 

867
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,470
down and splat a bunch of the items are
gonna fall out the side here as well and

868
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:25,480
gonna fall out the side here as well and
 

869
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,570
gonna fall out the side here as well and
spray out and then they're gonna be hard

870
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:27,580
spray out and then they're gonna be hard
 

871
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,640
spray out and then they're gonna be hard
to control yeah so we can't really have

872
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,650
to control yeah so we can't really have
 

873
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,510
to control yeah so we can't really have
the side open anywhere right if we do a

874
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:36,520
the side open anywhere right if we do a
 

875
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,610
the side open anywhere right if we do a
slime block launcher thing that means we

876
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:38,620
slime block launcher thing that means we
 

877
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,730
slime block launcher thing that means we
would have to open up the wall with the

878
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:40,740
would have to open up the wall with the
 

879
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,590
would have to open up the wall with the
piston or something and then shoot the

880
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
piston or something and then shoot the
 

881
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,420
piston or something and then shoot the
items out uh how do we do it and then

882
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,430
items out uh how do we do it and then
 

883
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,920
items out uh how do we do it and then
not if they shoot out I'm not sure

884
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:49,930
not if they shoot out I'm not sure
 

885
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,060
not if they shoot out I'm not sure
they're gonna make it all the way to the

886
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,070
they're gonna make it all the way to the
 

887
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,900
they're gonna make it all the way to the
middle that's a pretty far distance

888
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:54,910
middle that's a pretty far distance
 

889
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,990
middle that's a pretty far distance
actually the way I got the setup I do

890
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
actually the way I got the setup I do
 

891
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,030
actually the way I got the setup I do
have an idea though guys don't worry I

892
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,040
have an idea though guys don't worry I
 

893
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,840
have an idea though guys don't worry I
got an idea what I think we're gonna do

894
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,850
got an idea what I think we're gonna do
 

895
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,340
got an idea what I think we're gonna do
and sorry it's a little bit dark here if

896
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,350
and sorry it's a little bit dark here if
 

897
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,140
and sorry it's a little bit dark here if
I place down a torch the ice is gonna

898
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,150
I place down a torch the ice is gonna
 

899
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,480
I place down a torch the ice is gonna
start melting I think what we'll do is

900
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:11,490
start melting I think what we'll do is
 

901
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,140
start melting I think what we'll do is
let's get rid of these yeah sure I'm

902
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,150
let's get rid of these yeah sure I'm
 

903
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,950
let's get rid of these yeah sure I'm
going to have a hopper here maybe facing

904
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:19,960
going to have a hopper here maybe facing
 

905
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,010
going to have a hopper here maybe facing
down another hopper below it that'll

906
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,020
down another hopper below it that'll
 

907
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,900
down another hopper below it that'll
pick up the drops that'll just leave the

908
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:24,910
pick up the drops that'll just leave the
 

909
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:30,050
pick up the drops that'll just leave the
XP and then to get the XP out of there I

910
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,060
XP and then to get the XP out of there I
 

911
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,490
XP and then to get the XP out of there I
think I'm going to do the piston

912
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:32,500
think I'm going to do the piston
 

913
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,890
think I'm going to do the piston
translocation trick I think that's a

914
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:34,900
translocation trick I think that's a
 

915
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,360
translocation trick I think that's a
good idea instead of doing the slime

916
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,370
good idea instead of doing the slime
 

917
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,210
good idea instead of doing the slime
block launcher stuff try change it up do

918
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:39,220
block launcher stuff try change it up do
 

919
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,160
block launcher stuff try change it up do
do something different so this will be

920
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,170
do something different so this will be
 

921
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,280
do something different so this will be
totally sealed like this yeah I think

922
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,290
totally sealed like this yeah I think
 

923
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,450
totally sealed like this yeah I think
this will work out pretty good actually

924
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:45,460
this will work out pretty good actually
 

925
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,770
this will work out pretty good actually
so the hopper is gonna get rid of the

926
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:46,780
so the hopper is gonna get rid of the
 

927
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,970
so the hopper is gonna get rid of the
items out of the chamber

928
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:47,980
items out of the chamber
 

929
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,460
items out of the chamber
that'll just leave the XP orbs this

930
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:50,470
that'll just leave the XP orbs this
 

931
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,350
that'll just leave the XP orbs this
works out good too because I think if we

932
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,360
works out good too because I think if we
 

933
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,080
works out good too because I think if we
just use one main hopper to pick up all

934
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,090
just use one main hopper to pick up all
 

935
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,760
just use one main hopper to pick up all
the items it's gonna get jammed up we're

936
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:56,770
the items it's gonna get jammed up we're
 

937
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,799
the items it's gonna get jammed up we're
gonna get too many items for one hopper

938
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:58,809
gonna get too many items for one hopper
 

939
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,020
gonna get too many items for one hopper
alone I think so if we split it up to

940
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,030
alone I think so if we split it up to
 

941
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,549
alone I think so if we split it up to
four different ones it's gonna work a

942
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
four different ones it's gonna work a
 

943
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,640
four different ones it's gonna work a
lot better in the long run I think and

944
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:05,650
lot better in the long run I think and
 

945
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,070
lot better in the long run I think and
then the piston conveyor belts gonna

946
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
then the piston conveyor belts gonna
 

947
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
then the piston conveyor belts gonna
pull the XP orbs out of there bring it

948
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,090
pull the XP orbs out of there bring it
 

949
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,340
pull the XP orbs out of there bring it
along here right to the middle it worked

950
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,350
along here right to the middle it worked
 

951
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,250
along here right to the middle it worked
out perfect - so they it lines perfectly

952
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:17,260
out perfect - so they it lines perfectly
 

953
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,890
out perfect - so they it lines perfectly
with the middle and kind of got lucky

954
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:19,900
with the middle and kind of got lucky
 

955
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,930
with the middle and kind of got lucky
with that and then we're gonna have

956
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:21,940
with that and then we're gonna have
 

957
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,880
with that and then we're gonna have
another piston elevator to pull the

958
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:23,890
another piston elevator to pull the
 

959
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,500
another piston elevator to pull the
items up to the top to where we're

960
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,510
items up to the top to where we're
 

961
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,049
items up to the top to where we're
standing the the XP orbs up to us there

962
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:28,059
standing the the XP orbs up to us there
 

963
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:31,070
standing the the XP orbs up to us there
I think I'll be okay I did some testing

964
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,080
I think I'll be okay I did some testing
 

965
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,320
I think I'll be okay I did some testing
these these conveyor belt things are a

966
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,330
these these conveyor belt things are a
 

967
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,480
these these conveyor belt things are a
little bit hit and miss like for moving

968
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,490
little bit hit and miss like for moving
 

969
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,700
little bit hit and miss like for moving
players they're also a little bit hit

970
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:38,710
players they're also a little bit hit
 

971
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,970
players they're also a little bit hit
and miss with moving items but from my

972
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:41,980
and miss with moving items but from my
 

973
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,919
and miss with moving items but from my
testing I found they're actually pretty

974
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:43,929
testing I found they're actually pretty
 

975
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,440
testing I found they're actually pretty
reliable for moving XP orbs they seem to

976
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,450
reliable for moving XP orbs they seem to
 

977
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,169
reliable for moving XP orbs they seem to
handle them a lot better so we'll see

978
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:49,179
handle them a lot better so we'll see
 

979
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,520
handle them a lot better so we'll see
how this goes I think it'll be okay

980
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:50,530
how this goes I think it'll be okay
 

981
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:56,070
how this goes I think it'll be okay
though but yeah basically do do this

982
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,080
though but yeah basically do do this
 

983
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,070
though but yeah basically do do this
pattern like so put redstone here then

984
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,080
pattern like so put redstone here then
 

985
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,640
pattern like so put redstone here then
between each of the snaking connections

986
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,650
between each of the snaking connections
 

987
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,700
between each of the snaking connections
here this little zigzag we got going on

988
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:04,710
here this little zigzag we got going on
 

989
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,020
here this little zigzag we got going on
I'm gonna cover over this with glass

990
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,030
I'm gonna cover over this with glass
 

991
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,610
I'm gonna cover over this with glass
probably so we don't get any spawns

992
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:08,620
probably so we don't get any spawns
 

993
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,840
probably so we don't get any spawns
happening and maybe set up a hopper

994
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:12,850
happening and maybe set up a hopper
 

995
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,659
happening and maybe set up a hopper
clock for each of these branches that'll

996
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:15,669
clock for each of these branches that'll
 

997
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,909
clock for each of these branches that'll
send the signal from here all the way to

998
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:17,919
send the signal from here all the way to
 

999
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,750
send the signal from here all the way to
the middle and up yeah so this is

1000
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
the middle and up yeah so this is
 

1001
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,640
the middle and up yeah so this is
getting a little crazy guys but

1002
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,650
getting a little crazy guys but
 

1003
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,360
getting a little crazy guys but
hopefully it works now we'll try it out

1004
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,370
hopefully it works now we'll try it out
 

1005
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,340
hopefully it works now we'll try it out
basically we got a hopper clock way over

1006
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,350
basically we got a hopper clock way over
 

1007
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,919
basically we got a hopper clock way over
here let's put in thirty two items sure

1008
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:31,929
here let's put in thirty two items sure
 

1009
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,340
here let's put in thirty two items sure
why not

1010
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,350
why not
 

1011
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,750
why not
that's gonna make the conveyor belt run

1012
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
that's gonna make the conveyor belt run
 

1013
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,440
that's gonna make the conveyor belt run
every so often to deliver the XP orbs to

1014
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,450
every so often to deliver the XP orbs to
 

1015
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,730
every so often to deliver the XP orbs to
us we're gonna cover over this with

1016
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:40,740
us we're gonna cover over this with
 

1017
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,560
us we're gonna cover over this with
glass we don't get any zombie pigmen

1018
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:42,570
glass we don't get any zombie pigmen
 

1019
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,760
glass we don't get any zombie pigmen
spawning or gas which would be even

1020
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:46,770
spawning or gas which would be even
 

1021
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,380
spawning or gas which would be even
worse break all this

1022
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,390
worse break all this
 

1023
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:54,100
worse break all this
that's a monostable circuit right there

1024
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,110

 

1025
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,770

that good everything is all sealed up

1026
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:57,780
that good everything is all sealed up
 

1027
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,630
that good everything is all sealed up
pretty good here I'd say I think we're

1028
00:24:59,630 --> 00:24:59,640
pretty good here I'd say I think we're
 

1029
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,090
pretty good here I'd say I think we're
okay

1030
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:01,100
okay
 

1031
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,130
okay
so yeah this this is the main branch the

1032
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:04,140
so yeah this this is the main branch the
 

1033
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,440
so yeah this this is the main branch the
main conveyor bet branch this one

1034
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:06,450
main conveyor bet branch this one
 

1035
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,150
main conveyor bet branch this one
actually connects to the elevator in the

1036
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,160
actually connects to the elevator in the
 

1037
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,000
actually connects to the elevator in the
middle I got set up here I tried to do

1038
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,010
middle I got set up here I tried to do
 

1039
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,870
middle I got set up here I tried to do
the wiring so that's I think that worked

1040
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
the wiring so that's I think that worked
 

1041
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,490
the wiring so that's I think that worked
right I will find out yeah I tried to do

1042
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:22,500
right I will find out yeah I tried to do
 

1043
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,440
right I will find out yeah I tried to do
the wiring here so that no zombie pigmen

1044
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,450
the wiring here so that no zombie pigmen
 

1045
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,870
the wiring here so that no zombie pigmen
will spawn so I got slabs and pretty

1046
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
will spawn so I got slabs and pretty
 

1047
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,250
will spawn so I got slabs and pretty
much filling up all the empty spaces

1048
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:28,260
much filling up all the empty spaces
 

1049
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,530
much filling up all the empty spaces
there except for at the bottom here

1050
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:30,540
there except for at the bottom here
 

1051
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,960
there except for at the bottom here
you'll see like for example right here a

1052
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:32,970
you'll see like for example right here a
 

1053
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,060
you'll see like for example right here a
zombie fitting a good spawn so I'm gonna

1054
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,070
zombie fitting a good spawn so I'm gonna
 

1055
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,210
zombie fitting a good spawn so I'm gonna
put a slab over top this I'm going to

1056
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:38,220
put a slab over top this I'm going to
 

1057
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,480
put a slab over top this I'm going to
put a slab over top this and now I think

1058
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,490
put a slab over top this and now I think
 

1059
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,710
put a slab over top this and now I think
it's all good cool so the actual

1060
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:45,720
it's all good cool so the actual
 

1061
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,520
it's all good cool so the actual
elevator here I think we want this at

1062
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:49,530
elevator here I think we want this at
 

1063
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,210
elevator here I think we want this at
two tix

1064
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,220
two tix
 

1065
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,910
two tix
I think XP orbs can handle two ticks

1066
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:52,920
I think XP orbs can handle two ticks
 

1067
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,230
I think XP orbs can handle two ticks
like that we'll find out

1068
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
like that we'll find out
 

1069
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,220
like that we'll find out
let's go up I keep saying we'll find out

1070
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,230
let's go up I keep saying we'll find out
 

1071
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,890
let's go up I keep saying we'll find out
because I really don't know I didn't see

1072
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:03,900
because I really don't know I didn't see
 

1073
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,210
because I really don't know I didn't see
the lights go on there I'm a little

1074
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:05,220
the lights go on there I'm a little
 

1075
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,110
the lights go on there I'm a little
worried but we'll find out okay no I hit

1076
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
worried but we'll find out okay no I hit
 

1077
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,140
worried but we'll find out okay no I hit
my head it looks cool right I like that

1078
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,150
my head it looks cool right I like that
 

1079
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,720
my head it looks cool right I like that
I like how the blue glass looks it's

1080
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:14,730
I like how the blue glass looks it's
 

1081
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,920
I like how the blue glass looks it's
like it's sealed I gotta work on my

1082
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:18,930
like it's sealed I gotta work on my
 

1083
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,730
like it's sealed I gotta work on my
flying I just have this tiny little

1084
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:22,740
flying I just have this tiny little
 

1085
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,560
flying I just have this tiny little
platform I'm planning on landing it on

1086
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:24,570
platform I'm planning on landing it on
 

1087
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,940
platform I'm planning on landing it on
here this is the afk spot oh I heard the

1088
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:28,950
here this is the afk spot oh I heard the
 

1089
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,560
here this is the afk spot oh I heard the
Pistons go all the way up okay good good

1090
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:30,570
Pistons go all the way up okay good good
 

1091
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:30,950
Pistons go all the way up okay good good
good

1092
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
good
 

1093
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,550
good
so I don't have the X the items actually

1094
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:34,560
so I don't have the X the items actually
 

1095
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,130
so I don't have the X the items actually
being picked up beyond that one hopper

1096
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:37,140
being picked up beyond that one hopper
 

1097
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,010
being picked up beyond that one hopper
there's no actual collection system but

1098
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,020
there's no actual collection system but
 

1099
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,660
there's no actual collection system but
the XP orbs on that one side hopefully

1100
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:43,670
the XP orbs on that one side hopefully
 

1101
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,310
the XP orbs on that one side hopefully
will be delivered to us

1102
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320

game but I think it would be a good mod
 

1241
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,500
game but I think it would be a good mod
