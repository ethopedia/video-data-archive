and they're at low health
 

71
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,190
and they're at low health
and they die do they give you experience

00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
and they die do they give you experience
 

73
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,749
and they die do they give you experience

93
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,750

i thought it was still in creative mode

94
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
i thought it was still in creative mode
 

95
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,910
i thought it was still in creative mode
there

96
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920

 

97
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,830

okay let's just reset this

98
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
okay let's just reset this
 

99
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,470
okay let's just reset this
so i think uh i think they're gonna drop

100
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
so i think uh i think they're gonna drop
 

101
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,589
so i think uh i think they're gonna drop
experience points

102
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
experience points
 

103
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:54,309
experience points
when they die here we'll find out

104
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319

 

105
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,990

yeah look okay so they do drop

106
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
yeah look okay so they do drop
 

107
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,750
yeah look okay so they do drop
experience points and probably like if

108
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
experience points and probably like if
 

109
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,350
experience points and probably like if
they have

110
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
they have
 

111
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,309
they have
uh armor or any anything else they have

112
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
uh armor or any anything else they have
 

113
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,309
uh armor or any anything else they have
a chance of dropping that too

114
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319

 

115
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,309

come on that'd be amazing if we could

116
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
come on that'd be amazing if we could
 

117
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,830
come on that'd be amazing if we could
see this guy drop his armor or that bow

118
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
see this guy drop his armor or that bow
 

119
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,550
see this guy drop his armor or that bow
but they're spawning too quick

120
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
but they're spawning too quick
 

121
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,670
but they're spawning too quick
come on oh did he drop it

122
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680

 

123
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,589

i'm pretty sure they do but it's a

124
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
i'm pretty sure they do but it's a
 

125
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,550
i'm pretty sure they do but it's a
chance thing

126
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560

 

127
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,789

anyway let's go on to our lp

128
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799

 

129
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,270

so i have pretty much finished the

130
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
so i have pretty much finished the
 

131
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,630
so i have pretty much finished the
you've been ethod guy

132
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
you've been ethod guy
 

133
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,030
you've been ethod guy
i think it turned out pretty good here i

134
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
i think it turned out pretty good here i
 

135
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,910
i think it turned out pretty good here i
went back to

136
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
went back to
 

137
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,390
went back to
the nether and i harvested another five

138
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
the nether and i harvested another five
 

139
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,990
the nether and i harvested another five
or six stacks of glowstone to

140
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
or six stacks of glowstone to
 

141
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,190
or six stacks of glowstone to
do the internal ring going all around

142
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
do the internal ring going all around
 

143
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,949
do the internal ring going all around
and that makes it look a lot better i

144
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
and that makes it look a lot better i
 

145
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,190
and that makes it look a lot better i
would say because it used to have like

146
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
would say because it used to have like
 

147
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,830
would say because it used to have like
gray going around and it broke up the

148
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
gray going around and it broke up the
 

149
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,350
gray going around and it broke up the
image kind of

150
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
image kind of
 

151
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,229
image kind of
now it's a constant background and in

152
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
now it's a constant background and in
 

153
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,830
now it's a constant background and in
total that background

154
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
total that background
 

155
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,869
total that background
of glowstone is like 15 stacks or so

156
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
of glowstone is like 15 stacks or so
 

157
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,070
of glowstone is like 15 stacks or so
which is

158
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
which is
 

159
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,949
which is
by far the most glowstone i've ever used

160
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
by far the most glowstone i've ever used
 

161
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,190
by far the most glowstone i've ever used
on a project that's insane

162
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
on a project that's insane
 

163
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,949
on a project that's insane
but i'm worth it i'm not gonna cheap out

164
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
but i'm worth it i'm not gonna cheap out
 

165
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,990
but i'm worth it i'm not gonna cheap out
on myself

166
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
on myself
 

167
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,469
on myself
that that would be wrong that that's

168
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
that that would be wrong that that's
 

169
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,509
that that would be wrong that that's
actually kind of a nice thing about

170
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
actually kind of a nice thing about
 

171
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,789
actually kind of a nice thing about
playing single player like you don't

172
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
playing single player like you don't
 

173
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,310
playing single player like you don't
have to worry about

174
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
have to worry about
 

175
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,830
have to worry about
somebody going through the nether and

176
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
somebody going through the nether and
 

177
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,830
somebody going through the nether and
taking all the glowstone

178
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
taking all the glowstone
 

179
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,469
taking all the glowstone
avarice or the quartz or whatever

180
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
avarice or the quartz or whatever
 

181
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,830
avarice or the quartz or whatever
there's plenty plenty in supply

182
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
there's plenty plenty in supply
 

183
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,749
there's plenty plenty in supply
um so i've also

184
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
um so i've also
 

185
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,189
um so i've also
if there's one thing i've learned from b

186
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
if there's one thing i've learned from b
 

187

if there's one thing i've learned from b
double o planting grass and

188
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
double o planting grass and
 

189
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,950
double o planting grass and
and trees and stuff makes it makes any

190
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
and trees and stuff makes it makes any
 

191
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,790
and trees and stuff makes it makes any
project look better pretty much

192
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
project look better pretty much
 

193
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,469
project look better pretty much
and it's really easy to do so i got a

194
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
and it's really easy to do so i got a
 

195
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,790
and it's really easy to do so i got a
couple trees around here now

196
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
couple trees around here now
 

197
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,510
couple trees around here now
um i've evened out the sides remember

198
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
um i've evened out the sides remember
 

199
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,270
um i've evened out the sides remember
there was the sharp cut off before now

200
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
there was the sharp cut off before now
 

201
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,870
there was the sharp cut off before now
it's kind of leveled

202
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
it's kind of leveled
 

203
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,590
it's kind of leveled
off and it i think blends in pretty well

204
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
off and it i think blends in pretty well
 

205
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,950
off and it i think blends in pretty well
same with this side

206
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
same with this side
 

207
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,310
same with this side
i think this side turned out a little

208
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
i think this side turned out a little
 

209
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,629
i think this side turned out a little
bit better than this one but

210
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
bit better than this one but
 

211
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,830
bit better than this one but
i think it's good let's head on up

212
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
i think it's good let's head on up
 

213
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,749
i think it's good let's head on up
whoa punch myself

214
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
whoa punch myself
 

215
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,150
whoa punch myself
um i still might add some waterfalls

216
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
um i still might add some waterfalls
 

217
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,150
um i still might add some waterfalls
around here yet though

218
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
around here yet though
 

219
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,150
around here yet though
so this is what i added all around this

220
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
so this is what i added all around this
 

221
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,830
so this is what i added all around this
this five block wide

222
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
this five block wide
 

223
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,230
this five block wide
ring on the inside

224
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
ring on the inside
 

225
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,990
ring on the inside
pretty cool but anyways today guys i

226
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
pretty cool but anyways today guys i
 

227
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,670
pretty cool but anyways today guys i
think we're gonna go work on that zombie

228
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
think we're gonna go work on that zombie
 

229
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,590
think we're gonna go work on that zombie
pigmen farm some more for a little bit

230
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
pigmen farm some more for a little bit
 

231
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,469
pigmen farm some more for a little bit
anyway

232
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
anyway
 

233
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:42,870
anyway
so let's head on over to the nether

234
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880

 

235
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,670

this is where we are building our zombie

236
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
this is where we are building our zombie
 

237
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,469
this is where we are building our zombie
pigmen farm

238
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
pigmen farm
 

239
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,430
pigmen farm
our gold farm uh we cleared this out i

240
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
our gold farm uh we cleared this out i
 

241
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,189
our gold farm uh we cleared this out i
think two or three episodes ago with the

242
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
think two or three episodes ago with the
 

243
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,270
think two or three episodes ago with the
tnt and i've gone through and cleared

244
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
tnt and i've gone through and cleared
 

245
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,189
tnt and i've gone through and cleared
even more with the pick

246
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
even more with the pick
 

247
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,189
even more with the pick
and i still have a bunch to go though

248
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
and i still have a bunch to go though
 

249
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,870
and i still have a bunch to go though
especially down below here because we

250
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
especially down below here because we
 

251
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,590
especially down below here because we
need

252
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
need
 

253
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,309
need
the zombie pigmen to fall quite a ways

254
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
the zombie pigmen to fall quite a ways
 

255
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,749
the zombie pigmen to fall quite a ways
too

256
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
too
 

257
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,590
too
but let's head on up

258
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
but let's head on up
 

259
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,909
but let's head on up
this is i think the center right here

260
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
this is i think the center right here
 

261
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,070
this is i think the center right here
and we need to oh

262
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
and we need to oh
 

263
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,469
and we need to oh
ah smooth smooth we need to sort of

264
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
ah smooth smooth we need to sort of
 

265
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,350
ah smooth smooth we need to sort of
build our spawning pads in the shape of

266
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
build our spawning pads in the shape of
 

267
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,670
build our spawning pads in the shape of
a

268
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
a
 

269
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,670
a
semi sphere like with that as the flat

270
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
semi sphere like with that as the flat
 

271
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,309
semi sphere like with that as the flat
part

272
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
part
 

273
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,350
part
the ceiling here as the flat part and it

274
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
the ceiling here as the flat part and it
 

275
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,029
the ceiling here as the flat part and it
kind of doming outward

276
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
kind of doming outward
 

277
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,710
kind of doming outward
um sort of try to imagine that

278
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
um sort of try to imagine that
 

279
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,590
um sort of try to imagine that
uh so the spawning pads how far is this

280
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
uh so the spawning pads how far is this
 

281
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,309
uh so the spawning pads how far is this
let's

282
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
let's
 

283
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,070
let's
check this out i don't know how to how

284
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
check this out i don't know how to how
 

285
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,150
check this out i don't know how to how
big whoa

286
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
big whoa
 

287
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,309
big whoa
i think i just walked across that that

288
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
i think i just walked across that that
 

289
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,430
i think i just walked across that that
was pretty cool

290
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
was pretty cool
 

291
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,469
was pretty cool
i don't know how big we should make them

292
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
i don't know how big we should make them
 

293
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,830
i don't know how big we should make them
2 4 6 8

294
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
2 4 6 8
 

295
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,150
2 4 6 8
10 12. huh

296
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
10 12. huh
 

297
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,670
10 12. huh
i think what i want to do is make a

298
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
i think what i want to do is make a
 

299
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,309
i think what i want to do is make a
three wide space in the center

300
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
three wide space in the center
 

301
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,350
three wide space in the center
and then make it go out

302
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
and then make it go out
 

303
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,629
and then make it go out
let's go out 16 blocks make the spawning

304
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
let's go out 16 blocks make the spawning
 

305
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,790
let's go out 16 blocks make the spawning
pad 16 blocks long

306
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
pad 16 blocks long
 

307
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,309
pad 16 blocks long
and if we want to expand it in the

308
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
and if we want to expand it in the
 

309
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,469
and if we want to expand it in the
future we can and go out i think we can

310
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
future we can and go out i think we can
 

311
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,150
future we can and go out i think we can
do up to 30 blocks

312
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
do up to 30 blocks
 

313
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,870
do up to 30 blocks
long for each pad so

314
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
long for each pad so
 

315
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,550
long for each pad so
let's what's our height here

316
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
let's what's our height here
 

317
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,469
let's what's our height here
need three blocks height for each one

318
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479

 

319
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,270

i think this is where we're at yeah i'm

320
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
i think this is where we're at yeah i'm
 

321
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,029
i think this is where we're at yeah i'm
going to build it

322
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
going to build it
 

323
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,150
going to build it
out of

324
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160

 

325
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,270

the stone slabs i think the main thing

326
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
the stone slabs i think the main thing
 

327
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,710
the stone slabs i think the main thing
i'm worried about while building this

328
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
i'm worried about while building this
 

329
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,390
i'm worried about while building this
actually is the gas we're going to have

330
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
actually is the gas we're going to have
 

331
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,629
actually is the gas we're going to have
to put a cage around this thing

332
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
to put a cage around this thing
 

333
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,869
to put a cage around this thing
and i'll probably have to do that pretty

334
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
and i'll probably have to do that pretty
 

335
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,990
and i'll probably have to do that pretty
quick but

336
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
quick but
 

337
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,550
quick but
for now i'm going to try build it uh

338
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
for now i'm going to try build it uh
 

339
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,150
for now i'm going to try build it uh
with the gas around and i'll just have

340
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
with the gas around and i'll just have
 

341
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,029
with the gas around and i'll just have
to shoot

342
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
to shoot
 

343
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,790
to shoot
any that appear because they're going to

344
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
any that appear because they're going to
 

345
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,510
any that appear because they're going to
blow up my pistons and

346
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
blow up my pistons and
 

347
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,189
blow up my pistons and
string i got to use tripwires redstone

348
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
string i got to use tripwires redstone
 

349
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,110
string i got to use tripwires redstone
all that stuff can get blown up by gas

350
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
all that stuff can get blown up by gas
 

351
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,990
all that stuff can get blown up by gas
very easily

352
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000

 

353
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,230

so let's just kind of get started here

354
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
so let's just kind of get started here
 

355
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,270
so let's just kind of get started here
i'm going to be using

356
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
i'm going to be using
 

357
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,990
i'm going to be using
jl's high efficiency spawning pads for

358
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
jl's high efficiency spawning pads for
 

359
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,869
jl's high efficiency spawning pads for
this

360
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
this
 

361
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,110
this
because they have lots of air spaces and

362
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
because they have lots of air spaces and
 

363
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,909
because they have lots of air spaces and
that makes

364
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
that makes
 

365
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,749
that makes
increases the chances of mobs spawning

366
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
increases the chances of mobs spawning
 

367
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,430
increases the chances of mobs spawning
on a small area

368
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
on a small area
 

369
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,550
on a small area

16. right
 

379
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,310
16. right
that's what we want okay and then it

380
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
that's what we want okay and then it
 

381
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,670
that's what we want okay and then it
goes

382
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
goes
 

383
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,350
goes
let's see if i can remember this i think

384
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
let's see if i can remember this i think
 

385
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,509
let's see if i can remember this i think
it goes pistons

386
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
it goes pistons
 

387
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,870
it goes pistons
here i

388
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
here i
 

389
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,870
here i
i'm gonna really run out of redstone on

390
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
i'm gonna really run out of redstone on
 

391
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,150
i'm gonna really run out of redstone on
this build i don't have much at the

392
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
this build i don't have much at the
 

393
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,110
this build i don't have much at the
moment

394
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
moment
 

395
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,110
moment
and every one of these pistons takes one

396
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
and every one of these pistons takes one
 

397
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,389
and every one of these pistons takes one
and then we need

398
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
and then we need
 

399
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,949
and then we need
a redstone on top of each piston so i'm

400
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
a redstone on top of each piston so i'm
 

401
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,990
a redstone on top of each piston so i'm
gonna

402
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
gonna
 

403
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,829
gonna
run out very quickly here i got lots of

404
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
run out very quickly here i got lots of
 

405
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,430
run out very quickly here i got lots of
iron so that's not a problem and i got

406
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
iron so that's not a problem and i got
 

407
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,110
iron so that's not a problem and i got
lots of

408
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
lots of
 

409
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,310
lots of
i don't know if i have much string

410
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
i don't know if i have much string
 

411
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,990
i don't know if i have much string
around i'll have to check that out too

412
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
around i'll have to check that out too
 

413
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,389
around i'll have to check that out too
but

414
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
but
 

415
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,990
but
for the most part we got what we need

416
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
for the most part we got what we need
 

417
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,389
for the most part we got what we need
for this

418
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
for this
 

419
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,190
for this
and then we put redstone on top of this

420
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200

 

421
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,269

the problem with these slabs is you

422
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
the problem with these slabs is you
 

423
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,430
the problem with these slabs is you
gotta place two blocks for every one

424
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
gotta place two blocks for every one
 

425
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,590
gotta place two blocks for every one
but i do really like using these in the

426
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
but i do really like using these in the
 

427
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,470
but i do really like using these in the
nether because they're

428
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
nether because they're
 

429
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,310
nether because they're
nice and bright

430
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
nice and bright
 

431
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,509
nice and bright
okay and do i have any more i do

432
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
okay and do i have any more i do
 

433
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,590
okay and do i have any more i do
so then this will come out

434
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600

 

435
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,790

um it's got to come out two blocks

436
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
um it's got to come out two blocks
 

437
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,230
um it's got to come out two blocks
then up and actually

438
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240

 

439
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,949

i think the way i i did it on the

440
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
i think the way i i did it on the
 

441
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,790
i think the way i i did it on the
minecraft servers i had a half slab

442
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
minecraft servers i had a half slab
 

443
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,590
minecraft servers i had a half slab
underneath too

444
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600

 

445
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,910

like that and then you put your trip

446
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
like that and then you put your trip
 

447
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,430
like that and then you put your trip
wire

448
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440

 

449
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,069

over here and then that runs all the way

450
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
over here and then that runs all the way
 

451
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,550
over here and then that runs all the way
across

452
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
across
 

453
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,509
across
so when a mob spawns on this area here

454
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
so when a mob spawns on this area here
 

455
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,870
so when a mob spawns on this area here
they're going to spawn inside the

456
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
they're going to spawn inside the
 

457
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,230
they're going to spawn inside the
tripwire and that's going to tell all

458
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
tripwire and that's going to tell all
 

459
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,590
tripwire and that's going to tell all
these pistons to

460
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
these pistons to
 

461
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,550
these pistons to
extend and push whatever is on this pad

462
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
extend and push whatever is on this pad
 

463
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,990
extend and push whatever is on this pad
off

464
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000

 

465
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,630

and

466
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640

 

467
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,069

go out here

468
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079

 

469
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,509

okay connected

470
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
okay connected
 

471
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,389
okay connected
good so let's run some redstone along

472
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
good so let's run some redstone along
 

473
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,990
good so let's run some redstone along
here and i'm not gonna do all this on

474
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
here and i'm not gonna do all this on
 

475
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,030
here and i'm not gonna do all this on
camera don't worry

476
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
camera don't worry
 

477
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,069
camera don't worry
i just wanted to do a half here and then

478
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
i just wanted to do a half here and then
 

479
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,750
i just wanted to do a half here and then
i'll do a bunch off camera

480
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
i'll do a bunch off camera
 

481
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,590
i'll do a bunch off camera
uh this is this is a very large build

482
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
uh this is this is a very large build
 

483
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,430
uh this is this is a very large build
oh uh but it's a very repetitive build

484
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
oh uh but it's a very repetitive build
 

485
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,030
oh uh but it's a very repetitive build
so i don't think it's gonna take

486
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
so i don't think it's gonna take
 

487
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,500
so i don't think it's gonna take
too long like it's fairly easy to do it

488
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:01,510
too long like it's fairly easy to do it
 

489
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,110
too long like it's fairly easy to do it
[Music]

490
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
[Music]
 

491
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,870
[Music]
but i'm not guaranteeing we're gonna get

492
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
but i'm not guaranteeing we're gonna get
 

493
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,949
but i'm not guaranteeing we're gonna get
it all done today that's for sure

494
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
it all done today that's for sure
 

495
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,470
it all done today that's for sure
especially the cage i don't know how to

496
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
especially the cage i don't know how to
 

497
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,630
especially the cage i don't know how to
do the cage uh i'll probably use iron

498
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
do the cage uh i'll probably use iron
 

499
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,550
do the cage uh i'll probably use iron
bars for that

500
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
bars for that
 

501
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,670
bars for that
and try mix a pattern in

502
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
and try mix a pattern in
 

503
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,430
and try mix a pattern in
so then i think we got to connect

504
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
so then i think we got to connect
 

505
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,829
so then i think we got to connect
over here that'll go to the tripwire

506
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839

 

507
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,910

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
behind it and then we uh
 

517

i'm gonna do it like this i have a total

732
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
i'm gonna do it like this i have a total
 

733
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,990
i'm gonna do it like this i have a total
of

734
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
of
 

735
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,549
of
well each of these strips is 16 spawning

736
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
well each of these strips is 16 spawning
 

737
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,830
well each of these strips is 16 spawning
spaces

738
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
spaces
 

739
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,510
spaces
there's two percent so that's 32

740
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
there's two percent so that's 32
 

741
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,870
there's two percent so that's 32
and there's four sets per side so that's

742
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:03,880
and there's four sets per side so that's
 

743
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,110
and there's four sets per side so that's
128

744
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
128
 

745
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,549

spawning spaces per layer and i'm doing

750
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
spawning spaces per layer and i'm doing
 

751
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,669
spawning spaces per layer and i'm doing
i think four layers with this thing so

752
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
i think four layers with this thing so
 

753
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,110
i think four layers with this thing so
one here

754
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
one here
 

755
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,310
one here
here and then here

756
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
here and then here
 

757
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,110
here and then here
that'll make it just over a thousand i

758
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
that'll make it just over a thousand i
 

759
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,470
that'll make it just over a thousand i
think 1024

760

00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
enough to
 

765
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,070

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,240
though can't you
 

989
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,350
though can't you
yeah there we go that's what i wanted

yeah there we go that's what i wanted
 

991
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,710
yeah there we go that's what i wanted
and if you yeah

992
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
and if you yeah
 

993
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,310
and if you yeah
you have to shift right click to open it

994
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
you have to shift right click to open it
 

995
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,149
you have to shift right click to open it
and you can put stuff inside that is so

996
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
and you can put stuff inside that is so
 

997
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,510
and you can put stuff inside that is so
cool

998
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520

 

999
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,269

uh i might like the mules more than

1000
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
uh i might like the mules more than
 

1001
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,190
uh i might like the mules more than
the horses i'm not sure just because of

1002
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
the horses i'm not sure just because of
 

1003
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,789
the horses i'm not sure just because of
that fact

1004
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
that fact
 

1005
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,990
that fact
that is so handy to have 15

1006
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
that is so handy to have 15
 

1007
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,669
that is so handy to have 15
slots too

1008
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679

 

1009
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,990

so i think the donkey is actually

1010
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
so i think the donkey is actually
 

1011
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,789
so i think the donkey is actually
quicker than the mule

1012
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
quicker than the mule
 

1013
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,669
quicker than the mule
just by a little bit he has less health

1014
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
just by a little bit he has less health
 

1015
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,149
just by a little bit he has less health
though

1016
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
though
 

1017
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,590
though
so i think that that might have been the

1018
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
so i think that that might have been the
 

1019
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,350
so i think that that might have been the
trade-off

1020
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
trade-off
 

1021
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,870
trade-off
and they seem to jump about the same

1022
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
and they seem to jump about the same
 

1023
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,750
and they seem to jump about the same
height as each other too

1024
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
height as each other too
 

1025
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,350
height as each other too
you can tell it's a little bit slower

1026
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360

 

1027
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,630

but anyway we are going to name him uh

1028
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
but anyway we are going to name him uh
 

1029
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,990
but anyway we are going to name him uh
because of his performance and his ears

1030
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000

 

1031
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,789

i dub the dumbo

1032
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799

 

1033
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,029

oh man

1034
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039

 

1035
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,870

maybe one last thing we'll do this

1036
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
maybe one last thing we'll do this
 

1037
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,310
maybe one last thing we'll do this
episode before we end it

1038
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
episode before we end it
 

1039
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,470
episode before we end it
uh wilson i haven't forgotten about

1040
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
uh wilson i haven't forgotten about
 

1041
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,750
uh wilson i haven't forgotten about
wilson

1042
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
wilson
 

1043
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,350
wilson
um i'm going to take you guys to a

1044
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,360
um i'm going to take you guys to a
 

1045
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:55,990
um i'm going to take you guys to a
creative world

1046
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
creative world
 

1047
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,350
creative world
where i was working on some of his

1048
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
where i was working on some of his
 

1049
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,510
where i was working on some of his
components and we can check those out

1050
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
components and we can check those out
 

1051
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,149
components and we can check those out
real quick

1052
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
real quick
 

1053
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,830
real quick
too

1054
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840

 

1055
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,269

yeah i've been messing with a few

1056
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
yeah i've been messing with a few
 

1057
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,190
yeah i've been messing with a few
redstone ideas for wilson here and i'll

1058
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
redstone ideas for wilson here and i'll
 

1059
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,870
redstone ideas for wilson here and i'll
take you guys through them

1060
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
take you guys through them
 

1061
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,230
take you guys through them
give you an idea of how they're going to

1062
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
give you an idea of how they're going to
 

1063
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,830
give you an idea of how they're going to
work so first up this is pretty simple

1064
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
work so first up this is pretty simple
 

1065
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,549
work so first up this is pretty simple
you guys know these comparator clocks

1066
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:16,559
you guys know these comparator clocks
 

1067
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,430
you guys know these comparator clocks
where

1068
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440
where
 

1069
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,350
where
signal goes back to the comparator and

1070
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
signal goes back to the comparator and
 

1071
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,669
signal goes back to the comparator and
it makes it pulse really really quick

1072
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
it makes it pulse really really quick
 

1073
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,390
it makes it pulse really really quick
as fast as possible i was trying to

1074
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
as fast as possible i was trying to
 

1075
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,029
as fast as possible i was trying to
think of a way i could regulate it

1076
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
think of a way i could regulate it
 

1077
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,669
think of a way i could regulate it
like choose to slow it down or remove

1078
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
like choose to slow it down or remove
 

1079
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,710
like choose to slow it down or remove
pulses

1080
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
pulses
 

1081
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,669
pulses
from from that and i figured this would

1082
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
from from that and i figured this would
 

1083
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,510
from from that and i figured this would
be a pretty easy way of doing it just

1084
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
be a pretty easy way of doing it just
 

1085
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,269
be a pretty easy way of doing it just
send it to

1086
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:37,279
send it to
 

1087
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,310
send it to
block controlled by a piston

1088
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
block controlled by a piston
 

1089
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,669
block controlled by a piston
and you could have different delay

1090
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
and you could have different delay
 

1091
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,909
and you could have different delay
settings for the other side so if it's

1092
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
settings for the other side so if it's
 

1093
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,830
settings for the other side so if it's
at two ticks

1094
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
at two ticks
 

1095
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,630
at two ticks
um well if it's at one tick maybe i'll

1096
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,640
um well if it's at one tick maybe i'll
 

1097
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,110
um well if it's at one tick maybe i'll
just show you first

1098
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
just show you first
 

1099
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,789
just show you first
it basically goes at the same speed

1100
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:54,799
it basically goes at the same speed
 

1101
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,909
it basically goes at the same speed
you can see they're about the same oh

1102
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
you can see they're about the same oh
 

1103
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,950
you can see they're about the same oh
break that if you slow it down

1104
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:00,960
break that if you slow it down
 

1105
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,269
break that if you slow it down
you can see you can reduce the number of

1106
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
you can see you can reduce the number of
 

1107
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,190
you can see you can reduce the number of
pulses you get out of that

1108
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
pulses you get out of that
 

1109
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,190
pulses you get out of that
reduced even more and even more

1110
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,200
reduced even more and even more
 

1111
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,549
reduced even more and even more
so you could sometimes it does that

1112
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
so you could sometimes it does that
 

1113
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,990
so you could sometimes it does that
i think that's a kind of a glitch

1114
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
i think that's a kind of a glitch
 

1115
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,789
i think that's a kind of a glitch
i'm not sure uh but yeah you can

1116
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
i'm not sure uh but yeah you can
 

1117
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,990
i'm not sure uh but yeah you can
regulate between

1118
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,000
regulate between
 

1119
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,590
regulate between
two different settings really easy just

1120
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
two different settings really easy just
 

1121
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,230
two different settings really easy just
by doing this

1122
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240

 

1123
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,830

and what does that have to do with

1124
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
and what does that have to do with
 

1125
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,630
and what does that have to do with
wilson well i was thinking of using this

1126
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,640
wilson well i was thinking of using this
 

1127
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,029
wilson well i was thinking of using this
sort of for his stomach

1128
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:37,039
sort of for his stomach
 

1129
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,190
sort of for his stomach
the idea i had if wilson can only eat so

1130
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
the idea i had if wilson can only eat so
 

1131
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,830
the idea i had if wilson can only eat so
much food

1132
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
much food
 

1133
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,950
much food
in so much time basically

1134
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
in so much time basically
 

1135
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,669
in so much time basically
if you feed him too much at once then he

1136
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
if you feed him too much at once then he
 

1137
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:47,990
if you feed him too much at once then he
gets

1138
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
gets
 

1139
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,710
gets
a penalty like he he gains weight really

1140
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:50,720
a penalty like he he gains weight really
 

1141
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,389
a penalty like he he gains weight really
quickly is what i wanted it to do

1142
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
quickly is what i wanted it to do
 

1143
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,750
quickly is what i wanted it to do
so uh this is what's controlling that

1144
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:55,760
so uh this is what's controlling that
 

1145
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,950
so uh this is what's controlling that
he has uh

1146
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960

 

1147
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,950

wait is that what i want i can't

1148
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
wait is that what i want i can't
 

1149
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,669
wait is that what i want i can't
remember how this works i think

1150
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:03,679
remember how this works i think
 

1151
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,909
remember how this works i think
i think we want that in there actually

1152
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
i think we want that in there actually
 

1153
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,350
i think we want that in there actually
uh the idea is

1154
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360

 

1155
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,870

he can take up to 52 food points

1156
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
he can take up to 52 food points
 

1157
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,190
he can take up to 52 food points
uh like this is a buffer and

1158
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
uh like this is a buffer and
 

1159
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,190
uh like this is a buffer and
each pulse represents a food point he

1160
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
each pulse represents a food point he
 

1161
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,389
each pulse represents a food point he
got from eating something

1162
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399

 

1163
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,029

and then when his his buffer runs out

1164
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:27,039
and then when his his buffer runs out
 

1165
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,990
and then when his his buffer runs out
like where

1166
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
like where
 

1167
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,710
like where
he's eaten too much and he's full

1168
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
he's eaten too much and he's full
 

1169
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,590
he's eaten too much and he's full
that'll switch

1170
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
that'll switch
 

1171
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,549
that'll switch
and then each of these pulses would add

1172
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
and then each of these pulses would add
 

1173
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,669
and then each of these pulses would add
one to his weight so when it switches

1174
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
one to his weight so when it switches
 

1175
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,310
one to his weight so when it switches
he receives double double the weight

1176
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
he receives double double the weight
 

1177
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,230
he receives double double the weight
from the food he eats so

1178
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
from the food he eats so
 

1179
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,029
from the food he eats so
kind of a little penalty for that um

1180
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
kind of a little penalty for that um
 

1181
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,310
kind of a little penalty for that um
over here this is for his bladder

1182
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,320
over here this is for his bladder
 

1183
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,990
over here this is for his bladder
i was messing around with this um

1184
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
i was messing around with this um
 

1185
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,590
i was messing around with this um
quite a bit going on basically

1186
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
quite a bit going on basically
 

1187
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,750
quite a bit going on basically

oh yeah and and with this every update
um he'll be able to re eat one more food

1194
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
um he'll be able to re eat one more food
 

1195
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,590
um he'll be able to re eat one more food
point like

1196
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
point like
 

1197
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,389
point like
over time he's going to get pulses from

1198
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
over time he's going to get pulses from
 

1199
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,909
over time he's going to get pulses from
this

1200
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:13,919
this
 

1201
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,510
this
and eventually this is going to return

1202
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
and eventually this is going to return
 

1203
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,750
and eventually this is going to return
back it's going to go up and he'll be

1204
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
back it's going to go up and he'll be
 

1205
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,950
back it's going to go up and he'll be
able to eat again

1206
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
able to eat again
 

1207
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,230
able to eat again
without any penalty

1208
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240

 

1209
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,070

so with wilson's bladder system um

1210
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
so with wilson's bladder system um
 

1211
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,789
so with wilson's bladder system um
every time updates this is going to

1212
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
every time updates this is going to
 

1213
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,669
every time updates this is going to
pulse

1214
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
pulse
 

1215
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,549
pulse
this here and you can see as is right

1216
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:32,559
this here and you can see as is right
 

1217
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,269
this here and you can see as is right
now

1218
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
now
 

1219
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,310
now
it's not connected to anything right so

1220
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
it's not connected to anything right so
 

1221
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,789
it's not connected to anything right so
every update that would do nothing but

1222
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:38,799
every update that would do nothing but
 

1223
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,750
every update that would do nothing but
as wilson receives food so

1224
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
as wilson receives food so
 

1225
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,470
as wilson receives food so
as this pulses this line here it's going

1226
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,480
as this pulses this line here it's going
 

1227
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,470
as this pulses this line here it's going
to go to his bladder

1228
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
to go to his bladder
 

1229
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,789
to go to his bladder
um bladder input is over here

1230
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799
um bladder input is over here
 

1231
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,149
um bladder input is over here
and that's represented by what's in this

1232
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
and that's represented by what's in this
 

1233
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,710
and that's represented by what's in this
dropper here so he has

1234
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
dropper here so he has
 

1235
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,430
dropper here so he has
64 plus 16 things in his bladder right

1236
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
64 plus 16 things in his bladder right
 

1237
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,470
64 plus 16 things in his bladder right
now

1238
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
now
 

1239
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,990
now
what does that equal 80. he has 80 80

1240
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
what does that equal 80. he has 80 80
 

1241
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,669
what does that equal 80. he has 80 80
bladder garbage at the moment and as he

1242
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
bladder garbage at the moment and as he
 

1243
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,750
bladder garbage at the moment and as he
receives food

1244
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
receives food
 

1245
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,110
receives food
this is going to pulse and he's going to

1246
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,120
this is going to pulse and he's going to
 

1247
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,310
this is going to pulse and he's going to
gain one every time

1248
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320
gain one every time
 

1249
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,710
gain one every time
and at one point here once he has enough

1250
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
and at one point here once he has enough
 

1251
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,870
and at one point here once he has enough
stuff in his bladder

1252
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
stuff in his bladder
 

1253
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,470
stuff in his bladder
that triggers and then this pulse can

1254
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
that triggers and then this pulse can
 

1255
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,990
that triggers and then this pulse can
get through

1256
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
get through
 

1257
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,870
get through
that goes to a randomizer there's a one

1258
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:26,880
that goes to a randomizer there's a one
 

1259
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,549
that goes to a randomizer there's a one
in nine chance that the sword is going

1260
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
in nine chance that the sword is going
 

1261
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,350
in nine chance that the sword is going
to get chosen

1262
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
to get chosen
 

1263
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,070
to get chosen
to go into the hopper and that will send

1264
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,080
to go into the hopper and that will send
 

1265
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,149
to go into the hopper and that will send
out the signal to

1266
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:34,159
out the signal to
 

1267
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,710
out the signal to
the end here that then goes to

1268
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
the end here that then goes to
 

1269
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,590
the end here that then goes to
um this this is his bladder size like

1270
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
um this this is his bladder size like
 

1271
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,350
um this this is his bladder size like
the size of

1272
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
the size of
 

1273
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,710
the size of
um of relief

1274
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
um of relief
 

1275
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,350
um of relief
that he releases so at the moment i have

1276
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
that he releases so at the moment i have
 

1277
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,750
that he releases so at the moment i have
a 15 just for testing

1278
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
a 15 just for testing
 

1279
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,269
a 15 just for testing
um it's it's a hopper clock um

1280
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:55,279
um it's it's a hopper clock um
 

1281
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,470
um it's it's a hopper clock um
and that will trigger a pulser that then

1282
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
and that will trigger a pulser that then
 

1283
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,029
and that will trigger a pulser that then
goes

1284
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
goes
 

1285
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,870
goes
to send his bladder buffer back to

1286
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
to send his bladder buffer back to
 

1287
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,070
to send his bladder buffer back to
normal

1288
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
normal
 

1289
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,269
normal
and it then sends out

1290
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
and it then sends out
 

1291
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,350
and it then sends out
a pulse to this line as well which will

1292
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
a pulse to this line as well which will
 

1293
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,029
a pulse to this line as well which will
reduce his weight because when you go to

1294
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
reduce his weight because when you go to
 

1295
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,389
reduce his weight because when you go to
the bathroom

1296
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:12,399
the bathroom
 

1297
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,830
the bathroom
you get lighter so wilson does too

1298
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840
you get lighter so wilson does too
 

1299
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,509
you get lighter so wilson does too
um anyway let's try it out

1300
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:21,519

 

1301
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,950

nothing nothing

1302
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
nothing nothing
 

1303
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,029
nothing nothing
so there's a chance wilson get can get

1304
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
so there's a chance wilson get can get
 

1305
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,350
so there's a chance wilson get can get
constipated from this too

1306
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
constipated from this too
 

1307
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,389
constipated from this too
like if if he's not lucky here he's

1308
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
like if if he's not lucky here he's
 

1309
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,789
like if if he's not lucky here he's
going to keep filling up more and more

1310
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799

 

1311
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,230

till finally

1312
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,240

 

1313
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,710

go on poor wilson

1314
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:44,720
go on poor wilson
 

1315
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,149
go on poor wilson
he's not going to be feeling well at

1316
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:46,159
he's not going to be feeling well at
 

1317
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,590
he's not going to be feeling well at
this point

1318
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600

 

1319
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,110

wow it's one to nine come on

1320
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120

 

1321
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,549

trigger you stupid thing that's good i

1322
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:58,559
trigger you stupid thing that's good i
 

1323
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,590
trigger you stupid thing that's good i
actually want this behavior but

1324
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:01,600
actually want this behavior but
 

1325
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,669
actually want this behavior but
there we go finally so you can see it's

1326
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
there we go finally so you can see it's
 

1327
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,870
there we go finally so you can see it's
sending up pulse notes

1328
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
sending up pulse notes
 

1329
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,590
sending up pulse notes
do this thing and then after a certain

1330
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
do this thing and then after a certain
 

1331
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,830
do this thing and then after a certain
amount of time this goes back to normal

1332
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:12,840
amount of time this goes back to normal
 

1333
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,389
amount of time this goes back to normal
and you can see it's back to the state

1334
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
and you can see it's back to the state
 

1335
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:16,950
and you can see it's back to the state
where

1336
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
where
 

1337
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,269
where
pulse can't get through until he eats

1338
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
pulse can't get through until he eats
 

1339
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,470
pulse can't get through until he eats
more and his bladder fills up

1340
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480

 

1341
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,830

oh wilson's gonna be so crazy when he's

1342
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:26,840
oh wilson's gonna be so crazy when he's
 

1343
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,470
oh wilson's gonna be so crazy when he's
done

1344
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
done

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,630
i've been trying to decide like when he
goes to the bathroom

1348
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640

1358
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:46,640
uh or how to do it or how i'm supposed
 

1359
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,430
uh or how to do it or how i'm supposed
to clean it up afterwards but

1360
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
to clean it up afterwards but
 

1361
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,509
to clean it up afterwards but
yeah that's gonna be another part of

1362
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
yeah that's gonna be another part of
 

1363
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,149
yeah that's gonna be another part of
this that i haven't figured out yet

1364
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
this that i haven't figured out yet
 

1365
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,070
this that i haven't figured out yet
uh one last thing here to show you

1366
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
uh one last thing here to show you
 

1367
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,509
uh one last thing here to show you
ignore this in the back that was my

1368
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,519
ignore this in the back that was my
 

1369
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,149
ignore this in the back that was my
first

1370
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
first
 

1371
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,710
first
go at it this is supposed to be wilson's

1372
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:00,720
go at it this is supposed to be wilson's
 

1373
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,549
go at it this is supposed to be wilson's
immune system so

1374
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
immune system so
 

1375
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,230
immune system so
we wanted to make it where he can get

1376
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
we wanted to make it where he can get
 

1377
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,789
we wanted to make it where he can get
sick and we can give him medicine to

1378
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
sick and we can give him medicine to
 

1379
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,669
sick and we can give him medicine to
to make him recover from that the way

1380
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:09,679
to make him recover from that the way
 

1381
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,070
to make him recover from that the way
this

1382
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
this
 

1383
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,750
this
is going to work this represents his

1384
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:13,760
is going to work this represents his
 

1385
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,909
is going to work this represents his
health level here so it goes from one

1386
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:15,919
health level here so it goes from one
 

1387
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,549
health level here so it goes from one
two three

1388
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
two three
 

1389
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,950
two three
four five uh as he's healthier

1390
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
four five uh as he's healthier
 

1391
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,950
four five uh as he's healthier
he is less i wanted to make it so he's

1392
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
he is less i wanted to make it so he's
 

1393
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,990
he is less i wanted to make it so he's
less likely to get

1394
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
less likely to get
 

1395
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,110
less likely to get
sick and as he gets unhealthy he's more

1396
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
sick and as he gets unhealthy he's more
 

1397
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,110
sick and as he gets unhealthy he's more
and more likely so it's a very i have to

1398
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
and more likely so it's a very i have to
 

1399
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,590
and more likely so it's a very i have to
do like a variable

1400
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
do like a variable
 

1401
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,950
do like a variable
randomizer here so we have a bunch of

1402
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
randomizer here so we have a bunch of
 

1403
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,669
randomizer here so we have a bunch of
these

1404
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
these
 

1405
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,789
these
these randomizers i've been using five

1406
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:38,799
these randomizers i've been using five
 

1407
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,149
these randomizers i've been using five
of them

1408
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159
of them
 

1409
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,830
of them
and per updates

1410
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
and per updates
 

1411
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,029
and per updates
i can send a signal to this wire

1412
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039

 

1413
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,909

oh well if i do it like that it's

1414
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:51,919
oh well if i do it like that it's
 

1415
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,590
oh well if i do it like that it's
impossible for him to get sick if he's

1416
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,600
impossible for him to get sick if he's
 

1417
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,549
impossible for him to get sick if he's
at five

1418
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
at five
 

1419
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,990
at five
five health so let's take this out

1420
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
five health so let's take this out
 

1421
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,710
five health so let's take this out
uh so when i take that out this piston

1422
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720
uh so when i take that out this piston
 

1423
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,430
uh so when i take that out this piston
is able to

1424
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
is able to
 

1425
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,549
is able to
retract it's no longer being powered and

1426
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
retract it's no longer being powered and
 

1427
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,990
retract it's no longer being powered and
then when you it receives a pulse

1428
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
then when you it receives a pulse
 

1429
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,550
then when you it receives a pulse
it can move forward every time and it

1430
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:10,560
it can move forward every time and it
 

1431
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,349
it can move forward every time and it
goes

1432
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
goes
 

1433
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,510
goes
over top of a redstone torch which goes

1434
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,520
over top of a redstone torch which goes
 

1435
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,349
over top of a redstone torch which goes
to the randomizer

1436
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
to the randomizer
 

1437
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,430
to the randomizer
and if the sword is selected

1438
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
and if the sword is selected
 

1439
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,710
and if the sword is selected
it will send a signal three blocks

1440
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
it will send a signal three blocks
 

1441
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,750
it will send a signal three blocks
um at this wire and it'll reach this

1442
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
um at this wire and it'll reach this
 

1443
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,950
um at this wire and it'll reach this
line here

1444
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
line here
 

1445
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,909
line here
and if if this receives a pulse it means

1446
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919
and if if this receives a pulse it means
 

1447
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,270
and if if this receives a pulse it means
he gets sick

1448
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
he gets sick
 

1449
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,349
he gets sick
so as it is right now it's pretty

1450
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
so as it is right now it's pretty
 

1451
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,710
so as it is right now it's pretty
pretty low chance of him actually

1452
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
pretty low chance of him actually
 

1453
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,869
pretty low chance of him actually
getting sick if he's at four

1454
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879

 

1455
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,990

oh there we go this won't trigger every

1456
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
oh there we go this won't trigger every
 

1457
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,510
oh there we go this won't trigger every
update either i'll probably add one more

1458
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
update either i'll probably add one more
 

1459
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,909
update either i'll probably add one more
randomizer before this

1460
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
randomizer before this
 

1461
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,149
randomizer before this
to decrease it

1462
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159

 

1463
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,710

but as it gets more and more unhealthy

1464
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:58,720

 

1465
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,310

more and more of these things trigger

1466
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,320
more and more of these things trigger
 

1467
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,990
more and more of these things trigger
per update

1468
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
per update
 

1469
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,190
per update
that times two so it's twice as likely

1470
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,200
that times two so it's twice as likely
 

1471
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,069
that times two so it's twice as likely
to get sick at that point

1472
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
to get sick at that point
 

1473
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,310
to get sick at that point
uh unless i adjust the number of stuff

1474
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
uh unless i adjust the number of stuff
 

1475
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,910
uh unless i adjust the number of stuff
in these droppers i can

1476
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:11,920
in these droppers i can
 

1477
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,670
in these droppers i can
control it a little bit with that too

1478
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
control it a little bit with that too
 

1479
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,790
control it a little bit with that too
two let's take up more three

1480
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:22,800

 

1481
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,829

so at this point pretty reasonable

1482
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:28,839

 

1483
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,589

chance

1484
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:33,599

 

1485
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,349

it's like every one and three probably

1486
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
it's like every one and three probably
 

1487
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,349
it's like every one and three probably
i don't know what the actual odds are

1488
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
i don't know what the actual odds are
 

1489
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,109
i don't know what the actual odds are
but you can see it'll increase

1490
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:41,119
but you can see it'll increase
 

1491
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,870
but you can see it'll increase
even more if i do this

1492
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:46,880

 

1493
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,390

it's like every one and two now

1494
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400

 

1495
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,470

uh-huh so that's how that works i think

1496
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,480
uh-huh so that's how that works i think
 

1497
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,030
uh-huh so that's how that works i think
it's pretty cool

1498
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040

 

1499
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,950

anyway that's enough with wilson let's

1500
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:02,960
anyway that's enough with wilson let's
 

1501
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,310
anyway that's enough with wilson let's
go read the comments

1502
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320

 

1503
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,950

so i'm not too sure what happened here

1504
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
so i'm not too sure what happened here
 

1505
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,829
so i'm not too sure what happened here
but when i logged back on

1506
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:11,839
but when i logged back on
 

1507
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,870
but when i logged back on
dumbo was right here i was beside him uh

1508
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,880
dumbo was right here i was beside him uh
 

1509
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,910
dumbo was right here i was beside him uh
when i logged back on

1510
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
when i logged back on
 

1511
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,510
when i logged back on
dumbo was gone he's just gone no idea

1512
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,520
dumbo was gone he's just gone no idea
 

1513
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,349
dumbo was gone he's just gone no idea
why he disappeared i'm guessing jeff

1514
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
why he disappeared i'm guessing jeff
 

1515
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,790
why he disappeared i'm guessing jeff
must have taken him

1516
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
must have taken him
 

1517
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,390
must have taken him
i don't know ah very strange

1518
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
i don't know ah very strange
 

1519
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,470
i don't know ah very strange
i dismounted before i logged off too

1520
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,480
i dismounted before i logged off too
 

1521
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,910
i dismounted before i logged off too
because i think there's a glitch with

1522
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920
because i think there's a glitch with
