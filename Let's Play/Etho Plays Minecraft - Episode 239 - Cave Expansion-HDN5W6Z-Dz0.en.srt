at the moments I used to have one up

94
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:33,720
at the moments I used to have one up
 

95
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,810
at the moments I used to have one up
there but since we redid the sheep or we

96
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:35,820
there but since we redid the sheep or we
 

97
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,480
there but since we redid the sheep or we
since we did that room up there I got

98
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,490
since we did that room up there I got
 

99
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,920
since we did that room up there I got
rid of the ender chest so now the

100
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:39,930
rid of the ender chest so now the
 

101
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,700
rid of the ender chest so now the
closest one is all the way over here

102
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:42,710
closest one is all the way over here
 

103
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,520
closest one is all the way over here
which is ridiculous so I added another

104
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:46,530
which is ridiculous so I added another
 

105
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,000
which is ridiculous so I added another
one I was having trouble before trying

although hindsight now I would probably

118
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,530
although hindsight now I would probably
 

119
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,230
although hindsight now I would probably
just put the crafting table there if I

120
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,240
just put the crafting table there if I
 

121
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,220
just put the crafting table there if I
thought of that originally but oh you

122
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,230
thought of that originally but oh you
 

123
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,950
thought of that originally but oh you
know what we could put an anvil there

124
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:14,960
know what we could put an anvil there
 

125
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,290
know what we could put an anvil there
but uh all right we found a place for an

126
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:18,300
but uh all right we found a place for an
 

127
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,130
but uh all right we found a place for an
anvil finally see I got this dealio here

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,140
anvil finally see I got this dealio here
 

129
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:32,000

it's just the it's not much to it wire

Pistons the center is right here I'm

134
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:42,840
Pistons the center is right here I'm
 

135
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,050
Pistons the center is right here I'm
going to be able to get out of here

136
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,060
going to be able to get out of here
 

137
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,680
going to be able to get out of here
Center is right there let's try to get

138
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:48,690
Center is right there let's try to get
 

139
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,710
Center is right there let's try to get
some light you see one piston there the

140
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:51,720
some light you see one piston there the
 

141
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,180
some light you see one piston there the
other ones over there so those come up

142
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,190
other ones over there so those come up
 

143
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,040
other ones over there so those come up
when we go over the pressure plates and

144
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,050
when we go over the pressure plates and
 

145
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,979
when we go over the pressure plates and
the water stream ends just short of here

146
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:57,989
the water stream ends just short of here
 

147
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,540
the water stream ends just short of here
so that's the items won't be moving at

148
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:02,550
so that's the items won't be moving at
 

149
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,410
so that's the items won't be moving at
all guaranteed when they pop up so I

150
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:06,420
all guaranteed when they pop up so I
 

151
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,000
all guaranteed when they pop up so I
think that's going to work I haven't

152
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,010
think that's going to work I haven't
 

153
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:15,290
think that's going to work I haven't
tried it yet and we get out of here well

154
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:15,300
tried it yet and we get out of here well
 

155
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,810
tried it yet and we get out of here well
I did try it I'm not going to lie but I

156
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:17,820
I did try it I'm not going to lie but I
 

157
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,430
I did try it I'm not going to lie but I
didn't break the ice so there was no

158
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
didn't break the ice so there was no
 

159
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,190
didn't break the ice so there was no

319
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,710
here which we need to do and I do plan
on doing that but I think we should go a

320
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
on doing that but I think we should go a
 

321
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,640
on doing that but I think we should go a
little bit further to this area around

322
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:50,650
little bit further to this area around
 

323
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,700
little bit further to this area around
here start working around here on the

324
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:53,710
here start working around here on the
 

325
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,170
here start working around here on the
cave I like the spot it's it's got a lot

326
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:58,180
cave I like the spot it's it's got a lot
 

327
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,630
cave I like the spot it's it's got a lot
of elevation changes and it's fairly

328
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
of elevation changes and it's fairly
 

329
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,610
of elevation changes and it's fairly
wide open in most places so I think we

330
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:02,620
wide open in most places so I think we
 

331
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,670
wide open in most places so I think we
could do a bit with it and as we build

332
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
could do a bit with it and as we build
 

333
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,630
could do a bit with it and as we build
here we'll start working our way back to

334
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
here we'll start working our way back to
 

335
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,300
here we'll start working our way back to
this area I find it's easier to

336
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,310
this area I find it's easier to
 

337
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,450
this area I find it's easier to
transition from an area few to go beyond

338
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:15,460
transition from an area few to go beyond
 

339
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,860
transition from an area few to go beyond
it and then come back because that's

340
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:16,870
it and then come back because that's
 

341
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,110
it and then come back because that's
kind of what we did the tops there and

342
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
kind of what we did the tops there and
 

343
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,750
kind of what we did the tops there and
then we came back and finished up that

344
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
then we came back and finished up that
 

345
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,120
then we came back and finished up that
area

346
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,130
area
 

347
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,310
area
I am pretty happy with how that turned

348
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,320
I am pretty happy with how that turned
 

349
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,720
I am pretty happy with how that turned
out so far with that in mind I'm

350
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:31,730
out so far with that in mind I'm
 

351
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,030
out so far with that in mind I'm
probably going to do leste structures

352
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
probably going to do leste structures
 

353
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,440
probably going to do leste structures
like it's not going to be as cluttered

354
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,450
like it's not going to be as cluttered
 

355
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,050
like it's not going to be as cluttered
it's going to be more pathways and trees

356
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,060
it's going to be more pathways and trees
 

357
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,000
it's going to be more pathways and trees
and that kind of thing more naturey

358
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,010
and that kind of thing more naturey
 

359
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,850
and that kind of thing more naturey
I hope but I do have a plan for a

360
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:43,860
I hope but I do have a plan for a
 

361
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,590
I hope but I do have a plan for a
structure here I want to build a

362
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
structure here I want to build a
 

363
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,290
structure here I want to build a
mushroom farm I don't know if we can get

364
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,300
mushroom farm I don't know if we can get
 

365
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,950
mushroom farm I don't know if we can get
to it today it's going to take a long

366
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:51,960
to it today it's going to take a long
 

367
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,930
to it today it's going to take a long
time to clear out this land it's going

368
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:56,940
time to clear out this land it's going
 

369
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,890
time to clear out this land it's going
to take a long time to clear out this

370
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:57,900
to take a long time to clear out this
 

371
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,240
to take a long time to clear out this
land so I don't think we can do it today

372
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,250
land so I don't think we can do it today
 

373
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,200
land so I don't think we can do it today
but I want to build a brown mushroom

374
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,210
but I want to build a brown mushroom
 

375
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,160
but I want to build a brown mushroom
farm this open area here and I started

376
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,170
farm this open area here and I started
 

377
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,130
farm this open area here and I started
laying it down torches like lines it

378
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,140
laying it down torches like lines it
 

379
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,570
laying it down torches like lines it
should start about there from here to

380
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:16,580

 

381
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,150

here I figure I want to make it to brown

382
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
here I figure I want to make it to brown
 

383
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,990
here I figure I want to make it to brown
mushrooms wide so there's seven seven by

384
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
mushrooms wide so there's seven seven by
 

385
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,650
mushrooms wide so there's seven seven by
seven so that would be 14 wide and I

386
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:27,660
seven so that would be 14 wide and I
 

387
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,420
seven so that would be 14 wide and I
want to make go three Brown mushrooms

388
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,430
want to make go three Brown mushrooms
 

389
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:47,590
want to make go three Brown mushrooms
back so that would be 42 blocks that way

390
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600

 

391
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,560

with it but it's going to have 16
 

415
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:30,410
with it but it's going to have 16
mushrooms and got to clear out clear out

416

this land I want the floor to be I think

418
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,270
this land I want the floor to be I think
 

419
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,980
this land I want the floor to be I think
at this level here and I think I'm just

420
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:36,990
at this level here and I think I'm just
 

421
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,440
at this level here and I think I'm just
going to use brass flooring and see how

422
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,450
going to use brass flooring and see how
 

423
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,290
going to use brass flooring and see how
it looks and we'll add some pattern to

424
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:42,300
it looks and we'll add some pattern to
 

425
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,840
it looks and we'll add some pattern to
it but yeah oh boy this is gonna take a

that like in our old world we had lots
 

451
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,930
that like in our old world we had lots
of that stuff we had the cannons we had

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:24,940
of that stuff we had the cannons we had
 

453
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,120
of that stuff we had the cannons we had
the secret project which never really

454
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,130
the secret project which never really
 

455
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,770
the secret project which never really
turned out so we don't talk about it

456
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:29,780
turned out so we don't talk about it
 

457
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,180
turned out so we don't talk about it
anymore

458
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,190
anymore
 

459
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,480
anymore
we had the Rube Goldberg machine which

460
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,490
we had the Rube Goldberg machine which
 

461
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,860
we had the Rube Goldberg machine which
also didn't really work that well

462
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:35,870
also didn't really work that well
 

463
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,960
also didn't really work that well
because it's vanilla and very hard to

464
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:37,970
because it's vanilla and very hard to
 

465
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,730
because it's vanilla and very hard to
set up that kind of stuff but you know

466
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:39,740
set up that kind of stuff but you know
 

467
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,910
set up that kind of stuff but you know
it's things like that we we did cool

468
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:42,920
it's things like that we we did cool
 

469
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,070
it's things like that we we did cool
things like that all the time so I have

470
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,080
things like that all the time so I have
 

471
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,750
things like that all the time so I have
a few ideas in mind but I want to get

that maybe do those some things I'm

478
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,190
that maybe do those some things I'm
 

479
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,450
that maybe do those some things I'm
thinking of obviously there's a trivia

480
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:01,460
thinking of obviously there's a trivia
 

481
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,330
thinking of obviously there's a trivia
game which I've wanted to do I actually

482
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,340
game which I've wanted to do I actually
 

483
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,610
game which I've wanted to do I actually
thought of a really easy way of doing

484
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:06,620
thought of a really easy way of doing
 

485
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,840
thought of a really easy way of doing
that and I might do that for like it at

486
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:10,850
that and I might do that for like it at
 

487
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,970
that and I might do that for like it at
Gd a simple way of doing it not a

488
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:12,980
Gd a simple way of doing it not a
 

489
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,990
Gd a simple way of doing it not a
redstone version I might do that for the

490
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,000
redstone version I might do that for the
 

491
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,640
redstone version I might do that for the
next download that might be the Easter

492
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,650
next download that might be the Easter
 

493
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,350
next download that might be the Easter
Egg which hopefully like I said it's

494
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
Egg which hopefully like I said it's
 

495
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,620
Egg which hopefully like I said it's
coming out soon I also thought about

496
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:26,630
coming out soon I also thought about
 

497
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,290
coming out soon I also thought about
doing a shooting range of some sorts

498
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:31,300

 

499
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,220

possibly using boats and something that

500
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,230
possibly using boats and something that
 

501
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,890
possibly using boats and something that
really caught my eye recently although I

502
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:38,900
really caught my eye recently although I
 

503
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,750
really caught my eye recently although I
might do this on the minecraft server I

504
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:40,760
might do this on the minecraft server I
 

505
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,970
might do this on the minecraft server I
don't know is a Fe discos sonic map I

506
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:45,980

don't you guys saw that but he set up

508
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:47,570
don't you guys saw that but he set up
 

509
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,320
don't you guys saw that but he set up
like a race in Minecraft and I think

510
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,330
like a race in Minecraft and I think
 

511
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,580
like a race in Minecraft and I think
that could be its own genre itself in

512
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:54,590
that could be its own genre itself in
 

513
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,560
that could be its own genre itself in
Minecraft like you know we have race for

514
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,570
Minecraft like you know we have race for
 

515
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,810
Minecraft like you know we have race for
wool on that I think racing could really

516
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:58,820
wool on that I think racing could really
 

517
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,750
wool on that I think racing could really
become a big thing if people set up Maps

518
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
become a big thing if people set up Maps
 

519
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,260
become a big thing if people set up Maps
for it although like he's got cool like

520
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,270
for it although like he's got cool like
 

521
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,090
for it although like he's got cool like
TNT boosts and that kind of thing I

522
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,100
TNT boosts and that kind of thing I
 

523
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,300
TNT boosts and that kind of thing I
don't really think I could do all that

524
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,310
don't really think I could do all that
 

525
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,520
don't really think I could do all that
much of that in vanilla minecraft but

526
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:14,530
much of that in vanilla minecraft but
 

527
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,350
much of that in vanilla minecraft but
something like that like at a race track

528
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
something like that like at a race track
 

529
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,690
something like that like at a race track
or a parkour track or something like

honestly like sure took a little while
to set up but I did not think I yeah I

546
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:53,769

 

547
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,720

yeah I miscounted but it's going to work

552
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:09,860
yeah I miscounted but it's going to work
 

553
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,179
yeah I miscounted but it's going to work
out fine instead of starting the firm

554
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:13,189
out fine instead of starting the firm
 

555
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:15,369
out fine instead of starting the firm
here we're going to start it to where we

556
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:15,379
here we're going to start it to where we
 

557
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:19,480
here we're going to start it to where we
blew up yeah so starting around here I

558
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,490
blew up yeah so starting around here I
 

559
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,730
blew up yeah so starting around here I
counted it's about 35 blocks that will

560
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:21,740
counted it's about 35 blocks that will
 

561
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,829
counted it's about 35 blocks that will
hold 10 mushrooms 2 wide 5 long and I

562
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:26,839
hold 10 mushrooms 2 wide 5 long and I
 

563
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,829
hold 10 mushrooms 2 wide 5 long and I
think we'll do it that way and we might

564
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:28,839
think we'll do it that way and we might
 

565
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,079
think we'll do it that way and we might
put in 2 or 4 red mushrooms or something

566
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:32,089
put in 2 or 4 red mushrooms or something
 

567
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:34,960
put in 2 or 4 red mushrooms or something
in the back but the main focus is to

568
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:34,970
in the back but the main focus is to
 

569
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,989
in the back but the main focus is to
make a brown mushroom farm and I'm going

570
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:40,999
make a brown mushroom farm and I'm going
 

571
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,840
make a brown mushroom farm and I'm going
it's gonna be pretty square of a room I

572
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:43,850
it's gonna be pretty square of a room I
 

573
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,789
it's gonna be pretty square of a room I
would say like much much like this but

574
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:45,799
would say like much much like this but
 

575
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,579
would say like much much like this but
the floor is not I never intended the

576
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:48,589
the floor is not I never intended the
 

577
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,710
the floor is not I never intended the
floor to be down this low the reason I

578
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
floor to be down this low the reason I
 

579
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,359
floor to be down this low the reason I
blew out so much is so I would have a

580
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:52,369
blew out so much is so I would have a
 

581
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,259
blew out so much is so I would have a
crawl space to do some redstone wiring

582
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:55,269
crawl space to do some redstone wiring
 

583
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,639
crawl space to do some redstone wiring
the actual floor is going to be up at

584
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:57,649
the actual floor is going to be up at
 

585
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:01,329
the actual floor is going to be up at
that level there so I'm going to fill

586
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:01,339
that level there so I'm going to fill
 

587
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:03,789
that level there so I'm going to fill
this in a whole layer of dirt will have

588
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:03,799
this in a whole layer of dirt will have
 

589
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,249
this in a whole layer of dirt will have
it a too high crawl space which will

590
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:06,259
it a too high crawl space which will
 

591
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,840
it a too high crawl space which will
make things easier for me when we're

592
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:07,850
make things easier for me when we're
 

593
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,600

dirt here and maybe talk a little bit
 

617
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,100
dirt here and maybe talk a little bit
but one thing I've noticed this is

618
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,110
but one thing I've noticed this is
 

619
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,080
but one thing I've noticed this is
probably going to be a problem probably

620
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,090
probably going to be a problem probably
 

621
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,070
probably going to be a problem probably
going to be a problem

622
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,080
going to be a problem

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,780
desert so if I'm doing the grass thing
it's not gonna look good I don't think I

628
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:07,790
it's not gonna look good I don't think I
 

629
