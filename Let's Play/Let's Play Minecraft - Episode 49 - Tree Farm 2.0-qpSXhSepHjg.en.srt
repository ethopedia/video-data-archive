we're not going to be working on the mob

240
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,580
we're not going to be working on the mob
 

241
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,980
we're not going to be working on the mob
system I'm going to take a break from

242
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:15,990
system I'm going to take a break from
 

243
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,740
system I'm going to take a break from
that I think I got it pretty much

244
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:18,750
that I think I got it pretty much
 

245
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,120
that I think I got it pretty much
figured out now I just have to do it but

246
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,130
figured out now I just have to do it but
 

247
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,770
figured out now I just have to do it but
today we're going to be working on

248
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:24,780
today we're going to be working on
 

249
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,510
today we're going to be working on
designing a new tree farm because it's

250
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
designing a new tree farm because it's
 

251
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,769
designing a new tree farm because it's
about time this one gets retired

252
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:33,779

 

253
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,089

so the new one I think is going to go

254
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:36,099
so the new one I think is going to go
 

255
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,329
so the new one I think is going to go
all the way around the spawning pads up

256
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:39,339
all the way around the spawning pads up
 

257
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,850
all the way around the spawning pads up
there and we need to figure out a new

258
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:41,860
there and we need to figure out a new
 

259
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,579
there and we need to figure out a new
design and I got an idea in mind I just

260
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:47,589
design and I got an idea in mind I just
 

261
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:55,230
design and I got an idea in mind I just
need to see how well it works and then

262
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,240
need to see how well it works and then
 

263
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:08,540
need to see how well it works and then
hollow out a five by five thing and

264
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:08,550
hollow out a five by five thing and
 

265
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:26,940
hollow out a five by five thing and
probably set up the water tool okay I've

266
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:26,950
probably set up the water tool okay I've
 

267
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,470
probably set up the water tool okay I've
always wanted to make a tree farm that

268
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
always wanted to make a tree farm that
 

269
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,440
always wanted to make a tree farm that
had a Auto collection thing for the

270
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,450
had a Auto collection thing for the
 

271
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,870
had a Auto collection thing for the
saplings I've never done that before and

272
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:35,880

 

273
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,750

so that's what we're going to try to do

274
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:38,760
so that's what we're going to try to do
 

275
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,569
so that's what we're going to try to do
but it's not going to be 100 percent

276
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:41,579
but it's not going to be 100 percent
 

277
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,670
but it's not going to be 100 percent
collection either that's that would be

278
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:44,680
collection either that's that would be
 

279
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,220
collection either that's that would be
just silly

280
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,230

 

281
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,130

this is actually what I plan on doing

282
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,140
this is actually what I plan on doing
 

283
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,560
this is actually what I plan on doing
something like this with Wolves to to

284
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:53,570
something like this with Wolves to to
 

285
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,700
something like this with Wolves to to
shear the sheep automatically what I'm

286
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:57,710
shear the sheep automatically what I'm
 

287
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,830
shear the sheep automatically what I'm
going to do is the sheep and cows are

288
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:02,840
going to do is the sheep and cows are
 

289
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,440
going to do is the sheep and cows are
going to fall in to the center of a

290
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,450
going to fall in to the center of a
 

291
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,470
going to fall in to the center of a
whirlpool like this and also I'm going

292
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
whirlpool like this and also I'm going
 

293
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,090
whirlpool like this and also I'm going
to have to find some way to regulate the

294
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:10,100
to have to find some way to regulate the
 

295
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,840
to have to find some way to regulate the
Wolves so there's always one or two in

296
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:12,850
Wolves so there's always one or two in
 

297
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,220
Wolves so there's always one or two in
this and they'll all be drawn to the

298
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,230
this and they'll all be drawn to the
 

299
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,720
this and they'll all be drawn to the
center the Wolves will attack the sheep

300
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:19,730
center the Wolves will attack the sheep
 

301
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,000
center the Wolves will attack the sheep
and the cows and kill them and get the

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,010
and the cows and kill them and get the
 

303
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,400
and the cows and kill them and get the
wool and leather from them and then

304
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,410
wool and leather from them and then
 

305
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,480
wool and leather from them and then
there'll be a collection point in the

306
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,490
there'll be a collection point in the
 

307
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:35,020
there'll be a collection point in the
middle where all the loot goes to does

308
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,030
middle where all the loot goes to does
 

309
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,590
middle where all the loot goes to does
it matter where anything drops there'll

310
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:38,600
it matter where anything drops there'll
 

311
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,280
it matter where anything drops there'll
be a glass all around this five by five

312
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,290
be a glass all around this five by five
 

313
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,370
be a glass all around this five by five
to so that they can't get out so it all

314
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,380
to so that they can't get out so it all
 

315
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,010
to so that they can't get out so it all
will float to the center and then go

316
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,020
will float to the center and then go
 

317
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,290
will float to the center and then go

477
00:18:33,840 --> 00:19:02,600

um see how these signs I think that

478
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:02,610
um see how these signs I think that
 

479
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,970
um see how these signs I think that
would work instead of using the glass it

480
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:07,980
would work instead of using the glass it
 

481

would work instead of using the glass it
will force the leaves to go higher than

will force the leaves to go higher than
that point a I hurt you not today buddy

484
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:20,159
that point a I hurt you not today buddy
 

485
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:28,820
that point a I hurt you not today buddy
not today actually that probably won't

486
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:28,830
not today actually that probably won't
 

487
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,779
not today actually that probably won't
work out too well

488
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:29,789
work out too well
 

489
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:36,830
work out too well
signs I'll probably keep it the glass

490
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
signs I'll probably keep it the glass
 

491
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:52,010
signs I'll probably keep it the glass
like that so the other idea I have is

492
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,020
like that so the other idea I have is
 

493
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,630
like that so the other idea I have is
I'm going to set up like an eats road

494
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:53,640
I'm going to set up like an eats road
 

495
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,659
I'm going to set up like an eats road
around this thing if that makes any

496
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:56,669
around this thing if that makes any
 

497
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:13,470
around this thing if that makes any
sense somehow

498
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:13,480

 

499
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:21,190

holding a fixed I don't know the zombies

500
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
holding a fixed I don't know the zombies
 

501
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,850
holding a fixed I don't know the zombies
got fixed in the patch so yeah somehow I

502
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:27,860
got fixed in the patch so yeah somehow I
 

503
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:35,139
got fixed in the patch so yeah somehow I
want to step in each road I think if I

504
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:35,149
want to step in each road I think if I
 

505
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:44,350
want to step in each road I think if I
make pressure plates and line the

506
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:44,360
make pressure plates and line the
 

507
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,310
make pressure plates and line the
outside out of something like that

508
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,320
outside out of something like that
 

509
00:20:51,320 --> 00:21:23,740
outside out of something like that
and then have a wall oh yeah freakin

510
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:23,750
and then have a wall oh yeah freakin
 

511
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:33,669
and then have a wall oh yeah freakin
buggers I wear the Wolves I'm sure

512
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
buggers I wear the Wolves I'm sure
 

513
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,090
buggers I wear the Wolves I'm sure
there's a wolf around here

514
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,100

 

515
00:21:38,100 --> 00:22:01,200

[Applause]

516
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,210

 

517
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:16,510

kneadable where's my bowl I saw there's

518
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:16,520
kneadable where's my bowl I saw there's
 

519
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:53,220
kneadable where's my bowl I saw there's
a creature here okay

520
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,230
a creature here okay
 

521
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,820
a creature here okay
like I was saying I'm gonna make some

522
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:57,830
like I was saying I'm gonna make some
 

523
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:10,899
like I was saying I'm gonna make some
ladders here

524
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:10,909

 

525
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:32,830

I can't do anything out here I got to

526
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:32,840
I can't do anything out here I got to
 

527
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:41,379
I can't do anything out here I got to
place torches on my because because of

528
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:41,389
place torches on my because because of
 

529
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:43,180
place torches on my because because of
that mob system they spawned like crazy

530
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,190
that mob system they spawned like crazy
 

531
00:23:43,190 --> 00:24:23,330
that mob system they spawned like crazy
on the island now I see oh yeah

532
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,340

 

533
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,920

nice try I heard you again

534
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:25,930
nice try I heard you again
 

535
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:35,430
nice try I heard you again
this isn't working out too well set up

536
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
this isn't working out too well set up
 

537
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:58,970
this isn't working out too well set up
an each road on the outside and water

538
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:58,980

 

539
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,420

and gotta make I'll probably just have

540
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,430
and gotta make I'll probably just have
 

541
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,380
and gotta make I'll probably just have
one boat

542
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:04,390
one boat
 

543
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:16,220
one boat
constantly looping around the outside

544
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,230

 

545
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,020

would be one stream that just keeps

546
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,030
would be one stream that just keeps
 

547
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,600
would be one stream that just keeps
going around and around I guess it would

548
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:23,610
going around and around I guess it would
 

549
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:48,140
going around and around I guess it would
have to be counterclockwise and I want

550
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,150
have to be counterclockwise and I want
 

551
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:58,160
have to be counterclockwise and I want
to see if I can actually I know I can

552
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,170
to see if I can actually I know I can
 

553
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,870
to see if I can actually I know I can
get the book only around our loop I want

554
00:25:59,870 --> 00:25:59,880
get the book only around our loop I want
 

555
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,690
get the book only around our loop I want
to see if I can actually reach the trees

556
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:02,700
to see if I can actually reach the trees
 

557
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,980
to see if I can actually reach the trees
from the boat the whole point of this

558
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:09,990
from the boat the whole point of this
 

559
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:18,310
from the boat the whole point of this
boat on again so that I can

560
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320
boat on again so that I can
 

561
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,390
boat on again so that I can
automatically go around the tree farm

562
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
automatically go around the tree farm
 

563
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:33,720
automatically go around the tree farm
and plant saplings that's too far

564
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:33,730

 

565
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,560

so this is going to work I need to raise

566
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:37,570
so this is going to work I need to raise
 

567
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:54,420
so this is going to work I need to raise
the boat I think at least one block

568
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,430

 

569
00:26:54,430 --> 00:27:10,950

[Applause]

570
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960

 

571
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:20,529

so I have it up one block

572
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:20,539

 

573
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:47,709

oh I see I want my boat move now that's

574
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:47,719
oh I see I want my boat move now that's
 

575
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:49,209
oh I see I want my boat move now that's
where it even with the ladders gone it

576
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:49,219
where it even with the ladders gone it
 

577
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:57,419
where it even with the ladders gone it
wouldn't let me move it

578
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:57,429

 

579
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:11,350

hey can I reach now just barely mmm

580
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,360

 

581
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:19,900

I think I'm going to have to move the

582
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:19,910
I think I'm going to have to move the
 

583
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:26,620
I think I'm going to have to move the
closer one block one block closer so

584
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:26,630
closer one block one block closer so
 

585
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:31,930
closer one block one block closer so
this is that like an ideal position the

586
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:31,940
this is that like an ideal position the
 

587
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,770
this is that like an ideal position the
boat will automatically take me around

588
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:34,780
boat will automatically take me around
 

589
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,900
boat will automatically take me around
I'll be able to plant the trees easily

590
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:37,910
I'll be able to plant the trees easily
 

591
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,270
I'll be able to plant the trees easily
that way and also I should be able to

592
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,280
that way and also I should be able to
 

593
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,549
that way and also I should be able to
apply bone meal as I'm going around I

594
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
apply bone meal as I'm going around I
 

595
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,230
apply bone meal as I'm going around I
might have to do that side thing so that

596
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:47,240
might have to do that side thing so that
 

597
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,700
might have to do that side thing so that
I can lower the stoppers by one so that

598
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:51,710
I can lower the stoppers by one so that
 

599
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,650
I can lower the stoppers by one so that
the tree is more likely to grow when you

600
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:53,660
the tree is more likely to grow when you
 

601
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:03,280
the tree is more likely to grow when you
apply bone meal because this isn't going

602
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,290
apply bone meal because this isn't going
 

603
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,480
apply bone meal because this isn't going
to work out too well if it takes 20

604
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,490
to work out too well if it takes 20
 

605
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:12,370
to work out too well if it takes 20
applications or so ideally I want it in

606
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:12,380
applications or so ideally I want it in
 

607
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:27,140
applications or so ideally I want it in
around five or less

608
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,150

 

609
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,330

so to get the signs where I want them

610
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:29,340
so to get the signs where I want them
 

611
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,130
so to get the signs where I want them
I'll probably have to put signs on top

612
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,140
I'll probably have to put signs on top
 

613
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,010
I'll probably have to put signs on top
of signs and hopefully it won't look too

614
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,020
of signs and hopefully it won't look too
 

615
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,150
of signs and hopefully it won't look too
ugly and I'll I'll mess around with it

616
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,160
ugly and I'll I'll mess around with it
 

617
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:47,600
ugly and I'll I'll mess around with it
to probably figure out something let me

618
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:47,610
to probably figure out something let me
 

619
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,620
to probably figure out something let me
know if you guys have any other ideas

620
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:48,630
know if you guys have any other ideas
 

621
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,680
know if you guys have any other ideas
and so all these collection points are

622
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:51,690
and so all these collection points are
 

623
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,040
and so all these collection points are
going to be hooked together and all the

624
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,050
going to be hooked together and all the
 

625
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,930
going to be hooked together and all the
saplings will be brought to one spot

626
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:56,940
saplings will be brought to one spot
 

627
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,930
saplings will be brought to one spot
hopefully Wow

628
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:01,940
hopefully Wow
 

629
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,230
hopefully Wow
but that one spot is not going to be the

630
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
but that one spot is not going to be the
 

631
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,000
but that one spot is not going to be the
main collection area I'll probably do it

632
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,010
main collection area I'll probably do it
 

633
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,330
main collection area I'll probably do it
in some other area just because I don't

634
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:11,340
in some other area just because I don't
 

635
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:21,830
in some other area just because I don't
want tree saplings in here I'm surprised

636
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
want tree saplings in here I'm surprised
 

637
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,930
want tree saplings in here I'm surprised
I haven't seen any wolves it usually

638
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:23,940
I haven't seen any wolves it usually
 

639
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:34,070
I haven't seen any wolves it usually
comes around but yeah that's the plan

640
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
comes around but yeah that's the plan
 

641
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,010
comes around but yeah that's the plan
and that's the episode thanks for

642
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,020
and that's the episode thanks for
 

643
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,700
and that's the episode thanks for
watching next one will be the 1 million

644
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:40,710
watching next one will be the 1 million
 

645
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,799
watching next one will be the 1 million
view special I think actually this one

646
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:45,809
view special I think actually this one
 

647
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,360
view special I think actually this one
