if we throw an ender pearl with no armor
 

137
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,949
if we throw an ender pearl with no armor
on we take two and a half hertz damage

on we take two and a half hertz damage
 

139

let's wait to heal up here it greatly
 

145
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,430
let's wait to heal up here it greatly
reduces that

146
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
reduces that
 

147
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,949
reduces that
um come on come on

148
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
um come on come on

155
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,110

i wonder why it's inconsistent

156
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120

 

157
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,550

one heart when i was doing it before i

158
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
one heart when i was doing it before i
 

159
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,350
one heart when i was doing it before i
thought i got one and a half hearts

160
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
thought i got one and a half hearts
 

161
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,390

half a heart

164
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840

 

165
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,110

anyway another way of reducing fall

166
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
anyway another way of reducing fall
 

167
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,229
anyway another way of reducing fall
damage is

168
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
damage is
 

169
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,070
damage is
using armor that has protection on

170
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
using armor that has protection on
 

171
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,750
using armor that has protection on
because that's like a general protection

172
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
because that's like a general protection
 

173
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,309
because that's like a general protection
from

174
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
from
 

175
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,430
from
things like fire and other things that

176
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
things like fire and other things that
 

177
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,630
things like fire and other things that
hurt you in the game

178
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
hurt you in the game
 

179
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,429
hurt you in the game
environmental damage and fall damage is

180
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
environmental damage and fall damage is
 

181
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,789
environmental damage and fall damage is
included in that

182
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
included in that
 

183
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,070
included in that
so we should take even less damage with

184
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
so we should take even less damage with
 

185
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,550
so we should take even less damage with
this on

186
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560

 

187
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,789

half a heart full heart that's about the

188
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
half a heart full heart that's about the
 

189
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,550
half a heart full heart that's about the
same

190
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
same
 

191
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,190
same
we need more i think we need more pieces

192
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
we need more i think we need more pieces
 

193
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,830
we need more i think we need more pieces
with protection for on

194
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
with protection for on
 

195
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,470
with protection for on
it's too bad we didn't get it on that

196
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
it's too bad we didn't get it on that
 

197
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,310
it's too bad we didn't get it on that
and then i think we could probably

198
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
and then i think we could probably
 

199
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,590
and then i think we could probably
travel around with

200
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
travel around with
 

201
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,550
travel around with
just about no damage at all with ender

202
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
just about no damage at all with ender
 

203
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,990
just about no damage at all with ender
pearls

204
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
pearls
 

205
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,350
pearls
which would be really quick

206
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360

 

207
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,469

uh with this xp pearl farm thing i have

208
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
uh with this xp pearl farm thing i have
 

209
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,110
uh with this xp pearl farm thing i have
here i'm

210
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
here i'm
 

211
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,150
here i'm
getting to level 50 in i think under 10

212
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
getting to level 50 in i think under 10
 

213
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,749
getting to level 50 in i think under 10
minutes no problem

214
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
minutes no problem
 

215
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,070
minutes no problem
uh it's it's actually pretty fun killing

216
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
uh it's it's actually pretty fun killing
 

217
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,790
uh it's it's actually pretty fun killing
them too

218
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
them too
 

219
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,990
them too
i like it instead of like going

220
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
i like it instead of like going
 

221
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,550
i like it instead of like going
afk the mob farm you're actually putting

222
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
afk the mob farm you're actually putting
 

223
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,510
afk the mob farm you're actually putting
work into it

224
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
work into it
 

225
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,830
work into it
getting levels with this one which makes

226
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
getting levels with this one which makes
 

227
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,070
getting levels with this one which makes
it a little more interesting

228
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
it a little more interesting
 

229
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,030
it a little more interesting
with the 1.2 patch coming out that's

230
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
with the 1.2 patch coming out that's
 

231
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,830
with the 1.2 patch coming out that's
going to change

232
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
going to change
 

233
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,550
going to change
things i think for me it comes out

234
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
things i think for me it comes out
 

235
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,950
things i think for me it comes out
tomorrow from what i hear

236
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
tomorrow from what i hear
 

237
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,230
tomorrow from what i hear
but when you're watching this it's

238
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
but when you're watching this it's
 

239
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,110
but when you're watching this it's
probably out already

240
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
probably out already
 

241
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,790
probably out already
and with that we get the new map heights

242
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
and with that we get the new map heights
 

243
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,430
and with that we get the new map heights
so they're doubling in height basically

244
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
so they're doubling in height basically
 

245
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,790
so they're doubling in height basically
which means all mob farms are pretty

246
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
which means all mob farms are pretty
 

247
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,230
which means all mob farms are pretty
much going to be

248
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
much going to be
 

249
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,670
much going to be
half as effective so

250
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
half as effective so
 

251
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,670
half as effective so
pretty much need double the space to get

252
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
pretty much need double the space to get
 

253
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,070
pretty much need double the space to get
the same amount of mobs to spawn

254
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
the same amount of mobs to spawn
 

255
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,590
the same amount of mobs to spawn
i'm guessing i don't know for sure

256
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
i'm guessing i don't know for sure
 

257
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,350
i'm guessing i don't know for sure
haven't tried it

258
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
haven't tried it
 

259
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,469
haven't tried it
but it's twice the amount of area the

260
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
but it's twice the amount of area the
 

261
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,430
but it's twice the amount of area the
game needs to check

262
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
game needs to check
 

263
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,990
game needs to check
to place mobs and that means it's twice

264
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
to place mobs and that means it's twice
 

265
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,990
to place mobs and that means it's twice
as likely it's going to cancel out and

266
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
as likely it's going to cancel out and
 

267
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,550
as likely it's going to cancel out and
not place any so this will probably be

268
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
not place any so this will probably be
 

269
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,670
not place any so this will probably be
half as effective when that comes out

270
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
half as effective when that comes out
 

271
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,590
half as effective when that comes out
don't you knock me off

272
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600

 

273
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,029

um anyway we're not gonna do another end

274
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
um anyway we're not gonna do another end

we might go check out those mountains

292
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
we might go check out those mountains
 

293
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,990
we might go check out those mountains

first i want to do sort of a speed test

300
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
first i want to do sort of a speed test
 

301
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,510
first i want to do sort of a speed test
on the ground here

302
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
on the ground here
 

303
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,350
on the ground here
see how quick we can get around i have

304
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
see how quick we can get around i have
 

305
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,270
see how quick we can get around i have
the feather falling

306
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
the feather falling
 

307
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,990
the feather falling
and protection 3 on

308
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
and protection 3 on
 

309
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,909
and protection 3 on
as you can see these don't take damage

310
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
as you can see these don't take damage
 

311
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,029
as you can see these don't take damage
from the fall damage

312
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
from the fall damage
 

313
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,430
from the fall damage
like the armor doesn't wear out from it

314
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
like the armor doesn't wear out from it
 

315
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,029
like the armor doesn't wear out from it
so

316
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
so
 

317
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,670
so
it can last forever basically if we're

318
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
it can last forever basically if we're
 

319
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,589
it can last forever basically if we're
for careful

320
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
for careful
 

321
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,110
for careful
getting ahead of myself that's pretty

322
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
getting ahead of myself that's pretty
 

323
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,029
getting ahead of myself that's pretty
quick

324
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
quick
 

325
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,309
quick
i should probably throw it a little bit

326
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
i should probably throw it a little bit
 

327
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,350
i should probably throw it a little bit
higher though

328
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360

 

329
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,550

yeah it's cool so should be fun

330
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
yeah it's cool so should be fun
 

331
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,830
yeah it's cool so should be fun
exploring the mountains with these um

332
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840

 

333
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,390

and i guess we'll get one of these going

334
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
and i guess we'll get one of these going
 

335
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,390
and i guess we'll get one of these going
to start off with

336
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
to start off with
 

337
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,629
to start off with
probably need some food so the patch is

338
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
probably need some food so the patch is
 

339
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,469
probably need some food so the patch is
coming out tomorrow

iron farming that is
 

355
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,629
iron farming that is
going to be ridiculous if they allow

going to be ridiculous if they allow
 

357
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,830
going to be ridiculous if they allow
that to pass

358
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840

 

359

375
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,150
i'll probably skip using it for
a long time and hope they remove it

376
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
a long time and hope they remove it
 

377
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,589
a long time and hope they remove it
i'm not sure they might have removed it

378
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
i'm not sure they might have removed it
 

379
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,230
i'm not sure they might have removed it
already

just because it feels cheap to me and it
 

385
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,430
just because it feels cheap to me and it
would wreck it my enjoyment of the game

so we will have a mob system that works
 

439
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,470

469
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,550
peek up over here and then we'll head
back and probably start building

470
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560

think with the new patches they seem to
 

489
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,910
think with the new patches they seem to
just withhold the features in older

worlds
 

493
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,350

happen with these guys when 1.2 comes
 

543
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,230
happen with these guys when 1.2 comes
out

544
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240

 

545
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,829

548
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
haven't checked on them in so long
 

549
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,269
haven't checked on them in so long
need to work on that again i'm actually

550
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
need to work on that again i'm actually
 

551
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,350
need to work on that again i'm actually
surprised i've only found one village in

552
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
surprised i've only found one village in
 

553
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,030
surprised i've only found one village in
my world so far because i've covered a

554
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
my world so far because i've covered a
 

555
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,230
my world so far because i've covered a
lot of ground

556
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
lot of ground
 

557
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,990
lot of ground
really anyway

558
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
really anyway
 

559
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,829

first thing we're going to do i'm going
 

561
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,430
first thing we're going to do i'm going
to

562
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
to
 

563
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,670
to
install the lighting under our track

564
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
install the lighting under our track
 

565
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,230
install the lighting under our track
here

566
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240

 

567
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,670

so that we don't get spider spawns and

568
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
so that we don't get spider spawns and
 

569
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,590
so that we don't get spider spawns and
then i'm going to cover it up with the

570
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
then i'm going to cover it up with the
 

571
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,069
then i'm going to cover it up with the
has

572
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
has
 

573
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,110
has
with the sandstone slabs uh if we have

574
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
with the sandstone slabs uh if we have
 

575
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,069
with the sandstone slabs uh if we have
any carts get

576
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
any carts get
 

577
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,670
any carts get
stuck in there i can always get them out

578
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
stuck in there i can always get them out
 

579
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,509
stuck in there i can always get them out
using furnace minecarts so i'm not too

580
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
using furnace minecarts so i'm not too
 

581
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,389
using furnace minecarts so i'm not too
worried

582
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
worried
 

583
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,629
worried
about covering it up

584
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
about covering it up
 

585
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,030
about covering it up
yeah thinking maybe adding one of those

586
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
yeah thinking maybe adding one of those
 

587
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,949
yeah thinking maybe adding one of those
bread makers down here for the cows

588
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
bread makers down here for the cows
 

589
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,949
bread makers down here for the cows
but anyway i'll do this first and we'll

590
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
but anyway i'll do this first and we'll
 

591
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,269
but anyway i'll do this first and we'll
see how it goes

592
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
see how it goes
 

593
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,150
see how it goes
and this is the lighting is just so that

594
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
and this is the lighting is just so that
 

595
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,509
and this is the lighting is just so that
don't get spiders spawning under the

596
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
don't get spiders spawning under the
 

597
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,710
don't get spiders spawning under the
half slabs i don't know if i said that

598
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
half slabs i don't know if i said that
 

599
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,310
half slabs i don't know if i said that
already

600
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
already
 

601
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,790
already
and i can't use or i shouldn't use

602
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
and i can't use or i shouldn't use
 

603
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,629
and i can't use or i shouldn't use
torches for it because we'll get the

604
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
torches for it because we'll get the
 

605
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,750
torches for it because we'll get the
particle effects

606
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
particle effects
 

607
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,150
particle effects
through the half slabs i think

608
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
through the half slabs i think
 

609
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,269
through the half slabs i think
yeah i'm getting particles

610
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279

 

611
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,069

not seeing them though maybe we won't

612
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079

 

613
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,389

kind of thought they would

614
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399

 

615
00:13:46,399 --> 00:14:54,790

anyway okay here i go

616
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800

 

617
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,150

okay i got that all covered now um i've

618
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
okay i got that all covered now um i've
 

619
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,350
okay i got that all covered now um i've
noticed something here though

620
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
noticed something here though
 

621
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,590
noticed something here though
i wanted to show you like three of these

622
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
i wanted to show you like three of these
 

623
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,030
i wanted to show you like three of these
guys going around at once

624
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
guys going around at once
 

625
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,310
guys going around at once
but make that four

626
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
but make that four
 

627
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,430
but make that four
having a little issue with

628
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
having a little issue with
 

629
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,629
having a little issue with
loading them into the minecarts here

630
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
loading them into the minecarts here
 

631
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,990
loading them into the minecarts here
although it might work now that we have

632
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
although it might work now that we have
 

633
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,990
although it might work now that we have
a fourth but

634
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
a fourth but
 

635
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,269
a fourth but
uh let's see if

636
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
uh let's see if
 

637
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,189
uh let's see if
oh we did we got one

638
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
oh we did we got one
 

639
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,990
oh we did we got one
okay we got one let's see if we can get

640
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
okay we got one let's see if we can get
 

641
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,189
okay we got one let's see if we can get
another

642
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199

 

643
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,829

yeah so they're kind of forcing each

644
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
yeah so they're kind of forcing each
 

645
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,829
yeah so they're kind of forcing each
other into specific corners

646
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
other into specific corners
 

647
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,990
other into specific corners
like uh this guy is in this uh

648
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
like uh this guy is in this uh
 

649
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,829
like uh this guy is in this uh
this corner here and then the other ones

650
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
this corner here and then the other ones
 

651
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,430
this corner here and then the other ones
are in that corner there

652
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
are in that corner there
 

653
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,310
are in that corner there
so minecart won't pick them up from this

654
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
so minecart won't pick them up from this
 

655
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,189
so minecart won't pick them up from this
corner

656
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199

 

657
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,990

which means i have to be careful that

658
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
which means i have to be careful that
 

659
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,310
which means i have to be careful that
when i get the setup

660
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
when i get the setup
 

661
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,550
when i get the setup
that

662
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560

 

663
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,910

like i might not be able to grab them

664
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
like i might not be able to grab them
 

665
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,910
like i might not be able to grab them
from the corners

666
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
from the corners
 

667
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,509
from the corners
because they throw each other off like

668
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
because they throw each other off like
 

669
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,590
because they throw each other off like
that

670
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
that
 

671
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,829
that
anyway where is he

672
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839

679
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,710
i love it
okay so i am tempted to work on that

680
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
okay so i am tempted to work on that
 

681
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,150
okay so i am tempted to work on that
today i don't know how to do it

682
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
today i don't know how to do it
 

683
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,749
today i don't know how to do it
at the moment i'll have to think about

684
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
at the moment i'll have to think about
 

685
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,269
at the moment i'll have to think about
it a bit more

686
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
it a bit more
 

687
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,470
it a bit more
i was kind of thinking of

688
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
i was kind of thinking of
 

689
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,990
i was kind of thinking of
maybe fixing this in the middle here

690
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
maybe fixing this in the middle here
 

691
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,910
maybe fixing this in the middle here
um i'm not sure how i should light this

692
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
um i'm not sure how i should light this
 

693
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,710
um i'm not sure how i should light this
middle part it's really dark

694
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
middle part it's really dark
 

695
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,269
middle part it's really dark
i either have to put something here like

696
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
i either have to put something here like
 

697
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,150
i either have to put something here like
some kind of

698
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
some kind of
 

699
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,230
some kind of
object that comes out of the ground or i

700
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
object that comes out of the ground or i
 

701
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,310
object that comes out of the ground or i
would maybe

702
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
would maybe
 

703
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,150
would maybe
make a chandelier in the ceiling

704
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
make a chandelier in the ceiling
 

705
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,710
make a chandelier in the ceiling
that comes down and lights the middle

706
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
that comes down and lights the middle
 

707
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,230
that comes down and lights the middle
not sure yet

708
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
not sure yet
 

709
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,069
not sure yet
um need some more half slabs

710
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
um need some more half slabs
 

711
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,270
um need some more half slabs
running out of sound quick again

712
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
running out of sound quick again
 

713
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,549
running out of sound quick again
because i've been converting it to

714
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
because i've been converting it to
 

715
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,029
because i've been converting it to
sandstone

716
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
sandstone
 

717
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,470
sandstone
i think what i'll do here i'm going to

718
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
i think what i'll do here i'm going to
 

719
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,110
i think what i'll do here i'm going to
try to do kind of what dot cam does

720
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
try to do kind of what dot cam does
 

721
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,590
try to do kind of what dot cam does
with his rails i like the look of it

722
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
with his rails i like the look of it
 

723
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,429
with his rails i like the look of it
uh where he has the glass

724
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439

 

725
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,230

all along

726
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240

 

727
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,710

and then he puts half slabs on top

728
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720

 

729
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,909

i think that's how he does it

730
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919

 

731
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,070

you can see down still

732
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
you can see down still
 

733
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:56,789
you can see down still
and how does it look over here hmm

734
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799

 

735
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,669

it's an idea i don't know needs more

736
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
it's an idea i don't know needs more
 

737
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,070
it's an idea i don't know needs more
light

738
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
light
 

739
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,230
light
for sure

740
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240

 

741
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:12,230

um i might try it without the glass

742
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240

 

743
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,909

okay i was thinking about it and i

744
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
okay i was thinking about it and i
 

745
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,430
okay i was thinking about it and i
probably shouldn't put a railing there

746
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
probably shouldn't put a railing there
 

747
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,549
probably shouldn't put a railing there
even though

748
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
even though
 

749
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,029
even though
i do want a railing just because it's

750
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
i do want a railing just because it's
 

751
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,029
i do want a railing just because it's
gonna block the cow face even more

752
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
gonna block the cow face even more
 

753
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,230
gonna block the cow face even more
if uh it goes up at the end there

754
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
if uh it goes up at the end there
 

755
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,750
if uh it goes up at the end there
and even the way i have it right now

756
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
and even the way i have it right now
 

757
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,230
and even the way i have it right now
it's blocked quite a bit so i might

758
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
it's blocked quite a bit so i might
 

759
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,070
it's blocked quite a bit so i might
try lower the center part here

760
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
try lower the center part here
 

761
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,510
try lower the center part here
a little bit kind of make a semi circle

762
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
a little bit kind of make a semi circle
 

763
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,029
a little bit kind of make a semi circle
that's lowered

764
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
that's lowered
 

765
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,270
that's lowered
and see how that turns out and if i do

766
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
and see how that turns out and if i do
 

767
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,630
and see how that turns out and if i do
that i could probably find a

768
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
that i could probably find a
 

769
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,029
that i could probably find a
way to hide some glowstone or lava or

770
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
way to hide some glowstone or lava or
 

771
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,110
way to hide some glowstone or lava or
something into it as well

772
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
something into it as well
 

773
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,630
something into it as well
probably glowstone we got wood around

774
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
probably glowstone we got wood around
 

775
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,110
probably glowstone we got wood around
here

776
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120

 

777
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,669

so i'm going to do that the very center

778
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
so i'm going to do that the very center
 

779
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,549
so i'm going to do that the very center
would be

780
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
would be
 

781
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,630
would be
over here

782
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
over here
 

783
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,310
over here
and i haven't forgotten about your

784
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
and i haven't forgotten about your
 

785
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,070
and i haven't forgotten about your
suggestions on what i should do about

786
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
suggestions on what i should do about
 

787
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,830
suggestions on what i should do about
the frame

788
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
the frame
 

789
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,430
the frame
and it being uncentered because it's two

790
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
and it being uncentered because it's two
 

791
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,870
and it being uncentered because it's two
blocks there one block there

792
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
blocks there one block there
 

793
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,950
blocks there one block there
and a lot of people said just to stretch

794
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
and a lot of people said just to stretch
 

795
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,990
and a lot of people said just to stretch
it

796
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
it
 

797
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,310
it
copy the middle the middle pixels and

798
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
copy the middle the middle pixels and
 

799
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,430
copy the middle the middle pixels and
and duplicate them an extra line in so i

800
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440
and duplicate them an extra line in so i
 

801
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,750
and duplicate them an extra line in so i
think

802
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
think
 

803
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,029
think
i'll try that today hopefully and

804
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
i'll try that today hopefully and
 

805
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,950
i'll try that today hopefully and
i'll copy this line here and stretch it

806
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
i'll copy this line here and stretch it
 

807
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,150
i'll copy this line here and stretch it
and we'll see how it looks

808
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160

 

809
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,270

all right let me know what you guys

810
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
all right let me know what you guys
 

811
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,669
all right let me know what you guys
think of this i did uh i did something

812
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
think of this i did uh i did something
 

813
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,710
think of this i did uh i did something
here

814
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
here
 

815
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,830
here
hopefully something good i lowered the

816
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
hopefully something good i lowered the
 

817
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,190
hopefully something good i lowered the
middle

818
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
middle
 

819
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,590
middle
i was able to sneak in some lighting

820
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
i was able to sneak in some lighting
 

821
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,789
i was able to sneak in some lighting
that way

822
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
that way
 

823
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,310
that way
so it looks a lot better and i also have

824
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
so it looks a lot better and i also have
 

825
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,549
so it looks a lot better and i also have
some over here

826
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
some over here
 

827
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,029
some over here
it's kind of kind of expands out

828
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
it's kind of kind of expands out
 

829
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,789
it's kind of kind of expands out
which i like i might try put some fences

830
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:56,799
which i like i might try put some fences
 

831
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,070
which i like i might try put some fences
here and

832
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
here and
 

833
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,430
here and
here

834
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440

 

835
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,190

i think my sound quit oh well

836
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
i think my sound quit oh well
 

837
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,870
i think my sound quit oh well
um you can see a lot more of the picture

838
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
um you can see a lot more of the picture
 

839
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,190
um you can see a lot more of the picture
this way

840
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
this way
 

841
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,350
this way
and yeah there's still no railing

842
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
and yeah there's still no railing
 

843
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,270
and yeah there's still no railing
here um let's take a look from

844
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280

 

845
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,789

distance so

846
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
distance so
 

847
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,190
distance so
it's still rough below that but i should

848
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
it's still rough below that but i should
 

849
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,230
it's still rough below that but i should
be able to

850
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
be able to
 

851
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,029
be able to
clean that up too sometime soon and i'd

852
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
clean that up too sometime soon and i'd
 

853
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,990
clean that up too sometime soon and i'd
probably put another

854
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
probably put another
 

855
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,870
probably put another
light hidden somewhere around there in

856
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,880
light hidden somewhere around there in
 

857
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,310
light hidden somewhere around there in
the middle so i don't have that dark

858
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
the middle so i don't have that dark
 

859
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,110
the middle so i don't have that dark
spot

860
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
spot
 

861
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,870
spot
over there um i don't know has a little

862
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
over there um i don't know has a little
 

863
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,950
over there um i don't know has a little
more character than it just being

864
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
more character than it just being
 

865
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,390
more character than it just being
pure flat like it was and if i go down

866
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
pure flat like it was and if i go down
 

867
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,909
pure flat like it was and if i go down
the stairs like this i can still

868
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
the stairs like this i can still
 

869
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,590
the stairs like this i can still
continue and run up

870
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
continue and run up
 

871
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,990
continue and run up
to the other side which is good it has a

872
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
to the other side which is good it has a
 

873
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,230
to the other side which is good it has a
good flow to it

874
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
good flow to it
 

875
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,510
good flow to it
um maybe thinking of putting

876
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
um maybe thinking of putting
 

877
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,590
um maybe thinking of putting
fences here and just seeing how that

878
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
fences here and just seeing how that
 

879
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,350
fences here and just seeing how that
would look probably

880
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
would look probably
 

881
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,110
would look probably
won't look very good though

882
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120

 

883
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:14,830

yeah it's not gonna look good i know it

884
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:14,840

 

885
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,230

already

886
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240

 

887
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,230

fences allow you to see through still

888
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
fences allow you to see through still
 

889
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,470
fences allow you to see through still
which is nice

890
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
which is nice
 

891
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,830
which is nice
and you won't walk off but they don't

892
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
and you won't walk off but they don't
 

893
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,830
and you won't walk off but they don't
really connect to half slabs so

894
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
really connect to half slabs so
 

895
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:35,830
really connect to half slabs so
i don't know let's look from over here

896
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840

 

897
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,990

yeah i don't know something to think

898
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
yeah i don't know something to think
 

899
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,750
yeah i don't know something to think
about i guess

900
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760

 

901
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,270

okay so now i'm just going to stretch

902
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
okay so now i'm just going to stretch
 

903
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,270
okay so now i'm just going to stretch
that cow face and i'll probably get rid

904
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
that cow face and i'll probably get rid
 

905
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,110
that cow face and i'll probably get rid
of these

906
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
of these
 

907
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,430
of these
and then we'll see how it looks

908
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440

 

909
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,110

you know what it actually turned out

910
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
you know what it actually turned out
 

911
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,510
you know what it actually turned out
pretty good here i like it

912
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
pretty good here i like it
 

913
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,510
pretty good here i like it
i was worried when i changed it i would

914
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
i was worried when i changed it i would
 

915
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,950
i was worried when i changed it i would
have to change it back because it would

916
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
have to change it back because it would
 

917
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,070
have to change it back because it would
look a little strange

918
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
look a little strange
 

919
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,270
look a little strange
but it just looks like a fat cow

920
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280
but it just looks like a fat cow
 

921
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,909
but it just looks like a fat cow
which nothing wrong with that nothing

922
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
which nothing wrong with that nothing
 

923
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,110
which nothing wrong with that nothing
wrong with fat towels

924
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
wrong with fat towels
 

925
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,909
wrong with fat towels
so i think we're gonna keep it good

926
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
so i think we're gonna keep it good
 

927
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,990
so i think we're gonna keep it good
suggestion guys i wouldn't have tried it

928
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
suggestion guys i wouldn't have tried it
 

929
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,710
suggestion guys i wouldn't have tried it
with if you didn't suggest it

930
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
with if you didn't suggest it
 

931
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,510
with if you didn't suggest it
and now it's symmetrical yay

932
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520

 

933
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,510

oh it just just makes me feel a lot

934
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
oh it just just makes me feel a lot
 

935
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,830
oh it just just makes me feel a lot
better

936
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840

 

937
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,149

um i was gonna try this too

938
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
um i was gonna try this too
 

939
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,029
um i was gonna try this too
is that weird is that weird if i do that

940
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,039
is that weird is that weird if i do that
 

941
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,430
is that weird is that weird if i do that
i don't know i like to try to give

942
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
i don't know i like to try to give
 

943
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,549
i don't know i like to try to give
things more character

944
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
things more character
 

945
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,149
things more character
yeah i'll try it for a while um

946
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159

 

947
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,350

one thing i was thinking

948
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360

 

949
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,750

1.2 is actually out for me right now i'm

950
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,760
1.2 is actually out for me right now i'm
 

951
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,590
1.2 is actually out for me right now i'm
very tempted to just

952
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
very tempted to just
 

953
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,230
very tempted to just
quit recording here and go play with it

954
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
quit recording here and go play with it
 

955
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,630
quit recording here and go play with it
but

956
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
but
 

957
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,190
but
i have the day off tomorrow so that's

958
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
i have the day off tomorrow so that's
 

959
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,590
i have the day off tomorrow so that's
what i will be doing tomorrow probably

960
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
what i will be doing tomorrow probably
 

961
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,950
what i will be doing tomorrow probably
quite a bit but i was thinking

962
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
quite a bit but i was thinking
 

963
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,190
quite a bit but i was thinking
if i do that fence thing i might do the

964
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
if i do that fence thing i might do the
 

965
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,070
if i do that fence thing i might do the
upside down

966
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
upside down
 

967
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,149
upside down
wooden stairs i think there's upside

968
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
wooden stairs i think there's upside
 

969
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,990
wooden stairs i think there's upside
down wooden ones i hope

970
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
down wooden ones i hope
 

971
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,310
down wooden ones i hope
and put them underneath the fence and

972
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
and put them underneath the fence and
 

973
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,909
and put them underneath the fence and
it'll be like an overhang

974
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
it'll be like an overhang
 

975
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,789
it'll be like an overhang
that might look good the fence didn't

976
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
that might look good the fence didn't
 

977
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,470
that might look good the fence didn't
block out too much vision either so

978
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
block out too much vision either so
 

979
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,430
block out too much vision either so
just an idea and i'll round out other

980
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
just an idea and i'll round out other
 

981
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,990
just an idea and i'll round out other
things like over here for example

982
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
things like over here for example
 

983
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,990
things like over here for example
i wanted to mimic the bottom where it

984
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
i wanted to mimic the bottom where it
 

985
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,750
i wanted to mimic the bottom where it
goes down up down

986
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
goes down up down
 

987
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,029
goes down up down
up but you know it looks really chunky

988
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
up but you know it looks really chunky
 

989
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,990
up but you know it looks really chunky
compared to

990
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
compared to
 

991
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,110
compared to
the lower part i'll be able to smooth

992
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
the lower part i'll be able to smooth
 

993
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,269
the lower part i'll be able to smooth
that out in 1.2

994
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
that out in 1.2
 

995
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,310
that out in 1.2
which is good it's going to be an

996
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
which is good it's going to be an
 

997
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,269
which is good it's going to be an
awesome patch

998
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
awesome patch
 

999
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,029
awesome patch
looking forward to playing it um

1000
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
looking forward to playing it um
 

1001
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,110
looking forward to playing it um
as far as the tree farm goes i don't

1002
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
as far as the tree farm goes i don't
 

1003
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,269
as far as the tree farm goes i don't
think i'm going to expand it anymore

1004
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279

 

1005
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,789

i kind of wish i would have added a

1006
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
i kind of wish i would have added a
 

1007
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,029
i kind of wish i would have added a
little more variety to it

1008
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
little more variety to it
 

1009
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,789
little more variety to it
but i didn't expect it to get this big

1010
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
but i didn't expect it to get this big
 

1011
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,230
but i didn't expect it to get this big
to be honest it's huge

1012
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
to be honest it's huge
 

1013
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,549
to be honest it's huge
so i'll just keep the walkway around and

1014
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
so i'll just keep the walkway around and
 

1015
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,630
so i'll just keep the walkway around and
then for the newer donors i'll try think

1016
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
then for the newer donors i'll try think
 

1017
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,430
then for the newer donors i'll try think
of something else we can do i have a few

1018
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
of something else we can do i have a few
 

1019
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,789
of something else we can do i have a few
few ideas but might be a while before i

1020
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
few ideas but might be a while before i
 

1021
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,070
few ideas but might be a while before i
get around to doing them

1022
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080

1067
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,710

i have to think about it

1068
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
i have to think about it
 

1069
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,230
i have to think about it
actually i just checked the time of this

1070
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
actually i just checked the time of this
 

1071
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,149
actually i just checked the time of this
episode and it's getting to that point

1072
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
episode and it's getting to that point
 

1073
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,909
episode and it's getting to that point
where we should probably wrap it up

1074
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
where we should probably wrap it up
 

1075
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,230
where we should probably wrap it up
so before we do i just want to do one

1076
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
so before we do i just want to do one
 

1077

last thing here
with the snow golems i was trying to

1080
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
with the snow golems i was trying to
 

1081
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,110
with the snow golems i was trying to
find a quicker way of harvesting snow

1082
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120

 

1083
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,190

because as you know if you click you get

1084
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
because as you know if you click you get
 

1085
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,110
because as you know if you click you get
two snowballs so if you

1086
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
two snowballs so if you
 

1087
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,070
two snowballs so if you
rapidly click you get snowballs pretty

1088
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
rapidly click you get snowballs pretty
 

1089
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,630
rapidly click you get snowballs pretty
quick

1090
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640
quick
 

1091
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,269
quick
but i recently wore out a mouse from

1092
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
but i recently wore out a mouse from
 

1093
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,909
but i recently wore out a mouse from
clicking so much and i would like to

1094
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:57,919
clicking so much and i would like to
 

1095
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,710
clicking so much and i would like to
avoid clicking more than i need to if

1096
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
avoid clicking more than i need to if
 

1097
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,510
avoid clicking more than i need to if
possible

1098
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520

 

1099
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,590

so i tried harvesting the snow from a

1100
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
so i tried harvesting the snow from a
 

1101

so i tried harvesting the snow from a
distance you know how you can

1102
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
distance you know how you can
 

1103
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,390
distance you know how you can
break blocks quicker usually doing that

1104
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,400
break blocks quicker usually doing that
 

1105
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,149
break blocks quicker usually doing that
doesn't work with snow

1106
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159

guys
 

1113
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,750
guys
side by side so that we could maybe

1114
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:21,760
side by side so that we could maybe
 

1115
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,669
side by side so that we could maybe
aim for the very corner and

1116
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
aim for the very corner and
 

1117
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,990
aim for the very corner and
as this one disappears maybe we'll get

1118
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
as this one disappears maybe we'll get
 

1119
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,110
as this one disappears maybe we'll get
that one and it'll

1120
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
that one and it'll
 

1121
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,230
that one and it'll
speed it up or something but

1122
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
speed it up or something but
 

1123
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,510
speed it up or something but
it doesn't happen so

1124
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520

1127
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,110
i don't know i just know there's a
quicker way of doing it can't figure it

1128
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
quicker way of doing it can't figure it
 

1129
