and at the bottom of the floating

218
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
and at the bottom of the floating
 

219
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,070
and at the bottom of the floating
islands i think it'd be cool to have

islands i think it'd be cool to have
 

221
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,189
islands i think it'd be cool to have
vines but

231
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,670

and just see how they work because i'm

232
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
and just see how they work because i'm
 

233
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,830
and just see how they work because i'm
not too familiar with them i've never

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
not too familiar with them i've never
 

235
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,870
not too familiar with them i've never

used them for anything because

266
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
used them for anything because
 

267
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,870
used them for anything because
not only do they look pretty good

268
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880

 

269
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,310

ladders and lots of other stuff so it's

284
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
ladders and lots of other stuff so it's
 

285
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,990

a really useful block and i've never

a really useful block and i've never
 

287
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,749
a really useful block and i've never
really used it before but

288
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
really used it before but
 

289
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,909
really used it before but
i was looking at the wiki and it says uh

290
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
i was looking at the wiki and it says uh
 

291
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,350
i was looking at the wiki and it says uh
one of the reasons i was afraid of them

292
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
one of the reasons i was afraid of them
 

293
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,790
one of the reasons i was afraid of them
before is because they spread like

294
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
before is because they spread like
 

295
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,150
before is because they spread like
wildfire

296
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
wildfire
 

297
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,830
wildfire
and apparently they still do spread

298
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
and apparently they still do spread
 

299
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,430

according to the wiki
 

301
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,909
according to the wiki
um it says they can spread left right

302
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
um it says they can spread left right
 

303
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,029
um it says they can spread left right
i think up and obviously down i know

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
four vines in the area they will be able
 

333
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,950
four vines in the area they will be able
to spread i don't know

334

to spread i don't know
 

335
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,589
to spread i don't know
what area it means like how

336
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599

 

337
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,749

what kind of area checks but

338
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759

 

339
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,469

should be able to spread up i think left

340
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
should be able to spread up i think left
 

341
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,029
should be able to spread up i think left
and right

342
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
and right
 

343
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,749
and right
and obviously down i don't know if like

344
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
and obviously down i don't know if like
 

345
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,189
and obviously down i don't know if like
that vine can spread

346
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
that vine can spread
 

347
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,110
that vine can spread
to the other side of this block or

348
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
to the other side of this block or
 

349
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,950
to the other side of this block or
anything like that

350
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
anything like that
 

351
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,270
anything like that
it's one thing i'm very interested in

352
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
it's one thing i'm very interested in
 

353
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,510
it's one thing i'm very interested in
and i don't really know what kind of

354
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
and i don't really know what kind of
 

355
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,749
and i don't really know what kind of
lighting conditions are required either

356
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
lighting conditions are required either
 

357
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,830
lighting conditions are required either
so we're going to set up a dark room

358
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
so we're going to set up a dark room
 

359
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,469
so we're going to set up a dark room
here and put some in

360
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479

 

361
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,909

just to get a another idea of that

362
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
just to get a another idea of that
 

363
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,749
just to get a another idea of that
give it all these torches make it dark

364
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
give it all these torches make it dark
 

365
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,270
give it all these torches make it dark
oh we missed one oh yeah nice and dark

366
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
oh we missed one oh yeah nice and dark
 

367
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,710
oh we missed one oh yeah nice and dark
so

368
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
so
 

369
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,029
so
light level zero perfect

370
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039

 

371
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,350

okay so we'll see how those ones grow

372
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
okay so we'll see how those ones grow
 

373
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,710
okay so we'll see how those ones grow
and then also

374
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
and then also
 

375
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,710
and then also
this is the most important test what

376
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
this is the most important test what
 

377
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,950
this is the most important test what
we're about to do here this is uh

378
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
we're about to do here this is uh
 

379
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,230
we're about to do here this is uh
this is how i'm going to control the

380
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
this is how i'm going to control the
 

381
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,230
this is how i'm going to control the
length of them if this works i hope it

382
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
length of them if this works i hope it
 

383
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,909
length of them if this works i hope it
does

384
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
does
 

385
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,749
does
i'm going to put a vine

386
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759

 

387
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,230

in the middle of this with blocks on all

388
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
in the middle of this with blocks on all
 

389
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,790
in the middle of this with blocks on all
six sides

390
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
six sides
 

391
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,189
six sides
like that and my idea is

392
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199

 

393
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,510

have it so when the vines reach a

394
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
have it so when the vines reach a
 

395
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,749
have it so when the vines reach a
certain length whatever length we want

396
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759

 

397
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,950

make it so that they will be within rain

398
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
make it so that they will be within rain
 

399
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,430
make it so that they will be within rain
excuse me range of lava or fire and

400
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
excuse me range of lava or fire and
 

401
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,869
excuse me range of lava or fire and
catch fire

402
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
catch fire
 

403
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,150
catch fire
and then they'll burn up a ways

404
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
and then they'll burn up a ways
 

405
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,390
and then they'll burn up a ways
and then they'll regrow and keep getting

406
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
and then they'll regrow and keep getting
 

407
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,510
and then they'll regrow and keep getting
longer and then

408
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
longer and then
 

409
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,510
longer and then
get shorter kind of like a way of giving

410
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
get shorter kind of like a way of giving
 

411
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,709
get shorter kind of like a way of giving
it a haircut

412
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
it a haircut
 

413
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,670
it a haircut
every so often uh but the thing i'm

414
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
every so often uh but the thing i'm
 

415
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,550
every so often uh but the thing i'm
concerned about

416
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
concerned about
 

417
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,029
concerned about
obviously is that the vines will burn up

418
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
obviously is that the vines will burn up
 

419
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,389
obviously is that the vines will burn up
completely

420
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
completely
 

421
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,909
completely
which would suck because then you would

422
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
which would suck because then you would
 

423
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,590
which would suck because then you would
have to manually place them again

424
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
have to manually place them again
 

425
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,710
have to manually place them again
which i definitely don't want so

426
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
which i definitely don't want so
 

427
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,990
which i definitely don't want so
if i can hide them

428
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000

 

429
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,150

like this and have them spread to the

430
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
like this and have them spread to the
 

431
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,670
like this and have them spread to the
outside

432
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
outside
 

433
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,870
outside
uh it'll make it so it's impossible for

434
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
uh it'll make it so it's impossible for
 

435
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,350
uh it'll make it so it's impossible for
the fire to burn it up but yet they'll

436
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
the fire to burn it up but yet they'll
 

437
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,870
the fire to burn it up but yet they'll
they'll always be at least one vine

438
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
they'll always be at least one vine
 

439
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,470
they'll always be at least one vine
there to

440
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
there to
 

441
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,990
there to
to renew the ones that possibly burn up

442
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
to renew the ones that possibly burn up
 

443
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,030
to renew the ones that possibly burn up
type thing

444
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040

 

445
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,070

okay so i think uh

446
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
okay so i think uh
 

447
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,990
okay so i think uh
i think that's all i want to test so

448
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
i think that's all i want to test so
 

449
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,509
i think that's all i want to test so
we're gonna watch these for a bit i

450
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
we're gonna watch these for a bit i
 

451
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,590
we're gonna watch these for a bit i
might set up a few more

452
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
might set up a few more
 

453
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,509
might set up a few more
examples here too while i wait

454
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519

 

455
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,550

and we're back here so

456
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
and we're back here so
 

457
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,870
and we're back here so
i've left the game running for over an

458
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
i've left the game running for over an
 

459
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,070
i've left the game running for over an
hour

460
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
hour
 

461
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,030
hour
while i sit in a little hole type thing

462
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
while i sit in a little hole type thing
 

463
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,230
while i sit in a little hole type thing
and i've come back

464
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
and i've come back
 

465
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,269
and i've come back
and now i'm trying to make

466
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
and now i'm trying to make
 

467
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,030
and now i'm trying to make
sense of everything here and i'm not

468
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
sense of everything here and i'm not
 

469
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,030
sense of everything here and i'm not
didn't quite figure out as much as i had

470
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
didn't quite figure out as much as i had
 

471
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,790
didn't quite figure out as much as i had
hoped but i did learn a few things from

472
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
hoped but i did learn a few things from
 

473
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,389
hoped but i did learn a few things from
this

474
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
this
 

475
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,990
this
so the one that was here has grown

476
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
so the one that was here has grown
 

477
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,190
so the one that was here has grown
uh it's able to pass around corners like

478
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
uh it's able to pass around corners like
 

479
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,389
uh it's able to pass around corners like
that

480
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
that
 

481
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,310
that
and it's actually made it all the way to

482
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
and it's actually made it all the way to
 

483
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,870
and it's actually made it all the way to
the back here even

484
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
the back here even
 

485
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,030
the back here even
so i'm guessing it went to the side and

486
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
so i'm guessing it went to the side and
 

487
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,870
so i'm guessing it went to the side and
maybe drew up and then

488
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
maybe drew up and then
 

489
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,550
maybe drew up and then
to the side again or something i don't

490
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
to the side again or something i don't
 

491
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,710
to the side again or something i don't
know but it has

492
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
know but it has
 

493
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,470
know but it has
reached the limit it seems because this

494
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
reached the limit it seems because this
 

495
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,310
reached the limit it seems because this
one's been like this for a long time and

496
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
one's been like this for a long time and
 

497
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,389
one's been like this for a long time and
it's not even growing down here

498
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
it's not even growing down here
 

499
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,190
it's not even growing down here
so it's like too many vines in that area

500
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
so it's like too many vines in that area
 

501
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,190
so it's like too many vines in that area
but i haven't been able to figure out

502
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
but i haven't been able to figure out
 

503
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,470
but i haven't been able to figure out
what the area is

504
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
what the area is
 

505
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,670
what the area is
i still don't know this one too it's

506
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
i still don't know this one too it's
 

507
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,590
i still don't know this one too it's
reached the limit remember we placed the

508
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
reached the limit remember we placed the
 

509
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,870
reached the limit remember we placed the
vine here

510
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
vine here
 

511
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,870
vine here
it's grown to the left and the right and

512
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
it's grown to the left and the right and
 

513
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,790
it's grown to the left and the right and
down on all three

514
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
down on all three
 

515
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,790
down on all three
but it didn't go around the corner and

516
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
but it didn't go around the corner and
 

517
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,150
but it didn't go around the corner and
it's there's none on the back or

518
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
it's there's none on the back or
 

519
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,630
it's there's none on the back or
anything

520
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
anything
 

521
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,190
anything
so that one's reached the limit too

522
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
so that one's reached the limit too
 

523
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,829
so that one's reached the limit too
this one surrounded everything and grew

524
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
this one surrounded everything and grew
 

525
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,069
this one surrounded everything and grew
down

526
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
down
 

527
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,509
down
all the way so it covered everything but

528
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
all the way so it covered everything but
 

529
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,790
all the way so it covered everything but
i didn't give it any more space to grow

530
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
i didn't give it any more space to grow
 

531
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,230
i didn't give it any more space to grow
this one i placed it right here just one

532
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
this one i placed it right here just one
 

533
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,949
this one i placed it right here just one
vine

534
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
vine
 

535
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,670
vine
and it's grown up it's drawn down it's

536
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
and it's grown up it's drawn down it's
 

537
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,710
and it's grown up it's drawn down it's
growing around the side

538
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
growing around the side
 

539
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,670
growing around the side
and yeah it seems to reach the limit too

540
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
and yeah it seems to reach the limit too
 

541
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,590
and yeah it seems to reach the limit too
so i don't know i really don't know what

542
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
so i don't know i really don't know what
 

543
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,150
so i don't know i really don't know what
the area is these ones unfortunately

544
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
the area is these ones unfortunately
 

545
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,110
the area is these ones unfortunately
did not grow outside of the box

546
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120

 

547
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,590

oh they filled the box though that's

548
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
oh they filled the box though that's
 

549
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,430
oh they filled the box though that's
interesting

550
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
interesting
 

551
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,509
interesting
and i did another one over here

552
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519

 

553
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,350

same type of situation

554
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
same type of situation
 

555
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,190
same type of situation
um then i right after i did that i

556
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
um then i right after i did that i
 

557
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,509
um then i right after i did that i
thought maybe since those ones are

558
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
thought maybe since those ones are
 

559
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,030
thought maybe since those ones are
growing around the corners here that

560
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
growing around the corners here that
 

561
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,590
growing around the corners here that
maybe

562
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
maybe
 

563
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,670
maybe
if i used a non-solid block like glass

564
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
if i used a non-solid block like glass
 

565
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,670
if i used a non-solid block like glass
that it would be able to pass

566
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
that it would be able to pass
 

567
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,949
that it would be able to pass
from that face to this side over here

568
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
from that face to this side over here
 

569
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,350
from that face to this side over here
but it never did

570
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
but it never did
 

571
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,269
but it never did
i'm still going to try one more thing i

572
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
i'm still going to try one more thing i
 

573
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,190
i'm still going to try one more thing i
want to try

574
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
want to try
 

575
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,310
want to try
with a sign there and see if

576
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
with a sign there and see if
 

577
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,990
with a sign there and see if
that vine is able to pass around the

578
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
that vine is able to pass around the
 

579
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,190
that vine is able to pass around the
corner to that that side

580
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
corner to that that side
 

581
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,389
corner to that that side
because that vine still wouldn't burn

582
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
because that vine still wouldn't burn
 

583
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,509
because that vine still wouldn't burn
if there's a sign here

584
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
if there's a sign here
 

585
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,829
if there's a sign here
and i did this where i have them

586
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
and i did this where i have them
 

587
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,430
and i did this where i have them
underneath

588
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
underneath
 

589
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,990
underneath
i had these two vines here underneath

590
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
i had these two vines here underneath
 

591
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,230
i had these two vines here underneath
and they did not grow up or anything and

592
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
and they did not grow up or anything and
 

593
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,110
and they did not grow up or anything and
i even put

594
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
i even put
 

595
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,030
i even put
a few blocks here to see if they could

596
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
a few blocks here to see if they could
 

597
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,389
a few blocks here to see if they could
jump from

598
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
jump from
 

599
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,590
jump from
from there to like over here and it

600
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
from there to like over here and it
 

601
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,990
from there to like over here and it
never happened so

602
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000

 

603
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,030

yeah so i figured a little bit out about

604
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
yeah so i figured a little bit out about
 

605
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,350
yeah so i figured a little bit out about
it

606
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
it
 

607
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,470
it
but uh still gonna play around a bit to

608
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
but uh still gonna play around a bit to
 

609
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,790
but uh still gonna play around a bit to
really understand how these vines are

610
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
really understand how these vines are
 

611
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,069
really understand how these vines are
are working and what the area is

612
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
are working and what the area is
 

613
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,910
are working and what the area is
this one is just doing a fire test i

614
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
this one is just doing a fire test i
 

615
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,110
this one is just doing a fire test i
think it might

616
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
think it might
 

617
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,750
think it might
be better oh you can't place it i

618
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
be better oh you can't place it i
 

619
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,230
be better oh you can't place it i
thought you could place fines on vines

620
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240

 

621
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,910

well maybe you need a block to place it

622
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
well maybe you need a block to place it
 

623
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,389
well maybe you need a block to place it
on first i don't know

624
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
on first i don't know
 

625
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,069
on first i don't know
i think it might be better just to use

626
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
i think it might be better just to use
 

627
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,910
i think it might be better just to use
water or pistons or something to break

628
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
water or pistons or something to break
 

629
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,629
water or pistons or something to break
the vines instead of fire i don't know

630
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
the vines instead of fire i don't know
 

631
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,190
the vines instead of fire i don't know
we'll worry about another day oh and

632
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
we'll worry about another day oh and
 

633
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,110
we'll worry about another day oh and
this is something i just did recently i

634
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
this is something i just did recently i
 

635
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,590
this is something i just did recently i
was wondering if it could spread

636
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
was wondering if it could spread
 

637
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,670
was wondering if it could spread
infinitely sideways like this

638
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
infinitely sideways like this
 

639
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,509
infinitely sideways like this
so i put down three it's spread one

640
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
so i put down three it's spread one
 

641
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,190
so i put down three it's spread one
block over here

642
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
block over here
 

643
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,829
block over here
and i'm just going to watch it a while

644
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
and i'm just going to watch it a while
 

645
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,509
and i'm just going to watch it a while
and see if it continues spreading

646
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
and see if it continues spreading
 

647
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,790
and see if it continues spreading
to the right and left here but we're

648
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
to the right and left here but we're
 

649
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,069
to the right and left here but we're
gonna head back to the end

650
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
gonna head back to the end
 

651
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,629
gonna head back to the end
and maybe start work on an island

652
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
and maybe start work on an island
 

653
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,310
and maybe start work on an island
hopefully

654
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
hopefully
 

655
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,150
hopefully
i'm running out of time though

656
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160

 

657
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,150

oh and i forgot about our dark vines

658
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
oh and i forgot about our dark vines
 

659
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,990
oh and i forgot about our dark vines
over here they have actually grown quite

660
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
over here they have actually grown quite
 

661
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,190
over here they have actually grown quite
a bit

662
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
a bit
 

663
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,030
a bit
uh

664
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040

 

665
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,509

so these ones over here seem to still be

666
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
so these ones over here seem to still be
 

667
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,870
so these ones over here seem to still be
growing

668
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
growing
 

669
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,790
growing
uh and same with these ones but this one

670
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
uh and same with these ones but this one
 

671
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,430
uh and same with these ones but this one
has reached a limit too so it hasn't

672
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
has reached a limit too so it hasn't
 

673
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,470
has reached a limit too so it hasn't
been expanding

674
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
been expanding
 

675
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,110
been expanding
for a long long time but these ones i

676
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
for a long long time but these ones i
 

677
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,629
for a long long time but these ones i
think are still growing

678
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
think are still growing
 

679
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,710
think are still growing
so again i don't know what area it

680
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
so again i don't know what area it
 

681
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,710
so again i don't know what area it
checks

682
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
checks
 

683
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,949
checks
i don't know because there's two vines

684
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
i don't know because there's two vines
 

685
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,389
i don't know because there's two vines
in the one block so i don't know if that

686
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
in the one block so i don't know if that
 

687
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,910
in the one block so i don't know if that
counts as two vines

688
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
counts as two vines
 

689
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,750
counts as two vines
or if it's still just one vine i'm

690
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
or if it's still just one vine i'm
 

691
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,910
or if it's still just one vine i'm
guessing it must count as two

692
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
guessing it must count as two
 

693
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,710
guessing it must count as two
so there's actually five vines in this

694
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
so there's actually five vines in this
 

695
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,069
so there's actually five vines in this
area even though it's three

696
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
area even though it's three
 

697
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,550
area even though it's three
vine blocks if you know what i mean

698
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560

 

699
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,629

okay so we're in the end again here and

700
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
okay so we're in the end again here and
 

701
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,629
okay so we're in the end again here and
i am about to start building

702
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
i am about to start building
 

703
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,910
i am about to start building
the floating island their first one uh

704
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
the floating island their first one uh
 

705
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,230
the floating island their first one uh
i'm a little worried about this this is

706
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
i'm a little worried about this this is
 

707
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,829
i'm a little worried about this this is
gonna be a challenge for me i've never

708
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
gonna be a challenge for me i've never
 

709
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,310
gonna be a challenge for me i've never
built

710
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
built
 

711
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,030
built
any type of floating island or anything

712
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
any type of floating island or anything
 

713
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,350
any type of floating island or anything
i have no experience with it and i'm

714
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
i have no experience with it and i'm
 

715
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,150
i have no experience with it and i'm
worried it's gonna look terrible when

716
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
worried it's gonna look terrible when
 

717
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,110
worried it's gonna look terrible when
i'm all done here

718
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
i'm all done here
 

719
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,949
i'm all done here
but hopefully it turns out we'll see

720
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959

 

721
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,509

and it's just it's a real challenge

722
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
and it's just it's a real challenge
 

723
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,870
and it's just it's a real challenge
building them i think

724
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
building them i think
 

725
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,269
building them i think
even though i've never done it usually

726
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
even though i've never done it usually
 

727
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,470
even though i've never done it usually
when

728
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
when
 

729
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,269
when
people try to build a floating island in

730
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
people try to build a floating island in
 

731
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,150
people try to build a floating island in

minecraft it turns out to be

734
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
minecraft it turns out to be
 

735
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,389
minecraft it turns out to be
like one thick and kind of a big giant

736
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
like one thick and kind of a big giant
 

737
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,509
like one thick and kind of a big giant
square in the sky

738
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
square in the sky
 

739
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,550
square in the sky
basically uh it's really going to be

740
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
basically uh it's really going to be
 

741
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,590
basically uh it's really going to be
hard to shape it and it's going to be

742
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
hard to shape it and it's going to be
 

743
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,189
hard to shape it and it's going to be
if i do lots of them there's another

744
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
if i do lots of them there's another
 

745
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,430
if i do lots of them there's another
issue of running out of materials

746
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
issue of running out of materials
 

747
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,150
issue of running out of materials
i got a lot of soil with me here but

748
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
i got a lot of soil with me here but
 

749
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,910
i got a lot of soil with me here but
if it's not going to be just one thick

750
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
if it's not going to be just one thick
 

751
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,269
if it's not going to be just one thick
i'm going to use a lot of blocks

752
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
i'm going to use a lot of blocks
 

753
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,110
i'm going to use a lot of blocks
building it so

754
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
building it so
 

755
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,150
building it so
my plan for this is to kind of construct

756
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
my plan for this is to kind of construct
 

757
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,949
my plan for this is to kind of construct
a shell

758
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
a shell
 

759
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,470
a shell
and shape it out of soil

760
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
and shape it out of soil
 

761
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,030
and shape it out of soil
or dirt or whatever you want to call it

762
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
or dirt or whatever you want to call it
 

763
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,629
or dirt or whatever you want to call it
and then once i got the shape and

764
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
and then once i got the shape and
 

765
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,389
and then once i got the shape and
everything figured out in the size and

766
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
everything figured out in the size and
 

767
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,430
everything figured out in the size and
i'm happy with it

768
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
i'm happy with it
 

769
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,230
i'm happy with it
i'm gonna fill it with water and then

770
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
i'm gonna fill it with water and then
 

771
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,590
i'm gonna fill it with water and then
pour lava on top

772
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
pour lava on top
 

773
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,150
pour lava on top
one layer at a time same way i made this

774
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
one layer at a time same way i made this
 

775
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,189
one layer at a time same way i made this
pad here

776
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
pad here
 

777
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,790
pad here
i filled this all in with water and then

778
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
i filled this all in with water and then
 

779
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,550
i filled this all in with water and then
i poured lava

780
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
i poured lava
 

781
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,230
i poured lava
and it was a very quick way of placing

782
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
and it was a very quick way of placing
 

783
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,949
and it was a very quick way of placing
the blocks

784
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
the blocks
 

785
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,550
the blocks
and also uh very cheap

786
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
and also uh very cheap
 

787
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,430
and also uh very cheap
because i don't need to place or collect

788
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
because i don't need to place or collect
 

789
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,470
because i don't need to place or collect
a thousand

790
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
a thousand
 

791
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,150
a thousand
thousands of stone blocks to fill the

792
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
thousands of stone blocks to fill the
 

793
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,389
thousands of stone blocks to fill the
island if i do it this way

794
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
island if i do it this way
 

795
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,389
island if i do it this way
so we are going to be building departure

796
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
so we are going to be building departure
 

797
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:12,790
so we are going to be building departure
island

798

799
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,949

is our first one it's going to connect

800
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
is our first one it's going to connect
 

801
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,389
is our first one it's going to connect
directly

65 or so is what we want to be at so i

816
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
65 or so is what we want to be at so i
 

817
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,949
65 or so is what we want to be at so i
think i'll build it

818
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
think i'll build it
 

819
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,949
think i'll build it
a little ways away from our end or ender

820
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
a little ways away from our end or ender
 

821
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,430
a little ways away from our end or ender
here not too far away though

822
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
here not too far away though
 

823
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,230
here not too far away though
maybe

824
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240

 

825
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,990

maybe around here would look good we're

826
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
maybe around here would look good we're
 

827
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,269
maybe around here would look good we're
going to eventually get rid of

828
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
going to eventually get rid of
 

829
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,670
going to eventually get rid of
of that thing here in this path i want

830
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
of that thing here in this path i want
 

831
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,990
of that thing here in this path i want
to be gone

832
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
to be gone
 

833
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,710
to be gone
and now is the challenge of

834
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720

 

835
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,550

shaping it and everything maybe i'll go

836
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
shaping it and everything maybe i'll go
 

837
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,030
shaping it and everything maybe i'll go
up to

838
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040

 

839
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,150

here make it about 10 thick or so i

840
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
here make it about 10 thick or so i
 

841
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,429
here make it about 10 thick or so i
don't know

842
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
don't know
 

843
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,990
don't know
um and i kind of want to make

844
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
um and i kind of want to make
 

845
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,270
um and i kind of want to make
an l-shaped island maybe

846
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
an l-shaped island maybe
 

847
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,189
an l-shaped island maybe
so i guess i'll just play around with it

848
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
so i guess i'll just play around with it
 

849
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,549
so i guess i'll just play around with it
a bit and see how it goes

850
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559

 

851
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,669

all right everybody here is the island

852
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
all right everybody here is the island
 

853
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,710
all right everybody here is the island
i got it all shaped out and

854
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
i got it all shaped out and
 

855
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,190
i got it all shaped out and
got most of the shell complete for it so

856
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
got most of the shell complete for it so
 

857
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,789
got most of the shell complete for it so
that was the first layer down there that

858
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
that was the first layer down there that
 

859
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,750
that was the first layer down there that
i started on just kind of got a

860
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
i started on just kind of got a
 

861
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,909
i started on just kind of got a
the basic shape that i wanted and then

862
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
the basic shape that i wanted and then
 

863
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,430
the basic shape that i wanted and then
every layer i just outlined the same

864
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
every layer i just outlined the same
 

865
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,150
every layer i just outlined the same
shape

866
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
shape
 

867
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,150
shape
and went up so that's kind of makes it a

868
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
and went up so that's kind of makes it a
 

869
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,909
and went up so that's kind of makes it a
45 degree angle that

870
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
45 degree angle that
 

871
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,430
45 degree angle that
it expands wider

872
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
it expands wider
 

873
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,029
it expands wider
and then at this top layer i made it

874
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
and then at this top layer i made it
 

875
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,870
and then at this top layer i made it
expand two blocks

876
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
expand two blocks
 

877
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,909
expand two blocks
so don't know how that's gonna look i

878
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
so don't know how that's gonna look i
 

879
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,669
so don't know how that's gonna look i
hope it's okay

880
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
hope it's okay
 

881
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,190
hope it's okay
it'll be kind of 45 degree

882
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
it'll be kind of 45 degree
 

883
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,270
it'll be kind of 45 degree
anglish because of that but

884
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
anglish because of that but
 

885
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,669
anglish because of that but
makes it really easy to build if i

886
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
makes it really easy to build if i
 

887
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,990
makes it really easy to build if i
follow that pattern

888
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
follow that pattern
 

889
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,270
follow that pattern
and i decide to make the shell mostly

890
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
and i decide to make the shell mostly
 

891
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,110
and i decide to make the shell mostly
out of soil

892
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
out of soil
 

893
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,190
out of soil
or entirely out of soil i should say i

894
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
or entirely out of soil i should say i
 

895
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,630
or entirely out of soil i should say i
don't know if that's a good move or not

896
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
don't know if that's a good move or not
 

897
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,150
don't know if that's a good move or not
i could have used stone

898
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
i could have used stone
 

899
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,510
i could have used stone
for it or other things or do the bottom

900
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
for it or other things or do the bottom
 

901
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,270
for it or other things or do the bottom
out of something and then

902
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
out of something and then
 

903
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,390
out of something and then
decide something else i don't know

904
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
decide something else i don't know
 

905
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,230
decide something else i don't know
hope hopefully it looks good when this

906
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
hope hopefully it looks good when this
 

907
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,669
hope hopefully it looks good when this
is all done and then

908
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
is all done and then
 

909
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,110
is all done and then
once it's all done i'll probably have to

910
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
once it's all done i'll probably have to
 

911
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,510
once it's all done i'll probably have to
go underneath and

912
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
go underneath and
 

913
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,669
go underneath and
shape the the bottom a little bit so

914
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
shape the the bottom a little bit so
 

915
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,430
shape the the bottom a little bit so
it's not completely flat like it is

916
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
it's not completely flat like it is
 

917
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,549
it's not completely flat like it is
there

918
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
there
 

919
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,310
there
and yeah the torches are to prevent

920
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
and yeah the torches are to prevent
 

921
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,470
and yeah the torches are to prevent
enderman from spawning because they will

922
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
enderman from spawning because they will
 

923
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,669
enderman from spawning because they will
destroy this place in seconds otherwise

924
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
destroy this place in seconds otherwise
 

925
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,710
destroy this place in seconds otherwise
but they are also teleporting from down

926
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
but they are also teleporting from down
 

927
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,110
but they are also teleporting from down
there

928
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
there
 

929
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,270
there
to over here and they are

930
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
to over here and they are
 

931
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,789
to over here and they are
slowly trying to destroy it so i need to

932
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
slowly trying to destroy it so i need to
 

933
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,750
slowly trying to destroy it so i need to
hurry up finish filling this in with

934
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
hurry up finish filling this in with
 

935
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,270
hurry up finish filling this in with
stone

936
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
stone
 

937
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,590
stone
so that that's not as big of a problem

938
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
so that that's not as big of a problem
 

939
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,150
so that that's not as big of a problem
until i can figure out how to stop it

940
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160

 

941
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,750

what i should do sometimes figure out

942
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
what i should do sometimes figure out
 

943
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,590
what i should do sometimes figure out
how far these guys can teleport because

944
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
how far these guys can teleport because
 

945
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,230
how far these guys can teleport because
there going to be a problem constantly

946
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
there going to be a problem constantly
 

947
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,230
there going to be a problem constantly
if i do this floating island thing

948
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
if i do this floating island thing
 

949
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,470
if i do this floating island thing
so yeah anyway i'm going to

950
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
so yeah anyway i'm going to
 

951
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,630
so yeah anyway i'm going to
grab some lava grab some water we're

952
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
grab some lava grab some water we're
 

953
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,029
grab some lava grab some water we're
going to do this layer by layer

954
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
going to do this layer by layer
 

955
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,950
going to do this layer by layer
as much as we can today no

956
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
as much as we can today no
 

957
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,029
as much as we can today no
don't don't steal

958
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
don't don't steal
 

959
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,750
don't don't steal
stealing is bad

960
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760

 

961
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,750

oh man i'm so scared going down there

962
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
oh man i'm so scared going down there
 

963
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,029
oh man i'm so scared going down there
because i think

964
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
because i think
 

965
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,470
because i think
i'm always worried i looked at them

966
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480

 

967
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,190

okay this is what it looks like from

968
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
okay this is what it looks like from
 

969
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,830
okay this is what it looks like from
underneath

970
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
underneath
 

971
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,590
underneath
and also when we shape the bottom we'll

972
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
and also when we shape the bottom we'll
 

973
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,669
and also when we shape the bottom we'll
put vines on probably and maybe figure

974
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
put vines on probably and maybe figure
 

975
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,669
put vines on probably and maybe figure
out a way to prevent them

976
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
out a way to prevent them
 

977
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,909
out a way to prevent them
from growing infinitely to the bottom of

978
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
from growing infinitely to the bottom of
 

979
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,710
from growing infinitely to the bottom of
the world

980
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720

 

981
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,190

okay everybody so i've done two layers

982
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
okay everybody so i've done two layers
 

983
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,350
okay everybody so i've done two layers
already and it went pretty well

984
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
already and it went pretty well
 

985
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,470
already and it went pretty well
uh basically all i'm doing is putting

986
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
uh basically all i'm doing is putting
 

987
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,390
uh basically all i'm doing is putting
water down

988
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
water down
 

989
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,750
water down
making a lake on uh on the whole layer

990
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
making a lake on uh on the whole layer
 

991
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,870
making a lake on uh on the whole layer
here

992
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
here
 

993
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,029
here
and then we pour lav over top to convert

994
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
and then we pour lav over top to convert
 

995
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,029
and then we pour lav over top to convert
it to stone

996
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
it to stone
 

997
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,669
it to stone
and it's yeah it seems to work good it's

998
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
and it's yeah it seems to work good it's
 

999
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,350
and it's yeah it seems to work good it's
quick

1000
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
quick
 

1001
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,430
quick
uh the thing that takes the longest is

1002
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
uh the thing that takes the longest is
 

1003
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,510
uh the thing that takes the longest is
waiting for the lava to disappear

1004
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
waiting for the lava to disappear
 

1005
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,470
waiting for the lava to disappear
afterwards

1006
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
afterwards
 

1007
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,390
afterwards
but uh something i've been thinking of

1008
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
but uh something i've been thinking of
 

1009
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,430
but uh something i've been thinking of
doing is just put

1010
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
doing is just put
 

1011
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,510
doing is just put
pouring water over top the remaining

1012
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
pouring water over top the remaining
 

1013
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,190
pouring water over top the remaining
lava to convert it to

1014
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
lava to convert it to
 

1015
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,990
lava to convert it to
cobblestone i don't know

1016
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
cobblestone i don't know
 

1017
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,390
cobblestone i don't know
but yeah it's seems to be okay

1018
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
but yeah it's seems to be okay
 

1019
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,149
but yeah it's seems to be okay
uh if you guys have any ideas on how to

1020
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
uh if you guys have any ideas on how to
 

1021
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,830
uh if you guys have any ideas on how to
oh no no no no on how to make a floating

1022
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
oh no no no no on how to make a floating
 

1023
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,470
oh no no no no on how to make a floating
island

1024
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
island
 

1025
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,630
island
or ways i could do this better please do

1026
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
or ways i could do this better please do
 

1027
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,390
or ways i could do this better please do
let me know i am all ears

1028
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
let me know i am all ears
 

1029
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,149
let me know i am all ears
getting an organic shape is really tough

1030
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
getting an organic shape is really tough
 

1031
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,909
getting an organic shape is really tough
i'm kind of happy with how this turned

1032
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
i'm kind of happy with how this turned
 

1033
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,990
i'm kind of happy with how this turned
out just because it's my first attempt

1034
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
out just because it's my first attempt
 

1035
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,510
out just because it's my first attempt
but

1036
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
but
 

1037
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,470
but
it does look fairly symmetrical

1038
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480

 

1039
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,549

which i kind of expected because i was

1040
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
which i kind of expected because i was
 

1041
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,789
which i kind of expected because i was
just copying the same shape over and

1042
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
just copying the same shape over and
 

1043
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,830
just copying the same shape over and
over again

1044
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840

 

1045
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,149

um

1046
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
um
 

1047
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,510
um
but yeah if you have better ideas on how

1048
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
but yeah if you have better ideas on how
 

1049
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,750
but yeah if you have better ideas on how
to improve this

1050
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
to improve this
 

1051
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,669
to improve this
or not better ideas just ideas on how to

1052
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
or not better ideas just ideas on how to
 

1053
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,870
or not better ideas just ideas on how to
prove this i haven't

1054
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
prove this i haven't
 

1055
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,909
prove this i haven't
given any ideas on how to improve it

1056
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
given any ideas on how to improve it
 

1057
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,510
given any ideas on how to improve it
uh let me know uh

1058
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
uh let me know uh
 

1059
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,110
uh let me know uh
i am going to try to shape the bottom

1060
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120
i am going to try to shape the bottom
 

1061
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,830
i am going to try to shape the bottom
though oh he's dead

1062
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
though oh he's dead
 

1063
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,950
though oh he's dead
so that it's uh fairly vertical and then

1064
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
so that it's uh fairly vertical and then
 

1065
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,950
so that it's uh fairly vertical and then
it'll get to the 45

1066
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
it'll get to the 45
 

1067
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,789
it'll get to the 45
degree angle spot so it'll go up quickly

1068
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
degree angle spot so it'll go up quickly
 

1069
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,350
degree angle spot so it'll go up quickly
and then

1070
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
and then
 

1071
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,830
and then
kind of round out and then near the top

1072
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
kind of round out and then near the top
 

1073
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,470
kind of round out and then near the top
it's

1074
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
it's
 

1075
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,909
it's
even wider so it'll create a

1076
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
even wider so it'll create a
 

1077
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,029
even wider so it'll create a
bevel shape hopefully and

1078
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039

 

1079
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,430

yeah then i'll put the binds on and

1080
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
yeah then i'll put the binds on and
 

1081
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,630
yeah then i'll put the binds on and
whatever if they look good

1082
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
whatever if they look good
 

1083
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,710
whatever if they look good
okay so we got our lake now we're gonna

1084
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
okay so we got our lake now we're gonna
 

1085
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,590
okay so we got our lake now we're gonna
pour the for the lava

1086
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600

 

1087
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,230

and it just spreads out like that and we

1088
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
and it just spreads out like that and we
 

1089
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,870
and it just spreads out like that and we
juggle it

1090
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880

 

1091
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,270

really like this method i think i i'm

1092
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
really like this method i think i i'm
 

1093
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,630
really like this method i think i i'm
going to use it for a lot of things as

1094
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
going to use it for a lot of things as
 

1095
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,230
going to use it for a lot of things as
far as placing blocks

1096
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
far as placing blocks
 

1097
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,870
far as placing blocks
lots and lots of blocks quickly this is

1098
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
lots and lots of blocks quickly this is
 

1099
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,029
lots and lots of blocks quickly this is
probably

1100
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
probably
 

1101
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,950
probably
the best way of doing it that i can

1102
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
the best way of doing it that i can
 

1103
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,549
the best way of doing it that i can
think of

1104
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
think of
 

1105
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,990
think of
um

1106
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000

 

1107
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,190

well i guess it depends what you're

1108
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
well i guess it depends what you're
 

1109
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,270
well i guess it depends what you're
doing like getting leaves and stuff

1110
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,280
doing like getting leaves and stuff
 

1111
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,149
doing like getting leaves and stuff
is a really quick way of getting blocks

1112
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
is a really quick way of getting blocks
 

1113
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:08,470
is a really quick way of getting blocks
too

1114
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
too
 

1115
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,630
too
and placing them whoa

1116
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640

 

1117
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,789

but obviously we wouldn't want to use

1118
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
but obviously we wouldn't want to use
 

1119
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,990
but obviously we wouldn't want to use
leaves in this case

1120
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
leaves in this case
 

1121
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,230
leaves in this case

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
videos for like a week or so to get the
 

1179
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,590
videos for like a week or so to get the
extra time needed

1180
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
extra time needed
 

1181
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,149
extra time needed
and i'm sure people would not like that

1182
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
and i'm sure people would not like that
 

1183
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,590
and i'm sure people would not like that
so

1184
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
so
 

1185
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,510
so
probably best just to skip it this time

1186
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
probably best just to skip it this time
 

1187
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,789
probably best just to skip it this time

when i record i just kind of get a
 

1225
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,310
when i record i just kind of get a
rough idea of what i'm gonna say before

1226
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
rough idea of what i'm gonna say before
 

1227
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,990
rough idea of what i'm gonna say before
i start and

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
i start and
 

1229
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,430
i start and
quite often i'll just mess up

1230
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
quite often i'll just mess up
 

1231
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,269
quite often i'll just mess up
uh maybe i'll pause the video for a

1232
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
uh maybe i'll pause the video for a
 

1233
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,549
uh maybe i'll pause the video for a
second think

1234
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
second think
 

1235
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,470
second think
what i was gonna say

1236
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480

 

1237
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,990

yeah i don't know nothing really came to

1261
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,310
mcedit
version out right now is

1262
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
version out right now is
 

1263
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,510
version out right now is
fairly buggy so

1264
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
fairly buggy so
 

1265
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,029
fairly buggy so
been just been putting it off i guess

1266
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
been just been putting it off i guess
 

1267
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,470
been just been putting it off i guess
but hopefully one day maybe

1268
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:32,480
but hopefully one day maybe
 

1269
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,230
but hopefully one day maybe
a few months down the line it'll

1270
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
a few months down the line it'll
 

1271
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,669
a few months down the line it'll
actually get completed

1272
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
actually get completed
 

1273
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,549
actually get completed
is my dream but uh

1274
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559

 

1275
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,510

yeah i think we're gonna end the episode

1276
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
yeah i think we're gonna end the episode
 

1277
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,990
yeah i think we're gonna end the episode
about

1278
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,000
about
 

1279
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,269
about
here for today uh

1280
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279
here for today uh
 

1281
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,310
here for today uh
because i'm gonna have to wait for this

1282
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
because i'm gonna have to wait for this
 

1283
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,950
because i'm gonna have to wait for this
lava to disappear i could just

1284
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
lava to disappear i could just
 

1285
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,510
lava to disappear i could just
pour water on it but then it'll convert

1286
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:55,520
pour water on it but then it'll convert
 

1287
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,789
pour water on it but then it'll convert
to cobble and it won't

1288
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
to cobble and it won't
 

1289
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,830
to cobble and it won't
be really clean

1290
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
be really clean
 

1291
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,470
be really clean
pattern or anything so it'll be hard to

1292
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
pattern or anything so it'll be hard to
 

1293
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,789
pattern or anything so it'll be hard to
place water for the next layer

1294
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
place water for the next layer
 

1295
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,710
place water for the next layer
so i think it's it's better probably

1296
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
so i think it's it's better probably
 

1297
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,549
so i think it's it's better probably
just to wait the five minutes or so for

1298
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
just to wait the five minutes or so for
 

1299
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,029
just to wait the five minutes or so for
it to

1300
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
it to
 

1301
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,310
it to
disappear

1302
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320

 

1303
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,110

1316
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:32,559
