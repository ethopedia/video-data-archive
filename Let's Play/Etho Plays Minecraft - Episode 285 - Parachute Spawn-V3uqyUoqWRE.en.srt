00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,600
of other things and then I decided to
 

135
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,199

but I actually really liked it now that
 

141
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,770
but I actually really liked it now that
it's all done I've gotten used to it it

142
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:56,780

144
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,160
might be a little shocking to you guys
 

145
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,100
might be a little shocking to you guys
but I think it once you see it for a

146
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,110
but I think it once you see it for a
 

147
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,330
but I think it once you see it for a
while you kind of start to like it I

148
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:03,340
while you kind of start to like it I
 

149
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,130
while you kind of start to like it I
don't know I really like it now that

150
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,140
don't know I really like it now that
 

151
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,530

I've been been working in here for a

152
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:08,540
I've been been working in here for a
 

153
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,630
I've been been working in here for a
while and we got lamps and stuff

154
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
while and we got lamps and stuff
 

155
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,430
while and we got lamps and stuff
lighting the way so we have no torches

156
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:12,440
lighting the way so we have no torches
 

157
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,380
lighting the way so we have no torches
and I think that improves the look of it

158
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,390
and I think that improves the look of it
 

159
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,330
and I think that improves the look of it

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,560
builds so much when you can get rid of
torches because you got an ugly ugly

162
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,570
torches because you got an ugly ugly
 

163
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,040
torches because you got an ugly ugly
thing blocking the view of your blocks

164
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,050
thing blocking the view of your blocks
 

165
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,529
thing blocking the view of your blocks
and then it has particle effects and

166
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:26,539
and then it has particle effects and
 

167
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,480
and then it has particle effects and
it's animated it's really distracting

168
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,490
it's animated it's really distracting
 

169
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,790
it's animated it's really distracting
from the build if you have torches I

170
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
from the build if you have torches I
 

171
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,930
from the build if you have torches I
find so for most my builds I try to not

172
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:34,940
find so for most my builds I try to not
 

173
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,290
find so for most my builds I try to not
use torches where I can not always but

174
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:38,300
use torches where I can not always but
 

175
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,839
use torches where I can not always but
most of the time so yeah we got to our

176
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:40,849
most of the time so yeah we got to our
 

177
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:43,659
most of the time so yeah we got to our
brewing setups here we got four of them

178
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:43,669
brewing setups here we got four of them
 

179
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,210
brewing setups here we got four of them
built so far and we're not done as you

180
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,220
built so far and we're not done as you
 

181
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,200
built so far and we're not done as you
can see we still have empty wall here we

182
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,210
can see we still have empty wall here we
 

183
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,890
can see we still have empty wall here we
actually need to build two more of these

184
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:53,900
actually need to build two more of these
 

185
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,610
actually need to build two more of these
threes three brewing stand setups like

186
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:57,620
threes three brewing stand setups like
 

187
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,249
threes three brewing stand setups like
this one need two more of those and I

188
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:00,259
this one need two more of those and I
 

189
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,430
this one need two more of those and I
think two twos and then we're done with

190
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
think two twos and then we're done with
 

191
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,670
think two twos and then we're done with
these brewing setups in total we have we

192
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:06,680
these brewing setups in total we have we
 

193
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,059
these brewing setups in total we have we
have a three over there this is a four

194
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:09,069
have a three over there this is a four
 

195
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,149
have a three over there this is a four
we have four fours that's second third

196
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:13,159
we have four fours that's second third
 

197
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,559
we have four fours that's second third
and fourth and here's other three so we

198
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:17,569
and fourth and here's other three so we
 

199
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,390
and fourth and here's other three so we
have two threes and four fours at the

200
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:19,400
have two threes and four fours at the
 

201
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,140
have two threes and four fours at the
moment we need four threes and two twos

202
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,150
moment we need four threes and two twos
 

203
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,600
moment we need four threes and two twos
total and in this Cove here I'm going to

204
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,610
total and in this Cove here I'm going to
 

205
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,850
total and in this Cove here I'm going to
use this to brew awkward potions and

206
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:30,860
use this to brew awkward potions and
 

207
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,059
use this to brew awkward potions and
haven't set it up fully yet of course we

208
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:34,069
haven't set it up fully yet of course we
 

209
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,529
haven't set it up fully yet of course we
got our nether word farms that we set up

210
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:35,539
got our nether word farms that we set up
 

211
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:40,330
got our nether word farms that we set up
last time which work pretty good I like

212
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:40,340
last time which work pretty good I like
 

213
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,469
last time which work pretty good I like
them and let's go get the other one you

214
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
them and let's go get the other one you
 

215
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,260
them and let's go get the other one you
want for this side we have another one

216
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,270
want for this side we have another one
 

217
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,320
want for this side we have another one
of these coves and for here I want to

218
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,330
of these coves and for here I want to
 

219
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,149
of these coves and for here I want to
place controls for turning the stuff on

220
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:55,159
place controls for turning the stuff on
 

221
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,249
place controls for turning the stuff on
and off for controlling all the Redstone

222
00:05:57,249 --> 00:05:57,259
and off for controlling all the Redstone
 

223
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,230
and off for controlling all the Redstone
we'll put into this little area here

224
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,240
we'll put into this little area here
 

225
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,850
we'll put into this little area here
somehow and up at the front here I kind

226
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:03,860
somehow and up at the front here I kind
 

227
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,350
somehow and up at the front here I kind
of want to do something fancy but I

228
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
of want to do something fancy but I
 

229
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,029
of want to do something fancy but I
don't know what like of course we have

230
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
don't know what like of course we have
 

231
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,499
don't know what like of course we have
to put a few more of these but I was

232
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:08,509
to put a few more of these but I was
 

233
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,649
to put a few more of these but I was
thinking like stairs that go up then

234
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:10,659
thinking like stairs that go up then
 

235
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,559
thinking like stairs that go up then
maybe some ornamental stuff I don't know

236
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:13,569
maybe some ornamental stuff I don't know
 

237
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,990
maybe some ornamental stuff I don't know
exactly what I want to do here we do

238
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,000
exactly what I want to do here we do
 

239
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,570
exactly what I want to do here we do
need to expand like dig out a bunch of

240
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:19,580
need to expand like dig out a bunch of
 

241
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,610
need to expand like dig out a bunch of
this so that's what that buttons for and

242
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:23,620
this so that's what that buttons for and
 

243
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,369
this so that's what that buttons for and
clean it up quite a bit

244
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:27,379
clean it up quite a bit
 

245
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,689
clean it up quite a bit
and I'll probably have to take out some

246
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:29,699
and I'll probably have to take out some
 

247
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,869
and I'll probably have to take out some
more space still while I was over here

248
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:32,879
more space still while I was over here
 

249
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,059
more space still while I was over here
I've discovered a few cool things

250
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:37,069
I've discovered a few cool things
 

251
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,950
I've discovered a few cool things
rediscovered I should say let's head on

252
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:39,960
rediscovered I should say let's head on
 

253
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,890
rediscovered I should say let's head on
over up here yeah up here check this out

254
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:42,900
over up here yeah up here check this out
 

255
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,350
over up here yeah up here check this out
we're really close to a skeleton spawner

256
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
we're really close to a skeleton spawner
 

257
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,189
we're really close to a skeleton spawner
thing I made a long time ago right in

258
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
thing I made a long time ago right in
 

259
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,570
thing I made a long time ago right in
there is a skeleton spawner that's kind

260
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:53,580
there is a skeleton spawner that's kind
 

261
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,610
there is a skeleton spawner that's kind
of cool

262
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:54,620
of cool
 

263
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,260
of cool
so we'll probably try to set something

264
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,270
so we'll probably try to set something
 

265
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,080
so we'll probably try to set something
up for that because the building is so

266
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,090
up for that because the building is so
 

267
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,959
up for that because the building is so
close to it and if we go outside I think

268
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:02,969
close to it and if we go outside I think
 

269
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:09,230
close to it and if we go outside I think
we are pretty close to those glowing

270
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,240
we are pretty close to those glowing
 

271
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,600
we are pretty close to those glowing
jungle trees I set up yeah over here

272
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:14,610
jungle trees I set up yeah over here
 

273
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,600
jungle trees I set up yeah over here
this is where that's that snowflakes up

274
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:17,610
this is where that's that snowflakes up
 

275

is going um I don't know if we're going
 

279
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,730
is going um I don't know if we're going
to work on this today kind of feel like

280
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:28,740
to work on this today kind of feel like
 

281
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,890
to work on this today kind of feel like
just dripping around today to be honest

282
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:30,900
just dripping around today to be honest
 

283
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,290

not just for fun like normally if you

606
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,120
not just for fun like normally if you
 

607
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,300
not just for fun like normally if you
spawn somewhere you're you spawn at that

608
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,310
spawn somewhere you're you spawn at that
 

609
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,430
spawn somewhere you're you spawn at that
spot but with this I have the option of

610
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:50,440
spot but with this I have the option of
 

611
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,930
spot but with this I have the option of
like teleporting 100 blocks + all around

612
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:54,940
like teleporting 100 blocks + all around
 

613
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,850
like teleporting 100 blocks + all around
me with an ender pearl like you can

614
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:56,860
me with an ender pearl like you can
 

615
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,860
me with an ender pearl like you can
throw it super far because I'm way up in

616
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:58,870
throw it super far because I'm way up in
 

617
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,350
throw it super far because I'm way up in
the air so check this out I tested this

618
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
the air so check this out I tested this
 

619
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,850
the air so check this out I tested this
in creative you don't want to throw the

620
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:02,860
in creative you don't want to throw the
 

621
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,040
in creative you don't want to throw the
ender pearl up like this you way I think

622
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,050
ender pearl up like this you way I think
 

623
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,560
ender pearl up like this you way I think
the optimum angle is actually

624
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,570
the optimum angle is actually
 

625
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,570
the optimum angle is actually
straightforward so let's see where this

626
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:09,580
straightforward so let's see where this
 

627
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,080
straightforward so let's see where this
takes me

628
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,090
takes me
 

629
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:21,230
takes me
and we're at 319 163 nineteen one sixty

630
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,240
and we're at 319 163 nineteen one sixty
 

631
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,960
and we're at 319 163 nineteen one sixty
to seventy two so we teleported over one

632
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:24,970

setting my spawn in a bed
 

705
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,200
setting my spawn in a bed
the thing is normally if you set your

706
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,210
the thing is normally if you set your
 

707
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,650
the thing is normally if you set your
spawn in a bed and you obstruct it so

708
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:47,660
spawn in a bed and you obstruct it so
 

709
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,680
spawn in a bed and you obstruct it so
these are the spots that you can spawn

710
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:49,690
these are the spots that you can spawn
 

711
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,440
these are the spots that you can spawn
around a bed normally not a pie though

712
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,450
around a bed normally not a pie though
 

713
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,870
around a bed normally not a pie though
and when you when you block those and

714
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
and when you when you block those and
 

715
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
and when you when you block those and
you kill yourself you know I probably

716
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:01,610
you kill yourself you know I probably
 

717
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,370
you kill yourself you know I probably
should checked what what spot I was at I

718
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:03,380
should checked what what spot I was at I

let's go wool this time okay so I'm kind
of experimenting here too a little bit

738
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:42,039
of experimenting here too a little bit
 

739
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,110

now I think if you put glass all around
 

743
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:57,000
now I think if you put glass all around
it you will spawn in the glass I believe

744
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,010

 

745
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,750

let's try this out

746
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:58,760
let's try this out
 

747
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,260
let's try this out
oh no on top of it that's right so

748

that's that's your hint there you spot
 

751
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:13,299
that's that's your hint there you spot
on top of the glass instead of in it all

752
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:13,309
on top of the glass instead of in it all
 

753
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,299
on top of the glass instead of in it all
right

754
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:15,309
right
 

755
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,360
right
now you can specify a spot you want to

756
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,370
now you can specify a spot you want to
 

757
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,220
now you can specify a spot you want to
spawn if you change all all this ground

758
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,230

nighttime song and I leave the bed this

896
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:32,990
nighttime song and I leave the bed this
 

897
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,130
nighttime song and I leave the bed this
is where the block is this is the center

898
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,140
is where the block is this is the center
 

899
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:43,030
is where the block is this is the center
of the beacon now to leave here that

this is important to know the way this

902
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840
this is important to know the way this
 

903
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,070
this is important to know the way this
works if I set my spawn in the bed and I

904
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
works if I set my spawn in the bed and I
 

905
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,380
works if I set my spawn in the bed and I
leave the bed or if it becomes day while

906
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,390
leave the bed or if it becomes day while
 

907
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,340
leave the bed or if it becomes day while
I'm sleeping in it

908
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,350
I'm sleeping in it
 

909
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,390
I'm sleeping in it
I don't spawn up there I spawn down here

910
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:55,400
I don't spawn up there I spawn down here
 

911
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,450
I don't spawn up there I spawn down here
by the bed it's only if I die that I

912
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:58,460
by the bed it's only if I die that I
 

913
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,490
by the bed it's only if I die that I
spawn way up in the air like that so

914
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:00,500
spawn way up in the air like that so
 

915
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,010
spawn way up in the air like that so
keep that in mind but yeah I have to

916
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,020
keep that in mind but yeah I have to
 

917
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,250
keep that in mind but yeah I have to
have the spot here is the thing because

918
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,260
have the spot here is the thing because
 

919
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,580
have the spot here is the thing because
I don't want to move the beach in so

920
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:11,590
I don't want to move the beach in so
 

921
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:24,190

what I should probably do who maybe um

922
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,200
what I should probably do who maybe um
 

923
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,380
what I should probably do who maybe um
maybe if I dig out here I might be able

924
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,390
maybe if I dig out here I might be able
 

925
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,860
maybe if I dig out here I might be able
to even move the bed this might work if

926
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:32,870
to even move the bed this might work if
 

927
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,370
to even move the bed this might work if
I have it here I'll have to test it

928
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:36,380
I have it here I'll have to test it
 

929
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,280
I have it here I'll have to test it
later

930
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,290
later
 

931
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,040
later

941
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,250

probably

942
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:04,260
