00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,240
more foolishness we know now iron golems
 

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,120
more foolishness we know now iron golems
don't cause collateral damage they just

32

a lot of damage you didn't blow up my
 

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,179
a lot of damage you didn't blow up my
tree at least this is the very first

50
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:41,189
tree at least this is the very first
 

51
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,460
tree at least this is the very first
custom tree I made I would have been

52
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,470
custom tree I made I would have been
 

53
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,410
custom tree I made I would have been
very sad if he wrecked that oh but look

00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:48,420
very sad if he wrecked that oh but look
 

55
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,370
very sad if he wrecked that oh but look
at look at this let's not do the intros

56
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,380
at look at this let's not do the intros
 

57
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,270
at look at this let's not do the intros
like that anymore I'll fix it later

58
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,280
like that anymore I'll fix it later
 

59
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,719
like that anymore I'll fix it later
okay let's keep going let's go down here

60
00:01:59,719 --> 00:01:59,729
okay let's keep going let's go down here

want to get distracted all right so
 

65
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,440
want to get distracted all right so
we're gonna go over to the sheep farm

66
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,450
we're gonna go over to the sheep farm
 

67
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,719
we're gonna go over to the sheep farm
that we started last episode I take your

68
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:08,729
that we started last episode I take your
 

69
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,470
that we started last episode I take your
shortcuts whoa

70
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480

 

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,710

yes little top on down here I I spent a

74
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:19,500
yes little top on down here I I spent a
 

75
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,559
yes little top on down here I I spent a
bit of time on this I went into a

76
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:21,569
bit of time on this I went into a
 

77
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,869
bit of time on this I went into a
creative world and like tried to work it

78
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:23,879
creative world and like tried to work it
 

79
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,400
creative world and like tried to work it
out in a very crazy way like where I'd

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,410
out in a very crazy way like where I'd
 

81
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,520
out in a very crazy way like where I'd
controlled each sheep individually and

82
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,530
controlled each sheep individually and
 

83
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,740
controlled each sheep individually and
did all his fancy stuff the thing was

84
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,750
did all his fancy stuff the thing was
 

85
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,390
did all his fancy stuff the thing was
starting he have very big though and it

86
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,400
starting he have very big though and it
 

87
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,309
starting he have very big though and it
was getting very complicated so I just

88
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:37,319
was getting very complicated so I just
 

89
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,860
was getting very complicated so I just
closed that world team back to my LP

90
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:39,870
closed that world team back to my LP
 

91
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,350
closed that world team back to my LP
world and just tried to figure it out to

92
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,360
world and just tried to figure it out to
 

93
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,920
world and just tried to figure it out to
your and very happy with what we got now

94
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:44,930
your and very happy with what we got now
 

95
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,190
your and very happy with what we got now
so I ended up just using a simple date

96
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
so I ended up just using a simple date
 

97
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,470
so I ended up just using a simple date
system over here this block this block

98
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,480
system over here this block this block
 

99
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,759
system over here this block this block
right here we're gonna need that to be

100
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:55,769
right here we're gonna need that to be
 

101
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,589
right here we're gonna need that to be
glass so it doesn't suffocate the sheep

102
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
glass so it doesn't suffocate the sheep
 

103
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,330
glass so it doesn't suffocate the sheep
and then I'm gonna put one more block

104
00:02:59,330 --> 00:02:59,340
and then I'm gonna put one more block
 

105
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,000
and then I'm gonna put one more block
over here so that when a minecart goes

106
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,010
over here so that when a minecart goes
 

107
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,710
over here so that when a minecart goes
this way it'll crash into that and fall

108
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
this way it'll crash into that and fall
 

109
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,330
this way it'll crash into that and fall
down here nice and aligned and now what

110
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:08,340
down here nice and aligned and now what
 

111
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,729
down here nice and aligned and now what
happens if a sheep in a minecart goes

112
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:10,739
happens if a sheep in a minecart goes
 

113
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,569
happens if a sheep in a minecart goes
through here they do the whole thing

114
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:16,579
through here they do the whole thing
 

115
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,729
through here they do the whole thing
come back around oh yeah this is all

116
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:19,739
come back around oh yeah this is all
 

117
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,710
come back around oh yeah this is all
this is all not being used that let me

118
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:21,720
this is all not being used that let me
 

119
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,949
this is all not being used that let me
take that out so it doesn't distract you

120
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:23,959
take that out so it doesn't distract you
 

121
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,990
take that out so it doesn't distract you
all right that's all gone let's see it a

122
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,000
all right that's all gone let's see it a
 

123
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,140
all right that's all gone let's see it a
couple more times here so when this is

124
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,150
couple more times here so when this is
 

125
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,210
couple more times here so when this is
open they can fall down they hit this

126
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
open they can fall down they hit this
 

127
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,819
open they can fall down they hit this
detector real instantly this block goes

128
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:34,829
detector real instantly this block goes
 

129
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,150
detector real instantly this block goes
into place so no more she can can go

130
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,160
into place so no more she can can go
 

131
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,729
into place so no more she can can go
down after them it's not till they go

132
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:40,739
down after them it's not till they go
 

133
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,590
down after them it's not till they go
over this detector rail here that this

134
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:42,600
over this detector rail here that this
 

135
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,319
over this detector rail here that this
block gets pushed back over this way

136
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:45,329
block gets pushed back over this way
 

137
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,750
block gets pushed back over this way
from this piston all right and that

138
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
from this piston all right and that
 

139
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,220
from this piston all right and that
allows another sheep to go through so

140
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,230
allows another sheep to go through so
 

141
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,870
allows another sheep to go through so
only one can go through at a time which

142
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:50,880
only one can go through at a time which
 

143
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,210
only one can go through at a time which
is very important otherwise the whole

144
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,220
is very important otherwise the whole
 

145
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,400
is very important otherwise the whole
thing gets messed up so you see this

146
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,410
thing gets messed up so you see this
 

147
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,490
thing gets messed up so you see this
block is still here and now it's out of

148
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,500
block is still here and now it's out of
 

149
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,069
block is still here and now it's out of
the way once once they go through the

150
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:01,079
the way once once they go through the
 

151
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,640
the way once once they go through the
whole jump pad thing so if another sheep

152
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:04,650
whole jump pad thing so if another sheep
 

153
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,410
whole jump pad thing so if another sheep
was to come up it would just wait there

154
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:08,420
was to come up it would just wait there
 

155
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,880
was to come up it would just wait there
until it goes over this detector rail so

156
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:12,890
until it goes over this detector rail so
 

157
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,650
until it goes over this detector rail so
I think that's gonna work out pretty

158
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:14,660
I think that's gonna work out pretty
 

159
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,400
I think that's gonna work out pretty
good all we got to do is make sure we

160
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,410
good all we got to do is make sure we
 

161
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,260
good all we got to do is make sure we
don't let any sheep to flow back this

162
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,270
don't let any sheep to flow back this
 

163
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,909
don't let any sheep to flow back this
way as well so what we'll probably do is

164
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:24,919
way as well so what we'll probably do is
 

165
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,920
way as well so what we'll probably do is
drop them we're gonna run out of space

166
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:28,930
drop them we're gonna run out of space
 

167
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,370
drop them we're gonna run out of space
yep we're totally out of space darn it

168
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,380

 

169
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,210

let me see here

170
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,220
let me see here
 

171
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,340
let me see here
you know I'll finish this off-camera and

172
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,350
you know I'll finish this off-camera and
 

173
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,300
you know I'll finish this off-camera and
I'll just show you and aha yes so it's

174
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,310
I'll just show you and aha yes so it's
 

175
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,150
I'll just show you and aha yes so it's
kind of working

176
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
kind of working
 

177
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,970
kind of working
kinda we'll see if this goes full-scale

178
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:51,980
kinda we'll see if this goes full-scale
 

179
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,860
kinda we'll see if this goes full-scale
we have three minecarts in there right

180
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:53,870
we have three minecarts in there right
 

181
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,460
we have three minecarts in there right
now they're working flawlessly but I

182
00:04:59,460 --> 00:04:59,470
now they're working flawlessly but I
 

183
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,840
now they're working flawlessly but I
think we might have some trouble once we

184
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:01,850
think we might have some trouble once we
 

185
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,330
think we might have some trouble once we
start adding more so this is kind of

186
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,340
start adding more so this is kind of
 

187
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,120
start adding more so this is kind of
what's going on down here this area over

188
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,130
what's going on down here this area over
 

189
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,250
what's going on down here this area over
here is where the sheep reservoir is

190
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,260
here is where the sheep reservoir is
 

191
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,870
here is where the sheep reservoir is
basically let's try out a couple more so

192
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
basically let's try out a couple more so
 

193
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,450
basically let's try out a couple more so
for now I think the minecarts are gonna

194
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,460
for now I think the minecarts are gonna
 

195
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,800
for now I think the minecarts are gonna
staff together oh that one snuck in how

196
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:23,810
staff together oh that one snuck in how
 

197
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:33,190
staff together oh that one snuck in how
to do that what resolved but that wasn't

198
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,200
to do that what resolved but that wasn't
 

199
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,250
to do that what resolved but that wasn't
very good

200
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:35,260
very good
 

201
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,310
very good
I think things will get stable though

202
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
I think things will get stable though
 

203
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,350
I think things will get stable though
when it's running but yeah they're

204
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
when it's running but yeah they're
 

205
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,850
when it's running but yeah they're
definitely bunching together that's not

206
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:44,860
definitely bunching together that's not
 

207
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,200
definitely bunching together that's not
good let's just add a whole bunch and

208
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,210
good let's just add a whole bunch and
 

209
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,200
good let's just add a whole bunch and
just see what happens when things get

210
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,210
just see what happens when things get
 

211
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,710
just see what happens when things get
crazy they're all stacking together it's

212
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
crazy they're all stacking together it's
 

213
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,469
crazy they're all stacking together it's
terrible uh-oh

214
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479

 

215
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,730

no way I don't even think I've ever seen

216
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:08,740
no way I don't even think I've ever seen
 

217
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,469
no way I don't even think I've ever seen
that happen before this is a power rail

218
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
that happen before this is a power rail
 

219
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,659
that happen before this is a power rail
over here they have their interlocking

220
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:15,669
over here they have their interlocking
 

221
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,149
over here they have their interlocking
right now ones going this way ones going

222
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:18,159
right now ones going this way ones going
 

223
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,459
right now ones going this way ones going
to the left and they're like in perfect

224
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:20,469
to the left and they're like in perfect
 

225
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:22,499
to the left and they're like in perfect
strength where they can't defeat each

226
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:22,509
strength where they can't defeat each
 

227
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:27,640
strength where they can't defeat each
other or something I don't know

228
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,650

 

229
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,550

come on no there jamm man I'm pushing up

231
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,310
come on no there jamm man I'm pushing up
and stuff it's not moving at all that

232
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,320
and stuff it's not moving at all that
 

233
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:44,130
and stuff it's not moving at all that
that's insane

234
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,140

 

235
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,700

I'm very sad right now

236
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:47,710
I'm very sad right now
 

237
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,750
I'm very sad right now
very sad darn it's that kind of sucks

238
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:52,760
very sad darn it's that kind of sucks
 

239
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,040
very sad darn it's that kind of sucks
that means we're gonna have to do

240
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,050
that means we're gonna have to do
 

241
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,670
that means we're gonna have to do
something like this instead where we

242
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
something like this instead where we
 

243
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,250
something like this instead where we
control each sheep individually which is

244
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,260
control each sheep individually which is
 

245
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,100
control each sheep individually which is
what I was trying to avoid it's very

246
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,110
what I was trying to avoid it's very
 

247
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,010
what I was trying to avoid it's very
complicated and it takes a lot of space

248
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,020
complicated and it takes a lot of space
 

249
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,210
complicated and it takes a lot of space
so when this minecart would go there

250
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,220
so when this minecart would go there
 

251
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,410
so when this minecart would go there
then we would have to power this

252
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,420
then we would have to power this
 

253
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,590
then we would have to power this
junction which is glitched out for some

254
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:11,600
junction which is glitched out for some
 

255
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,180
junction which is glitched out for some
reason there we go and then the next one

256
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,190
reason there we go and then the next one
 

257
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,970
reason there we go and then the next one
would go to the next one type a thing

258
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:18,980
would go to the next one type a thing
 

259
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,480
would go to the next one type a thing
and then the next one I think I know why

260
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,490
and then the next one I think I know why
 

261
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,000
and then the next one I think I know why
this happens this is a glitch I think it

262
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,010
this happens this is a glitch I think it
 

263
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,330
this happens this is a glitch I think it
has to update no why does that happen

264
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:30,340
has to update no why does that happen
 

265
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:37,660
has to update no why does that happen
it's very strange actually yeah I'm not

266
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:37,670
it's very strange actually yeah I'm not
 

267
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,690
it's very strange actually yeah I'm not
sure what that's about this is gonna

268
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:40,700
sure what that's about this is gonna
 

269
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,980
sure what that's about this is gonna
take a lot of space though and it's

270
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:41,990
take a lot of space though and it's
 

271
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,560
take a lot of space though and it's
gonna be a little bit tricky to do and I

272
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,570
gonna be a little bit tricky to do and I
 

273
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,750
gonna be a little bit tricky to do and I
don't feel like doing it today so I'm

274
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:46,760
don't feel like doing it today so I'm
 

275
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,240
don't feel like doing it today so I'm
not going to oh yeah I took this one way

276
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,250
not going to oh yeah I took this one way
 

277
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,060
not going to oh yeah I took this one way
of course it's not going but it'll run

278
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,070
of course it's not going but it'll run
 

279
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,700
of course it's not going but it'll run
fine with three four right now alright

280
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:57,710
fine with three four right now alright
 

281
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,920
fine with three four right now alright
everybody so what is next on our agenda

where we are
we're in the nether hub we're gonna be

288
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:05,600
we're in the nether hub we're gonna be
 

289
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,170
we're in the nether hub we're gonna be
working on the nether hub today I'm to

290
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,180
working on the nether hub today I'm to
 

291
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,160
working on the nether hub today I'm to
try tackle it

292
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,170
try tackle it
 

293
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,650
try tackle it
so I've talked about it a lot lately how

294
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:11,660
so I've talked about it a lot lately how
 

295
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,960
so I've talked about it a lot lately how
I've wanted to redesign this and redo it

296
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:13,970
I've wanted to redesign this and redo it
 

297
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,480
I've wanted to redesign this and redo it
and make it all all nice and perfect and

298
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,490
and make it all all nice and perfect and
 

299
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,450
and make it all all nice and perfect and
wonderful but honestly I think that's a

300
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:19,460
wonderful but honestly I think that's a
 

301
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,720
wonderful but honestly I think that's a
terrible idea now as great as that

302
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:22,730
terrible idea now as great as that
 

303
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,140
terrible idea now as great as that
sounds there's some flaws with that idea

304
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,150
sounds there's some flaws with that idea
 

305
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,450
sounds there's some flaws with that idea
I think so

306
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:27,460
I think so
 

307
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,400
I think so
here's here's my thinking behind it

308
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,410
here's here's my thinking behind it
 

309
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,580
here's here's my thinking behind it
we've gotten used to this I'm stumbling

310
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:33,590
we've gotten used to this I'm stumbling
 

311
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,000
we've gotten used to this I'm stumbling
a lot I keep saying like we we I I why

that has me worried now it's like a

318
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,190
that has me worried now it's like a
 

319
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,270
that has me worried now it's like a
speech problem do i I don't normally do

320
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,280
speech problem do i I don't normally do
 

321
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,720
speech problem do i I don't normally do
that do I

322
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,730
that do I
 

323
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,550
that do I
I hope not I think it's just in this

324
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:51,560
I hope not I think it's just in this
 

325
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,340
I hope not I think it's just in this
clip for some reason alright anyway

326
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,350
clip for some reason alright anyway
 

327
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,250
clip for some reason alright anyway
so we've gotten used to this I'm sort of

328
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,260
so we've gotten used to this I'm sort of
 

329
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,870
so we've gotten used to this I'm sort of
nostalgic with it I'm sure you guys are

330
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
nostalgic with it I'm sure you guys are
 

331
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,750
nostalgic with it I'm sure you guys are
as well even though I I could do it

332
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
as well even though I I could do it
 

333
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,720
as well even though I I could do it
better if I redid it today that is

334
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:04,730
better if I redid it today that is
 

335
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,820
better if I redid it today that is
basically time that we would take away

336
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,830
basically time that we would take away
 

337
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,350
basically time that we would take away
from doing other things in our world

338
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,360
from doing other things in our world
 

339
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,880
from doing other things in our world
because we would have to tear this all

340
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:09,890
because we would have to tear this all
 

341
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,570
because we would have to tear this all
down spend time redoing it and like even

342
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:13,580
down spend time redoing it and like even
 

343
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,510
down spend time redoing it and like even
this tunnel here for example this this

344
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:16,520
this tunnel here for example this this
 

345
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,160
this tunnel here for example this this
tunnel is pretty plain and boring I

346
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,170
tunnel is pretty plain and boring I
 

347
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,430
tunnel is pretty plain and boring I
don't totally liked it anymore but I

348
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
don't totally liked it anymore but I
 

349
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,860
don't totally liked it anymore but I
spent hours and hours building this

350
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:23,870
spent hours and hours building this
 

351
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,320
spent hours and hours building this
thing and that would be hours and hours

352
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,330
thing and that would be hours and hours
 

353
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,860
thing and that would be hours and hours
we would have to spend redoing it you

354
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:29,870
we would have to spend redoing it you
 

355
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,550
we would have to spend redoing it you
know so that doesn't sound too appealing

356
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
know so that doesn't sound too appealing
 

357
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,830
know so that doesn't sound too appealing
it is what it is I think we just have to

358
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:35,840
it is what it is I think we just have to
 

359
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,280
it is what it is I think we just have to
accept it and rather let's focus on

360
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,290
accept it and rather let's focus on
 

361
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,990
accept it and rather let's focus on
making other things that we build nice

362
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,000
making other things that we build nice
 

363
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,510
making other things that we build nice
instead of deconstructing and

364
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:43,520
instead of deconstructing and
 

365
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,460
instead of deconstructing and
reconstructing let's just focus on

366
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:45,470
reconstructing let's just focus on
 

367
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,650
reconstructing let's just focus on
constructing but that said look at this

368
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:50,660
constructing but that said look at this
 

369
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,050
constructing but that said look at this
like it's not done we never did actually

370
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,060
like it's not done we never did actually
 

371
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,990
like it's not done we never did actually
finish it so that's that's what we're

372
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
finish it so that's that's what we're
 

373
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,810
finish it so that's that's what we're
gonna try to do today I've gotten so

374
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:58,820
gonna try to do today I've gotten so
 

375
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,730
gonna try to do today I've gotten so
used to this netherrack ceiling though I

376
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:00,740
used to this netherrack ceiling though I
 

377
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,070
used to this netherrack ceiling though I
don't know if we could really change it

378
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,080
don't know if we could really change it
 

379
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,810
don't know if we could really change it
to any other colour the only thing I

380
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:04,820
to any other colour the only thing I
 

381
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,420
to any other colour the only thing I
could think of I want it to look

382
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,430
could think of I want it to look
 

383
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,190
could think of I want it to look
finished but at the same time I don't

384
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
finished but at the same time I don't
 

385
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,590
finished but at the same time I don't
think we can really change it because it

386
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
think we can really change it because it
 

387
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,710
think we can really change it because it
would throw me off so much but we might

388
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
would throw me off so much but we might
 

389
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,580
would throw me off so much but we might
be able to do another brick yeah I think

390
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:18,590
be able to do another brick yeah I think
 

391
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,150
be able to do another brick yeah I think
I think I could handle that originally I

392
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
I think I could handle that originally I
 

393
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,910
I think I could handle that originally I
was gonna make a dome dome ceiling which

394
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:24,920
was gonna make a dome dome ceiling which
 

395
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,250
was gonna make a dome dome ceiling which
is big basically the shape it is right

396
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:27,260
is big basically the shape it is right
 

397
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,600
is big basically the shape it is right
now this a little rough in in places I

398
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:31,610
now this a little rough in in places I
 

399
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,060
now this a little rough in in places I
also originally plan on having lights

400
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,070
also originally plan on having lights
 

401
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,980
also originally plan on having lights
all around it with like a minecart going

402
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:35,990
all around it with like a minecart going
 

403
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,430
all around it with like a minecart going
around and lighting those up I might try

404
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:38,440
around and lighting those up I might try
 

405
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,630
around and lighting those up I might try
to do that still ignore the voicecrack

406
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:43,640
to do that still ignore the voicecrack
 

407
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,930
to do that still ignore the voicecrack
there by the way I I tried not to bring

408
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:46,940
there by the way I I tried not to bring
 

409
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,130
there by the way I I tried not to bring
attention to it but I couldn't help

410
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,140
attention to it but I couldn't help
 

411
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,290
attention to it but I couldn't help
myself

412
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:49,300
myself
 

413
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,730
myself
so yeah that's that's what I'm gonna do

414
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:51,740
so yeah that's that's what I'm gonna do
 

415
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,560
so yeah that's that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna first do the ceiling with

416
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,570
I'm gonna first do the ceiling with
 

417
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,900
I'm gonna first do the ceiling with
nether brick also with the ground like

418
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:55,910
nether brick also with the ground like
 

419
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,200
nether brick also with the ground like
it's all one one type of block maybe we

420
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,210
it's all one one type of block maybe we
 

421
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,470
it's all one one type of block maybe we
could try mix in some stuff I have no

422
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
could try mix in some stuff I have no
 

423
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,600
could try mix in some stuff I have no
problem with refinement it's just the

424
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:04,610
problem with refinement it's just the
 

425
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,810
problem with refinement it's just the
whole total reconstructing I think I

426
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:07,820
whole total reconstructing I think I
 

427
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:07,990
whole total reconstructing I think I
would

428
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
would
 

429
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,190
would
regret later but maybe bring character

430
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,200
regret later but maybe bring character
 

431
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,970
regret later but maybe bring character
to it we could try mixing another type

432
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:15,980
to it we could try mixing another type
 

433
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,410
to it we could try mixing another type
of block I don't know if this is the

434
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:17,420
of block I don't know if this is the
 

435
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,110
of block I don't know if this is the
right type probably not

436
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
right type probably not
 

437
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,610
right type probably not
I don't like cow likes sandstone is very

438
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:27,620
I don't like cow likes sandstone is very
 

439
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,870
I don't like cow likes sandstone is very
clean-looking

440
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
clean-looking
 

441
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,000
clean-looking
this has like lines around each of the

442
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,010
this has like lines around each of the
 

443
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,750
this has like lines around each of the
blocks which is very distracting so that

444
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:34,760
blocks which is very distracting so that
 

445
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,790
blocks which is very distracting so that
might not be the right block to use but

446
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
might not be the right block to use but
 

447
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,870
might not be the right block to use but
maybe we'll find something all right I

448
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
maybe we'll find something all right I
 

449
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
maybe we'll find something all right I
think it's also a good idea to try get

450
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,010
think it's also a good idea to try get
 

451
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,500
think it's also a good idea to try get
rid of all this wood we placed earlier

452
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,510
rid of all this wood we placed earlier
 

453
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,450
rid of all this wood we placed earlier
oops

454
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:46,460
oops
 

455
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,610
oops
I tried redoing the nether hub before

456
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:48,620
I tried redoing the nether hub before
 

457
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,380
I tried redoing the nether hub before
and failed that's what all this wood is

458
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:50,390
and failed that's what all this wood is
 

459
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,870
and failed that's what all this wood is
about I never really got too far with it

460
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
about I never really got too far with it
 

461
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,410
about I never really got too far with it
but nether brick is probably better than

462
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,420
but nether brick is probably better than
 

463
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,290
but nether brick is probably better than
than the wood it actually goes with the

464
00:11:59,290 --> 00:11:59,300
than the wood it actually goes with the
 

465
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,390
than the wood it actually goes with the
purple pretty good too because it's it's

466
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:01,400
purple pretty good too because it's it's
 

467
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,250
purple pretty good too because it's it's
burgundy right which is red and purple

468
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:03,260
burgundy right which is red and purple
 

469
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,430
burgundy right which is red and purple
um yeah I think that's okay I'd like

470
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
um yeah I think that's okay I'd like
 

471
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,360
um yeah I think that's okay I'd like
that

472
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,370
that
 

473
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,070
that
something it needs work yet okay so I

474
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,080
something it needs work yet okay so I
 

475
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,110
something it needs work yet okay so I
threw in a thing of lights here just to

476
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
threw in a thing of lights here just to
 

477

take a look here so I decided to add
these weird shapes to the ground because

584
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:07,670
these weird shapes to the ground because
 

585
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,430
these weird shapes to the ground because
couldn't really find anything that went

well with the sandstone and that kind of
 

589
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,740
well with the sandstone and that kind of

thing here had a pretty good idea I

634
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
thing here had a pretty good idea I
 

635
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,389
thing here had a pretty good idea I
think yeah over here let's grab this the

636
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:29,399
think yeah over here let's grab this the
 

637
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,819
think yeah over here let's grab this the
carpets we didn't have carpet when I

638
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:31,829
carpets we didn't have carpet when I
 

639
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:34,340
carpets we didn't have carpet when I
built this originally and I never really

640
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,350
built this originally and I never really
 

641
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,629
built this originally and I never really
liked these lights here that's why I

642
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:35,639
liked these lights here that's why I
 

643
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,069
liked these lights here that's why I
have them in the corner so you can't

644
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:37,079
have them in the corner so you can't
 

645
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,049
have them in the corner so you can't
really see them unless you're up close

646
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:39,059
really see them unless you're up close
 

647
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:41,809
really see them unless you're up close
but if we have carpet we can just go

648
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:41,819
but if we have carpet we can just go
 

649
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:45,230
but if we have carpet we can just go
over top all of this and hide the

650
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,240
over top all of this and hide the
 

651
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,179
over top all of this and hide the
lighting that's other thing this room's

652
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:47,189
lighting that's other thing this room's
 

653
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,189
lighting that's other thing this room's
pretty dark right now we will be putting

654
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
pretty dark right now we will be putting
 

655
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,019
pretty dark right now we will be putting
or turning these lights on pretty soon

656
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:53,029
or turning these lights on pretty soon
 

657
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,340
or turning these lights on pretty soon
we might need to get some lighting in

658
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,350
we might need to get some lighting in
 

659
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,809
we might need to get some lighting in
the middle though because it is fairly

660
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:56,819
the middle though because it is fairly
 

661
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:01,309
the middle though because it is fairly
dark but yeah I'm gonna go all around

662
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:01,319
dark but yeah I'm gonna go all around
 

663
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,789
dark but yeah I'm gonna go all around
with this and then I think what we'll do

664
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
with this and then I think what we'll do
 

665
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,919
with this and then I think what we'll do
next is try to hook these up yeah you

666
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:09,929
next is try to hook these up yeah you
 

667
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,929
next is try to hook these up yeah you
know what the more I look at this the

668
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:11,939
know what the more I look at this the
 

669
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,149
know what the more I look at this the
more I feel like the ice just needs to

670
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:14,159
more I feel like the ice just needs to
 

671
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,090
more I feel like the ice just needs to
get out of here you know it doesn't

672
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,100
get out of here you know it doesn't
 

673
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,189
get out of here you know it doesn't
quite suit the building but I want to

674
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
quite suit the building but I want to
 

675
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,480
quite suit the building but I want to
see what you guys have to say about this

676
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,490
see what you guys have to say about this
 

677
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,710
see what you guys have to say about this
so make sure you leave your feedback

678
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:21,720
so make sure you leave your feedback
 

679
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,130
so make sure you leave your feedback
about the design and how how your eyes

680
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,140
about the design and how how your eyes
 

681
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,169
about the design and how how your eyes
hurts from looking at it and all that

682
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:27,179
hurts from looking at it and all that
 

683
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,270
hurts from looking at it and all that
kind of stuff we could change this out

684
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,280
kind of stuff we could change this out
 

685
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,330
kind of stuff we could change this out
with sandstone though would probably

686
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:35,340
with sandstone though would probably
 

687
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,520
with sandstone though would probably
look pretty good anyway we're gonna

688
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,530
look pretty good anyway we're gonna
 

689
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,039
look pretty good anyway we're gonna
focus on these lights next so

690
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,049
focus on these lights next so
 

691
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,019
focus on these lights next so
instead of doing the Micra thing I'm

692
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:43,029
instead of doing the Micra thing I'm
 

693
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,200
instead of doing the Micra thing I'm
going to try do the chicken power thing

694
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,210
going to try do the chicken power thing
 

695
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,690
going to try do the chicken power thing
I'm gonna have to oh whoops

696
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm gonna have to oh whoops
 

697
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,340
I'm gonna have to oh whoops
yeah we're gonna have to remove a lot of

698
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,350
yeah we're gonna have to remove a lot of
 

699
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,419
yeah we're gonna have to remove a lot of
blocks actually so I'm gonna do it like

700
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:54,429
blocks actually so I'm gonna do it like
 

701
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:59,960
blocks actually so I'm gonna do it like
this let's go up here remove all these

702
00:17:59,960 --> 00:17:59,970
this let's go up here remove all these
 

703
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:10,759
this let's go up here remove all these
and although trying to think here

704
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:10,769
and although trying to think here
 

705
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,749
and although trying to think here
because some of these lights are on a

706
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:12,759
because some of these lights are on a
 

707
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,970
because some of these lights are on a
diagnose this is gonna be a bit tricky

708
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:14,980
diagnose this is gonna be a bit tricky
 

709
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,460
diagnose this is gonna be a bit tricky
to do the way I want but we'll have

710
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,470
to do the way I want but we'll have
 

711
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,470
to do the way I want but we'll have
chickens running around up here and

712
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:21,480

 

713
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,470

probably want least one block up from

714
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:25,480
probably want least one block up from
 

715
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,299
probably want least one block up from
these lights oops

716
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:27,309
these lights oops
 

717
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:31,349
these lights oops
trapped so pressure plate on here if

718
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:31,359
trapped so pressure plate on here if
 

719
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,149
trapped so pressure plate on here if
they step on the pressure plates they'll

720
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:33,159
they step on the pressure plates they'll
 

721
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,999
they step on the pressure plates they'll
turn on the lights and it'll be kind of

722
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,009
turn on the lights and it'll be kind of
 

723
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:39,570
turn on the lights and it'll be kind of
random this here though for the

724
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:39,580
random this here though for the
 

725
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,669
random this here though for the
diagonals who might put a pressure plate

726
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
diagonals who might put a pressure plate
 

727
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,799
diagonals who might put a pressure plate
down here cuz otherwise they'll walk

728
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:46,809
down here cuz otherwise they'll walk
 

729
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,759
down here cuz otherwise they'll walk
here and then the lights will be on and

730
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:49,769
here and then the lights will be on and
 

731
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,779
here and then the lights will be on and
then they'll walk here and they'll turn

732
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:51,789
then they'll walk here and they'll turn
 

733
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:59,759
then they'll walk here and they'll turn
on might look a little weird or we could

734
00:18:59,759 --> 00:18:59,769
on might look a little weird or we could
 

735
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,609
on might look a little weird or we could
just keep everything on the light level

736
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:01,619
just keep everything on the light level
 

737
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:05,029
just keep everything on the light level
put all the pressure plates down here

738
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
put all the pressure plates down here
 

739
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,590
put all the pressure plates down here
yeah I'm gonna try that first maybe

740
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600

 

741
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,659

alright guys so this is an example of

742
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:12,669
alright guys so this is an example of
 

743
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,720
alright guys so this is an example of
the chicken power got three chickens up

744
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:15,730
the chicken power got three chickens up
 

745
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,070
the chicken power got three chickens up
in the pressure plates there and they're

746
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,080
in the pressure plates there and they're
 

747
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,549
in the pressure plates there and they're
free to walk around but I think it might

748
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
free to walk around but I think it might
 

749
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,080
free to walk around but I think it might
be a failure they don't really move

750
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,090
be a failure they don't really move
 

751
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,139
be a failure they don't really move
around a lot they also tend to group up

752
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:25,149
around a lot they also tend to group up
 

753
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:27,960
around a lot they also tend to group up
quite often like there's two over there

754
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:27,970
quite often like there's two over there
 

755
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,419
quite often like there's two over there
and one over there

756
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:30,429
and one over there
 

757
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,909
and one over there
not too sure the main thing I don't like

758
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:32,919
not too sure the main thing I don't like
 

759
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,210
not too sure the main thing I don't like
about those them noise you can hear them

760
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,220
about those them noise you can hear them
 

761
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,029
about those them noise you can hear them
I don't like that because if we have one

762
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
I don't like that because if we have one
 

763
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,519
I don't like that because if we have one
in each corner anywhere you are in the

764
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:41,529
in each corner anywhere you are in the
 

765
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:43,159
in each corner anywhere you are in the
nether hub you'll probably hear them

766
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:43,169
nether hub you'll probably hear them
 

767
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:45,840
nether hub you'll probably hear them
unless you're right in the center here

768
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:45,850
unless you're right in the center here
 

769
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,870
unless you're right in the center here
maybe

770
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880

 

771
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,940

because you got to be 16 blocks away

772
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:50,950
because you got to be 16 blocks away
 

773
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,350
because you got to be 16 blocks away
from them for to not hear them so yeah

774
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
from them for to not hear them so yeah
 

775
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,900
from them for to not hear them so yeah
we probably will go for a minecart or a

776
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:57,910
we probably will go for a minecart or a
 

777
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,860
we probably will go for a minecart or a
red stone controlled system what else

778
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:01,870
red stone controlled system what else
 

779
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,200
red stone controlled system what else
what else this is another big thing we

780
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,210
what else this is another big thing we
 

781
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,640
what else this is another big thing we
got to work on with the nether hub I

782
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:05,650
got to work on with the nether hub I
 

783
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,130
got to work on with the nether hub I
took this thing out for for a ride today

784
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:08,140
took this thing out for for a ride today
 

785
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,960
took this thing out for for a ride today
all right Rick I was using this I use

786
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:09,970
all right Rick I was using this I use
 

787
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,750
all right Rick I was using this I use
this quite often for some reason a horse

788
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:12,760
this quite often for some reason a horse
 

789
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,630
this quite often for some reason a horse
died in it today I hit this buttons to

790
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:15,640
died in it today I hit this buttons to
 

791
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,820
died in it today I hit this buttons to
swap them and like the horse just went

792
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:17,830
swap them and like the horse just went
 

793
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,040
swap them and like the horse just went
underground through the slime blocks but

794
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,050
underground through the slime blocks but
 

795
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,290
underground through the slime blocks but
yeah this thing's really cool it's not

796
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:25,300
yeah this thing's really cool it's not
 

797
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,270
yeah this thing's really cool it's not
fully effective right now though because

798
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
fully effective right now though because
 

799
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,800
fully effective right now though because
like if we go out this way this is where

800
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:31,810
like if we go out this way this is where
 

801
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,510
like if we go out this way this is where
we go to get to the amplified base by

802
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
we go to get to the amplified base by
 

803
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,870
we go to get to the amplified base by
the way the tunnels aren't really done

804
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
the way the tunnels aren't really done
 

805
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,820
the way the tunnels aren't really done
like at all it's kind of dangerous to

806
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:41,830
like at all it's kind of dangerous to
 

807
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,530
like at all it's kind of dangerous to
walk here sometimes there's gas that

808
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:43,540
walk here sometimes there's gas that
 

809
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,260
walk here sometimes there's gas that
shoot at us so we got a lot of tunnels

810
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,270
shoot at us so we got a lot of tunnels
 

811
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,380
shoot at us so we got a lot of tunnels
we need to build and they take a lot of

812
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,390
we need to build and they take a lot of
 

813
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:56,040
we need to build and they take a lot of
time a lot of time over here is the Mesa

814
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,050
time a lot of time over here is the Mesa
 

815
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,660
time a lot of time over here is the Mesa
biome this is where I get hardened clay

816
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:57,670
biome this is where I get hardened clay
 

817
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,750
biome this is where I get hardened clay
from but then further on here's where we

818
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:00,760
from but then further on here's where we
 

819
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,510
from but then further on here's where we
especially have a problem no we got a

820
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,520
especially have a problem no we got a
 

821
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,510
especially have a problem no we got a
guest yeah this is like the end of the

822
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:06,520
guest yeah this is like the end of the
 

823
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,540
guest yeah this is like the end of the
line this is not the amplified base here

824
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:09,550
line this is not the amplified base here
 

825
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,970
line this is not the amplified base here
it's a little bit further down down here

826
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:11,980
it's a little bit further down down here
 

827
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,870
it's a little bit further down down here
and the thing is like we came and get a

828
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:15,880
and the thing is like we came and get a
 

829
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,270
and the thing is like we came and get a
horse down here right now so we got a

830
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,280
horse down here right now so we got a
 

831
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,810
horse down here right now so we got a
lot of work to do with our nether hub

832
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:21,820
lot of work to do with our nether hub
 

833
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,590
lot of work to do with our nether hub
for it to actually be effective this

834
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
for it to actually be effective this
 

835
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,650
for it to actually be effective this
portal I might just take down let's go

836
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:28,660
portal I might just take down let's go
 

837
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,000

check this out I don't think there was

838
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,010
check this out I don't think there was
 

839
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,430
check this out I don't think there was
anything here this is if I remember

anything here this is if I remember
 

841
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,200
anything here this is if I remember

oh all the snows gone
 

847
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,760
oh all the snows gone
oh no it's up there okay yeah I think

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,770
oh no it's up there okay yeah I think
 

849
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,470
oh no it's up there okay yeah I think
when we first went to the amplified

850
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
when we first went to the amplified
 

851
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,840
when we first went to the amplified
terrain this is like where we first came

852
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:48,850
terrain this is like where we first came
 

853
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,350
terrain this is like where we first came
out and saw it for the first time how

854
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:52,360
out and saw it for the first time how
 

855
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,450
out and saw it for the first time how
many first can I squeeze into that

856
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:54,460
many first can I squeeze into that
 

857
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,480

but there's not actually anything bill T

860
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,350
but there's not actually anything bill T
 

861
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,380
but there's not actually anything bill T
or nothing we need here so I think we'll

862
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:01,390
or nothing we need here so I think we'll
 

863
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,240
or nothing we need here so I think we'll
take this portal out for sure cuz it

864
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,250
take this portal out for sure cuz it
 

865
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,600
take this portal out for sure cuz it
just confuses me sometimes I forget what

866
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:09,610
just confuses me sometimes I forget what
 

867
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,520
just confuses me sometimes I forget what
it's for but anyways guys that's gonna

868
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:14,530
it's for but anyways guys that's gonna
 

869
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,380
it's for but anyways guys that's gonna
have to be a project for another day

870
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,390
have to be a project for another day
 

871
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,120
have to be a project for another day
we're gonna have to wrap this episode up

872
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,130
we're gonna have to wrap this episode up
 

873
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,020
we're gonna have to wrap this episode up
so got a comment there's a zombie nearby

874
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,030
so got a comment there's a zombie nearby
 

875
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,540
so got a comment there's a zombie nearby
I think he's outside though we're fine

876
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:24,550
I think he's outside though we're fine
 

877
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,000
I think he's outside though we're fine
and we got a new librarian here too

878
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,010
and we got a new librarian here too
 

879
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,780
and we got a new librarian here too
which is cool

880
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:27,790
which is cool
 

881
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,880
which is cool
um so comet says a etho for your 400th

882
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:32,890
um so comet says a etho for your 400th
 

883
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,070
um so comet says a etho for your 400th
episode I was asking suggestions for

884
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,080
episode I was asking suggestions for
 

885
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,140
episode I was asking suggestions for
that it says you should make another

886
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,150
that it says you should make another
 

887
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,800
that it says you should make another
Rube Goldberg machine like you tried to

888
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:40,810
Rube Goldberg machine like you tried to
 

889
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,230
Rube Goldberg machine like you tried to
do in your first world redstone has

890
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,240
do in your first world redstone has
 

891
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,480
do in your first world redstone has
advanced a lot since then and there are

892
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,490
advanced a lot since then and there are
 

893
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,270
advanced a lot since then and there are
all sorts of new new mechanics to

894
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,280
all sorts of new new mechanics to
 

895
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,510
all sorts of new new mechanics to
Minecraft I think you should do a

896
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
Minecraft I think you should do a
 

897
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,370
Minecraft I think you should do a
segment of the machine for every 10

898
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:53,380
segment of the machine for every 10
 

899
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,940
segment of the machine for every 10
episodes so 40 segments I would oh oh

900
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:58,950
episodes so 40 segments I would oh oh
 

901
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,190
episodes so 40 segments I would oh oh
that's a big project I was so excited

902
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,200
that's a big project I was so excited
 

903
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,570
that's a big project I was so excited
when I found out you were going to make

904
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:03,580
when I found out you were going to make
 

905
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,120
when I found out you were going to make
one but then you didn't I think you

906
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,130
one but then you didn't I think you
 

907
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,780
one but then you didn't I think you
should try again I actually really liked

908
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:09,790
should try again I actually really liked
 

909
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,400
should try again I actually really liked
the suggestion I think it would be fun

910
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,410
the suggestion I think it would be fun
 

911
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,160
the suggestion I think it would be fun
to try it again a lot of you probably

912
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,170
to try it again a lot of you probably
 

913
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,960
to try it again a lot of you probably
don't even remember that it was so long

914
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:15,970
don't even remember that it was so long
 

915
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,650
don't even remember that it was so long
ago but in my old world we spent a bit

916
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:19,660
ago but in my old world we spent a bit
 

917
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,890
ago but in my old world we spent a bit
of time trying to make one but the

918
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:22,900
of time trying to make one but the
 

919
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,770
of time trying to make one but the
problem I had when I tried it originally

920
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:25,780
problem I had when I tried it originally
 

921
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,580
problem I had when I tried it originally
is I did a lot of stuff that relied on

922
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,590
is I did a lot of stuff that relied on
 

923
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,340
is I did a lot of stuff that relied on
random chance those very unlikely the

924
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,350
random chance those very unlikely the
 

925
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,870
random chance those very unlikely the
machine would work and also I did a lot

926
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
machine would work and also I did a lot
 

927
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,170
machine would work and also I did a lot
of stuff that was kind of slow and would

928
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:40,180
of stuff that was kind of slow and would
 

929
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,990
of stuff that was kind of slow and would
take a long time to actually activate so

930
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,000
take a long time to actually activate so
 

931
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,690
take a long time to actually activate so
yeah kind of learnt a few things from

932
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:45,700
yeah kind of learnt a few things from
 

933
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,110
yeah kind of learnt a few things from
that first one but it was unfortunately

934
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,120
that first one but it was unfortunately
 

935
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,260
that first one but it was unfortunately
not that great but I would like to try

936
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,270
not that great but I would like to try
 

937
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,910
not that great but I would like to try
it again if you guys think that's a good

938
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:53,920
it again if you guys think that's a good
 

939
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,730
it again if you guys think that's a good
idea

940
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:55,740
idea
 

941
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,760
idea
