lights up here now they show us what

32
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:55,770
lights up here now they show us what
 

33
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,950
lights up here now they show us what
code we have selected at the moment so

34
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:57,960
code we have selected at the moment so
 

35
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,549
code we have selected at the moment so
if we press three for example that would

36
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:01,559
if we press three for example that would
 

37
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,770
if we press three for example that would
be one one zero zero so one one zero

38
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:06,780
be one one zero zero so one one zero
 

39
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,200
be one one zero zero so one one zero
zero if we press it again it applies to

40
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,210
zero if we press it again it applies to
 

41
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,250
zero if we press it again it applies to
the other other set of memory here and

42
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,260
the other other set of memory here and
 

43
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,020
the other other set of memory here and
by doing this we can choose what item we

44
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,030
by doing this we can choose what item we
 

45
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,580
by doing this we can choose what item we
want to get out of the Nexus depending

46
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:16,590
want to get out of the Nexus depending
 

47
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,440
want to get out of the Nexus depending
on what code we enter and we can

48
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,450
on what code we enter and we can
 

49
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,240
on what code we enter and we can
actually see what code we have selected

50
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,250
actually see what code we have selected
 

51
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,499
actually see what code we have selected
now which is really cool

52
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:21,509

good oh man this is all so complicated
and messy it's crazy that's my goal

134
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:52,430
and messy it's crazy that's my goal
 

135

and messy it's crazy that's my goal
though I got to refine this make it

136
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:53,900
though I got to refine this make it
 

137
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,309
though I got to refine this make it
perfect and eventually maybe with enough

138
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:57,319
perfect and eventually maybe with enough
 

139
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,780

persistence we will work out all the
 

141
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,759
persistence we will work out all the
kinks here that looks good we have the

142
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:00,769
kinks here that looks good we have the
 

143
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,599
kinks here that looks good we have the

be okay I don't know why that top row
there was messed up

162
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:25,909
there was messed up
 

163
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:26,440
there was messed up
the other

164
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,450
the other
 

165
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,960
the other
Rose seemed okay but I'll have to look

166
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:28,970
Rose seemed okay but I'll have to look
 

167
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,450
Rose seemed okay but I'll have to look
over it a little bit better you know

168
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:31,460
over it a little bit better you know
 

169
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,980
over it a little bit better you know
what it is I think I just solved the

170
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,990
what it is I think I just solved the
 

171
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,690
what it is I think I just solved the
mystery like I just checked all the

172
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:34,700
mystery like I just checked all the
 

173
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,330
mystery like I just checked all the
droppers some of them had stone in quite

174
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:37,340
droppers some of them had stone in quite
 

175
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,190
droppers some of them had stone in quite
a few of them had stone in some had dirt

176
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,200
a few of them had stone in some had dirt
 

177
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,040
a few of them had stone in some had dirt
in some had other random things like as

178
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,050
in some had other random things like as
 

179
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,100
in some had other random things like as
we were doing tests we we were putting

180
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,110
we were doing tests we we were putting
 

181
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,850
we were doing tests we we were putting
items into the droppers and I think also

182
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:47,860
items into the droppers and I think also
 

183
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,160
items into the droppers and I think also
before I put in the filters like like

184
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,170
before I put in the filters like like
 

185
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,610
before I put in the filters like like
the item here um I was digging out this

186
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:54,620
the item here um I was digging out this
 

187
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,680
the item here um I was digging out this
room and and stone was like falling from

188
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:56,690
room and and stone was like falling from
 

189
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,980
room and and stone was like falling from
the ceiling into these hoppers and that

190
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,990
the ceiling into these hoppers and that
 

191
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,290
the ceiling into these hoppers and that
still was in the dropper from before I

192
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,300
still was in the dropper from before I
 

193
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,260
still was in the dropper from before I
never cleaned them out so it's not

194
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,270
never cleaned them out so it's not
 

195
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,560
never cleaned them out so it's not
because it got sorted him properly

196
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,570
because it got sorted him properly
 

197
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,540
because it got sorted him properly
also there was filler blocks in some of

198
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:10,550
also there was filler blocks in some of
 

199
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,810
also there was filler blocks in some of
these because like ender pearls

200
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:12,820
these because like ender pearls
 

201
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,060
these because like ender pearls
well maybe not maybe not if we if we put

202
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,070
well maybe not maybe not if we if we put
 

203
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,230
well maybe not maybe not if we if we put
one of these in here is that messed it

204
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,240
one of these in here is that messed it
 

205
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,230
one of these in here is that messed it
up no it's good okay that's good so I

206
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
up no it's good okay that's good so I
 

207
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,390
up no it's good okay that's good so I
think it's all all fine I think it's all

208
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
think it's all all fine I think it's all
 

209
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,760
think it's all all fine I think it's all
good just some random junk fell in the

210
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:24,770
good just some random junk fell in the
 

211
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,500
good just some random junk fell in the
hoppers and I never clean it out from

212
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,510
hoppers and I never clean it out from
 

213
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,870
hoppers and I never clean it out from
long ago not not now okay so now guys we

214
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:31,880
long ago not not now okay so now guys we
 

215
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,700
long ago not not now okay so now guys we
are doing some benchmarking here trying

216
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:33,710
are doing some benchmarking here trying
 

217
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,470
are doing some benchmarking here trying
to figure out how fast the Nexus

218
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:35,480
to figure out how fast the Nexus
 

219
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,680
to figure out how fast the Nexus
actually is I put it in a random code

220
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:38,690
actually is I put it in a random code
 

221
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,780
actually is I put it in a random code
and it was for pink wall I found out so

222
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:40,790
and it was for pink wall I found out so
 

223
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,880
and it was for pink wall I found out so
I just tracked it down here turns out

224
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:42,890
I just tracked it down here turns out
 

225
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,740
I just tracked it down here turns out
it's a at the very end of the Nexus

226
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:44,750
it's a at the very end of the Nexus
 

227
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,470
it's a at the very end of the Nexus
pretty much so it's about as far as an

228
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:47,480
pretty much so it's about as far as an
 

229
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,990
pretty much so it's about as far as an
item can travel to get to us it's got to

230
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
item can travel to get to us it's got to
 

231
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,930
item can travel to get to us it's got to
go all the way down here and then fall

232
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:52,940
go all the way down here and then fall
 

233
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,930
go all the way down here and then fall
down go to go through a whole bunch of

234
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:55,940
down go to go through a whole bunch of
 

235
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,660
down go to go through a whole bunch of
ice streams eventually it winds up in

236
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,670
ice streams eventually it winds up in
 

237
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,260
ice streams eventually it winds up in
the middle load all the way over here so

238
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,270
the middle load all the way over here so
 

239
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,900
the middle load all the way over here so
if we request an item this is the code

240
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:04,910
if we request an item this is the code
 

241
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,170
if we request an item this is the code
for pink wool apparently so if we pull

242
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,180
for pink wool apparently so if we pull
 

243
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,930
for pink wool apparently so if we pull
this as soon as we pull this lever the

244
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:10,940
this as soon as we pull this lever the
 

245
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,700
this as soon as we pull this lever the
time it takes for the pink wool to get

246
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:12,710
time it takes for the pink wool to get
 

247
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,880
time it takes for the pink wool to get
here is kind of what I'm checking and it

248
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:15,890
here is kind of what I'm checking and it
 

249
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,080
here is kind of what I'm checking and it
is a little bit long unfortunately items

250
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,090
is a little bit long unfortunately items
 

251
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,200
is a little bit long unfortunately items
can only travel so fast you know

252
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,210
can only travel so fast you know
 

253
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,750
can only travel so fast you know
it's like maybe 10 seconds oh no that

254
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:28,760
it's like maybe 10 seconds oh no that
 

255
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,660
it's like maybe 10 seconds oh no that
was not 10 seconds I just checked our

256
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:31,670
was not 10 seconds I just checked our
 

257
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,550
was not 10 seconds I just checked our
video here to be precise and that was

258
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:33,560
video here to be precise and that was
 

259
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,590
video here to be precise and that was
about 17 seconds so at the max from the

260
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:38,600
about 17 seconds so at the max from the
 

261
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,150
about 17 seconds so at the max from the
time we pull the lever to

262
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
time we pull the lever to
 

263
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,460
time we pull the lever to
about 17 seconds for our request to get

264
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:42,470
about 17 seconds for our request to get
 

265
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,340
about 17 seconds for our request to get
delivered plus the amount of time it

266
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,350
delivered plus the amount of time it
 

267
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,220
delivered plus the amount of time it
takes for us to to get the item so it

268
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,230
takes for us to to get the item so it
 

269
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,200
takes for us to to get the item so it
takes point 2 seconds per item per item

270
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,210
takes point 2 seconds per item per item
 

271
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,140
takes point 2 seconds per item per item
yeah per it and if we're requesting 64

272
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,150
yeah per it and if we're requesting 64
 

273
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,090
yeah per it and if we're requesting 64
like a stack of items times point to

274
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,100
like a stack of items times point to
 

275
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,530
like a stack of items times point to
that is twelve point eight seconds so

276
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:08,540
that is twelve point eight seconds so
 

277
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,990
that is twelve point eight seconds so
seventeen plus twelve point eight at the

278
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,000
seventeen plus twelve point eight at the
 

279
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,270
seventeen plus twelve point eight at the
most like to get to request the stack of

280
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
most like to get to request the stack of
 

281
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,070
most like to get to request the stack of
items it'll take about thirty seconds

282
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,080
items it'll take about thirty seconds
 

283
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,740
items it'll take about thirty seconds
for it to get here so that's that's

284
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:17,750
for it to get here so that's that's
 

285
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,660
for it to get here so that's that's
reasonable I would say for only

286
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:19,670
reasonable I would say for only
 

287
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,700
reasonable I would say for only
requesting white one item though and

288
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:21,710
requesting white one item though and
 

289
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,830
requesting white one item though and
it's close to us it might take it only

290
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
it's close to us it might take it only
 

291
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,110
it's close to us it might take it only
ten seconds or so so there's going to be

292
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,120
ten seconds or so so there's going to be
 

293
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,330
ten seconds or so so there's going to be
a little bit of variation within how

294
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:28,340
a little bit of variation within how
 

295
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
a little bit of variation within how
long it takes items to get here I think

296
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,350
long it takes items to get here I think
 

297
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,570
long it takes items to get here I think
that's not too bad it's about as good as

298
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:34,580
that's not too bad it's about as good as
 

299
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,180
that's not too bad it's about as good as
you can get I mean I've tried really

300
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,190
you can get I mean I've tried really
 

301
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,480
you can get I mean I've tried really
hard to optimize this thing and I think

302
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,490
hard to optimize this thing and I think
 

303
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,450
hard to optimize this thing and I think
we'll have to live with that alright so

304
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:43,460
we'll have to live with that alright so
 

305
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,560
we'll have to live with that alright so
we're going to move on here pretty quick

306
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,570
we're going to move on here pretty quick
 

307
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,850
we're going to move on here pretty quick
guys I just want to show you one more

308
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:45,860
guys I just want to show you one more
 

309
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,340
guys I just want to show you one more
thing the next step what I got to do

310
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,350
thing the next step what I got to do
 

311
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,750
thing the next step what I got to do
next with this project to move forward

312
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:49,760
next with this project to move forward
 

313
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,140
next with this project to move forward
with it basically I got to go through

314
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,150
with it basically I got to go through
 

315
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,360
with it basically I got to go through
all the codes here starting with zero

316
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,370
all the codes here starting with zero
 

317
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,050
all the codes here starting with zero
zero so no lights on zero zero requests

318
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,060
zero so no lights on zero zero requests
 

319
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,540
zero so no lights on zero zero requests
the item I don't know what item we're

320
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:01,550
the item I don't know what item we're
 

321
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,100
the item I don't know what item we're
going to get here doesn't really matter

322
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,110
going to get here doesn't really matter
 

323
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,330
going to get here doesn't really matter
too much I kind of would like some

324
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:06,340
too much I kind of would like some
 

325
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,880
too much I kind of would like some
logistical order to it like like if

326
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:09,890
logistical order to it like like if
 

327
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,590
logistical order to it like like if
we're requesting wood I would like wood

328
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:11,600
we're requesting wood I would like wood
 

329
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,310
we're requesting wood I would like wood
to kind of be all grouped together oh

330
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:14,320
to kind of be all grouped together oh
 

331
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,430
to kind of be all grouped together oh
it's cool okay we got coal that's fine

332
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
it's cool okay we got coal that's fine
 

333
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,740
it's cool okay we got coal that's fine
so then what we got to do take one one

334
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,750
so then what we got to do take one one
 

335
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,890
so then what we got to do take one one
piece of this coal and since we use the

336
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:23,900
piece of this coal and since we use the
 

337
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,590
piece of this coal and since we use the
code zero zero there we're label it zero

338
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,600
code zero zero there we're label it zero
 

339
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,710
code zero zero there we're label it zero
zero and then put in one of these chests

340
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:29,720
zero and then put in one of these chests
 

341
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,640
zero and then put in one of these chests
and then zero one would go here zero two

342
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:33,650
and then zero one would go here zero two
 

343
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,930
and then zero one would go here zero two
zero three and it's going to form a

344
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:34,940
zero three and it's going to form a
 

345
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,339
zero three and it's going to form a
table where we can just hover our mouse

346
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:36,349
table where we can just hover our mouse
 

347
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,709
table where we can just hover our mouse
over to see what the code is for for

348
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
over to see what the code is for for
 

349
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,320
over to see what the code is for for
that item and that way we don't have to

350
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,330
that item and that way we don't have to
 

351
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,010
that item and that way we don't have to
remember the codes in our head we need

352
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,020
remember the codes in our head we need
 

353
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,860
remember the codes in our head we need
some way of like checking it and since

354
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:47,870
some way of like checking it and since
 

355
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,270
some way of like checking it and since
it's got an extra piece Ariens put it

356
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,280
it's got an extra piece Ariens put it
 

357
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,430
it's got an extra piece Ariens put it
back in the system move on to the next

358
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
back in the system move on to the next
 

359
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,180
back in the system move on to the next
one which would be zero

360
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,190
one which would be zero
 

361
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,119
one which would be zero
one right Oh dad press those two quick

362
00:08:59,119 --> 00:08:59,129
one right Oh dad press those two quick
 

363
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:06,699
one right Oh dad press those two quick
together I wonder zero one wait what

364
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:06,709
together I wonder zero one wait what
 

365
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:13,249
together I wonder zero one wait what
what let's press it one more time okay I

366
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:13,259
what let's press it one more time okay I
 

367
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,290
what let's press it one more time okay I
think those got out of the sink I might

368
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:15,300
think those got out of the sink I might
 

369
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,600
think those got out of the sink I might
make it so that side resets once it

370
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:17,610
make it so that side resets once it
 

371
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,920
make it so that side resets once it
starts on this one again I'm not sure

372
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:20,930
starts on this one again I'm not sure
 

373
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,179
starts on this one again I'm not sure
although actually if we do one zero it's

374
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:26,189
although actually if we do one zero it's
 

375
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:28,069
although actually if we do one zero it's
going to turn this light on then zero

376
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:28,079
going to turn this light on then zero
 

377
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,800
going to turn this light on then zero
zero zero zero zero zero zero that's

378
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:30,810
zero zero zero zero zero zero that's
 

379
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,860
zero zero zero zero zero zero that's
what I want

380
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:32,870
what I want
 

381
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,869
what I want
is that right one zero would come next

382
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:35,879
is that right one zero would come next
 

383
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,249
is that right one zero would come next
did I do something reversed here I might

384
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:40,259
did I do something reversed here I might
 

385
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,129
did I do something reversed here I might
have done something reversed because I

386
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:43,139
have done something reversed because I
 

387
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,189
have done something reversed because I
want I want it to go in binary order

388
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:46,199
want I want it to go in binary order
 

389
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,929
want I want it to go in binary order
here where this these lights come on

390
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:47,939
here where this these lights come on
 

391
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:55,009
here where this these lights come on
first then these ones okay we got lapis

392
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:55,019
first then these ones okay we got lapis
 

393
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,990
first then these ones okay we got lapis
so that that is correct I'm pretty sure

394
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,000
so that that is correct I'm pretty sure
 

395
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,470
so that that is correct I'm pretty sure
that's an ore like the coal is so this

396
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
that's an ore like the coal is so this
 

397
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,800
that's an ore like the coal is so this
would be one zero all people are going

398
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:03,810
would be one zero all people are going
 

399
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,550
would be one zero all people are going
to be raging I'm not sure if that's

400
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,560
to be raging I'm not sure if that's
 

401
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,840
to be raging I'm not sure if that's
right I think it's supposed to go zero

402
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:08,850
right I think it's supposed to go zero
 

403
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,019
right I think it's supposed to go zero
one next those problem but I seem to

404
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:12,029
one next those problem but I seem to
 

405
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:18,050
one next those problem but I seem to
have done something wrong here yeah I'm

406
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,060
have done something wrong here yeah I'm
 

407
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,269
have done something wrong here yeah I'm
almost certain next one would be add to

408
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
almost certain next one would be add to
 

409
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,790
almost certain next one would be add to
zero maybe I can flip the display so

410
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
zero maybe I can flip the display so
 

411
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,759
zero maybe I can flip the display so
that'll fix everything because I think

412
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:31,769
that'll fix everything because I think
 

413
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,990
that'll fix everything because I think
that would do the trick right okay

414
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
that would do the trick right okay
 

415
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,730
that would do the trick right okay
anyways that's kind of the next thing I

416
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:37,740
anyways that's kind of the next thing I
 

417
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,590
anyways that's kind of the next thing I
got to do I might have to look into why

418
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
got to do I might have to look into why
 

419
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,240
got to do I might have to look into why
that seems to be reversed alright

420
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,250
that seems to be reversed alright
 

421
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,160
that seems to be reversed alright
everybody so I decided let's head over

422
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,170
everybody so I decided let's head over
 

423
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,860
everybody so I decided let's head over
to our amplified base here next and

424
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:48,870
to our amplified base here next and
 

425
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,079
to our amplified base here next and
we're going to do a little project here

426
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:51,089
we're going to do a little project here
 

427
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,670
we're going to do a little project here
something I've been wanting to do for a

428
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:52,680
something I've been wanting to do for a
 

429
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,429
something I've been wanting to do for a
while like a year but just never got

430
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:58,439
while like a year but just never got
 

431
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,079
while like a year but just never got
around to doing it so we're going to do

432
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:00,089
around to doing it so we're going to do
 

433
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,679
around to doing it so we're going to do
it today we need a better name than that

434
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:03,689
it today we need a better name than that
 

435
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,629
it today we need a better name than that

for this place so if you guys have ideas

444
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
for this place so if you guys have ideas
 

445
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,720
for this place so if you guys have ideas
do let me know in the comments but yeah

446
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:17,730
do let me know in the comments but yeah

do let me know in the comments but yeah
like a long time ago I made this slime

448
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:21,900
like a long time ago I made this slime
 

449
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,550
like a long time ago I made this slime
block launcher thing and tried to build

450
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:25,560
block launcher thing and tried to build
 

451
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,200
block launcher thing and tried to build
it on a server and it didn't work on the

452
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,210
it on a server and it didn't work on the
 

453
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,550
it on a server and it didn't work on the
server but it works great in

454
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
server but it works great in
 

455
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,870
server but it works great in
single-player um I've never built in

456
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
single-player um I've never built in
 

457
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,370
single-player um I've never built in
single-player so that's what we're going

458
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,380
single-player so that's what we're going
 

459
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,250
single-player so that's what we're going
to do here we are going to make a slime

460
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,260
to do here we are going to make a slime
 

461
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,040
to do here we are going to make a slime
block launcher to go from here to there

462
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,050
block launcher to go from here to there
 

463
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,300
block launcher to go from here to there
we're going to dig a tunnel in the

464
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,310
we're going to dig a tunnel in the
 

465
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,430
we're going to dig a tunnel in the
mountain there and it should lead up to

466
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
mountain there and it should lead up to
 

467
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,650
mountain there and it should lead up to
another area we built further down here

468
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:45,660
another area we built further down here
 

469
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,329
another area we built further down here
we're going to try to chain them

470
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:47,339
we're going to try to chain them
 

471
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,120
we're going to try to chain them
together several slime block launchers

472
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,130
together several slime block launchers
 

473
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,350
together several slime block launchers
and just see what that is like so here I

474
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,360
and just see what that is like so here I
 

475
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,450
and just see what that is like so here I
think what we got to do we'll put down I

476
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:58,460
think what we got to do we'll put down I
 

477
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,560
think what we got to do we'll put down I
guess we only need one piston because

478
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,570
guess we only need one piston because
 

479
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,090
guess we only need one piston because
we're using slime blocks tools they'll

480
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,100
we're using slime blocks tools they'll
 

481
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,640
we're using slime blocks tools they'll
stick together this will have to be note

482
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:04,650
stick together this will have to be note
 

483
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,780
stick together this will have to be note
blocks or something that doesn't move no

484
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:08,790
blocks or something that doesn't move no
 

485
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,740
blocks or something that doesn't move no
blocks there we go alright so this

486
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:11,750
blocks there we go alright so this
 

487
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,610
blocks there we go alright so this
actually maybe this goes down well we'll

488
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:16,620
actually maybe this goes down well we'll
 

489
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,680
actually maybe this goes down well we'll
try it at this level first the idea is

490
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:18,690
try it at this level first the idea is
 

491
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,300
try it at this level first the idea is
though this is going to push us up and

492
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,310
though this is going to push us up and
 

493
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,970
though this is going to push us up and
then we're going to have another

494
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:21,980
then we're going to have another
 

495
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,560
then we're going to have another
sideways pusher let's put it I think it

496
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:27,570
sideways pusher let's put it I think it
 

497
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,480
sideways pusher let's put it I think it
was three blocks up so like up here and

498
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,490
was three blocks up so like up here and
 

499
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,190
was three blocks up so like up here and
this will push us sideways when we get

500
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,200
this will push us sideways when we get
 

501
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,950
this will push us sideways when we get
knocked up and yes I just said knocked

502
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:36,960
knocked up and yes I just said knocked
 

503
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,850
knocked up and yes I just said knocked
up I'm not pregnant you do not prove

504
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:40,860
up I'm not pregnant you do not prove
 

505
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,270
up I'm not pregnant you do not prove
anything it never happened all right and

506
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,280
anything it never happened all right and
 

507
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,829
anything it never happened all right and
that should be good okay so I'm going to

508
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:48,839
that should be good okay so I'm going to
 

509
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,329
that should be good okay so I'm going to
run some redstone here

510
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:50,339
run some redstone here
 

511
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,260
run some redstone here
I guess the pressure plates will go or

512
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,270
I guess the pressure plates will go or
 

513
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,690
I guess the pressure plates will go or
should we use tripwire I don't know I'll

514
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:56,700
should we use tripwire I don't know I'll
 

515
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,980
should we use tripwire I don't know I'll
try to figure it out here we'll see how

516
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:57,990
try to figure it out here we'll see how
 

517
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,000
try to figure it out here we'll see how
this works okay here we go guys so this

518
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,010
this works okay here we go guys so this
 

519
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,590
this works okay here we go guys so this
is pretty simple as it is right now to

520
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
is pretty simple as it is right now to
 

521
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,990
is pretty simple as it is right now to
step on this this goes up and then two

522
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
step on this this goes up and then two
 

523
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,030
step on this this goes up and then two
redstone ticks later this goes out as

524
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,040
redstone ticks later this goes out as
 

525
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,500
redstone ticks later this goes out as
well and then I retract so if we run we

526
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:12,510
well and then I retract so if we run we
 

527
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,520
well and then I retract so if we run we
should get lift off here I hope we did

528
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,530
should get lift off here I hope we did
 

529
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,510
should get lift off here I hope we did
not

530
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:17,520
not
 

531
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,699
not
darn it okay why did we not get liftoff

532
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:21,709
darn it okay why did we not get liftoff
 

533
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:24,079
darn it okay why did we not get liftoff
is it because we got to move this one

534
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,089
is it because we got to move this one
 

535
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:26,120
is it because we got to move this one
forward maybe I bet you that's what it

536
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,130
forward maybe I bet you that's what it
 

537
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,220
forward maybe I bet you that's what it
is yeah I'm going to try move the top

538
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,230
is yeah I'm going to try move the top
 

539
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,519
is yeah I'm going to try move the top
one it forward one more block oh is this

540
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:34,529
one it forward one more block oh is this
 

541
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,949
one it forward one more block oh is this
gonna kill me go to pain now we're fine

542
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
gonna kill me go to pain now we're fine
 

543
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,250
gonna kill me go to pain now we're fine
we're good alright attempt number two

544
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:42,260
we're good alright attempt number two
 

545
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:48,530
we're good alright attempt number two
let's give it a go Oh No

546
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:48,540
let's give it a go Oh No
 

547
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,860
let's give it a go Oh No
darn it okay maybe I got a lower one

548
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,870
darn it okay maybe I got a lower one
 

549
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,460
darn it okay maybe I got a lower one
block I have this all figured out before

550
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,470
block I have this all figured out before
 

551
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,560
block I have this all figured out before
but I think the creative world where I

552
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:57,570
but I think the creative world where I
 

553
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,750
but I think the creative world where I
figured out is gone so I have to kind of

554
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
figured out is gone so I have to kind of
 

555
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,350
figured out is gone so I have to kind of
remember how to rebuild it and test

556
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
remember how to rebuild it and test
 

557
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,690
remember how to rebuild it and test
number three so it's it's lowered and

558
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:05,700
number three so it's it's lowered and
 

559
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,300
number three so it's it's lowered and
pulled back one let's give it a go oh no

560
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,310
pulled back one let's give it a go oh no
 

561
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:20,180
pulled back one let's give it a go oh no
still no still no good ah oh oh oh no oh

562
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,190
still no still no good ah oh oh oh no oh
 

563
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,430
still no still no good ah oh oh oh no oh
no that was a skeleton all right all

564
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
no that was a skeleton all right all
 

565
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,639
no that was a skeleton all right all
right

566
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:25,649
right
 

567
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,240
right
heal up heal up lots of baddies around

568
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,250
heal up heal up lots of baddies around
 

569
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,690
heal up heal up lots of baddies around
here maybe if I change the timing on it

570
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:32,700
here maybe if I change the timing on it
 

571
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,889
here maybe if I change the timing on it
that will do the trick because we've

572
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:33,899
that will do the trick because we've
 

573
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,510
that will do the trick because we've
tried every combination now and none of

574
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:35,520
tried every combination now and none of
 

575
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,310
tried every combination now and none of
them have worked okay okay check it out

576
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
them have worked okay okay check it out
 

577
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,730
them have worked okay okay check it out
check it out this is so cool whoa whoa

578
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:45,740
check it out this is so cool whoa whoa
 

579
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,180
check it out this is so cool whoa whoa
all right

580
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,190
all right
 

581
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,260
all right
so I did move it back up so we got a

582
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,270
so I did move it back up so we got a
 

583
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,819
so I did move it back up so we got a
little bit of headroom here which is

584
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:52,829
little bit of headroom here which is
 

585
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,370
little bit of headroom here which is
nice I didn't like it all load lowdown

586
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:55,380
nice I didn't like it all load lowdown
 

587
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,120
nice I didn't like it all load lowdown
and cramped and I lowered it here so

588
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,130
and cramped and I lowered it here so
 

589
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,699
and cramped and I lowered it here so
it's one below the pressure plates what

590
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:01,709
it's one below the pressure plates what
 

591
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:05,930
it's one below the pressure plates what
I got it at is a timing of three on that

592
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:05,940
I got it at is a timing of three on that
 

593
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,120
I got it at is a timing of three on that
repeater so we got redstone underneath

594
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,130
repeater so we got redstone underneath
 

595
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,300
repeater so we got redstone underneath
here right still underneath there and

596
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,310
here right still underneath there and
 

597
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,600
here right still underneath there and
then it goes up or it goes down to this

598
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,610
then it goes up or it goes down to this
 

599
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,030
then it goes up or it goes down to this
piston first powers this block goes down

600
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
piston first powers this block goes down
 

601
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,760
piston first powers this block goes down
and then another repeater on one tick to

602
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:19,770
and then another repeater on one tick to
 

603
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,300
and then another repeater on one tick to
go to the top piston here and that seems

604
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,310
go to the top piston here and that seems
 

605
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,980
go to the top piston here and that seems
to do the trick very nicely so now what

606
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:27,990
to do the trick very nicely so now what
 

607
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:33,069
to do the trick very nicely so now what
I want to do is chain these together

608
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:33,079

 

609
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,290

so um and I wanted to work two ways to

610
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:38,300
so um and I wanted to work two ways to
 

611
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,850
so um and I wanted to work two ways to
not just one way I want to work both

612
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:39,860
not just one way I want to work both
 

613
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,150
not just one way I want to work both
ways so I'm going to build like a

614
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,160
ways so I'm going to build like a
 

615
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,829
ways so I'm going to build like a
pretend one over here so let's imagine

616
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:44,839
pretend one over here so let's imagine
 

617
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,819
pretend one over here so let's imagine
we have another pusher up here to knock

618
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:48,829
we have another pusher up here to knock
 

619
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:51,370
we have another pusher up here to knock
us this way let's see what how smoothly

620
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,380
us this way let's see what how smoothly
 

621
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,210
us this way let's see what how smoothly
we can enter onto this platform if it's

622
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,220
we can enter onto this platform if it's
 

623
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,569
we can enter onto this platform if it's
in this position all right so we don't

624
00:15:58,569 --> 00:15:58,579
in this position all right so we don't
 

625
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:00,879
in this position all right so we don't
really want to hit our head on that top

626
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:00,889
really want to hit our head on that top
 

627
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,590
really want to hit our head on that top
one there but we want to land on the

628
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,600
one there but we want to land on the
 

629
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,449
one there but we want to land on the
bottom all right here we go oh we're

630
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:07,459
bottom all right here we go oh we're
 

631
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,600
bottom all right here we go oh we're
shorts we're a little bit short so we

632
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:10,610
shorts we're a little bit short so we
 

633
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,670
shorts we're a little bit short so we
might need to move it forward one block

634
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:12,680
might need to move it forward one block
 

635
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,430
might need to move it forward one block
and that'll probably be our distance

636
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
and that'll probably be our distance
 

637
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,460
and that'll probably be our distance
here Oh Oh didn't activate oh I don't

638
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,470
here Oh Oh didn't activate oh I don't
 

639
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,949
here Oh Oh didn't activate oh I don't
have my weapon equipped wait let's not

640
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:23,959
have my weapon equipped wait let's not
 

641
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,749
have my weapon equipped wait let's not
fight that guy's about to jump down and

642
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
fight that guy's about to jump down and
 

643
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,129
fight that guy's about to jump down and
tackle him but that would have been

644
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:27,139
tackle him but that would have been
 

645
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,629
tackle him but that would have been
pretty bad alright so I'm starting to

646
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:31,639
pretty bad alright so I'm starting to
 

647
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,400
pretty bad alright so I'm starting to
set up a second one over there but it

648
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,410
set up a second one over there but it
 

649
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,329
set up a second one over there but it
doesn't seem to be working quite right

650
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:36,339
doesn't seem to be working quite right
 

651
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:40,829
doesn't seem to be working quite right
okay let's see if we can get it whoa

652
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:40,839
okay let's see if we can get it whoa
 

653
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,240
okay let's see if we can get it whoa
yeah I don't know why but I can't get it

654
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,250
yeah I don't know why but I can't get it
 

655
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,009
yeah I don't know why but I can't get it
to trigger the second time whoa that

656
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:48,019
to trigger the second time whoa that
 

657
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,009
to trigger the second time whoa that
wasn't quite right here let's try let's

658
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,019
wasn't quite right here let's try let's
 

659
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:53,470
wasn't quite right here let's try let's
try run from here like this one's not

660
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:53,480
try run from here like this one's not
 

661
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,269
try run from here like this one's not
hitting us for some reason the top one

662
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
hitting us for some reason the top one
 

663
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,629
hitting us for some reason the top one
oh it does this we run from there might

664
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
oh it does this we run from there might
 

665
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,449
oh it does this we run from there might
just because it might just be because of

666
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:01,459
just because it might just be because of
 

667
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,779
just because it might just be because of
where we're positioned after that

668
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:04,789
where we're positioned after that
 

669
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:11,199
where we're positioned after that
happens whoa yeah then trigger again

670
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,209
happens whoa yeah then trigger again
 

671
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,860
happens whoa yeah then trigger again
very strange exactly oh no no no no no

672
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:14,870
very strange exactly oh no no no no no
 

673
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,710
very strange exactly oh no no no no no
no no no always a stupid silverfish

674
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:19,720

 

675
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,690

get out of here oh oh he's so little I

676
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:24,700
get out of here oh oh he's so little I
 

677
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,730
get out of here oh oh he's so little I
can't hit him got him got him

678
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:28,740
can't hit him got him got him
 

679
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,180
can't hit him got him got him
whew that was close

680
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,190
whew that was close
 

681
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,980
whew that was close
well I've been doing some testing here

682
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,990
well I've been doing some testing here
 

683
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,690
well I've been doing some testing here
and it seems to be based on where we

684
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:36,700
and it seems to be based on where we
 

685
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,450
and it seems to be based on where we
start running like I put a border here

686
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:39,460
start running like I put a border here
 

687
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
start running like I put a border here
so if we align ourselves right against

688
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,470
so if we align ourselves right against
 

689
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,560
so if we align ourselves right against
these blocks it seems to work every time

690
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:43,570
these blocks it seems to work every time
 

691
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:51,020
these blocks it seems to work every time
then whoo and oh it didn't work now what

692
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,030
then whoo and oh it didn't work now what
 

693
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,090
then whoo and oh it didn't work now what
I wonder maybe it's because I'm

694
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,100
I wonder maybe it's because I'm
 

695
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,650
I wonder maybe it's because I'm
recording in my frame rate slower

696
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:55,660
recording in my frame rate slower
 

697
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,930
recording in my frame rate slower
because I locked my frame rate at 30

698
00:17:59,930 --> 00:17:59,940

 

699
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,940

otherwise I get about 120 oh at that

700
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:02,950
otherwise I get about 120 oh at that
 

701
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,150
otherwise I get about 120 oh at that
time it seems very inconsistent

702
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
time it seems very inconsistent
 

703
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,050
time it seems very inconsistent
unfortunately I was hoping like we could

704
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,060
unfortunately I was hoping like we could
 

705
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,460
unfortunately I was hoping like we could
chain a bunch of these together and they

706
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:11,470
chain a bunch of these together and they
 

707
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,820
chain a bunch of these together and they
would kind of flow smoothly go back I'm

708
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:17,830
would kind of flow smoothly go back I'm
 

709
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,820
would kind of flow smoothly go back I'm
not sure that worked that time yeah I

710
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:23,830
not sure that worked that time yeah I
 

711
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,840
not sure that worked that time yeah I
don't know I don't know if I can

712
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:24,850
don't know I don't know if I can
 

713
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,490
don't know I don't know if I can
actually get this thing to work 100%

714
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:28,500
actually get this thing to work 100%
 

715
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,510
actually get this thing to work 100%
worked again worked again hmm like it

716
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:36,520
worked again worked again hmm like it
 

717
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,960
worked again worked again hmm like it
wasn't working at all and now it seems

718
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:39,970
wasn't working at all and now it seems
 

719
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,720
wasn't working at all and now it seems
to work every time let's get rid of this

720
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:41,730
to work every time let's get rid of this
 

721
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,890
to work every time let's get rid of this
we'll just run it like normal works and

722
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:45,900
we'll just run it like normal works and
 

723
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,730
we'll just run it like normal works and
failed yeah I don't know don't know I'm

724
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:50,740
failed yeah I don't know don't know I'm
 

725
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,620
failed yeah I don't know don't know I'm
gonna have to experiment experiment with

726
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:52,630
gonna have to experiment experiment with
 

727
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,840
gonna have to experiment experiment with
it quite a bit more I think if you have

728
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:54,850
it quite a bit more I think if you have
 

729
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,760
it quite a bit more I think if you have
ideas let me know what I could try here

730
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:58,770
ideas let me know what I could try here
 

731
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,130
ideas let me know what I could try here
but I think we'll leave it there for

732
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:02,140
but I think we'll leave it there for
 

733
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,350
but I think we'll leave it there for
today so something else I want to do

734
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
today so something else I want to do
 

735
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
today so something else I want to do

736
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,370
today just a quick little project here
 

737
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,220
today just a quick little project here

742
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:16,600
in this one kind of wandering around
 

743
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,390
in this one kind of wandering around
randomly but I don't really like the

744
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
randomly but I don't really like the
 

745
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,850

kind of lame so we're gonna redo it

748
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:26,800
kind of lame so we're gonna redo it
 

749
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,500

we're gonna put a minecart in here and

750
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,510
we're gonna put a minecart in here and
 

751
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,910
we're gonna put a minecart in here and
have it go around and in a precise order

752
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:31,920
have it go around and in a precise order
 

753
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,350
have it go around and in a precise order
all right so let's let's get up in the

754
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:34,360
all right so let's let's get up in the
 

755
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,240
all right so let's let's get up in the
ceiling here I don't know how many of

756
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,250
ceiling here I don't know how many of
 

757
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,450
ceiling here I don't know how many of
you guys watched the minecon stuff I I

758
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:39,460
you guys watched the minecon stuff I I
 

759
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,200
you guys watched the minecon stuff I I
missed most of it but I did see well

760
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,210
missed most of it but I did see well
 

761
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,430
missed most of it but I did see well
especially on the reddit they were

762
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,440
especially on the reddit they were
 

763
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,040
especially on the reddit they were
talking about it they revealed some

764
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,050
talking about it they revealed some
 

765
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,250
talking about it they revealed some
information about the 1.9 updates and

766
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,260
information about the 1.9 updates and
 

767
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,330
information about the 1.9 updates and
some spoilers I guess so I'm gonna be

768
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,340
some spoilers I guess so I'm gonna be
 

769
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,600
some spoilers I guess so I'm gonna be
given a couple spoilers but yeah it

770
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:57,610
given a couple spoilers but yeah it
 

771
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,120
given a couple spoilers but yeah it
looks like they redid the end quite a

772
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,130
looks like they redid the end quite a
 

773
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,040
looks like they redid the end quite a
bit they improved it a lot by the looks

774
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,050
bit they improved it a lot by the looks
 

775
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:08,580
bit they improved it a lot by the looks
of it they made a way for light from

776
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:08,590
of it they made a way for light from
 

777
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,200
of it they made a way for light from
what I understood there's like multiple

778
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,210
what I understood there's like multiple
 

779
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,540
what I understood there's like multiple
islands you can generate in the end and

780
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:12,550
islands you can generate in the end and
 

781
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,070
islands you can generate in the end and
you have to like hop between them or

782
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
you have to like hop between them or
 

783
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,010
you have to like hop between them or
something they made like a levitation or

784
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,020
something they made like a levitation or
 

785
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,620
something they made like a levitation or
maybe it's you know I don't even know

786
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:19,630
maybe it's you know I don't even know
 

787
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,530
maybe it's you know I don't even know
what I'm talking about how did it go I

think they said there are ways of

790
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:29,710
think they said there are ways of
 

791
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,430
think they said there are ways of
getting to another island like if you're

getting to another island like if you're
 

793
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,840
getting to another island like if you're
done with your current Island I think

794
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:33,850
done with your current Island I think
 

795
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,030
done with your current Island I think
you can hop to another one with like a

796
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,040
you can hop to another one with like a
 

797

842
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,610
time that probably would have drove me
 

843
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,620
time that probably would have drove me
crazy this is probably for the best

844
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:46,630
crazy this is probably for the best
 

845
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,210
crazy this is probably for the best
alright so we'll just do something like

846
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:49,220
alright so we'll just do something like
 

847
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,860
alright so we'll just do something like
that it's gonna take a lot of repeaters

848
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:50,870
that it's gonna take a lot of repeaters
 

849
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,770
that it's gonna take a lot of repeaters
those only problem but yeah the the

850
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:53,780
those only problem but yeah the the
 

851
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,840
those only problem but yeah the the

855
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,250
block a purple brick block with a few
different variations and that looks

856
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,260
different variations and that looks
 

857
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,100
different variations and that looks
really good I think that's going to be a

858
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,110
really good I think that's going to be a
 

859
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,400
really good I think that's going to be a
pretty big kids and there's even a way

860
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,410
pretty big kids and there's even a way
 

861
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,190

to farm it they introduced a new type of
 

863
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,900
to farm it they introduced a new type of
crop very weird what was it called

864
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:13,910
crop very weird what was it called

chorus or something yeah weird plant
that grows in the end and it's kind of

868
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:20,780
that grows in the end and it's kind of
 

869
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,110
that grows in the end and it's kind of
like chopping down a tree you get that

870
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
like chopping down a tree you get that
 

871
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,320
like chopping down a tree you get that
and you can make bricks out of it and I

872
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,330
and you can make bricks out of it and I
 

873
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,820
and you can make bricks out of it and I
don't know it looked pretty cool they
