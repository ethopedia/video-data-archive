00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:35,590
15 minutes later it was fine thirty
 

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,000
15 minutes later it was fine thirty
minutes it was fine an hour later it was

fine I left the island I came back and
 

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,330

00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:48,340
everything was gone so took forever but
 

39
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,820
everything was gone so took forever but
it did eventually burn and that's what

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:50,830
it did eventually burn and that's what
 

41
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,380

43
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,100

00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,110
it wasn't the flaming minecarts because
 

45
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:07,770
it wasn't the flaming minecarts because

built a cactus farm and the tree farm
 

63
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,080
built a cactus farm and the tree farm
now and I was going to build them in LP

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,090
now and I was going to build them in LP
 

65
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,809
now and I was going to build them in LP
but I figured a lot of people would want

66
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:54,819
but I figured a lot of people would want
 

67

that tutorial for it so I just went
 

69
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,800
that tutorial for it so I just went

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:05,650
there and get some details on how it
 

75
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,699
there and get some details on how it
works and if you don't want it you don't

overview of them now so to our right
 

81
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,680
overview of them now so to our right
here is the tree farm I got three paths

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:22,690
here is the tree farm I got three paths
 

83
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,009
here is the tree farm I got three paths
here and by the way I really like this

84
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:26,019
here and by the way I really like this
 

85
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,539
here and by the way I really like this
tree farm I think it's very cool so we

86
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:30,549
tree farm I think it's very cool so we
 

87
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,770
tree farm I think it's very cool so we
got water paths that pull us up here

88
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:33,780
got water paths that pull us up here
 

89
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,830
got water paths that pull us up here
goes around this little spiral staircase

90
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
goes around this little spiral staircase
 

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,130
goes around this little spiral staircase
and pulls us up to our tree farm here

92
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,140
and pulls us up to our tree farm here
 

93
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,060
and pulls us up to our tree farm here
it's not done yet but it's fully

94
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,070
it's not done yet but it's fully
 

95
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:52,440
it's not done yet but it's fully
functional right now

96
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,450

 

97
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,100

water sources all the saplings that fall
 

101
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,600
water sources all the saplings that fall
in the water get brought to the center

102
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:06,610

 

103
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,540

chest for fertilizer crafting bench
 

109
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,310
chest for fertilizer crafting bench
chests for the saplings and then we have

110
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,320
chests for the saplings and then we have
 

111
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,620
chests for the saplings and then we have
a dispenser full of axes so when we come

112
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:26,630
a dispenser full of axes so when we come
 

113
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,590
a dispenser full of axes so when we come
up here we just head over here

grab some fertilizer I have some bones
 

121
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:45,300
grab some fertilizer I have some bones
on me so I'm just going to make some and

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,310
on me so I'm just going to make some and
 

123
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,760
on me so I'm just going to make some and
this tree farm is kind of uh it only

124
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:51,770
this tree farm is kind of uh it only
 

125
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,280
this tree farm is kind of uh it only
works if you use bone meal that's that's

126
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,290
works if you use bone meal that's that's
 

127
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,390
works if you use bone meal that's that's
what my intention was with this it will

128
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
what my intention was with this it will
 

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,140
what my intention was with this it will
grow on its own but it takes forever for

130
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,150
grow on its own but it takes forever for
 

131
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,180
grow on its own but it takes forever for
like this one tree to grow because it's

132
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,190
like this one tree to grow because it's
 

133
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,860
like this one tree to grow because it's
surrounded by other trees so it's very

134
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:07,870
surrounded by other trees so it's very
 

135
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,810
surrounded by other trees so it's very
takes a very long time for the trees to

136
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:10,820
takes a very long time for the trees to
 

137
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,590
takes a very long time for the trees to
grow if you just leave them on their own

138
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
grow if you just leave them on their own
 

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,870
grow if you just leave them on their own
so this is a bone meal tree farm and

140
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
so this is a bone meal tree farm and
 

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,960
so this is a bone meal tree farm and
what you do you just can reach the trees

142
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:19,970
what you do you just can reach the trees
 

143
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,580
what you do you just can reach the trees
from here they're at eye level which is

144
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:21,590
from here they're at eye level which is
 

145
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,290
from here they're at eye level which is
nice and you just spam the right-click

146
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:25,300
nice and you just spam the right-click
 

147
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:32,320
nice and you just spam the right-click
and the trees drill

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,330

 

149
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,350

and you don't have to worry about

150
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
and you don't have to worry about
 

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
and you don't have to worry about
right-clicking too many times because it

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,250
right-clicking too many times because it
 

153
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,830
right-clicking too many times because it
doesn't use any fertilizer if you

154
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
doesn't use any fertilizer if you
 

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,820
doesn't use any fertilizer if you
right-click on a log so just throw all

156
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:46,830
right-click on a log so just throw all
 

157
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,990
right-click on a log so just throw all
the trees once you got solid wood all

158
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
the trees once you got solid wood all
 

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,350
the trees once you got solid wood all
the way around just grab your X Maggie's

160
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
the way around just grab your X Maggie's
 

161
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,140

making jokes because I know everybody
wants them okay so I usually just clear

172
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:43,830
wants them okay so I usually just clear
 

173
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,430
wants them okay so I usually just clear
out the bottom two blocks all the way

174
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,440
out the bottom two blocks all the way
 

175
00:06:46,440 --> 00:07:02,320
out the bottom two blocks all the way
around and then I do the top ones and

176
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,330
around and then I do the top ones and
 

177
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,140
around and then I do the top ones and
above us there's a glass glass blocks

178
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,150
above us there's a glass glass blocks
 

179
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,340
above us there's a glass glass blocks
all the way around eight blocks up it

180
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,350
all the way around eight blocks up it
 

181
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,970
all the way around eight blocks up it
seems to be the ideal height to go nine

182
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:13,980
seems to be the ideal height to go nine
 

183
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,670
seems to be the ideal height to go nine
blocks up then you have issues with the

184
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:16,680
blocks up then you have issues with the
 

185
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,360
blocks up then you have issues with the
trees branching which will will get you

186
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,370
trees branching which will will get you
 

187
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,360
trees branching which will will get you
more wood doing that I just know this

188
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,370
more wood doing that I just know this
 

189
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,120
more wood doing that I just know this
want to be and really enjoys they'll get

190
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,130
want to be and really enjoys they'll get
 

191
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,390
want to be and really enjoys they'll get
more we're doing that but they branch up

192
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,400
more we're doing that but they branch up
 

193
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,050
more we're doing that but they branch up
to two blocks out so you have to destroy

194
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,060
to two blocks out so you have to destroy
 

195
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,940
to two blocks out so you have to destroy
leaves sometimes

196
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:34,950
leaves sometimes
 

197
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,590
leaves sometimes
so I find a putting the glass blocks

198
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:39,600
so I find a putting the glass blocks
 

199
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,130
so I find a putting the glass blocks
neat

200
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,140
neat
 

201
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:52,270
neat
eight blocks up is the best and I go all

202
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,280
eight blocks up is the best and I go all
 

203
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,420
eight blocks up is the best and I go all
I'll harvest it now the leaves all die

204
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,430
I'll harvest it now the leaves all die
 

205
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,280
I'll harvest it now the leaves all die
saplings fall some of them fall off on

206
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,290
saplings fall some of them fall off on
 

207
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,730

the side not a big deal usually I don't

208
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:01,740
the side not a big deal usually I don't
 

209
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,660
the side not a big deal usually I don't
collect those ones most of them fall in

210
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:05,670
collect those ones most of them fall in
 

211
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,910
collect those ones most of them fall in
the water I an over here I have a

212
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:10,920
the water I an over here I have a
 

213
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,020
the water I an over here I have a
storage thing for wood and a storage

214
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,030
storage thing for wood and a storage
 

215
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,180
storage thing for wood and a storage
thing for charcoal this spot here is

216
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,190
thing for charcoal this spot here is
 

217
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,880
thing for charcoal this spot here is
dedicated these furnaces to making

218
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:19,890
dedicated these furnaces to making
 

219
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:26,540
dedicated these furnaces to making
charcoal just drop in a stack and then I

220
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:26,550
charcoal just drop in a stack and then I
 

221
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,160
charcoal just drop in a stack and then I
can store them here and when I have a

222
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,170
can store them here and when I have a
 

223
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,070
can store them here and when I have a
big load of charcoal or whatever then I

224
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080
big load of charcoal or whatever then I
 

225
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,930
big load of charcoal or whatever then I
can pick it up and then take it down to

226
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:32,940
can pick it up and then take it down to
 

227
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,560
can pick it up and then take it down to
my storage room and so usually what I'll

228
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:39,570
my storage room and so usually what I'll
 

229
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,780
my storage room and so usually what I'll
do is out the school got saplings aim

230
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:44,790
do is out the school got saplings aim
 

231
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:53,880
do is out the school got saplings aim
straight down and right-click again

232
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:53,890

 

233
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,250

there's no dead zones in the water flow

234
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,260
there's no dead zones in the water flow
 

235
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,570
there's no dead zones in the water flow
which is nice it all goes right right

236
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:01,580
which is nice it all goes right right
 

237
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,600
which is nice it all goes right right
there

238
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:03,610
there
 

239
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,000
there
got a little bridge for getting up here

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,010

 

241
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,820

and by the time you have the trees all

242
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:12,830
and by the time you have the trees all
 

243
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,790
and by the time you have the trees all
planted again usually will sluzer

244
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:15,800
planted again usually will sluzer
 

245
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,670
planted again usually will sluzer
dead so you can go ahead and start

246
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:18,680
dead so you can go ahead and start
 

247
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:26,280
dead so you can go ahead and start
growing your next crop

248
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,290

 

249
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,780

oh yeah those are the glass blocks I'm

250
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:30,790
oh yeah those are the glass blocks I'm
 

251
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,939
oh yeah those are the glass blocks I'm
talking about there directly above the

252
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:32,949
talking about there directly above the
 

253
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:43,809
talking about there directly above the
soil eight blocks up

254
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:43,819

 

255
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,340

so I finally have a use for all the

256
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,350
so I finally have a use for all the
 

257
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:53,150
so I finally have a use for all the
bullets I've been getting just cool

258
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,160

 

259
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,689

I think it usually takes about three

260
00:09:59,689 --> 00:09:59,699
I think it usually takes about three
 

261
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:05,470
I think it usually takes about three
stacks of bonemeal to draw them all and

262
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:05,480
stacks of bonemeal to draw them all and
 

263
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,769
stacks of bonemeal to draw them all and
I got 24 trees with this setup I use

264
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:12,779
I got 24 trees with this setup I use
 

265
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,100
I got 24 trees with this setup I use
mossy cobblestone just for looks there's

266
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,110
mossy cobblestone just for looks there's
 

267
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:25,180
mossy cobblestone just for looks there's
a ring 13 by 13 for the collection point

268
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,190

 

269
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,249

and then on the soil blocks I have these

270
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:27,259
and then on the soil blocks I have these
 

271
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,720
and then on the soil blocks I have these
torches so that saplings will uproot for

272
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:31,730
torches so that saplings will uproot for
 

273
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,579
torches so that saplings will uproot for
having a lack of lights if there's a

274
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:33,589
having a lack of lights if there's a
 

275
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:40,650
having a lack of lights if there's a
tree grove the bubble

276
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:40,660

 

277
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,820

[Applause]

278

279
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,150

so it works works really well I don't

280
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
so it works works really well I don't
 

281
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,340
so it works works really well I don't
recommend you building this style of a

282
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,350
recommend you building this style of a
 

283
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,530
recommend you building this style of a
tree farm if you don't have a steady

284
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:52,540
tree farm if you don't have a steady
 

285
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,190
tree farm if you don't have a steady
supply of bones it's more of a if you're

286
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,200
supply of bones it's more of a if you're
 

287
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,320
supply of bones it's more of a if you're
settled in your world like I am then

288
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,330
settled in your world like I am then
 

289
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,720
settled in your world like I am then
this works pretty good actually really

290
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:00,730
this works pretty good actually really
 

291
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:09,300
this works pretty good actually really
good and when you're done deposit your

292
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,310
good and when you're done deposit your
 

293
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:17,550
good and when you're done deposit your
stuff back and this you can't go down

294
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:17,560
stuff back and this you can't go down
 

295
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,940
stuff back and this you can't go down
the up way I've got a little drop zone

296
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:20,950
the up way I've got a little drop zone
 

297
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,930
the up way I've got a little drop zone
here for exits all the saplings that

298
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:24,940
here for exits all the saplings that
 

299
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,930
here for exits all the saplings that
float to the center you can pick up and

300
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:26,940
float to the center you can pick up and
 

301
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,610
float to the center you can pick up and
deposit

302
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:28,620
deposit
 

303
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,980
deposit
usually it's pretty close to 24 you got

304
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:31,990
usually it's pretty close to 24 you got
 

305
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,090
usually it's pretty close to 24 you got
21 that time now on the other side is

306
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,100
21 that time now on the other side is
 

307
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,720
21 that time now on the other side is
the cactus farm pretty much identical I

308
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:41,730

 

309
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,740

went to the nether I got some more

310
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:43,750
went to the nether I got some more
 

311
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:53,109
went to the nether I got some more
glowstone I'll lock the stuff here

312
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:53,119

 

313
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:56,030

so the cactus farm much the same thing

314
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,040
so the cactus farm much the same thing
 

315
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,549
so the cactus farm much the same thing
tree farm you enter over here opposite

316
00:11:58,549 --> 00:11:58,559
tree farm you enter over here opposite
 

317
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,030
tree farm you enter over here opposite
side is the cactus farm go up the spiral

pretty straightforward this parts not
done either yet and I have a drop here

328
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:20,779
done either yet and I have a drop here
 

329
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:27,579
done either yet and I have a drop here
just like the tree farm has a chest here

330
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:27,589
just like the tree farm has a chest here
 

331
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,069
just like the tree farm has a chest here
deposit them and then these two furnaces

332
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:31,079
deposit them and then these two furnaces
 

333
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,639
deposit them and then these two furnaces
are dedicated to making the green the

334
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:34,649
are dedicated to making the green the
 

335
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:40,609
are dedicated to making the green the
green dye and when I have this chest

336
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:40,619
green dye and when I have this chest
 

337
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:45,470
green dye and when I have this chest
full of either cactus or the dye I can

338
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,480
full of either cactus or the dye I can
 

339
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,079
full of either cactus or the dye I can
pick it up and then haul it to the

340
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,089
pick it up and then haul it to the
 

341
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,710
pick it up and then haul it to the
storage room and deposit it so it's

342
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:51,720
storage room and deposit it so it's
 

343
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,169
storage room and deposit it so it's
pretty cool I really like these two

344
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:57,179
pretty cool I really like these two
 

345
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,030
pretty cool I really like these two
farms they're almost identical and yet

346
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
farms they're almost identical and yet
 

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,039
farms they're almost identical and yet
they do two different things and I even

348
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,049
they do two different things and I even
 

349
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,809
they do two different things and I even
have this little up neat little

350
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:05,819
have this little up neat little
 

351
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:11,360
have this little up neat little
passageway here

352
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,370

 

353
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:19,519

to get from one to the other which is

354
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:19,529
to get from one to the other which is
 

355
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:34,430
to get from one to the other which is
pretty cool I think I have a feeling of

356
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:34,440
pretty cool I think I have a feeling of
 

357
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,910
pretty cool I think I have a feeling of
someone behind me and it looks kind of

358
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:40,920
someone behind me and it looks kind of
 

359
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,510
someone behind me and it looks kind of
cool too the passage between the two and

360
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:46,520
cool too the passage between the two and
 

361
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,100
cool too the passage between the two and
so this is where they all collect the

362
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,110
so this is where they all collect the
 

363
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,820
so this is where they all collect the
center here and then piping here takes

364
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:52,830
center here and then piping here takes
 

365
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:59,660
center here and then piping here takes
them to the collection areas

366
00:13:59,660 --> 00:13:59,670

 

367
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,689

[Applause]

368
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:03,699

 

369
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:10,600

very nice I think so you guys might have

370
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:10,610
very nice I think so you guys might have
 

371
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,030
very nice I think so you guys might have
notice but the minecart track is still

372
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
notice but the minecart track is still
 

373
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,150
notice but the minecart track is still
here last episode I was really intent on

374
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
here last episode I was really intent on
 

375
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,420
here last episode I was really intent on
ripping it out and add my tool belt on

376
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,430
ripping it out and add my tool belt on
 

377
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,629
ripping it out and add my tool belt on
and everything but like some type of a

378
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
and everything but like some type of a
 

379
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,999
and everything but like some type of a
protective mother you guys tried to

380
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:25,009
protective mother you guys tried to
 

381
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:28,059
protective mother you guys tried to
plead a case or you know try to convince

382
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:28,069
plead a case or you know try to convince
 

383
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:34,199
plead a case or you know try to convince
me that it might have some use still and

384
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:34,209

 

385
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,819

at best you know I thought it would

386
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:36,829
at best you know I thought it would
 

387
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:39,340
at best you know I thought it would
serve as a science experiment something

388
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,350
serve as a science experiment something
 

389
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,610
serve as a science experiment something
that looked cool but you guys made a

390
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:42,620
that looked cool but you guys made a
 

391
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,220
that looked cool but you guys made a
pretty good case one thing you suggested

392
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,230
pretty good case one thing you suggested
 

393
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,730
pretty good case one thing you suggested
is to set up some sort of button or

394
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:48,740
is to set up some sort of button or
 

395
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,309
is to set up some sort of button or
buttons or levers or something to

396
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:53,319
buttons or levers or something to
 

397
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,900
buttons or levers or something to
control this door to turn the system on

398
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:58,910
control this door to turn the system on
 

399
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,999
control this door to turn the system on
or off so if I leave my base I can shut

400
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:01,009
or off so if I leave my base I can shut
 

401
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,980
or off so if I leave my base I can shut
it off and I won't have a with my cards

402
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:05,990
it off and I won't have a with my cards
 

403
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,780
it off and I won't have a with my cards
getting stuck on the track and that's

404
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:10,790
getting stuck on the track and that's
 

405
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,850
getting stuck on the track and that's
something I thought about doing - it's a

406
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:12,860
something I thought about doing - it's a
 

407
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,600
something I thought about doing - it's a
good suggestion but I still wasn't quite

408
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:16,610
good suggestion but I still wasn't quite
 

409
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,389
good suggestion but I still wasn't quite
happy with it because even if I do that

410
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:19,399
happy with it because even if I do that
 

411
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,540
happy with it because even if I do that
if I somehow have to leave the game

412
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:22,550
if I somehow have to leave the game
 

413
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,629
if I somehow have to leave the game
quickly or if I forget to shut the

414
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:25,639
quickly or if I forget to shut the
 

415
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:32,230
quickly or if I forget to shut the
system off or I die or you know game

416
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
system off or I die or you know game
 

417
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,470
system off or I die or you know game
crashes anything could happen then I

418
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,480
crashes anything could happen then I
 

419
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,660
crashes anything could happen then I
have to deal with the carts on the track

420
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:37,670
have to deal with the carts on the track
 

421
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,220
have to deal with the carts on the track
and like I said I can't really destroy

422
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,230
and like I said I can't really destroy
 

423
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,710
and like I said I can't really destroy
them because they fall into these cracks

424
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
them because they fall into these cracks
 

425
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,360
them because they fall into these cracks
where the stairs are and I can't pick

426
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,370
where the stairs are and I can't pick
 

427
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,350
where the stairs are and I can't pick
them up so I would have to push them all

428
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
them up so I would have to push them all
 

429
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,730
them up so I would have to push them all
which would involve walking around the

430
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:51,740
which would involve walking around the
 

431
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,810
which would involve walking around the
whole storage room

432
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:53,820
whole storage room
 

433
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,150
whole storage room
every time that happens which is a huge

434
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
every time that happens which is a huge
 

435
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,360
every time that happens which is a huge
pain well not a huge pain it takes a

436
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,370
pain well not a huge pain it takes a
 

437
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,450
pain well not a huge pain it takes a
minute but you know not something I want

438
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:02,460
minute but you know not something I want
 

439
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,080
minute but you know not something I want
to do all the time so another good

440
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,090
to do all the time so another good
 

441
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,850
to do all the time so another good
suggestion you guys gave me is to use

442
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:07,860
suggestion you guys gave me is to use
 

443
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,220
suggestion you guys gave me is to use
one of those furnace mine carts and to

444
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,230
one of those furnace mine carts and to
 

445
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,880
one of those furnace mine carts and to
set up some system for it and it'll come

446
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:13,890
set up some system for it and it'll come
 

447
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,050
set up some system for it and it'll come
up and push them all around and you guys

448
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,060
up and push them all around and you guys
 

449
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,920
up and push them all around and you guys
told me something I didn't know that if

450
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:20,930
told me something I didn't know that if
 

451
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,860
told me something I didn't know that if
you have one up if you have one of those

452
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:24,870
you have one up if you have one of those
 

453
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,530
you have one up if you have one of those
furnace mine carts not on a track it

454
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:27,540
furnace mine carts not on a track it
 

455
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,480
furnace mine carts not on a track it
doesn't use the coal so you could

456
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,490
doesn't use the coal so you could
 

457
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,520
doesn't use the coal so you could
probably put it on a door like this and

458
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:34,530
probably put it on a door like this and
 

459
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,260
probably put it on a door like this and
then when you want to call it open the

460
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,270
then when you want to call it open the
 

461
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,080
then when you want to call it open the
door and it'll start going on the track

462
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,090
door and it'll start going on the track
 

463
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,640
door and it'll start going on the track
and using the coal so combine those two

464
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:43,650
and using the coal so combine those two
 

465
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,010
and using the coal so combine those two
ideas I think we might somehow salvage

466
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,020
ideas I think we might somehow salvage
 

467
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,660
ideas I think we might somehow salvage
our minecart track system here I think

468
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:50,670
our minecart track system here I think
 

469
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,490
our minecart track system here I think
it might be fairly cool so that's what

470
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:55,500
it might be fairly cool so that's what
 

471
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,740
it might be fairly cool so that's what
we're going to do right now I've decided

472
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:57,750
we're going to do right now I've decided
 

473
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,300
we're going to do right now I've decided
to put call buttons here at all the

474
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,310
to put call buttons here at all the
 

475
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:09,080
to put call buttons here at all the
corners I don't have a whole lot of

476
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,090
corners I don't have a whole lot of
 

477
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,210
corners I don't have a whole lot of
options where I can put them because any

478
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,220
options where I can put them because any
 

479
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,270
options where I can put them because any
redstone wiring risks interfering with

480
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,280
redstone wiring risks interfering with
 

481
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,740
redstone wiring risks interfering with
my dispensers so the corners is a pretty

482
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:18,750
my dispensers so the corners is a pretty
 

483
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,940
my dispensers so the corners is a pretty
good place where I don't have any

484
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:19,950
good place where I don't have any
 

485

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:26,630

 

487
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:34,539

anymore Peters I think the buttons on

488
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:34,549
anymore Peters I think the buttons on
 

489
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:38,320
anymore Peters I think the buttons on
all the corners and then we'll run

490
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,330
all the corners and then we'll run
 

491
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:45,190
all the corners and then we'll run
redstone both these buttons will power

492
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
redstone both these buttons will power
 

493
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,830
redstone both these buttons will power
the Redstone and I kind of a mind out

494
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
the Redstone and I kind of a mind out
 

495
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,710
the Redstone and I kind of a mind out
the area here already to save time

496
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720

 

497
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,340

tour of underneath my storage room
 

501
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,299
tour of underneath my storage room
because I don't think I really show you

502

because I don't think I really show you
as this there's actually quite a bit of

504
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,100
as this there's actually quite a bit of
 

505
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:07,299
as this there's actually quite a bit of
hollowed out area this is the timer room

506
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:07,309
hollowed out area this is the timer room
 

507
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,360
hollowed out area this is the timer room
and then note blocks I hate coming in

508
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,370
and then note blocks I hate coming in
 

509
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:16,500
and then note blocks I hate coming in
here because it's really hard to move I

510
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,510

we got the station in here and that's

558
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:09,910
we got the station in here and that's
 

559
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,820
we got the station in here and that's
about it and there's an ice road and

560
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:14,830
about it and there's an ice road and
 

561
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,770
about it and there's an ice road and
some other stuff but I can't get to it

some other stuff but I can't get to it
from here I don't think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

564
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:22,840
from here I don't think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
 

565
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:33,960
from here I don't think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
I like placing a wire on soil

566
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:33,970

fifteen oh let's put it over here this

572
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:51,590
fifteen oh let's put it over here this
 

573
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,350
fifteen oh let's put it over here this
is the other side so all eight we're

574
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:56,360
is the other side so all eight we're
 

575
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,970
is the other side so all eight we're
going to have eight buttons they're all

576
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:57,980
going to have eight buttons they're all
 

577
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,840
going to have eight buttons they're all
going to merge together and then they

578
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:01,850
going to merge together and then they
 

579
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,669
going to merge together and then they
are going to control a T flip-flop you

580
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
are going to control a T flip-flop you
 

581
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,610
are going to control a T flip-flop you
can't use an RS nor latch for this

582
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:11,620

 

583
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:20,799

because an RS nor latch is wolf RS nor

584
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:20,809
because an RS nor latch is wolf RS nor
 

585
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:27,310
because an RS nor latch is wolf RS nor
latch requires a tube inputs and we are

586
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:27,320
latch requires a tube inputs and we are
 

587
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,350
latch requires a tube inputs and we are
just going to have the one input the

588
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
just going to have the one input the
 

589
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:38,820

two okay and that brings us to here

606
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
two okay and that brings us to here
 

607
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,549
two okay and that brings us to here
we're not going to hook this up yet I

608
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
we're not going to hook this up yet I
 

609
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,090
we're not going to hook this up yet I
need to lower this all I think probably

610
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,100
need to lower this all I think probably
 

611
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,210
need to lower this all I think probably
four or five blocks is at the moment our

612
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,220
four or five blocks is at the moment our
 

613
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,549
four or five blocks is at the moment our
PEZ dispenser only holds I think seven

614
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
PEZ dispenser only holds I think seven
 

615
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,640
PEZ dispenser only holds I think seven
mine carts and we need it to hold at

616
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:33,650
mine carts and we need it to hold at
 

617
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:40,290
mine carts and we need it to hold at
least eight but more is better

618
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:40,300
least eight but more is better
 

619
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:51,070
least eight but more is better
underneath us is the mob system so it's

620
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,080
underneath us is the mob system so it's
 

621
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,900
underneath us is the mob system so it's
all hollowed out already so it shouldn't

622
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:52,910
all hollowed out already so it shouldn't
 

623
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:58,210
all hollowed out already so it shouldn't
be too hard to add and I'm just I think

624
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:58,220
be too hard to add and I'm just I think
 

625
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,740
be too hard to add and I'm just I think
I'm just going to copy it all exactly

626
00:22:59,740 --> 00:22:59,750
I'm just going to copy it all exactly
 

627
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm just going to copy it all exactly
like it is here

628
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,530

 

629
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:22,400

yeah okay so I'm going to lower that my

630
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,410
yeah okay so I'm going to lower that my
 

631
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,690
yeah okay so I'm going to lower that my
card stuff later off-camera sometime

632
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:25,700
card stuff later off-camera sometime
 

633
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,040
card stuff later off-camera sometime
because it's not going to be all that

634
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,050
because it's not going to be all that
 

635
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,360
because it's not going to be all that
interesting and then we're going to have

636
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,370
interesting and then we're going to have
 

637
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,660
interesting and then we're going to have
the eight buttons which can control the

638
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:34,670
the eight buttons which can control the
 

639
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,410
the eight buttons which can control the
system pressing it once turns it on

640
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:38,420
system pressing it once turns it on
 

641
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,080
system pressing it once turns it on
probably within 30 seconds mine carts

642
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,090
probably within 30 seconds mine carts
