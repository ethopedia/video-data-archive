wanted to go down half a block so I'm
 

59
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,560
wanted to go down half a block so I'm
going to use half slabs this I want it

60
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,570
going to use half slabs this I want it
 

61
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,760
going to use half slabs this I want it
kind of like a greenhouse looking if

for the plant one for the pumpkin or
whatever we'll do it on both sides like

82
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:42,610
whatever we'll do it on both sides like
 

83
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,060
whatever we'll do it on both sides like
this this is kind of why I want it to be

84
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,070
this this is kind of why I want it to be
 

85
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,930
this this is kind of why I want it to be
half slabs so if if these two blocks are

86
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:48,940
half slabs so if if these two blocks are
 

87
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,910
half slabs so if if these two blocks are
missing and I got my pumpkins in that

88
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:50,920
missing and I got my pumpkins in that

98
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,170
putting soil here both sides and
 

99
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,990
putting soil here both sides and
hollowing this place out a little bit

100
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
hollowing this place out a little bit
 

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,610

more hollowed out now but I forgot

102
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:17,620
more hollowed out now but I forgot
 

103
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,190
more hollowed out now but I forgot
something before I can place the soil

104
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,200
something before I can place the soil
 

105
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,480
something before I can place the soil
down I need to place our pistons and the

106
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,490
down I need to place our pistons and the
 

107
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,000
down I need to place our pistons and the
way that it's going to work by the way

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,010
way that it's going to work by the way
 

109
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,920
way that it's going to work by the way
I'd like it to work so we'll just run

110
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,930
I'd like it to work so we'll just run
 

111
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,860
I'd like it to work so we'll just run
our wire underneath the pressure plate

112
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:30,870
our wire underneath the pressure plate
 

113
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:39,900
our wire underneath the pressure plate
over there that's right over here it

114
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:39,910
over there that's right over here it
 

115
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:50,930
over there that's right over here it
will be hidden underneath our half slabs

116
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:50,940

 

117
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,530

118
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:55,540
there you okay we'll have our redstone
 

119
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:02,580
there you okay we'll have our redstone
underneath so when you walk in that

120
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:02,590
underneath so when you walk in that
 

121
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,520
underneath so when you walk in that
needs to power our Pistons gonna have

122
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,530
needs to power our Pistons gonna have
 

123
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,080
needs to power our Pistons gonna have
the Pistons one block lower right there

124
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,090
the Pistons one block lower right there
 

125
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,640
the Pistons one block lower right there
so that wire should power the no problem

126
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:14,650
so that wire should power the no problem
 

127
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,800
so that wire should power the no problem
let's check it just to make sure yeah so

128
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:22,810
let's check it just to make sure yeah so
 

129
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,940
let's check it just to make sure yeah so
then we'll have our tilled farmland over

130
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:26,950
then we'll have our tilled farmland over
 

131
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,160
then we'll have our tilled farmland over
here this is that what the pumpkins and

132
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,170
here this is that what the pumpkins and
 

133
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,800
here this is that what the pumpkins and
melons will grow on so if there's any

134
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:31,810
melons will grow on so if there's any
 

135
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,300
melons will grow on so if there's any
grown above will get pushed up and then

136
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,310
grown above will get pushed up and then
 

137
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,510
grown above will get pushed up and then
they'll get Auto harvested and then

138
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
they'll get Auto harvested and then
 

139
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,320
they'll get Auto harvested and then
you'll just have to retail any oops any

140
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,330
you'll just have to retail any oops any
 

141
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,250
you'll just have to retail any oops any
soil that's untilled after that

142
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,260
soil that's untilled after that
 

143
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,480
soil that's untilled after that
ooh I'm not doing too well with my words

144
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,490
ooh I'm not doing too well with my words
 

145
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,460
ooh I'm not doing too well with my words
anyway and the plants go here so the

146
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,470
anyway and the plants go here so the
 

147
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:05,170
anyway and the plants go here so the
plants will grow this way see

148
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,180
plants will grow this way see
 

149
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,920
plants will grow this way see
yeah so I'll do that both sides and I'll

150
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:08,930
yeah so I'll do that both sides and I'll
 

151
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,630
yeah so I'll do that both sides and I'll
try figure out how long I want it I'm

152
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:10,640
try figure out how long I want it I'm
 

153
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,880
try figure out how long I want it I'm
guessing around 10 blocks would be nice

154
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:12,890
guessing around 10 blocks would be nice
 

155
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,300
guessing around 10 blocks would be nice
and blocks long maybe 10 pumpkins and

156
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,310
and blocks long maybe 10 pumpkins and
 

157
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:40,740
and blocks long maybe 10 pumpkins and
Penn melons 1 2 3 4 5

158
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:40,750

 

159
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:51,010

just in its 10 long yeah so this is

160
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,020
just in its 10 long yeah so this is
 

161
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,560
just in its 10 long yeah so this is
going pretty quick it's not done yet but

162
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,570
going pretty quick it's not done yet but
 

163
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,740
going pretty quick it's not done yet but
it's going real fast just going to put

164
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:56,750
it's going real fast just going to put
 

165
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,910
it's going real fast just going to put
fences below the actual plants so they

166
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:00,920
fences below the actual plants so they
 

167
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,500
fences below the actual plants so they
can't be trampled hopefully if that

168
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,510
can't be trampled hopefully if that
 

169
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,820
can't be trampled hopefully if that
trick stays in the game I don't know if

170
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:06,830
trick stays in the game I don't know if
 

171
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,520
trick stays in the game I don't know if
it will be for long

172
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:09,530
it will be for long
 

173
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,440
it will be for long
we'll find out we'll cover that with

174
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,450
we'll find out we'll cover that with
 

175
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,220
we'll find out we'll cover that with
soil that's where the plants will be

176
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,230
soil that's where the plants will be
 

177
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,140
soil that's where the plants will be
this is what this is what it looks like

178
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,150
this is what this is what it looks like
 

179
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,660
this is what this is what it looks like
I brought pumpkins with me to try this

180
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,670
I brought pumpkins with me to try this
 

181
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,300
I brought pumpkins with me to try this
out to make sure it works

182
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,310

 

183
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,970

yeah harvests no problem but you know

184
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:36,980
yeah harvests no problem but you know
 

185
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,080
yeah harvests no problem but you know
what I kind of messed up here I want it

186
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,090
what I kind of messed up here I want it
 

187
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,500
what I kind of messed up here I want it
to be so that when I walk in the soil is

188
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:44,510
to be so that when I walk in the soil is
 

189
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,650
to be so that when I walk in the soil is
up and then when I walk out I want to go

190
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:47,660
up and then when I walk out I want to go
 

191
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,080
up and then when I walk out I want to go
back down the easiest way would be to

192
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,090
back down the easiest way would be to
 

193
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,330
back down the easiest way would be to
use a lever I suppose maybe I'll try

194
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,340
use a lever I suppose maybe I'll try
 

195
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,270
use a lever I suppose maybe I'll try
hook up an RS nor latch or a t flip-flop

196
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
hook up an RS nor latch or a t flip-flop
 

197
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,170
hook up an RS nor latch or a t flip-flop
or something to our pressure plate maybe

198
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,180
or something to our pressure plate maybe
 

199
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,840
or something to our pressure plate maybe
if if I got enough space here wish I

200
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:10,850
if if I got enough space here wish I
 

201
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,190
if if I got enough space here wish I
thought of that sooner we'll make it

202
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,200
thought of that sooner we'll make it
 

203
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,480
thought of that sooner we'll make it

simplest things in our cheap system so

224
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:54,640
simplest things in our cheap system so
 

225
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,470
simplest things in our cheap system so
far this is like our starting out area

226
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:00,480

 

227
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:30,020

should work good hopefully we are

232
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:39,700
should work good hopefully we are
 

233
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,520
should work good hopefully we are
missing something important though we

234
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:41,530
missing something important though we
 

235
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,980
missing something important though we
need water so that our crops will be

236
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:43,990
need water so that our crops will be
 

237
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,770
need water so that our crops will be
hydrated so I'm just going to stick some

238
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:48,780

 

239
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:56,880

that's for sure but if I do I'll
probably cut out a lot of the grinding

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,330
probably cut out a lot of the grinding
 

263
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,900
probably cut out a lot of the grinding
parts of it and just give you like

I'm going to use lava because at some

284
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm going to use lava because at some
 

285
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,100

torches in my cave area so we'll have to
 

289
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,420
torches in my cave area so we'll have to
design this with lava probably yeah

290

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:47,990
to get it but it's pretty rare yeah okay
 

321
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,870
to get it but it's pretty rare yeah okay
so I'll add the lava and then we'll

322
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:49,880
so I'll add the lava and then we'll
 

323
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,720
so I'll add the lava and then we'll
plant our crops and I should figure out

324
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:55,730
plant our crops and I should figure out
 

325
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,150
plant our crops and I should figure out
what I'm going to do about the redstone

326
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,160
what I'm going to do about the redstone
 

327
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,210
what I'm going to do about the redstone
I'll probably have just if I can make it

328
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,220
I'll probably have just if I can make it
 

329
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,910
I'll probably have just if I can make it
work out maybe have two stone pressure

330
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
work out maybe have two stone pressure
 

331
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,540
work out maybe have two stone pressure
plates this one here will set an RS nor

332
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:10,550
plates this one here will set an RS nor
 

333
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:16,210
plates this one here will set an RS nor
latch so that these stay up and the

334
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,220
latch so that these stay up and the
 

335
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,130
latch so that these stay up and the
second one over here will make them go

336
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,140
second one over here will make them go
 

337
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,170
second one over here will make them go
down all right so when I walk into the

338
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,180
down all right so when I walk into the
 

339
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,940
down all right so when I walk into the
farm they'll be down normally so if I

340
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:24,950
farm they'll be down normally so if I
 

341
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,310
farm they'll be down normally so if I
walk on the one that makes it go down

342
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
walk on the one that makes it go down
 

343
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,780
walk on the one that makes it go down
nothing will change but when I walk on

344
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:28,790
nothing will change but when I walk on
 

345
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,740
nothing will change but when I walk on
this one they'll go up and then when I

346
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:32,750
this one they'll go up and then when I
 

347
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,900
this one they'll go up and then when I
leave the farm these will still be up if

348
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:34,910
leave the farm these will still be up if
 

349
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,370
leave the farm these will still be up if
I walk on the one that makes them go up

350
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:36,380
I walk on the one that makes them go up
 

351
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,920
I walk on the one that makes them go up
nothing changes but then when I walk on

352
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:38,930
nothing changes but then when I walk on
 

353
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,940
nothing changes but then when I walk on
the make it go down one they'll go down

354
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:42,950
the make it go down one they'll go down
 

355
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:49,900
the make it go down one they'll go down
so that'll maybe work I'll try it it's

356
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:49,910
so that'll maybe work I'll try it it's
 

357
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,389
so that'll maybe work I'll try it it's
very close to being done now I went with

358
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
very close to being done now I went with
 

359
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,780
very close to being done now I went with
the pressure plate after all and I did a

360
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:55,790
the pressure plate after all and I did a
 

361
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:02,560
the pressure plate after all and I did a
T flip-flop so what happens you hit the

362
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:02,570
T flip-flop so what happens you hit the
 

363
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,100
T flip-flop so what happens you hit the
button

364
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,110
button
 

365
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,120
button
block moves over which empowers this

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,130
block moves over which empowers this
 

367
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,460
block moves over which empowers this
wire but if the block is above the

368
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,470
wire but if the block is above the
 

369
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,199
wire but if the block is above the
redstone torch

370
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:12,209

 

371
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,910

then it powers the wire the wire goes to

372
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:14,920
then it powers the wire the wire goes to
 

373
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,269
then it powers the wire the wire goes to
redstone torch here which powers the

374
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:18,279
redstone torch here which powers the
 

375
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,549
redstone torch here which powers the
line redstone wire above that's pretty

376
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:23,559
line redstone wire above that's pretty
 

377
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:29,939
line redstone wire above that's pretty
cool just have to put a floor here cover

378
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:29,949
cool just have to put a floor here cover
 

379
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:34,229
cool just have to put a floor here cover
it up like that

380
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:34,239
it up like that
 

381
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:40,199
it up like that
and so when I walk in boom all the

382
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:40,209
and so when I walk in boom all the
 

383
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,530
and so when I walk in boom all the
pumpkins and melons get harvested not

384
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:43,540
pumpkins and melons get harvested not
 

385
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,059
pumpkins and melons get harvested not
the other nice thing about these glass

386
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:45,069
the other nice thing about these glass
 

387
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:47,179
the other nice thing about these glass
blocks here is they should prevent like

388
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:47,189
blocks here is they should prevent like
 

389
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,710
blocks here is they should prevent like
the melons and that from landing on the

390
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:49,720
the melons and that from landing on the
 

391
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,009
the melons and that from landing on the
plant area probably a few still will but

392
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:53,019
plant area probably a few still will but
 

393
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,689
plant area probably a few still will but
it'll help prevent that from happening

394
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:56,699
it'll help prevent that from happening
 

395
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:00,840
it'll help prevent that from happening
and then when I leave it goes down so

396
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:00,850
and then when I leave it goes down so
 

397
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,439
and then when I leave it goes down so
that's what I wanted we got pretty cool

398
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:04,449
that's what I wanted we got pretty cool
 

399
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,329
that's what I wanted we got pretty cool
lighting here got lava

400
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:06,339
lighting here got lava
 

401
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,769
lighting here got lava
then I moved the water up just for looks

402
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:09,779
then I moved the water up just for looks
 

403
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,069
then I moved the water up just for looks
kind of have a red blue red blue red

404
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:13,079
kind of have a red blue red blue red
 

405
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,009
kind of have a red blue red blue red
thing in here and this water hydrates

406
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:17,019
thing in here and this water hydrates
 

407
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,009
thing in here and this water hydrates
the land so the only thing left now is

408
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:20,019
the land so the only thing left now is
 

409
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:27,659
the land so the only thing left now is
to actually plant our well there's a few

410
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:27,669
to actually plant our well there's a few
 

411
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,879
to actually plant our well there's a few
things left but main thing left is plant

412
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:31,889
things left but main thing left is plant
 

413
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:42,090
things left but main thing left is plant
our melons and our pumpkins here

414
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,100

 

415
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,480

I got the seeds from the abandoned

416
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,490
I got the seeds from the abandoned
 

417
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,200

mineshaft for the for the watermelons

418
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,210
mineshaft for the for the watermelons
 

419
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,890
mineshaft for the for the watermelons
here and I wonder if I have a side

420
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:52,900
here and I wonder if I have a side
 

421
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,380
here and I wonder if I have a side
preference or should i mix and match

422
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,390
preference or should i mix and match
 

423
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,180
preference or should i mix and match
them I'll probably just do water Mel on

424
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,190
them I'll probably just do water Mel on
 

425
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,220
them I'll probably just do water Mel on
this side and then pumpkins on this side

426
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,230
this side and then pumpkins on this side

melons still only drop one it's fixed in

436
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:28,750
melons still only drop one it's fixed in
 

437
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,390

the pre-release five but like I said I'm

438
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:33,400
the pre-release five but like I said I'm
 

439
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,480
the pre-release five but like I said I'm
trying to avoid using that I'll wait for

440
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,490
trying to avoid using that I'll wait for
 

441
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,820
trying to avoid using that I'll wait for
six I'm sure they'll be a six all right

442
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:41,830
six I'm sure they'll be a six all right
 

443
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,640
six I'm sure they'll be a six all right
very nice so even when the pumpkins and

444
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,650
very nice so even when the pumpkins and
 

445
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:51,300
very nice so even when the pumpkins and
melons yeah if if they don't grow and I

446
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,310
melons yeah if if they don't grow and I
 

447
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,050
melons yeah if if they don't grow and I
enter here like if a few have grown

448
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,060
enter here like if a few have grown
 

449
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:00,570
enter here like if a few have grown
that's fine even if I if I step on

450
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:00,580
that's fine even if I if I step on
 

451
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,700
that's fine even if I if I step on
pressure plate the tilled soil doesn't

452
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:02,710
pressure plate the tilled soil doesn't
 

453
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,200
pressure plate the tilled soil doesn't
get untilled when it goes up like that

454
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,210
get untilled when it goes up like that
 

455
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,060
get untilled when it goes up like that
so that's okay and I wanted to add a

456
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,070
so that's okay and I wanted to add a
 

457
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:14,250
so that's okay and I wanted to add a
dispenser here too for the hole and I

458
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:14,260
dispenser here too for the hole and I
 

459
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,790
dispenser here too for the hole and I
brought one with me maybe

460
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800

 

461
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,049

so maybe I'll try get the redstone wire

462
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:23,059
so maybe I'll try get the redstone wire
 

463
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:28,030
so maybe I'll try get the redstone wire
to connect to that underneath there got

464
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,040
to connect to that underneath there got
 

465
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,460
to connect to that underneath there got
the dispenser hooked up but that is not

466
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,470
the dispenser hooked up but that is not
 

467
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,949
the dispenser hooked up but that is not
all I also spent some time polishing it

468
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
all I also spent some time polishing it
 

469
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,319
all I also spent some time polishing it
up making it look nice because I know

470
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:35,329
up making it look nice because I know
 

471
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,449
up making it look nice because I know
you guys like it when I do that so just

our our hole got shot at us from our

486
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:13,399
our our hole got shot at us from our
 

487
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,250
our our hole got shot at us from our
dispenser so if we had an empty

488
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:17,260
dispenser so if we had an empty
 

489
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,899
dispenser so if we had an empty
inventory at our front here it would

490
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:19,909
inventory at our front here it would
 

491
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:25,090
inventory at our front here it would
just be neatly in our inventory and then

492
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,100
just be neatly in our inventory and then
 

493
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,240
just be neatly in our inventory and then
you would just retail everything put it

494
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,250
you would just retail everything put it
 

495
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:35,710
you would just retail everything put it
back and leave since the sense is that T

496
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:35,720
back and leave since the sense is that T
 

497
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,539
back and leave since the sense is that T
flip-flop it doesn't get shot out again

498
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:37,549
flip-flop it doesn't get shot out again
 

499
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,260
flip-flop it doesn't get shot out again
so that's fine and yeah that's all there

500
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,270
so that's fine and yeah that's all there
 

501
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,139
so that's fine and yeah that's all there
is to it it's it's nice I'll show you

502
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:47,149
is to it it's it's nice I'll show you
 

503
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,490
is to it it's it's nice I'll show you
the wiring for the dispenser ow all I

504
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:51,500
the wiring for the dispenser ow all I
 

505
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,250
the wiring for the dispenser ow all I
did spencer's over there on the back

506
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,260
did spencer's over there on the back
 

507
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,220
did spencer's over there on the back
there's there's a repeater there the

508
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,230
there's there's a repeater there the
 

509
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,549
there's there's a repeater there the
wire connects to repeater repeater sends

510
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:03,559
wire connects to repeater repeater sends
 

511
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,120
wire connects to repeater repeater sends
power to this block and then there's a

512
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,130
power to this block and then there's a
 

513
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,580
power to this block and then there's a
redstone wire on top the redstone wire

514
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:09,590
redstone wire on top the redstone wire
 

515
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,690
redstone wire on top the redstone wire
on top sends power to this block and

516
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:12,700
on top sends power to this block and
 

517
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,690
on top sends power to this block and
since this block is adjacent to the

518
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:15,700
since this block is adjacent to the
 

519
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,740
since this block is adjacent to the
dispenser it sends power to the

520
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:17,750
dispenser it sends power to the
 

521
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,580
dispenser it sends power to the
dispenser and it shoots out the hole so

522
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:21,590
dispenser and it shoots out the hole so
 

523
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,990
dispenser and it shoots out the hole so
that was not hard to do at all

524
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,000

 

525
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,250

one more project on McCool I am going to

526
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:32,260
one more project on McCool I am going to
 

527
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,560
one more project on McCool I am going to
check the time and we may do some more

528
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:34,570
check the time and we may do some more
 

529
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,710
check the time and we may do some more
stuff I don't know this is good because

530
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:37,720
stuff I don't know this is good because
 

531
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
stuff I don't know this is good because
it's given me a feel of how I want the

532
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:39,730
it's given me a feel of how I want the
 

533
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,909
it's given me a feel of how I want the
chief to turn out to when I when I

534
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
chief to turn out to when I when I
 

535
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,070
chief to turn out to when I when I
polish up projects like this I can tell

536
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
polish up projects like this I can tell
 

537
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,260
polish up projects like this I can tell
already that I want this area wider I

538
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,270
already that I want this area wider I
 

539
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,180
already that I want this area wider I
want this to be at least four or five

540
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,190
want this to be at least four or five
 

541
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,430
want this to be at least four or five
blocks wide because right now it feels

542
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:50,440
blocks wide because right now it feels
 

543
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,799
blocks wide because right now it feels
like I'm too close it's just way too

544
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:52,809
like I'm too close it's just way too
 

545
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:56,279
like I'm too close it's just way too
close so that gives me an idea of how to
