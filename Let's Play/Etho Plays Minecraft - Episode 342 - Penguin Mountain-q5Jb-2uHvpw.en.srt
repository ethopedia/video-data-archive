here but if you hear it we got like
 

81
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,600
here but if you hear it we got like
zombies stuck in there so we got to get

82
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:10,610
zombies stuck in there so we got to get
 

83
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,690
zombies stuck in there so we got to get
some villagers to attract them we'll

84
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:13,700
some villagers to attract them we'll
 

85
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,420
some villagers to attract them we'll
probably put those just on the outside

87
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,530

this is the middle right yeah that's the

88
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:23,540
this is the middle right yeah that's the
 

89
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,990
this is the middle right yeah that's the
middle so we got to figure out how many

90
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
middle so we got to figure out how many
 

91
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,580
middle so we got to figure out how many
we need or that we can get away with and

92
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,590
we need or that we can get away with and
 

93
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,850
we need or that we can get away with and
to figure it out we kind of need to know

94
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:32,860
to figure it out we kind of need to know
 

95
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,920
to figure it out we kind of need to know
how the zombie tracking works on the

166
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:18,950

167
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,690
see the villager they don't need a line
of sight to them either I that guy

168
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:22,700
of sight to them either I that guy
 

169
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,310
of sight to them either I that guy
started walking because he was trying to

170
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
started walking because he was trying to
 

171
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,350
started walking because he was trying to
get over here if they're tracking the

172
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,360
get over here if they're tracking the
 

173
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,030
get over here if they're tracking the
villager they their heads will look down

174
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,040
villager they their heads will look down
 

175
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,000
villager they their heads will look down
at them but you see the head is straight

176
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,010
at them but you see the head is straight
 

177
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,380
at them but you see the head is straight
across all right so if we move this guy

178
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,390
across all right so if we move this guy
 

179
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,310
across all right so if we move this guy
up one block and of course I mean kill

180
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,320
up one block and of course I mean kill
 

181
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,980
up one block and of course I mean kill
him and get a new villager we're not

182
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:41,990
him and get a new villager we're not
 

183
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,340
him and get a new villager we're not
actually gonna move them right away they

184
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,350
actually gonna move them right away they
 

185
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,390
actually gonna move them right away they
start tracking in

186
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,400
start tracking in
 

187
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,000
start tracking in
so that is five blocks below this path

188
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,010
so that is five blocks below this path
 

189
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,310
so that is five blocks below this path
here all right

190
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,320
here all right
 

191
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,969
here all right
and then upwards pretty much the same

192
00:04:58,969 --> 00:04:58,979
and then upwards pretty much the same
 

193
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,500
and then upwards pretty much the same
deal five blocks above is the limit so

194
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,510
deal five blocks above is the limit so
 

195
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,590
deal five blocks above is the limit so
if we go put some zombies down once

196
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
if we go put some zombies down once
 

197
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,780
if we go put some zombies down once
again they are not seeing him drop them

198
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:11,790
again they are not seeing him drop them
 

199
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,110
again they are not seeing him drop them
down one block although I guess the baby

200
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
down one block although I guess the baby
 

201
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,939
down one block although I guess the baby
zombie heads are yeah the baby zombies

202
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:19,949
zombie heads are yeah the baby zombies
 

203
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,400
zombie heads are yeah the baby zombies
won't see them because their head is one

204
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,410
won't see them because their head is one
 

205
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,529
won't see them because their head is one
block lower so keep that in mind I bet

206
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:24,539
block lower so keep that in mind I bet
 

207
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,110
block lower so keep that in mind I bet
you he'll track this guy down here

208
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
you he'll track this guy down here
 

209
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,810
you he'll track this guy down here
though oh yeah I think you saw him there

210
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:34,820
though oh yeah I think you saw him there
 

211
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,129
though oh yeah I think you saw him there
learn to tell me anyway so with that in

00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:40,139
learn to tell me anyway so with that in
 

213
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,040
learn to tell me anyway so with that in
mind we can do one more test really

214
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,050
mind we can do one more test really
 

215
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,980
mind we can do one more test really
quickly here just show you this

216
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:44,990
quickly here just show you this
 

217
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,180
quickly here just show you this
we got a villager down there and a

218
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,190
we got a villager down there and a
 

219
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,430
we got a villager down there and a
zombie up here he will not track them

220
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
zombie up here he will not track them
 

221
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,719
zombie up here he will not track them
because this is one well unless that guy

222
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:53,729
because this is one well unless that guy
 

223
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,580
because this is one well unless that guy
goes up the staircase

224
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:57,590

 

225
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:05,510

you reckon my test one oops I was trying

226
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
you reckon my test one oops I was trying
 

227
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,690
you reckon my test one oops I was trying
to chant one two three four five six

228
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:08,700
to chant one two three four five six
 

229
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,029
to chant one two three four five six
blocks down it's out of out of range so

230
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:14,039
blocks down it's out of out of range so
 

231
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,640
blocks down it's out of out of range so
that level zombie can't see them go one

232
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:16,650
that level zombie can't see them go one
 

233
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,330
that level zombie can't see them go one
level up pretty much right away alright

234
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:22,340
level up pretty much right away alright
 

235
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,950
level up pretty much right away alright
whew okay so now with what we know I've

236
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
whew okay so now with what we know I've
 

237
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,080
whew okay so now with what we know I've
marked this out we have six layers in

238
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,090
marked this out we have six layers in
 

239
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,150
marked this out we have six layers in
the mob system which I marked on this

240
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
the mob system which I marked on this
 

241
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,830
the mob system which I marked on this
side here that three to the layers

242
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
side here that three to the layers
 

243
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,350
side here that three to the layers
starts and then on the Left here is

244
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,360
starts and then on the Left here is
 

245
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,460
starts and then on the Left here is
where I'm planning on putting the

246
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,470
where I'm planning on putting the
 

247
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,060
where I'm planning on putting the
villagers so counting from here like if

248
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,070
villagers so counting from here like if
 

249
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,710
villagers so counting from here like if
we have a zombie spawning here if we go

250
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
we have a zombie spawning here if we go
 

251
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,180
we have a zombie spawning here if we go
one two three four that's within range

252
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,190
one two three four that's within range
 

253
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,980
one two three four that's within range
that the zombie will see a villager up

254
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:48,990
that the zombie will see a villager up
 

255
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,409
that the zombie will see a villager up
there even a baby zombie will see a

256
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:51,419
there even a baby zombie will see a
 

257
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,540
there even a baby zombie will see a
villager there if we don't care about

258
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:53,550
villager there if we don't care about
 

259
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,159
villager there if we don't care about
the baby zombies we could go one higher

260
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,169
the baby zombies we could go one higher
 

261
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,959
the baby zombies we could go one higher
with the villager from there - there's

262
00:06:59,959 --> 00:06:59,969
with the villager from there - there's
 

263
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:00,740
with the villager from there - there's
good there

264
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:00,750
good there
 

265
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,460
good there
there's good from there to there is one

266
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,470
there's good from there to there is one
 

267
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,460
there's good from there to there is one
two three four five blocks down so again

268
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,470
two three four five blocks down so again
 

269
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,400
two three four five blocks down so again
that's within range going downwards so

270
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,410
that's within range going downwards so
 

271
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,500
that's within range going downwards so
the only two layers that won't see the

272
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:12,510
the only two layers that won't see the
 

273
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,380
the only two layers that won't see the
villager at that height is this one and

274
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:15,390
villager at that height is this one and
 

275
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,000
villager at that height is this one and
this one so we need a second villager we

276
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,010
this one so we need a second villager we
 

277
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,190
this one so we need a second villager we
could increase the distance between the

278
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,200
could increase the distance between the
 

279
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,690
could increase the distance between the
two villagers like I could raise this

280
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:23,700
two villagers like I could raise this
 

281
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,750
two villagers like I could raise this
one higher but we're at the top of the

282
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:26,760
one higher but we're at the top of the
 

283
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,520
one higher but we're at the top of the
mob system anyway so I don't really care

284
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,530
mob system anyway so I don't really care
 

285
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,030
mob system anyway so I don't really care
so now we got to figure out how to get a

286
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,040
so now we got to figure out how to get a
 

287
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,930
so now we got to figure out how to get a
zombie villager up on on these blocks

288
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:35,940
zombie villager up on on these blocks
 

289
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:43,690
zombie villager up on on these blocks
and then convert them should be fun Oh

290
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:43,700

 

291
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,080

skeleton skeleton no all right this is

292
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,090
skeleton skeleton no all right this is
 

293
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,940
skeleton skeleton no all right this is
it we're gonna get one oh no his helmet

294
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:52,950
it we're gonna get one oh no his helmet

324
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:58,860
problem I went inside here to check up
 

325
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,590
problem I went inside here to check up
on it and I guess all the cats are out

326
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,600
on it and I guess all the cats are out
 

327
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,010
on it and I guess all the cats are out
of position so I'm gonna have to put

328
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,020
of position so I'm gonna have to put
 

329
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,470
of position so I'm gonna have to put
them where the wolf is try to force them

330
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
them where the wolf is try to force them
 

331
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,380
them where the wolf is try to force them
together otherwise we'll just keep

332
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,390
together otherwise we'll just keep
 

333
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,329
together otherwise we'll just keep
coming loose I think because when I'm in

334
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:11,339
coming loose I think because when I'm in
 

335
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,730
coming loose I think because when I'm in
the area and I'm fighting the mobs they

336
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:13,740
the area and I'm fighting the mobs they
 

337
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,680
the area and I'm fighting the mobs they
like stand up

338
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:14,690
like stand up
 

339
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,260
like stand up
to try help me out and then they I think

340
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,270
to try help me out and then they I think
 

341
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,490
to try help me out and then they I think
they're getting out of place that way

342
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:20,500
they're getting out of place that way
 

343
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,200
they're getting out of place that way
dad's really tough to push the two

344
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,210
dad's really tough to push the two
 

345
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,140
dad's really tough to push the two
together so this is how I'm doing it

346
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,150
together so this is how I'm doing it
 

347
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,730
together so this is how I'm doing it
like that a little bit place one more

348
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:29,740
like that a little bit place one more
 

349
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,600
like that a little bit place one more
and yeah once again I do not recommend

350
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:34,610
and yeah once again I do not recommend
 

351
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,940
and yeah once again I do not recommend
this type of mob system setting this up

352
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:36,950
this type of mob system setting this up
 

353
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,170
this type of mob system setting this up
has been really difficult like building

354
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:41,180
has been really difficult like building
 

355
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,910
has been really difficult like building
it's easy getting the cats and dogs

356
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,920
it's easy getting the cats and dogs
 

357
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,570
it's easy getting the cats and dogs
where you need them insane

358
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:48,580

 

359
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,950

okay I know zombies don't really have

360
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:50,960
okay I know zombies don't really have
 

361
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,580
okay I know zombies don't really have
brains but this guy has some real

362
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:54,590
brains but this guy has some real
 

363
00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:00,430
brains but this guy has some real
problems he's totally ignoring me like

364
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,440
problems he's totally ignoring me like
 

365
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:14,470
problems he's totally ignoring me like
totally well it wasn't easy but we did

366
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
totally well it wasn't easy but we did
 

367
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,120
totally well it wasn't easy but we did
it we got one villager up there and

368
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,130
it we got one villager up there and
 

369
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:31,990
it we got one villager up there and
number two is right over there all right

370
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
number two is right over there all right
 

371
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,840
number two is right over there all right
very good excellent we have the

372
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:34,850
very good excellent we have the
 

373
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,530
very good excellent we have the
villagers in place one two we have the

374
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:38,540
villagers in place one two we have the
 

375
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,870
villagers in place one two we have the
ocelots and the wolves they've been put

376
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
ocelots and the wolves they've been put
 

377
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,520
ocelots and the wolves they've been put
back into place and they should probably

378
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:42,530
back into place and they should probably
 

379
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,080
back into place and they should probably
stay there now I think everything is

380
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,090
stay there now I think everything is
 

381
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,430
stay there now I think everything is
working pretty good with this now

382
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:48,440
working pretty good with this now
 

383
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,710
working pretty good with this now
there's a one issue I've noticed though

384
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
there's a one issue I've noticed though
 

385
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,650
there's a one issue I've noticed though
because it's based on an even number

386
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:53,660
because it's based on an even number
 

387
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,040
because it's based on an even number
like like that we got trapdoors there

388
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,050
like like that we got trapdoors there
 

389
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,720
like like that we got trapdoors there
and there

390
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:58,730
and there
 

391
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,390
and there
the middle is two blocks wide basically

392
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,400
the middle is two blocks wide basically
 

393
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,670
the middle is two blocks wide basically
we have to put these guys on one of the

394
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
we have to put these guys on one of the
 

395
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,890
we have to put these guys on one of the
sides and because of that any zombies on

396
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:08,900
sides and because of that any zombies on
 

397
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,860
sides and because of that any zombies on
this side of the spawning platform

398
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:11,870
this side of the spawning platform
 

399
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,560
this side of the spawning platform
sometimes one of the zombies won't fall

400
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,570
sometimes one of the zombies won't fall
 

401
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,410
sometimes one of the zombies won't fall
down he'll he'll just stay like right on

402
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:17,420
down he'll he'll just stay like right on
 

403
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,270
down he'll he'll just stay like right on
the edge of falling down because he's

404
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,280
the edge of falling down because he's
 

405
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,310
the edge of falling down because he's
tracking the villager that's not till

406
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:21,320
tracking the villager that's not till
 

407
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,860
tracking the villager that's not till
another zombie comes by and that he gets

408
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:23,870
another zombie comes by and that he gets
 

409
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,710
another zombie comes by and that he gets
pushed down from the other zombie

410
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
pushed down from the other zombie
 

411
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,440
pushed down from the other zombie
not a big deal just like like when I

412
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,450
not a big deal just like like when I
 

413
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,180
not a big deal just like like when I
when I checked it sometimes there'd be

414
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,190
when I checked it sometimes there'd be
 

415
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,850
when I checked it sometimes there'd be
like three zombies stuck in there total

416
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:34,860
like three zombies stuck in there total
 

417
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,610
like three zombies stuck in there total
but that's not a big deal

418
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:36,620
but that's not a big deal
 

419
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,620
but that's not a big deal
anyway so I've been trying to decide

420
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:39,630
anyway so I've been trying to decide
 

421
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,210
anyway so I've been trying to decide
what to do on the outside of this thing

422
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,220
what to do on the outside of this thing
 

423
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,340
what to do on the outside of this thing
we're done with all the inside and the

424
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,350
we're done with all the inside and the
 

425
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,910
we're done with all the inside and the
workings of it I couldn't come up with

426
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:46,920
workings of it I couldn't come up with
 

427
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,400
workings of it I couldn't come up with
any good ideas so I've decided we are

428
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,410
any good ideas so I've decided we are
 

429
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,680
any good ideas so I've decided we are
going to convert it into like a snowy

430
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:51,690
going to convert it into like a snowy
 

431
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,280
going to convert it into like a snowy
mountain which doesn't make sense

432
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,290
mountain which doesn't make sense
 

433
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,960
mountain which doesn't make sense
because it's in the desert but that's

434
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:56,970
because it's in the desert but that's
 

435
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,970
because it's in the desert but that's
what we're doing and there's jungle

436
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:58,980
what we're doing and there's jungle
 

437
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,560
what we're doing and there's jungle
trees next to it but we'll try make it

438
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,570
trees next to it but we'll try make it
 

439
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,780
trees next to it but we'll try make it
work I mostly just want an excuse to to

440
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:05,790
work I mostly just want an excuse to to
 

441
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,690

443
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,540

oops
all right now how can we see this from a

708
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:55,870
all right now how can we see this from a
 

709
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,370
all right now how can we see this from a
good place

710
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:56,380
good place
 

711
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,100
good place
let's let's just build off a little ways

712
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,110
let's let's just build off a little ways
 

713
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,520
let's let's just build off a little ways
it's like a side shot of it go up a

714
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:05,530
it's like a side shot of it go up a
 

715
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,790
it's like a side shot of it go up a
little bit I'm going to add probably

716
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:08,800
little bit I'm going to add probably
 

717
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,680
little bit I'm going to add probably
some way of killing the zombies too

718
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:10,690
some way of killing the zombies too
 

719
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,510
some way of killing the zombies too
because they they keep a track getting a

720
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:12,520
because they they keep a track getting a
 

721
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,790
because they they keep a track getting a
track to that spot to the villagers so

722
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:14,800
track to that spot to the villagers so
 

723
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,620
track to that spot to the villagers so
I'll add some way of killing those ones

724
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:16,630
I'll add some way of killing those ones
 

725
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,610
I'll add some way of killing those ones
too on the outside

726
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:19,620

 

727
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,260

that's pretty close I think that's

728
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,270
that's pretty close I think that's
 

729
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,100
that's pretty close I think that's
that's about right

730
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,110
that's about right
 

731
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:32,430

one more thing we'll try I'm going to
 

809
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,990
one more thing we'll try I'm going to
try and make a an ice tree that that'll

810
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,000
try and make a an ice tree that that'll
 

811
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,820
try and make a an ice tree that that'll
be the last thing we do so here's the

812
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:41,830
be the last thing we do so here's the
 

813
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,410
be the last thing we do so here's the
plan we're not actually going to make it

814
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,420
plan we're not actually going to make it
 

815
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,600

out of ice I decided to try make glass

816
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:45,610
out of ice I decided to try make glass
 

817
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,620
out of ice I decided to try make glass
tree instead and I guess we'll go up

818
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:49,630
tree instead and I guess we'll go up
 

819
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,530
tree instead and I guess we'll go up
here acacia trees have a pretty cool

820
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:52,540
here acacia trees have a pretty cool
 

821
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,450
here acacia trees have a pretty cool
growth pattern so we're going to use

822
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:54,460
growth pattern so we're going to use
 

823
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,270
growth pattern so we're going to use
that I'm not going to do like a custom

824
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
that I'm not going to do like a custom
 

825
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,030

tree we put one here let's try it out

828
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,110
tree we put one here let's try it out
 

829
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,250
tree we put one here let's try it out
put some dirt down geishas appening make

830
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,260
put some dirt down geishas appening make
 

831
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,680
put some dirt down geishas appening make
it grow should be able to grow right

832
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:10,690
it grow should be able to grow right
 

833
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,380
it grow should be able to grow right
yeah alright so that is our layout for

834
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:13,390
yeah alright so that is our layout for
 

835
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,630
yeah alright so that is our layout for
the tree that Asia wood looks good

836

looks good in in snow biomes so we can

842
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:26,380
looks good in in snow biomes so we can
 

843
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,470
looks good in in snow biomes so we can
keep that the way it is but I might

844
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
keep that the way it is but I might
 

845
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,510
keep that the way it is but I might
replace all these leaves with maybe I'll

846
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
replace all these leaves with maybe I'll
 

847

just do the light blue glass and see how
 

849
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,920
just do the light blue glass and see how
that looks and then we'll probably have

850
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:37,930
that looks and then we'll probably have
 

851
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,910
that looks and then we'll probably have
to change it up just a little bit I

852

958
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:13,730
and that's the closest point they can
 

959
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,220
and that's the closest point they can
get to is when they land on there but

960
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,230
get to is when they land on there but
 

961
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,960
get to is when they land on there but
they can't get up there like from down

962
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:16,970
they can't get up there like from down
 

963
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,400
they can't get up there like from down
here so that they have to walk all the

964
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,410
here so that they have to walk all the
 

965
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,549
here so that they have to walk all the
way up and then fall down just kind of

966
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:21,559
way up and then fall down just kind of
 

967
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,150
way up and then fall down just kind of
interesting um and I think the only

968
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,160
interesting um and I think the only
 

969
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,970
interesting um and I think the only
reason they do that actually I'll have

970
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:27,980
reason they do that actually I'll have
 

971
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,100
reason they do that actually I'll have
to experiment with that yeah I'm not

972
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,110
to experiment with that yeah I'm not
 

973
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,330
to experiment with that yeah I'm not
