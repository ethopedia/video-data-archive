31
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,150
cheating there's been something I wanted
to try for a long time I don't know how

32
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
to try for a long time I don't know how
 

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,820
to try for a long time I don't know how
it's going to turn out it's we're going

34

it's going to turn out it's we're going
 

35
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,530
it's going to turn out it's we're going

caving but with a twist a very like I
 

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,140
caving but with a twist a very like I
don't know exactly what I want to do but

don't know exactly what I want to do but
 

39
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,499

I do have a general idea basically we're

40
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:18,509
I do have a general idea basically we're
 

41
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,679
I do have a general idea basically we're
going caving with rules and the rules

42
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:21,689
going caving with rules and the rules
 

43
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,590
going caving with rules and the rules
are we we can only place torches on

44
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
are we we can only place torches on
 

45
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
are we we can only place torches on
something we've built well I'll explain

46
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,530
something we've built well I'll explain
 

47
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,109
something we've built well I'll explain
the concept first I'll help you

48
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
the concept first I'll help you
 

49
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,490
the concept first I'll help you
understand better where I'm coming from

50
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
understand better where I'm coming from
 

51
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,890
understand better where I'm coming from
with this usually when you go to aving

52
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:36,900
with this usually when you go to aving
 

53
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,649
with this usually when you go to aving
you go and you get all the iron and all

54
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:39,659
you go and you get all the iron and all
 

55
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,140
you go and you get all the iron and all
this resources and all the good stuff as

56
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,150
this resources and all the good stuff as
 

57
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,730
this resources and all the good stuff as
quickly as you can and you get out and

58
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:43,740
quickly as you can and you get out and
 

59
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,380
quickly as you can and you get out and
then you never want to go back to that

60
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:45,390
then you never want to go back to that
 

61
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,730
then you never want to go back to that
cave ever again because it's just the

62
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:48,740
cave ever again because it's just the
 

63
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,289
cave ever again because it's just the
plain old cave with nothing good in it

64
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:51,299
plain old cave with nothing good in it
 

65
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,330
plain old cave with nothing good in it
because you took it all out and there's

66
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:53,340
because you took it all out and there's
 

67
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,959
because you took it all out and there's
torches everywhere so what I want to do

68
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:56,969
torches everywhere so what I want to do
 

69
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,069
torches everywhere so what I want to do
is actually go caving and try to

70
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:03,079

 

71
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,450

decorate it's not really the word I want

72
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:05,460
decorate it's not really the word I want
 

73
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,100
decorate it's not really the word I want
to want to use but I want to make the

74
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,110
to want to use but I want to make the
 

75
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,020
to want to use but I want to make the
cave look good like I want it to be

76
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,030
cave look good like I want it to be
 

77
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,550
cave look good like I want it to be
something I might actually want to

78
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
something I might actually want to
 

79
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,030
something I might actually want to
explore some time down the line like

80
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
explore some time down the line like
 

81
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,750
explore some time down the line like
I'm feeling nostalgic something

82
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm feeling nostalgic something
 

83
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,250
I'm feeling nostalgic something
something interesting to go back to not

84
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,260
something interesting to go back to not
 

85
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,890
something interesting to go back to not
just another generic cave all right and

86
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:21,900
just another generic cave all right and
 

87
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,920
just another generic cave all right and
to do that I'm going to like put up

88
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:24,930
to do that I'm going to like put up
 

89
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:32,080
to do that I'm going to like put up
wooden supports and and instead of just

90
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,090
wooden supports and and instead of just
 

91
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,069
wooden supports and and instead of just
running through and getting everything

92
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:34,079
running through and getting everything
 

93
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,050
running through and getting everything
as quick as I can I'm going to build a a

94
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,060
as quick as I can I'm going to build a a
 

95
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,429
as quick as I can I'm going to build a a
track all the way with a storage

96
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:40,439
track all the way with a storage
 

97
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,379
track all the way with a storage
minecart in it and I have to put all the

98
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:42,389
minecart in it and I have to put all the
 

99
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:44,179
minecart in it and I have to put all the
stuff I collect in that and then when

100
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:44,189
stuff I collect in that and then when
 

101
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:48,470
stuff I collect in that and then when
we're all done take it out using the

102
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
we're all done take it out using the
 

103
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,550
we're all done take it out using the
track that's the general idea behind it

104
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
track that's the general idea behind it
 

105
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,929
track that's the general idea behind it
so I got my kid picked out I'm just

106
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:53,939
so I got my kid picked out I'm just
 

107
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,619
so I got my kid picked out I'm just
trying to get wood for the support beams

108
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:57,629
trying to get wood for the support beams
 

109
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,629
trying to get wood for the support beams
we're going to build and we'll probably

110
00:02:59,629 --> 00:02:59,639
we're going to build and we'll probably
 

111
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,610
we're going to build and we'll probably
figure out the style as we go in it we

112
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,620
figure out the style as we go in it we
 

113
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,640
figure out the style as we go in it we
might adjust it's kind of like I've

114
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:04,650
might adjust it's kind of like I've
 

115
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,599
might adjust it's kind of like I've
never why built the that mineshaft over

116
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:08,609
never why built the that mineshaft over
 

117
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:09,649
never why built the that mineshaft over
there but that's about my only

118
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:09,659
there but that's about my only
 

119
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,780
there but that's about my only
experience with trying to make a

120
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:11,790
experience with trying to make a
 

121
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,839
experience with trying to make a
realistic cave there's also some other

122
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:14,849
realistic cave there's also some other
 

123
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,490
realistic cave there's also some other
restrictions we're going to use I'm

124
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:16,500
restrictions we're going to use I'm
 

125
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,050
restrictions we're going to use I'm
going to take off my feather falling

come across lava I can't just put water
over top of it I have to deal with it I

136
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:34,109
over top of it I have to deal with it I
 

137
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,020
over top of it I have to deal with it I
can't just pull her up I have to use

138
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,030
can't just pull her up I have to use
 

139
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,449
can't just pull her up I have to use
ladders or something to move vertically

140
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:38,459
ladders or something to move vertically
 

141
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,729
ladders or something to move vertically
and what else like if I come to a ravine

142
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:43,739
and what else like if I come to a ravine
 

143
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,379
and what else like if I come to a ravine
I can't just hop the other side I have

144
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:45,389
I can't just hop the other side I have
 

145
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,300
I can't just hop the other side I have
to build an actual proper bridge to get

146
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,310
to build an actual proper bridge to get
 

147
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,830
to build an actual proper bridge to get
across so stuff like that so I'm going

148
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
across so stuff like that so I'm going
 

149
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,960
across so stuff like that so I'm going
to finish getting what I need here and

150
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:53,970
to finish getting what I need here and
 

151
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,309
to finish getting what I need here and
we'll get going with the idea and just

152
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:55,319
we'll get going with the idea and just
 

153
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,689
we'll get going with the idea and just
see how it goes okay let's try this

154
00:03:59,689 --> 00:03:59,699
see how it goes okay let's try this
 

155
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:00,319
see how it goes okay let's try this
again

156
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:00,329
again
 

157
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,050
again
so from our home here this is tape two

158
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,060
so from our home here this is tape two
 

159
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,670
so from our home here this is tape two
by the way I got lost trying to find the

okay how we do in structure wise is key

306
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,030
okay how we do in structure wise is key
 

307
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,529
okay how we do in structure wise is key
going to support itself I think it's

308
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:24,539
going to support itself I think it's
 

309
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,939
going to support itself I think it's
okay it's pretty good maybe we'll put a

310
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:28,949
okay it's pretty good maybe we'll put a
 

311
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,420
okay it's pretty good maybe we'll put a
beam in right here just to make sure

312
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:34,430
beam in right here just to make sure
 

313
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,490
beam in right here just to make sure
because we're going by realistic

go now I think we should have junctions
 

527
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,550
go now I think we should have junctions
- like if I come across stuff like this

528
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,560
- like if I come across stuff like this
 

529
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,470
- like if I come across stuff like this

to a return to the surface there so see
 

537
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,910
to a return to the surface there so see
