00:07:59,170 --> 00:07:59,180
to go back to the main island so we're
 

323
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,050
to go back to the main island so we're
gonna attempt the best jump we're gonna

324
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,060
gonna attempt the best jump we're gonna
 

325
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,120
gonna attempt the best jump we're gonna
fly off this way the main island should

326
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,130
fly off this way the main island should
 

327
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,070
fly off this way the main island should
be this direction about seven hundred

328
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
be this direction about seven hundred
 

329
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,700
be this direction about seven hundred
blocks diagonally right definitely

330
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:09,710
blocks diagonally right definitely
 

331
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,790
blocks diagonally right definitely
should be doable let's see if we can

332
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
should be doable let's see if we can
 

333
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,839
should be doable let's see if we can
make it we are flying we're not fine

334
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:15,849
make it we are flying we're not fine
 

335
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:20,320
make it we are flying we're not fine
that's how you check okay good this is

336
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,330
that's how you check okay good this is
 

337
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,600
that's how you check okay good this is
so freaky though cuz we can't see a

338
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,610
so freaky though cuz we can't see a
 

339
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,360
so freaky though cuz we can't see a
thing but at zero zero should be the

340
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,370
thing but at zero zero should be the
 

341
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,760
thing but at zero zero should be the
main island oh oh we oh I was looking

342
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:30,770
main island oh oh we oh I was looking
 

343
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,140
main island oh oh we oh I was looking
way too far down just about went a

344
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,150
way too far down just about went a
 

345
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,130
way too far down just about went a
little bit too low yeah that's one way

346
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,140
little bit too low yeah that's one way
 

347
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,570
little bit too low yeah that's one way
of getting back if you can't find the

348
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:40,580
of getting back if you can't find the
 

349
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,209
of getting back if you can't find the
portal if you get lost or mixed up if

350
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:43,219
portal if you get lost or mixed up if
 

351
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,980
portal if you get lost or mixed up if
you know if you fly you don't make

352
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:44,990
you know if you fly you don't make
 

353
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,900
you know if you fly you don't make
bridges and stuff so you lose landmarks

354
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:46,910
bridges and stuff so you lose landmarks
 

355
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,490
bridges and stuff so you lose landmarks
you make it a bit tricky too

356
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:48,500
you make it a bit tricky too
 

357
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,550
you make it a bit tricky too
find your way if you didn't keep track

358
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:51,560
find your way if you didn't keep track
 

359
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
find your way if you didn't keep track
of your coordinates properly like I did

360
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:53,570
of your coordinates properly like I did
 

361
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,020
of your coordinates properly like I did
there all right but we're back we got a

362
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,030
there all right but we're back we got a
 

363
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,910
there all right but we're back we got a
spare set of wings and the frost

364
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
spare set of wings and the frost
 

365
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,830
spare set of wings and the frost
Walker's okay so the good news is we

366
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:02,840
Walker's okay so the good news is we
 

367
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,750
Walker's okay so the good news is we
actually did get mending as well the bad

368
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:04,760
actually did get mending as well the bad
 

369
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,340
actually did get mending as well the bad
news is it's on the Iron Boots oh and a

370
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,350
news is it's on the Iron Boots oh and a
 

371
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,770
news is it's on the Iron Boots oh and a
waist I'm gonna I'm gonna keep them

372
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:11,780
waist I'm gonna I'm gonna keep them
 

373
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,210
waist I'm gonna I'm gonna keep them
though it might they might be pretty

374
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,220
though it might they might be pretty
 

375
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,790
though it might they might be pretty
decent actually that's my first time

376
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:15,800
decent actually that's my first time
 

377
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,530
decent actually that's my first time
getting mending and frost Walker I've

378
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:17,540
getting mending and frost Walker I've
 

379
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,150
getting mending and frost Walker I've
never even tried for us to Walker in

380
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,160
never even tried for us to Walker in
 

381
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,670
never even tried for us to Walker in
creative yet so I I just let's give it a

382
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
creative yet so I I just let's give it a
 

383
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,450
creative yet so I I just let's give it a
try here I've seen some videos of it

384
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,460
try here I've seen some videos of it
 

385
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,740
try here I've seen some videos of it
though yeah and then it's it starts

386
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:29,750
though yeah and then it's it starts
 

387
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,030
though yeah and then it's it starts
melting or is it melting or breaking

388
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
melting or is it melting or breaking
 

389
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,300
melting or is it melting or breaking
because it has like cracks in it right

390
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,310
because it has like cracks in it right
 

391
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,600
because it has like cracks in it right
whoa

392
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:40,610
whoa
 

393
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,460
whoa
so how small does oh it actually all

394
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,470
so how small does oh it actually all
 

395
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,110
so how small does oh it actually all
disappears oh so you need the motion and

396
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,120
disappears oh so you need the motion and
 

397
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,870
disappears oh so you need the motion and
you can't swim apparently did you not

398
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:49,880
you can't swim apparently did you not
 

399
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,460
you can't swim apparently did you not
jump out of the water with them oh you

400
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:51,470
jump out of the water with them oh you
 

401
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,400
jump out of the water with them oh you
can you can there is that because I have

402
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:54,410
can you can there is that because I have
 

403
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,970
can you can there is that because I have
my wings on these are about to break by

404
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:57,980
my wings on these are about to break by
 

405
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,360
my wings on these are about to break by
the way I better fix them okay if you go

406
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,370
the way I better fix them okay if you go
 

407
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,390
the way I better fix them okay if you go
in yeah you can jump up if you don't

408
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,400
in yeah you can jump up if you don't
 

409
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,890
in yeah you can jump up if you don't
have the wings on so it's the wings that

410
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:08,900
have the wings on so it's the wings that
 

411
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,420
have the wings on so it's the wings that
we're giving me trouble there oh and if

412
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:13,430
we're giving me trouble there oh and if
 

413
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,329
we're giving me trouble there oh and if
you jump yeah then you fall in the water

414
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:16,339
you jump yeah then you fall in the water
 

415
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,860
you jump yeah then you fall in the water
okay yeah let's let's try out a couple

416
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:20,870
okay yeah let's let's try out a couple
 

417
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,690
okay yeah let's let's try out a couple
mechanics here guys I'm wondering how

418
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:22,700
mechanics here guys I'm wondering how
 

419
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,210
mechanics here guys I'm wondering how
some things work like the lily pads oh

420
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,220
some things work like the lily pads oh
 

421
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,850
some things work like the lily pads oh
it doesn't turn to ice I thought it did

422
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:29,860

 

423
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,770

okay wait there's a when you go on lily

424
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:35,780
okay wait there's a when you go on lily
 

425
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,960
okay wait there's a when you go on lily
pads you go up a block a little bit

426
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:37,970
pads you go up a block a little bit
 

427
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,340
pads you go up a block a little bit
don't you yeah we're at sixty three

428
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,350
don't you yeah we're at sixty three
 

429
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,160
don't you yeah we're at sixty three
point zero then you go up to point zero

430
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,170
point zero then you go up to point zero
 

431
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:48,790
point zero then you go up to point zero
nine three really the other thing I want

432
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
nine three really the other thing I want
 

433
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,730
nine three really the other thing I want
to try is does it work with boats can we

434
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:51,740
to try is does it work with boats can we
 

435
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:58,120
to try is does it work with boats can we
have our super speedboats ah darn it's

436
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,130
have our super speedboats ah darn it's
 

437
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,949
have our super speedboats ah darn it's
because the boats still do that thing

438
00:10:59,949 --> 00:10:59,959
because the boats still do that thing
 

439
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,450
because the boats still do that thing
where they they move fast on ice

440
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:02,460
where they they move fast on ice
 

441
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,990
where they they move fast on ice
I just not though I told somebody in the

442
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
I just not though I told somebody in the
 

443
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,790
I just not though I told somebody in the
comments you could but it it looks like

444
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:07,800
comments you could but it it looks like
 

445
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,790
comments you could but it it looks like
the effect is canceled when you're in

446
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
the effect is canceled when you're in
 

447
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,720
the effect is canceled when you're in
the boats oh so you have to be above the

448
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:17,730
the boats oh so you have to be above the
 

449
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,019
the boats oh so you have to be above the
water is what it looks like

450
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:21,029
water is what it looks like
 

451
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,460
water is what it looks like
and when you're in a boat you're a

452
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,470
and when you're in a boat you're a
 

453
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,250
and when you're in a boat you're a
little bit below yeah we're at sixty two

454
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,260
little bit below yeah we're at sixty two
 

455
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,139
little bit below yeah we're at sixty two
point zero seven and on the ground here

456
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:30,149
point zero seven and on the ground here
 

457
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,160
point zero seven and on the ground here
we're at 63 so you have to be at 63 to

458
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,170
we're at 63 so you have to be at 63 to
 

459
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,650
we're at 63 so you have to be at 63 to
trigger the effect it looks like or

460
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:36,660
trigger the effect it looks like or
 

461
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,540
trigger the effect it looks like or
higher right because if we're on a lily

462
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:38,550
higher right because if we're on a lily
 

463
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,079
higher right because if we're on a lily
pad it still works too right can we

464
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,089
pad it still works too right can we
 

465
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,949
pad it still works too right can we
place lily pads on this ice you can't

466
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:45,959
place lily pads on this ice you can't
 

467
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,840
place lily pads on this ice you can't
okay I see I thought I saw pictures

468
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:47,850
okay I see I thought I saw pictures
 

469
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,400
okay I see I thought I saw pictures
where the lily pads were frozen like

470
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,410
where the lily pads were frozen like
 

471
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:57,470
where the lily pads were frozen like
that boat whoa what's happening when I

472
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:57,480
that boat whoa what's happening when I
 

473
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,060
that boat whoa what's happening when I
placed one of those lily pads it broke

474
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,070
placed one of those lily pads it broke
 

475
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,120
placed one of those lily pads it broke
somehow okay here's what we're trying to

476
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,130
somehow okay here's what we're trying to
 

477
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,550
somehow okay here's what we're trying to
do though we're gonna move around on

478
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
do though we're gonna move around on
 

479
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,170
do though we're gonna move around on
these lily pads and see if it makes the

480
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:06,180
these lily pads and see if it makes the
 

481
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,720
these lily pads and see if it makes the
ice cuz we're a little bit above sixty

482
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:08,730
ice cuz we're a little bit above sixty
 

483
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,780
ice cuz we're a little bit above sixty
three point zero right I'm curious I

484
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:11,790
three point zero right I'm curious I
 

485
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,910
three point zero right I'm curious I
don't know it still has the effect so if

486
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
don't know it still has the effect so if
 

487
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,280
don't know it still has the effect so if
we're above by a bit it still works yeah

488
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,290
we're above by a bit it still works yeah
 

489
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,930
we're above by a bit it still works yeah
so check this out guys I wanted to see

490
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:20,940
so check this out guys I wanted to see
 

491
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,970
so check this out guys I wanted to see
exactly how the frost Walker works so I

492
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:22,980
exactly how the frost Walker works so I
 

493
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
exactly how the frost Walker works so I
got some snow slabs from the man cave

494
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:24,990
got some snow slabs from the man cave
 

495
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,199
got some snow slabs from the man cave
there pay attention to our height here

496
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:27,209
there pay attention to our height here
 

497
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,410
there pay attention to our height here
so we're it's sixty 3.875 we're still in

498
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,420
so we're it's sixty 3.875 we're still in
 

499
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,530
so we're it's sixty 3.875 we're still in
the sixty three block range right

500
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:32,540
the sixty three block range right
 

501
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,260
the sixty three block range right
it creates ice if we go up one more slab

502
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,270
it creates ice if we go up one more slab
 

503
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:43,130
it creates ice if we go up one more slab
into the sixty-four then it stops so

504
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,140
into the sixty-four then it stops so
 

505
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,269
into the sixty-four then it stops so
it's the full range from 63 to to less

506
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
it's the full range from 63 to to less
 

507
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,150
it's the full range from 63 to to less
than 64 that it creates ice if we go

508
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
than 64 that it creates ice if we go
 

509
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,360
than 64 that it creates ice if we go
down below the water and also drop down

510
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,370
down below the water and also drop down
 

511
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,910
down below the water and also drop down
to sixty two point eight seven five and

512
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
to sixty two point eight seven five and
 

513
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,530
to sixty two point eight seven five and
no longer creates the ice because we're

514
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:57,540
no longer creates the ice because we're
 

515
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,590
no longer creates the ice because we're
below the water so you got to be at the

516
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:00,600
below the water so you got to be at the
 

517
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,769
below the water so you got to be at the
water height or above it's no more than

518
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:03,779
water height or above it's no more than
 

519
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,100
water height or above it's no more than
a block all right I want to see now what

520
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,110
a block all right I want to see now what
 

521
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,390
a block all right I want to see now what
happens if we put a boat on here let's

522
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,400
happens if we put a boat on here let's
 

523
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,960
happens if we put a boat on here let's
grab our boat okay since you sink down a

524
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:14,970
grab our boat okay since you sink down a
 

525
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,100
grab our boat okay since you sink down a
little bit in the boat yeah

526
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,110
little bit in the boat yeah
 

527
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,199
little bit in the boat yeah
think it's working right did it just

528
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:18,209
think it's working right did it just
 

529
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,730
think it's working right did it just
make that nicer was that there before oh

530
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:21,740
make that nicer was that there before oh
 

531
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,710
make that nicer was that there before oh
it's not working I don't think it's

532
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
it's not working I don't think it's
 

533
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,160
it's not working I don't think it's
working

534
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,170
working
 

535
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,519
working
no darn it so maybe it just doesn't work

536
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:28,529
no darn it so maybe it just doesn't work
 

537
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:32,569
no darn it so maybe it just doesn't work
in a boat I guess that makes sense right

538
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:32,579
in a boat I guess that makes sense right
 

539
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,440
in a boat I guess that makes sense right
it's Frost Walker not frost Rider all

540
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:36,450
it's Frost Walker not frost Rider all
 

541
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,440
it's Frost Walker not frost Rider all
right let's try place rails on this now

542
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,450
right let's try place rails on this now
 

543
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,350
right let's try place rails on this now
it can't place rails of any kind

544
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,360
it can't place rails of any kind
 

545
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,090
it can't place rails of any kind
oh no yeah it doesn't look like it

546
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,100
oh no yeah it doesn't look like it
 

547
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,130
oh no yeah it doesn't look like it
okay I thought maybe you could create

548
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:49,140
okay I thought maybe you could create
 

549
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,380
okay I thought maybe you could create
floating rails nah doesn't look like it

550
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,390
floating rails nah doesn't look like it
 

551
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,750
floating rails nah doesn't look like it
though I also wanted to try the

552
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
though I also wanted to try the
 

553
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,550
though I also wanted to try the
armorstand thing apparently you can put

554
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:55,560
armorstand thing apparently you can put
 

555
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,829
armorstand thing apparently you can put
the boots on the armor stand and it

556
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
the boots on the armor stand and it
 

557
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,910
the boots on the armor stand and it
still activates the effect did it just

558
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:04,920
still activates the effect did it just
 

559
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,600
still activates the effect did it just
eat my boots or oh I put them on how do

560
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:11,610
eat my boots or oh I put them on how do
 

561
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,160
eat my boots or oh I put them on how do
you do you have to shift you know I

562
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,170
you do you have to shift you know I
 

563
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,139
you do you have to shift you know I
never use armor stands yeah you got a

564
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:15,149
never use armor stands yeah you got a
 

565
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:21,470
never use armor stands yeah you got a
shift okay and then you gotta make it

566
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:21,480
shift okay and then you gotta make it
 

567
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,250
shift okay and then you gotta make it
move

568
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,260
move
 

569
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,050
move
yeah you got me to move okay so that

570
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,060
yeah you got me to move okay so that
 

571
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,740
yeah you got me to move okay so that
works what happens if we put this armor

572
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:27,750
works what happens if we put this armor
 

573
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:35,449
works what happens if we put this armor
stand in a boat well good I missed do

574
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:35,459
stand in a boat well good I missed do
 

575
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,980
stand in a boat well good I missed do
you not oh yeah you got to push it into

576
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:36,990
you not oh yeah you got to push it into
 

577
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,790
you not oh yeah you got to push it into
it when you're not in the boat right

578
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:39,800
it when you're not in the boat right
 

579
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,210
it when you're not in the boat right
yeah mom

580
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,220
yeah mom
 

581
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,750
yeah mom
oh you can't I pick up farmer stands in

582
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:44,760
oh you can't I pick up farmer stands in
 

583
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,980
oh you can't I pick up farmer stands in
a boat you might not be able to okay so

584
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:51,990
a boat you might not be able to okay so
 

585
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,900
a boat you might not be able to okay so
it seems like the effect is triggered

586
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:53,910
it seems like the effect is triggered
 

587
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,840
it seems like the effect is triggered
whenever you walk into a new block so

588
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:56,850
whenever you walk into a new block so
 

589
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,579
whenever you walk into a new block so
right now if you look at our Zed we're

590
00:14:58,579 --> 00:14:58,589
right now if you look at our Zed we're
 

591
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:00,620
right now if you look at our Zed we're
at seven seven seven point eight seven

592
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:00,630
at seven seven seven point eight seven
 

593
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,500
at seven seven seven point eight seven
zero we can move around within this

594
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,510
zero we can move around within this
 

595
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,569
zero we can move around within this
block nothing happens it's not till we

596
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:05,579
block nothing happens it's not till we
 

597
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,730
block nothing happens it's not till we
cross the border into the next block so

598
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:07,740
cross the border into the next block so
 

599
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,380
cross the border into the next block so
we're at point nine and then new block

600
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,390
we're at point nine and then new block
 

601
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,199
we're at point nine and then new block
automatically triggers of the effect

602
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:14,209
automatically triggers of the effect
 

603
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,400
automatically triggers of the effect
okay so I found out a few more things

604
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,410
okay so I found out a few more things
 

605
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,710
okay so I found out a few more things
here so we can't freeze water if if

606
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
here so we can't freeze water if if
 

607
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,350
here so we can't freeze water if if
there's water or ice above it so we

608
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
there's water or ice above it so we
 

609
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
there's water or ice above it so we
infuse this top one but we can't freeze

610
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,130
infuse this top one but we can't freeze
 

611
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,800
infuse this top one but we can't freeze
the one below it even if we go on the

612
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:24,810
the one below it even if we go on the
 

613
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,760
the one below it even if we go on the
proper level to do it and the flowing

614
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:28,770
proper level to do it and the flowing
 

615
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,879
proper level to do it and the flowing
water doesn't freeze it

616
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:29,889
water doesn't freeze it
 

617
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,289
water doesn't freeze it
either also I did not realize this but

618
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:33,299
either also I did not realize this but
 

619
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,389
either also I did not realize this but
the light level matters with this frozen

620
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
the light level matters with this frozen
 

621
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,739
the light level matters with this frozen
ice frozen ice with this new special ice

622
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:40,749
ice frozen ice with this new special ice
 

623
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:43,109
ice frozen ice with this new special ice
so because it's nighttime now it doesn't

624
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:43,119
so because it's nighttime now it doesn't
 

625
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:47,519
so because it's nighttime now it doesn't
saw it it stays frozen like this until

626
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:47,529
saw it it stays frozen like this until
 

627
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,859
saw it it stays frozen like this until
the Sun comes up or if we put down like

628
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:49,869
the Sun comes up or if we put down like
 

629
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:51,389
the Sun comes up or if we put down like
a torch or something some other light

630
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,399
a torch or something some other light
 

631
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,679
a torch or something some other light
source then it'll start melting it or

632
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:55,689
source then it'll start melting it or
 

633
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:56,579
source then it'll start melting it or
breaking it

634
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:56,589
breaking it
 

635

breaking it
I think it's breaking it it's not

636
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:57,850
I think it's breaking it it's not
 

637
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:08,369
I think it's breaking it it's not
actually melting it right oh man you

guys have to be really careful though if

640
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
guys have to be really careful though if
 

641
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,460
guys have to be really careful though if
you do this if you switch all the water

642
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,470
you do this if you switch all the water
 

643
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,119
you do this if you switch all the water
to this special ice when day comes it's

644
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:15,129
to this special ice when day comes it's
 

645
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:17,269
to this special ice when day comes it's
gonna leg your server or your game

646
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
gonna leg your server or your game
 

647
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,189
gonna leg your server or your game
incredibly because it all has to thaw

648
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:20,199
incredibly because it all has to thaw
 

649
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,150
incredibly because it all has to thaw

is gonna be bad oh no I'm fine it

652
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:29,379
is gonna be bad oh no I'm fine it
 

653

news if you guys thought a frost Walker

656
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:34,779
news if you guys thought a frost Walker
 

657
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:36,749
news if you guys thought a frost Walker
is a great way of getting rid of

658
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:36,759
is a great way of getting rid of
 

659
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,389
is a great way of getting rid of
unwanted water like this pond here if I

660
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:39,399
unwanted water like this pond here if I
 

661
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,460
unwanted water like this pond here if I
want to remove it let's turn it to ice

662
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,470
want to remove it let's turn it to ice
 

663
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,900
want to remove it let's turn it to ice
and then you can break it nice and easy

664
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:42,910
and then you can break it nice and easy
 

665
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,239
and then you can break it nice and easy
right no unfortunately not it has a much

666
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:48,249
right no unfortunately not it has a much
 

667
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,699
right no unfortunately not it has a much
longer breaking time than normal ice you

668
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:50,709
longer breaking time than normal ice you
 

669
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,799
longer breaking time than normal ice you
can't instant break it's this is

670
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:52,809
can't instant break it's this is
 

671
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,199
can't instant break it's this is
efficiency 5 with haste to the fastest

672
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:55,209
efficiency 5 with haste to the fastest
 

673
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:59,220
efficiency 5 with haste to the fastest
you can get so no easy easy to make

674
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,230
you can get so no easy easy to make
 

675
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,629
you can get so no easy easy to make
Guardian farms or anything you still

676
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
Guardian farms or anything you still
 

677
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,039
Guardian farms or anything you still
have to remove the water the hard way

678
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,049
have to remove the water the hard way
 

679
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:06,299
have to remove the water the hard way
now probably one of the coolest things

680
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:06,309
now probably one of the coolest things
 

681
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:07,519
now probably one of the coolest things
you can do with the frost Walker

682
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:07,529
you can do with the frost Walker
 

683
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,829
you can do with the frost Walker
enchantment is activate redstone devices

684
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:10,839
enchantment is activate redstone devices
 

685
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,939
enchantment is activate redstone devices
so I want to show you guys how you can

686
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:11,949
so I want to show you guys how you can
 

687
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,289
so I want to show you guys how you can
how you can go about doing that I'm

688
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:13,299
how you can go about doing that I'm
 

689
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,929
how you can go about doing that I'm
gonna try a cup a switch to our gate

690
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:15,939
gonna try a cup a switch to our gate
 

691
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,250
gonna try a cup a switch to our gate
here probably the best place to put the

692
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:20,260
here probably the best place to put the
 

693
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,199
here probably the best place to put the
water is in the middle so I decided to

694
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:22,209
water is in the middle so I decided to
 

695
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,149
water is in the middle so I decided to
put it underneath the wood on this side

696
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:24,159
put it underneath the wood on this side
 

697
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:27,509
put it underneath the wood on this side
so right at this block is what I want to

698
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:27,519
so right at this block is what I want to
 

699
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,889
so right at this block is what I want to
freeze this is a double check if there's

700
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:31,899
freeze this is a double check if there's
 

701
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:34,980
freeze this is a double check if there's
water there let's put on our frost

702
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,990
water there let's put on our frost
 

703
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,200
water there let's put on our frost
walkers I think I double-checked frost

704
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,210
walkers I think I double-checked frost
 

705
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,810
walkers I think I double-checked frost
Walker 2 is the maximum according to the

706
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:39,820
Walker 2 is the maximum according to the
 

707
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,840
Walker 2 is the maximum according to the
wiki will it activates

708
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:42,850
wiki will it activates
 

709
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,850
wiki will it activates
you got to walk right up to it though it

710
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:44,860
you got to walk right up to it though it
 

711
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,880
you got to walk right up to it though it
looks like mmm oh yeah and that's the

712
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:50,890
looks like mmm oh yeah and that's the
 

713
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,920
looks like mmm oh yeah and that's the
other thing if we do this we probably

714
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:52,930
other thing if we do this we probably
 

715
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,480
other thing if we do this we probably
want to put glowstone next to it

716
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,490
want to put glowstone next to it
 

717
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,370
want to put glowstone next to it
otherwise it won't melt you know yeah

718
00:17:59,370 --> 00:17:59,380
otherwise it won't melt you know yeah
 

719
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,140
otherwise it won't melt you know yeah
this is in such a dark spot that it's

720
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,150
this is in such a dark spot that it's
 

721
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:07,050
this is in such a dark spot that it's
not melting uh-huh all right let's try

722
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,060
not melting uh-huh all right let's try
 

723
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,770
not melting uh-huh all right let's try
this again so if we walk up to the gate

724
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:10,780
this again so if we walk up to the gate
 

725
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,020
this again so if we walk up to the gate
like this

726
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,030
like this
 

727
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,250
like this
yeah it doesn't activate we have we

728
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,260
yeah it doesn't activate we have we
 

729
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,450
yeah it doesn't activate we have we
would have to be in the middle and it's

730
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:18,460
would have to be in the middle and it's
 

731
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,850
would have to be in the middle and it's
only when I walked into this block here

732
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:20,860
only when I walked into this block here
 

733
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,750
only when I walked into this block here
unless I'm closer on this side mmm the

734
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:24,760
unless I'm closer on this side mmm the
 

735
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,530
unless I'm closer on this side mmm the
range is actually not that great is it I

736
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:27,540
range is actually not that great is it I
 

737
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,450
range is actually not that great is it I
could put it underneath this block that

738
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:30,460
could put it underneath this block that
 

739
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,150
could put it underneath this block that
would probably work a lot better but it

740
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,160
would probably work a lot better but it
 

741
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,860
would probably work a lot better but it
won't work so well before coming from

742
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:34,870
won't work so well before coming from
 

743
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,480
won't work so well before coming from
the other side unless I put one under

744
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,490
the other side unless I put one under
 

745
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,710
the other side unless I put one under
here too okay on second thought there's

746
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:43,720
here too okay on second thought there's
 

747
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,870
here too okay on second thought there's
redstone right underneath this pillar

748
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:45,880
redstone right underneath this pillar
 

749
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,510
redstone right underneath this pillar
that's not gonna work so well I'm gonna

750
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:48,520
that's not gonna work so well I'm gonna
 

751
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,920
that's not gonna work so well I'm gonna
just put it in the middle here just to

752
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:49,930
just put it in the middle here just to
 

753
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,140
just put it in the middle here just to
show you guys how to do this if you if

754
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,150
show you guys how to do this if you if
 

755
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,990
show you guys how to do this if you if
you want to hook one of these up

756
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
you want to hook one of these up
 

757
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,290
you want to hook one of these up
basically you want to put in a T flip or

758
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:58,300
basically you want to put in a T flip or
 

759
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,660
basically you want to put in a T flip or
I'm a t bud switch it's a bud switch

760
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:00,670
I'm a t bud switch it's a bud switch
 

761
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,110
I'm a t bud switch it's a bud switch
that's a T flip-flop basically and

762
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
that's a T flip-flop basically and
 

763
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,650
that's a T flip-flop basically and
they're pretty simple to build a

764
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,660
they're pretty simple to build a
 

765
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,620
they're pretty simple to build a
redstone dust down here sticky piston

766
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:10,630
redstone dust down here sticky piston
 

767
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,470
redstone dust down here sticky piston
redstone block okay

768
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:13,480
redstone block okay
 

769
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,680
redstone block okay
and then what do we do guys I'm

770
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:16,690
and then what do we do guys I'm
 

771
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,810
and then what do we do guys I'm
forgetting I think you gotta go redstone

772
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:18,820
forgetting I think you gotta go redstone
 

773
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:26,220
forgetting I think you gotta go redstone
torch then over here and then a repeater

774
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,230
torch then over here and then a repeater
 

775
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,010
torch then over here and then a repeater
goes in here somewhere I build a lot of

776
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,020
goes in here somewhere I build a lot of
 

777
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,210
goes in here somewhere I build a lot of
things off of memory and that's not

778
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,220
things off of memory and that's not
 

779
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,320
things off of memory and that's not
always the best thing is my memory sucks

780
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,330
always the best thing is my memory sucks
 

781
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,580
always the best thing is my memory sucks
yeah I think you do it like that okay so

782
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,590
yeah I think you do it like that okay so
 

783
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,250
yeah I think you do it like that okay so
then you put your repeater here now any

784
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:38,260
then you put your repeater here now any
 

785
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,870
then you put your repeater here now any
time this this piston gets an updates it

786
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
time this this piston gets an updates it
 

787
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,840
time this this piston gets an updates it
switches alright so when the water

788
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:45,850
switches alright so when the water
 

789
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,590
switches alright so when the water
freezes it extends and when it unfreezes

790
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
freezes it extends and when it unfreezes
 

791
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,510
freezes it extends and when it unfreezes
and retract so it's a complete cycle

792
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
and retract so it's a complete cycle
 

793
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,330
and retract so it's a complete cycle
sort of thing get our water over here

794
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,340
sort of thing get our water over here
 

795
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,520
sort of thing get our water over here
and now I'm gonna hook up

796
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,530
and now I'm gonna hook up
 

797
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,610
and now I'm gonna hook up
a wire from this to our main starting

798
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:02,620
a wire from this to our main starting
 

799
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,230
a wire from this to our main starting
device here I think I got to connect it

800
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
device here I think I got to connect it
 

801
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,540
device here I think I got to connect it
to this wire over here and then it

802
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:06,550
to this wire over here and then it
 

803
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,630
to this wire over here and then it
triggers all this stuff over here all

804
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:09,640
triggers all this stuff over here all
 

805
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,290
triggers all this stuff over here all
right all right so check it out guys we

806
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:13,300
right all right so check it out guys we
 

807
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,510
right all right so check it out guys we
got it all installed so now when we walk

808
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520
got it all installed so now when we walk
 

809
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,050
got it all installed so now when we walk
up the water freezes you do have to get

810
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:19,060
up the water freezes you do have to get
 

811
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,260
up the water freezes you do have to get
kind of close if I had more space for

812
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,270
kind of close if I had more space for
 

813
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,640
kind of close if I had more space for
redstone I would have done a little bit

814
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:23,650
redstone I would have done a little bit
 

815
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,670
redstone I would have done a little bit
nicer but it does work so the gate opens

816
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:26,680
nicer but it does work so the gate opens
 

817
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,880
nicer but it does work so the gate opens
I made the wire run underneath here to

818
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:29,890
I made the wire run underneath here to
 

819
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,990
I made the wire run underneath here to
the hopper timer up there basically it

820
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
the hopper timer up there basically it
 

821
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,320
the hopper timer up there basically it
goes up with a torch over there seems to

822
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,330
goes up with a torch over there seems to
 

823
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,100
goes up with a torch over there seems to
do the trick

824
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,110
do the trick
 

825
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,950
do the trick
and whoa I did one of those crazy jumps

826
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
and whoa I did one of those crazy jumps
 

827
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,170
and whoa I did one of those crazy jumps
again so yeah I got to figure out how to

828
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,180
again so yeah I got to figure out how to
 

829
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,750
again so yeah I got to figure out how to
do those Lister really needs I've been

830
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
do those Lister really needs I've been
 

831
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,550
do those Lister really needs I've been
practicing but I can't quite figure it

832
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:47,560
practicing but I can't quite figure it
 

833
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,850
practicing but I can't quite figure it
out it's like it's not like when you hit

834
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:50,860
out it's like it's not like when you hit
 

835
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,060
out it's like it's not like when you hit
the ground is it Oh

836
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,070

 

837
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,580

because you can actually trigger the

838
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:55,590
because you can actually trigger the
 

839
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,280
because you can actually trigger the
glider wings if you just fall one block

840
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,290
glider wings if you just fall one block
 

841
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,930
glider wings if you just fall one block
like that but I can't get it to do one

842
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:00,940
like that but I can't get it to do one
 

843
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,730
like that but I can't get it to do one
of those weird hops afterwards yeah I

844
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:05,740
of those weird hops afterwards yeah I
 

845
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,320
of those weird hops afterwards yeah I
don't know maybe you got a hit space

846
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,330
don't know maybe you got a hit space
 

847
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,210
don't know maybe you got a hit space
rate as he hit the ground oh that was

848
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:09,220
rate as he hit the ground oh that was
 

849
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,590
rate as he hit the ground oh that was
crazy

850
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
crazy
 

851
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,880
crazy
I think that was this a normal jump

852
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:11,890
I think that was this a normal jump
 

853
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,860
I think that was this a normal jump
though they looked it looked weird cuz

854
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:13,870
though they looked it looked weird cuz
 

855
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,030
though they looked it looked weird cuz
of our our perspective whoa

856
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,040
of our our perspective whoa
 

857
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,760
of our our perspective whoa
I don't know there's some trick to it

858
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:22,770
I don't know there's some trick to it
 

859
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,890
I don't know there's some trick to it
yeah I'm gonna seal this up and

860
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:27,900

 

861
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:35,090

oh I made a mistake

862
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,100
oh I made a mistake
 

863
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,610
oh I made a mistake
it does not freeze if any block is over

864
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:38,620
it does not freeze if any block is over
 

865
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:47,690
it does not freeze if any block is over
it's right not just water all that sucks

866
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:47,700

 

867
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:56,730

okay well Dern aha sorry about that guys

868
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:56,740
okay well Dern aha sorry about that guys
 

869
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,590
okay well Dern aha sorry about that guys
a little bit of an oversight on my parts

870
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:58,600
a little bit of an oversight on my parts
 

871
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,420
a little bit of an oversight on my parts
that's why we were doing that testing

872
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,430
that's why we were doing that testing
 

873
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,980
that's why we were doing that testing
before to figure out the mechanics and I

874
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:01,990
before to figure out the mechanics and I
 

875
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,800
before to figure out the mechanics and I
I still miss some things apparently so I

876
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:04,810
I still miss some things apparently so I
 

877
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,670
I still miss some things apparently so I
moved it over to behind this pillar and

878
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:08,680
moved it over to behind this pillar and
 

879
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,650
moved it over to behind this pillar and
we have air above it now that's what you

880
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:10,660
we have air above it now that's what you
 

881
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,060
we have air above it now that's what you
need you need air above the water test

882
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,070
need you need air above the water test
 

883
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,340
need you need air above the water test
it out it'll make it easier to activate

884
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,350
it out it'll make it easier to activate
 

885
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,870
it out it'll make it easier to activate
it from the side it should still be

886
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:21,880
it from the side it should still be
 

887
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,580
it from the side it should still be
possible to activate it from this side

888
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,590
possible to activate it from this side
 

889
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,290
possible to activate it from this side
too I would think if we stand in that

890
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,300
too I would think if we stand in that
 

891
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,260
too I would think if we stand in that
corner but it's not a not a perfect

892
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,270
corner but it's not a not a perfect
 

893
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,200
corner but it's not a not a perfect
thing I mostly did this just to show you

894
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,210
thing I mostly did this just to show you
 

895
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,270
thing I mostly did this just to show you
guys how to do it though if you want to

896
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
guys how to do it though if you want to
 

897
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,200
guys how to do it though if you want to
activate things with frost Walker it's a

898
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,210
activate things with frost Walker it's a
 

899
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,670
activate things with frost Walker it's a
bit trickier to hide it than I thought

900
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:38,680
bit trickier to hide it than I thought
 

901
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,620
bit trickier to hide it than I thought
though because you need that air block

902
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:40,630
though because you need that air block
 

903
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,810
though because you need that air block
but still still possible one thing I'm

904
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:45,820
but still still possible one thing I'm
 

905
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,790
but still still possible one thing I'm
gonna have to be very very careful about

906
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:47,800
gonna have to be very very careful about
 

907
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,250
gonna have to be very very careful about
guys is this river here I can't wear

908
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:50,260
guys is this river here I can't wear
 

909
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,860
guys is this river here I can't wear
frost Walker anywhere near it because

910
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:52,870
frost Walker anywhere near it because
 

911
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,130
frost Walker anywhere near it because
it'll cause it to update and then it's

912
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,140
it'll cause it to update and then it's
 

913
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,280
it'll cause it to update and then it's
gg there's no way of like recreating

914
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,290
gg there's no way of like recreating
 

915
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,580

this now which is what the comment of

916
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:02,590
this now which is what the comment of
 

917
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,320
this now which is what the comment of
the day is about so let me let me get to

918
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,330
the day is about so let me let me get to
 

919
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,910
the day is about so let me let me get to
that we're gonna wrap it up here for

920
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:05,920
that we're gonna wrap it up here for
 

921
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,730

play in 1.9 I thought you might find

924
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:11,380
play in 1.9 I thought you might find
 

925
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,110
play in 1.9 I thought you might find
some of these more obscure changes

926
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
some of these more obscure changes
 

927
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,720
some of these more obscure changes
interesting especially that any floating

928
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:15,730
interesting especially that any floating
 

929
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,090
interesting especially that any floating
water sources in your world might be

930
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,100
water sources in your world might be
 

931
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,910
water sources in your world might be
ruined

932

aha so there's a i I've seen this

934
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,430
aha so there's a i I've seen this
 

935
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,890
aha so there's a i I've seen this
comment a few times I thought maybe I'd

936
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:25,900
comment a few times I thought maybe I'd
 

937
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,980
comment a few times I thought maybe I'd
clear up a misconception about it so now

938
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:28,990
clear up a misconception about it so now
 

939
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,900
clear up a misconception about it so now
when you when when ice thaws you used to

940
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:33,910
when you when when ice thaws you used to
 

941
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,160
when you when when ice thaws you used to
be able to have like floating water

942

yeah that where frost Walker these fries

946
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,450
yeah that where frost Walker these fries
 

947
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,420
yeah that where frost Walker these fries
by the way they don't thaw out because

948
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,430
by the way they don't thaw out because
 

949
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,470
by the way they don't thaw out because
there's no lighting nearby to do it but

950
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480
there's no lighting nearby to do it but
