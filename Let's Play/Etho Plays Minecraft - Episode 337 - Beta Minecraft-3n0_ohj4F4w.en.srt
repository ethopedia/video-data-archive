oh so the lava and the coroners was to

298
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:42,950
oh so the lava and the coroners was to
 

299
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,290

light the minecart it's also if the
light up the room and this is when I

302
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,230
light up the room and this is when I
 

303
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,560
light up the room and this is when I
built this storage room I had this idea

304
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,570
built this storage room I had this idea
 

305
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,950
built this storage room I had this idea
where I wanted to have a display for

306
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:53,960
where I wanted to have a display for
 

307
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,079
where I wanted to have a display for
what's in the chest so instead of having

308
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:56,089
what's in the chest so instead of having
 

309
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,660
what's in the chest so instead of having
signs everywhere I thought it would be

310
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,670
signs everywhere I thought it would be
 

311
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,060
signs everywhere I thought it would be
cool to have the block type above the

312
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,070
cool to have the block type above the
 

313
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,010
cool to have the block type above the
chest and then I did something similar

314
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,020
chest and then I did something similar
 

315
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,940
chest and then I did something similar
in in my let's play world - based off of

316
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:06,950
in in my let's play world - based off of

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,199
in in my let's play world - based off of
this idea slow sand ashes with the slow

it's gonna work hmm

388
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:22,339
it's gonna work hmm

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,840
it's gonna work hmm
is there no boat up there oh I don't

390
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:25,850
is there no boat up there oh I don't

probably why these these redstone
torches up here I had this idea I was

396
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:34,610
torches up here I had this idea I was
 

397
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,460
torches up here I had this idea I was
gonna light up my base I was gonna have

398
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,470
gonna light up my base I was gonna have
 

399
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,860
gonna light up my base I was gonna have
a light switch for it right at the front

400
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:38,870
a light switch for it right at the front
 

401
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,540
a light switch for it right at the front
door here I don't know let's check

403
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,189
door here I don't know let's check
behind here I kind of remember there

404
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:45,199
behind here I kind of remember there
 

405
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:49,740
behind here I kind of remember there
being wiring back here I guess not hmm

406
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:49,750
being wiring back here I guess not hmm
 

407
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,420
being wiring back here I guess not hmm
but anyway that I was going to I was

408
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,430
but anyway that I was going to I was
 

409
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,699
but anyway that I was going to I was
gonna light up my whole base at with the

410
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:57,709
gonna light up my whole base at with the
 

411
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,620
gonna light up my whole base at with the
flip of a switch it would turn these

412
00:11:59,620 --> 00:11:59,630
flip of a switch it would turn these
 

413
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,060
flip of a switch it would turn these
redstone torches on I didn't really

414
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,070
redstone torches on I didn't really
 

415
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,069
redstone torches on I didn't really
understand that redstone torches don't

416
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:03,079
understand that redstone torches don't
 

417
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,620
understand that redstone torches don't
give off a lot of light and especially

418
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:05,630
give off a lot of light and especially
 

419
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,870
give off a lot of light and especially
if they're at the top of the world like

420
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:07,880
if they're at the top of the world like
 

421
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,310
if they're at the top of the world like
this they're not gonna do anything

422
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,320
this they're not gonna do anything
 

423
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,480
this they're not gonna do anything
really and I spent a long time oh and

424
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,490
really and I spent a long time oh and
 

425
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,680
really and I spent a long time oh and
then later I guess I removed all the

426
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:14,690
then later I guess I removed all the
 

427
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,490
then later I guess I removed all the
redstone

428
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:15,500
redstone
 

429
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,220
redstone
realized it was a flop of an idea

430
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,230
realized it was a flop of an idea
 

431
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,900
realized it was a flop of an idea
because I had redstone running around

432
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:19,910
because I had redstone running around
 

433
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,710
because I had redstone running around
all along here and then I think I added

434
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:23,720
all along here and then I think I added
 

435
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,500
all along here and then I think I added
this this road Koppel later too because

436
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:26,510
this this road Koppel later too because
 

437
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,450
this this road Koppel later too because
it was burning out what did I call this

438
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:31,460
it was burning out what did I call this
 

439
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,870
it was burning out what did I call this
thing I can't even remember oh there's

440
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
thing I can't even remember oh there's
 

441
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,600
thing I can't even remember oh there's
the boat oh it was in the off position

442
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:37,610
the boat oh it was in the off position
 

443
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,520
the boat oh it was in the off position
no wonder there we go that'll work I

444
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:42,530
no wonder there we go that'll work I
 

445
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,750
no wonder there we go that'll work I
think yeah in the past we didn't have

446
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:46,760
think yeah in the past we didn't have
 

447
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,730
think yeah in the past we didn't have
Pistons right so we had to come up with

448
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:48,740
Pistons right so we had to come up with
 

449
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,880
Pistons right so we had to come up with
clever ways of moving things around and

450
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:51,890
clever ways of moving things around and
 

451
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,340
clever ways of moving things around and
doors were a big thing and here I'm

452
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,350
doors were a big thing and here I'm
 

453
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,990
doors were a big thing and here I'm
using a boat

454
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
using a boat
 

455
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,390
using a boat
the cactus would fall down and if there

456
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:58,400
the cactus would fall down and if there
 

457
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,530
the cactus would fall down and if there
they would collide with boats so it

458
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:02,540
they would collide with boats so it
 

459
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,910
they would collide with boats so it
would hold them in place and then I

460
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
would hold them in place and then I
 

461
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,420
would hold them in place and then I
would release them all at once it does

462
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,430
would release them all at once it does
 

463
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,590
would release them all at once it does
work awesome and then they would fall in

464
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
work awesome and then they would fall in
 

465
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,330
work awesome and then they would fall in
the lava and they would kind of explode

466
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:13,340
the lava and they would kind of explode
 

467
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,610
the lava and they would kind of explode
out and I called it my firework show

468
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:17,620

 

469
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,840

let's see I got a bit on me even though

470
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:22,850
let's see I got a bit on me even though
 

471
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,020
let's see I got a bit on me even though
I don't think we had beds back then but

472
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,030
I don't think we had beds back then but
 

473
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:33,329
I don't think we had beds back then but
we are in beta I just made one oh man oh

474
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:33,339

 

475
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:39,579

man old bed mechanics you remember that

476
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:39,589

way to get rid of leaves after you cut a
 

645
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,980
way to get rid of leaves after you cut a
tree down you'd have to break each leaf

646
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:25,990
tree down you'd have to break each leaf
 

647
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,710
tree down you'd have to break each leaf
individually so I I was using the wood

648
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:29,720
individually so I I was using the wood
 

649
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,940

duplicating trickier not fixed the the

650
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:33,950
duplicating trickier not fixed the the
 

651
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,799
duplicating trickier not fixed the the
wood duplicating trick but he never

652
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:35,809
wood duplicating trick but he never
 

653
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,649
wood duplicating trick but he never
fixed the the leaves not despawning so I

654
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:38,659
fixed the the leaves not despawning so I
 

655
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,200

he didn't fix the leaves decaying thing
 

663
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:54,940
he didn't fix the leaves decaying thing
when he fixed the wood duplicating thing

storage was full of boats it would

668
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,450
storage was full of boats it would
 

669
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,360

cool let's let's get a boat though press

674
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,280
cool let's let's get a boat though press
 

675
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,490
cool let's let's get a boat though press
a button yeah pretty good timing on that

676
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:13,500
a button yeah pretty good timing on that
 

677
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,159
a button yeah pretty good timing on that
actually let's go inside when I made

678
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:16,169
actually let's go inside when I made
 

679
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:18,890
actually let's go inside when I made
this world oh that was the one mistake I

680
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:18,900
this world oh that was the one mistake I
 

681
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,810
this world oh that was the one mistake I
made though the boats would always face

682
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:20,820
made though the boats would always face
 

683
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,549
made though the boats would always face
this way so we'll need go on it it would

684
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
this way so we'll need go on it it would
 

685
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,159
this way so we'll need go on it it would
do that flip around thing which really

686
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:25,169
do that flip around thing which really
 

687
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,039
do that flip around thing which really
annoyed me but when I made this world I

688
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:28,049
annoyed me but when I made this world I
 

689
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:30,020
annoyed me but when I made this world I
picked the seat specifically because it

690
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,030
picked the seat specifically because it
 

691
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,430
picked the seat specifically because it
was right by all this water and I

692
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
was right by all this water and I
 

693
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,039
was right by all this water and I
thought it was a perfect location for

694
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,049
thought it was a perfect location for
 

695
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,630
thought it was a perfect location for
this boat dispenser build I wanted to do

696
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:37,640
this boat dispenser build I wanted to do
 

697
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,649
this boat dispenser build I wanted to do
and then when you return it here let's

698
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:42,659
and then when you return it here let's
 

699
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:43,279
and then when you return it here let's
see

700
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:43,289
see
 

701
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,490
see
oh yeah the boat would hit the pressure

702
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:46,500
oh yeah the boat would hit the pressure
 

703
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,669
oh yeah the boat would hit the pressure
plate closed the doors would wait for

704
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
plate closed the doors would wait for
 

705
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,289
plate closed the doors would wait for
you to get out I came out with came up

706
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:51,299
you to get out I came out with came up
 

707
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,500
you to get out I came out with came up
with this idea of this boat thing in a

708
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:54,510
with this idea of this boat thing in a
 

709
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:00,039
with this idea of this boat thing in a
glass to get out of the boat down there

710
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:00,049

 

711
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:02,450

the water stream was set up just right

712
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:02,460
the water stream was set up just right
 

713
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,880
the water stream was set up just right
so the boat would never break against

714
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:04,890
so the boat would never break against
 

715
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,610
so the boat would never break against
the walls how do I get out right click

716
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:07,620
the walls how do I get out right click
 

717
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,330
the walls how do I get out right click
right click and goes over the pressure

718
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,340
right click and goes over the pressure
 

719
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,740
right click and goes over the pressure
plate here oh we're at half a heart and

720
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,750
plate here oh we're at half a heart and
 

721
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,789
plate here oh we're at half a heart and
a whole bunch of stuff happens let's see

722
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
a whole bunch of stuff happens let's see
 

723
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:27,190
a whole bunch of stuff happens let's see
if we can ride it in get another one

724
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200

 

725
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,070

727
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,210

stupid boat turnaround thing oh yeah and

728
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:36,220
stupid boat turnaround thing oh yeah and
 

729
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,370
stupid boat turnaround thing oh yeah and
I had that you see those four redstone

730
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,380
I had that you see those four redstone
 

731
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,010
I had that you see those four redstone
torches era I made a clock a redstone

732
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,020
torches era I made a clock a redstone
 

733
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,650
torches era I made a clock a redstone
clock just for the blinky light effect

734
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:43,660
clock just for the blinky light effect
 

735
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,320
clock just for the blinky light effect
around this thing and it like totally

741
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,430
what was going on I didn't realize like
how leggy redstone clocks were on the

742
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,440
how leggy redstone clocks were on the
 

743
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,940
how leggy redstone clocks were on the
game oh it's gonna break its gonna break

one sec boats alignment inputs oh that's

748
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:13,570
one sec boats alignment inputs oh that's
 

749
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,710
one sec boats alignment inputs oh that's
some extra okay when something steps on

750
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
some extra okay when something steps on

the pressure plate up there that's what

752
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:18,910
the pressure plate up there that's what
 

753
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,520
the pressure plate up there that's what
this is for I must have red ripped out

754
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,530
this is for I must have red ripped out
 

755
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,390
this is for I must have red ripped out
the redstone clock I had here make room

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,230
the redstone clock I had here make room
for that so the boat falls down this

758
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
for that so the boat falls down this
 

759
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,020
for that so the boat falls down this
thing this is a boat junction I made and

760
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,030
thing this is a boat junction I made and
 

761
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,200
thing this is a boat junction I made and
there's basically a door this the door

762
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,210
there's basically a door this the door
 

763
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,890
there's basically a door this the door
here yeah there and when it was closed

764
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:40,900
here yeah there and when it was closed
 

765
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,050
here yeah there and when it was closed
like this or open whatever whatever it

766

like this or open whatever whatever it
 

767
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,480
like this or open whatever whatever it
is and the boat would fall down it would

768
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,490
is and the boat would fall down it would
 

769
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,100
is and the boat would fall down it would
hit the door and then it would go this

770
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,110
hit the door and then it would go this
 

771
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,790
hit the door and then it would go this
way and up to the boat shredder thing if

772
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:50,800
way and up to the boat shredder thing if
 

773
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,720
way and up to the boat shredder thing if
the door was closed the boat would fall

774
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:54,730
the door was closed the boat would fall
 

775
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,260
the door was closed the boat would fall
down here and go through this rig

776
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,270
down here and go through this rig
 

777
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,290
down here and go through this rig

here this was a holding cell in case

784
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,550
here this was a holding cell in case
 

785
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,370
here this was a holding cell in case
there was too many boats down there

786
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:17,380
there was too many boats down there
 

787
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,220
there was too many boats down there
there was a buffer space for one extra

788
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,230
there was a buffer space for one extra
 

789
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,110
there was a buffer space for one extra
one what's this is this for I think this

790
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
one what's this is this for I think this
 

791
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,020
one what's this is this for I think this
might have been a redstone wire access

792
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,030
might have been a redstone wire access

might have been a redstone wire access
area yeah that's what it looks like all

794
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,000
area yeah that's what it looks like all
 

795

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,490
and these are like a whole bunch of
 

819
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,820
and these are like a whole bunch of
holding cells I made four for the boats

820
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:08,830
holding cells I made four for the boats
 

821
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,840
holding cells I made four for the boats
very intricate workings down here again

822
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:12,850
very intricate workings down here again
 

823
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,110
very intricate workings down here again
I did the pot light thing and it looks

824
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,120
I did the pot light thing and it looks
 

825
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,950
I did the pot light thing and it looks
like I used wheat for decoration a lot

826
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:19,960
like I used wheat for decoration a lot
 

827
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,150
like I used wheat for decoration a lot
of stuff in this world was purely

828
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,160
of stuff in this world was purely
 

829
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,630
of stuff in this world was purely
technical I didn't do a lot of building

830
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:27,640
technical I didn't do a lot of building
 

831
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,790
technical I didn't do a lot of building
for the fun of building in this world it

832
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:29,800
for the fun of building in this world it
 

833
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,580
for the fun of building in this world it
was all technical experimentation I was

834
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:32,590
was all technical experimentation I was
 

835
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,730
was all technical experimentation I was
really trying to make videos at this

836
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:35,740
really trying to make videos at this
 

837
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,680
really trying to make videos at this
point the everything in this world is

838
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:37,690
point the everything in this world is
 

839
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,010
point the everything in this world is
basically from when I was making my

840
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,020
basically from when I was making my
 

841
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,170
basically from when I was making my
silent videos on YouTube yeah you see

842
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,180
silent videos on YouTube yeah you see
 

843
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,500
silent videos on YouTube yeah you see
the redstone like going so if there was

844
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,510
the redstone like going so if there was
 

845
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,480
the redstone like going so if there was
a boat there the redstone light would

846
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,490
a boat there the redstone light would
 

847
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,970
a boat there the redstone light would
stay on let's put one more in here

848
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:58,980
stay on let's put one more in here
 

849
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,100
stay on let's put one more in here
head on down this the redstone to this

850
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,110
head on down this the redstone to this
 

851
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,780
head on down this the redstone to this
one was a lot more fancy than the

852
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:06,790
one was a lot more fancy than the
 

853
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,510
one was a lot more fancy than the
original one see I have a button here

854
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
original one see I have a button here
 

855
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,880
original one see I have a button here
yeah so when if you'd press this it

856
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:14,890
yeah so when if you'd press this it
 

857
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,340
yeah so when if you'd press this it
would send out that boat and then that

858
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,350
would send out that boat and then that
 

859
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,990
would send out that boat and then that
one would check if there was a boat in

860
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,000
one would check if there was a boat in
 

861
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,680
one would check if there was a boat in
front and if there wasn't it would it

862
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:22,690
front and if there wasn't it would it
 

863
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,350
front and if there wasn't it would it
would send it down the line so that

864
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,360
would send it down the line so that
 

865
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,460
would send it down the line so that
there would always be a boat ready to go

866
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:31,470

 

867
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:38,820

so cool man see extra boats there it

868
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:38,830
so cool man see extra boats there it
 

869
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,870
so cool man see extra boats there it
looks like and what's over here computer

870
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
looks like and what's over here computer
 

871
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,200
looks like and what's over here computer
room

872
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,210
room
 

873
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,240
room
geeks only

874
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,250

 

875
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,310

and then there was another door back

876
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
and then there was another door back
 

877
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,899
and then there was another door back
there I think that's also to get down

878
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:49,909
there I think that's also to get down
 

879
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:52,180
there I think that's also to get down
here let's go check out the Redstone

880
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,190
here let's go check out the Redstone
 

881
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,029
here let's go check out the Redstone
because I am very curious

882
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:54,039
because I am very curious
 

883
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:59,500
because I am very curious
of course redstone in the past instead

884
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,510
of course redstone in the past instead
 

885
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,090
of course redstone in the past instead
of it being different colors like it is

886
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:01,100
of it being different colors like it is
 

887
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,770
of it being different colors like it is
now it was just black if it wasn't

888
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:02,780
now it was just black if it wasn't
 

889
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:09,659
now it was just black if it wasn't
powered here it is oh man

890
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:09,669
powered here it is oh man
 

891
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:12,039
powered here it is oh man
definitely not done the most efficient

892
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:12,049
definitely not done the most efficient
 

893
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:16,930
definitely not done the most efficient
way possible I am very confused as to

894
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:16,940
way possible I am very confused as to
 

895
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,539
way possible I am very confused as to
what I actually did here to be honest

896
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:21,549

 

897
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,640

okay I think this this line of wire was

898
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:24,650
okay I think this this line of wire was
 

899
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,000
okay I think this this line of wire was
for the light that shows if there's a

900
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,010
for the light that shows if there's a
 

901
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,310
for the light that shows if there's a
boat there that redstone torch on the

902
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
boat there that redstone torch on the
 

903
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:42,190
boat there that redstone torch on the
left side oh man what a mess wait how

904
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,200
left side oh man what a mess wait how
 

905
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:54,000
left side oh man what a mess wait how
did I I'm still confused how this works

906
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,010

 

907
00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:00,180

mmm oh there's a portal down here too

908
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,190

 

909
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,110

huh I don't know guys this was this was

910
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
huh I don't know guys this was this was
 

911
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,080
huh I don't know guys this was this was
a big mess I didn't understand and eats

912
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,090
a big mess I didn't understand and eats
 

913
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,730
a big mess I didn't understand and eats
at the time right so this was some fancy

914
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:11,740
at the time right so this was some fancy
 

915
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,380
at the time right so this was some fancy
redstone thing I saw in the on the wiki

916
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,390
redstone thing I saw in the on the wiki
 

917
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,899
redstone thing I saw in the on the wiki
that I tried to work out and it took

918
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:16,909
that I tried to work out and it took
 

919
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:24,430
that I tried to work out and it took
forever it's very very intricate there's

920
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:24,440
forever it's very very intricate there's
 

921
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,730
forever it's very very intricate there's
mobs everywhere

922
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:26,740
mobs everywhere
 

923
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,560
mobs everywhere
alright anyway that's about it for the

924
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:29,570
alright anyway that's about it for the
 

925
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,950
alright anyway that's about it for the
boat dispenser 2.0 very fun project

926
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960
boat dispenser 2.0 very fun project
 

927
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,169
boat dispenser 2.0 very fun project
can we go ride it up think we Chen

928
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:40,179
can we go ride it up think we Chen
 

929
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,470
can we go ride it up think we Chen
whoa

930
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
whoa
 

931
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,630
whoa
oh we hit another boat and it

932
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
oh we hit another boat and it
 

933
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,670
oh we hit another boat and it
automatically turned us around awesome

934
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:46,680
automatically turned us around awesome
 

935
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,630
automatically turned us around awesome
oh yeah

936
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
oh yeah
 

937
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,800
oh yeah
I just yeah we can go check out the each

938
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:54,810
I just yeah we can go check out the each
 

939
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,000
I just yeah we can go check out the each
road real quick too

940
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,010
road real quick too
 

941
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,980
road real quick too
I guess and that'll probably be about it

942
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:57,990
I guess and that'll probably be about it
 

943
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,880
I guess and that'll probably be about it
for here actually wait a sec let's check

944
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:01,890
for here actually wait a sec let's check
 

945
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:07,100
for here actually wait a sec let's check
this out here this what goes up must

946
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,110
this out here this what goes up must
 

947
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:12,470
this out here this what goes up must
come down no jumping I can jump if I

948
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
come down no jumping I can jump if I
 

949
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,820
come down no jumping I can jump if I
walk to lava lighting this was my wood

950
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:19,830
walk to lava lighting this was my wood
 

951
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,930

dispenser

952
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:20,940
dispenser
 

953
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,290
dispenser
I highly doubt this to setup to work

954
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:24,300
I highly doubt this to setup to work
 

955
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,700
I highly doubt this to setup to work

00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,060
wait a second we got to try this out oh
 

1019
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:30,140
wait a second we got to try this out oh
man so claustrophobic down here and that

1020
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,150

 

1021
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,550

that's weird I had some random dirt

in this version of Minecraft I think of

1026
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,230
in this version of Minecraft I think of
 

1027
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,750
in this version of Minecraft I think of
a boat or my hit's

1028
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:39,760
a boat or my hit's
 

1029
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,690
a boat or my hit's
like one of these block entities it will

1030
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:42,700
like one of these block entities it will
 

1031
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,370
like one of these block entities it will
completely stop it I think could be

1032
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:47,380
completely stop it I think could be
 

1033
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,290
completely stop it I think could be
wrong about that or that might just be

1034
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:49,300
wrong about that or that might just be
 

1035
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,440
wrong about that or that might just be
minecarts okay we're gonna make a boat

1036
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:52,450
minecarts okay we're gonna make a boat
 

1037
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,180
minecarts okay we're gonna make a boat
and we're gonna see if we can ride this

1038
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,190
and we're gonna see if we can ride this
 

1039
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,280
and we're gonna see if we can ride this
thing up and see where it takes us

1040
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,290

 

1041
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:02,880

alright so here we go don't break don't

1042
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:02,890
alright so here we go don't break don't
 

1043
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,420

1045
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,830
break don't break oh yeah and this is
when I was experimenting with like

1046
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
when I was experimenting with like
 

1047
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,570
when I was experimenting with like
smashing boats against walls

1048
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:09,580
smashing boats against walls
 

1049
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:15,300
smashing boats against walls
I found out it didn't break them okay

1050
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,310
I found out it didn't break them okay
 

1051
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,890
I found out it didn't break them okay
this is where it takes us I think our

1052
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:16,900
this is where it takes us I think our
 

1053
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,990
this is where it takes us I think our
head is inside glass right now and see

1054
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
head is inside glass right now and see
 

1055
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:35,690
head is inside glass right now and see
can't get out of here oh let me out Oh

1056
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:35,700

 

1057
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:42,300

broke it okay yeah so a whole stack of

1058
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,310
broke it okay yeah so a whole stack of
 

1059
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,400
broke it okay yeah so a whole stack of
boats would get stored in the water here

1060
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,410
boats would get stored in the water here
 

1061
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,290
boats would get stored in the water here
and when the door would open they would

1062
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:49,300
and when the door would open they would
 

1063
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,770
and when the door would open they would
all flow into this thing towards the

1064
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:52,780
all flow into this thing towards the
 

1065
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,440
all flow into this thing towards the
lava this would duplicate the amount of

1066
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,450
lava this would duplicate the amount of
 

1067
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,330
lava this would duplicate the amount of
wood you get from the boat breaking and

1068
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:57,340
wood you get from the boat breaking and
 

1069
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,710
wood you get from the boat breaking and
then that would feed off into

1070
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:01,720

 

1071
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,200

guessing it's down here yeah they would

1072
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,210
guessing it's down here yeah they would
 

1073
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,240
guessing it's down here yeah they would
drop then all the wood and sticks will

1074
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,250
drop then all the wood and sticks will
 

1075
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,820
drop then all the wood and sticks will
drop here what's this for

1076
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:09,830
drop here what's this for
 

1077
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:15,460
drop here what's this for
oh I never put anything here uh-huh all

looks like a strip mine yeah right at
bedrock level I don't know if that was

1116
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:37,039
bedrock level I don't know if that was
 

1117
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,360
bedrock level I don't know if that was
the best place to get diamonds back then

1118
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,370
the best place to get diamonds back then
 

1119
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,220
the best place to get diamonds back then
or my it might have just been to get

1120
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,230
or my it might have just been to get
 

1121
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:49,750
or my it might have just been to get
redstone actually whoa quite the

1122
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
redstone actually whoa quite the
 

1123
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,590
redstone actually whoa quite the
extensive mine actually you don't get

1124
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
extensive mine actually you don't get
 

1125
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,889
extensive mine actually you don't get
the speed boost for jumping back then I

1126
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:55,899
the speed boost for jumping back then I
 

1127
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:57,850
the speed boost for jumping back then I
guess I was only in the adventure

1128
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:57,860
guess I was only in the adventure
 

1129
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,960
guess I was only in the adventure

I mined out a lot here I think that's it

1132
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:06,679
I mined out a lot here I think that's it
 

1133
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,150
I mined out a lot here I think that's it
where does this go

1134
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,160

 

1135
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,780

I see water up at the end it might not

1136
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,790
I see water up at the end it might not
 

1137
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:19,420
I see water up at the end it might not
go anywhere actually did I just stop

1138
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:19,430
go anywhere actually did I just stop
 

1139
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,140
go anywhere actually did I just stop
here because of the water there's this a

1140
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,150
here because of the water there's this a
 

1141
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:30,520
here because of the water there's this a
cave system oh it's a cave huh I must

1142
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,530
cave system oh it's a cave huh I must
 

1143
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,960
cave system oh it's a cave huh I must
have just dug until I hit that and then

1144
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:31,970
have just dug until I hit that and then
 

1145
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,950
have just dug until I hit that and then
I stopped unexplored to you an

1146
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:37,960

 

1147
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:45,360

interesting all right so let's head back

1148
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,370

 

1149
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:54,960

let's try this thing out again awesome

1150
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:54,970

 

1151
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,530

okay let's go try out the old eats road

1152
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:58,540
okay let's go try out the old eats road
 

1153
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,300
okay let's go try out the old eats road
for some reason I wanted to build this

1154
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,310
for some reason I wanted to build this
 

1155
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,610
for some reason I wanted to build this
under water and that made it all the

1156
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:03,620
under water and that made it all the
 

1157
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,630
under water and that made it all the
more fun to make not really sure why I

1158
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:07,640
more fun to make not really sure why I
 

1159
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:16,570
more fun to make not really sure why I
did that got an easy loader here gonna

1160
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:16,580
did that got an easy loader here gonna
 

1161
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,260
did that got an easy loader here gonna
work oh it does work sweet so with this

1162
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:20,270
work oh it does work sweet so with this
 

1163
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,100
work oh it does work sweet so with this
version I had no way of holding the boat

1164
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,110
version I had no way of holding the boat
 

1165
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,980
version I had no way of holding the boat
at the start I was mostly experimenting

1166
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:26,990
at the start I was mostly experimenting
 

1167
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:32,710
at the start I was mostly experimenting
with this intersection oh I remember

1168
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
with this intersection oh I remember
 

1169
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,750
with this intersection oh I remember
this hey that the doors stay closed oh

1170
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:34,760
this hey that the doors stay closed oh
 

1171
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,399
this hey that the doors stay closed oh
never mind they just opened basically

1172
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:38,409
never mind they just opened basically
 

1173
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,490
never mind they just opened basically
you had this opened the door you want to

1174
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:42,500
you had this opened the door you want to
 

1175
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,830
you had this opened the door you want to
go for that destination and there was

1176
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:44,840
go for that destination and there was
 

1177
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,470
go for that destination and there was
like signs where you could write like

1178
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:47,480
like signs where you could write like
 

1179
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,210
like signs where you could write like
the location you're going to and see

1180
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,220
the location you're going to and see
 

1181
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:58,360
the location you're going to and see
let's go to north if we can slow us and

1182
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,370
let's go to north if we can slow us and
 

1183
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:03,360
let's go to north if we can slow us and
yet otherwise it would break

1184
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,370

 

1185
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,460

this was just like a short experiment

1186
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:05,470
this was just like a short experiment
 

1187
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,380
this was just like a short experiment
this miswrote here I kind of want to hop

1188
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,390
this miswrote here I kind of want to hop
 

1189
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,760
this miswrote here I kind of want to hop
out here and check out the Redstone

1190
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:08,770
out here and check out the Redstone
 

1191
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,080
out here and check out the Redstone
actually where did I put the redstone is

1192
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,090
actually where did I put the redstone is
 

1193
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,660
actually where did I put the redstone is
it I think these are just for looks

1194
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:17,670
it I think these are just for looks
 

1195
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:24,390
it I think these are just for looks
there must be underneath right okay yeah

1196
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
there must be underneath right okay yeah
 

1197
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,590
there must be underneath right okay yeah
it's all down here aha I don't know how

1198
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:31,600
it's all down here aha I don't know how
 

1199
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,120
it's all down here aha I don't know how
it works oh man

1200
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,130
it works oh man
 

1201
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,800
it works oh man
basically I came up with this idea when

1202
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:40,810
basically I came up with this idea when
 

1203
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,950
basically I came up with this idea when
I was actually driving in my car at the

1204
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:43,960
I was actually driving in my car at the
 

1205
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,410
I was actually driving in my car at the
time and I was thinking how cool it

1206
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:46,420
time and I was thinking how cool it
 

1207
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,300
time and I was thinking how cool it
would it be to have like highways

1208
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,310
would it be to have like highways
 

1209
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,140
would it be to have like highways
railroads in Minecraft where you drive

1210
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,150
railroads in Minecraft where you drive
 

1211
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,040
railroads in Minecraft where you drive
on the right side and you follow these

1212
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,050
on the right side and you follow these
 

1213
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:00,830
on the right side and you follow these
rules and yeah ended up coming up with a

1214
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:00,840
rules and yeah ended up coming up with a
 

1215
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,160
rules and yeah ended up coming up with a
boat system kind of based around real

1216
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,170
boat system kind of based around real
 

1217
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,960
boat system kind of based around real
road rules that chunk air there actually

1218
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:09,970
road rules that chunk air there actually
 

1219
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,760
road rules that chunk air there actually
happened in this world I think that's

1220
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:11,770
happened in this world I think that's
 

1221
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,080
happened in this world I think that's
why I was having trouble getting this

1222
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,090
why I was having trouble getting this
 

1223
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,880
why I was having trouble getting this
world to work because I was having chunk

1224
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:14,890
world to work because I was having chunk
 

1225
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,210
world to work because I was having chunk
air problems and corruption even back in

1226
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,220
air problems and corruption even back in
 

1227
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,620
air problems and corruption even back in
the Alpha days there was something in

1228
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:19,630
the Alpha days there was something in
 

1229
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,520
the Alpha days there was something in
stable about this world

1230
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:22,530
stable about this world
 

1231
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,950
stable about this world
let's check this out really quick to you

1232
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:25,960
let's check this out really quick to you
 

1233
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,830
let's check this out really quick to you
guys remember the secret project oh and

1234
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:28,840
guys remember the secret project oh and
 

1235
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,270
guys remember the secret project oh and
look we got leaves that aren't D

1236
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:30,280
look we got leaves that aren't D
 

1237
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,660
look we got leaves that aren't D
spotting secret project this is where

1238
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:35,670
spotting secret project this is where
 

1239
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,490
spotting secret project this is where
the first instance of it the Frogger

1240
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:38,500
the first instance of it the Frogger
 

1241
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,310
the first instance of it the Frogger
game fortunately I didn't get very far

1242
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320
game fortunately I didn't get very far
 

1243
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,070
game fortunately I didn't get very far
with it in this world and it didn't turn

1244
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,080
with it in this world and it didn't turn
 

1245
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,340
with it in this world and it didn't turn
out in my let's play world and it didn't

1246
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,350
out in my let's play world and it didn't
 

1247
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,220
out in my let's play world and it didn't
turn out in the feed the beast version I

1248
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,230
turn out in the feed the beast version I
 

1249
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,190
turn out in the feed the beast version I
did either although that one would have

1250
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,200
did either although that one would have
 

1251
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,440
did either although that one would have
worked except it was causing too much

1252
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,450
worked except it was causing too much
 

1253
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,560
worked except it was causing too much
leg so I never finished it but maybe one

1254
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:01,570
leg so I never finished it but maybe one
 

1255
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:05,000
leg so I never finished it but maybe one
day we will finish the Frogger game and

1256
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,010
day we will finish the Frogger game and
 

1257
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,609
day we will finish the Frogger game and
basically I had boat dispensers

1258
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:10,619

 

1259
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:15,660

what is it going on here oh it actually

1260
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:15,670
what is it going on here oh it actually
 

1261
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,660
what is it going on here oh it actually
had a timer set up so that oh I was

1262
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:18,670
had a timer set up so that oh I was
 

1263
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,759
had a timer set up so that oh I was
using a minecart thing here as a timer I

1264
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:20,769
using a minecart thing here as a timer I
 

1265
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:23,460
using a minecart thing here as a timer I
see and that would release the boats

1266
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:23,470
see and that would release the boats
 

1267
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,440
see and that would release the boats
periodically and they had just enough

1268
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,450
periodically and they had just enough
 

1269
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,029
periodically and they had just enough
momentum to get to the other side I

1270
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:27,039
momentum to get to the other side I
 

1271
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,019
momentum to get to the other side I
believe right out real quick it's

1272
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:31,029
believe right out real quick it's
 

1273
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:33,269
believe right out real quick it's
getting dark we have to have to sleep

1274

00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:38,460
away darn it
oh I always do that I have a boat in my

1278
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:38,470
oh I always do that I have a boat in my
 

1279
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,039
oh I always do that I have a boat in my
inventory what am i doing alright we

1280
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:41,049
inventory what am i doing alright we
 

1281
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:44,759
inventory what am i doing alright we
made another one there we go

1282
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:44,769
made another one there we go
 

1283
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:47,819
made another one there we go
it's gonna work can I place it I don't

1284
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:47,829
it's gonna work can I place it I don't
 

1285
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:48,990
it's gonna work can I place it I don't
think I can place it there it's not

1286
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,000
think I can place it there it's not
 

1287
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,410
think I can place it there it's not
gonna no I can't place it there huh I

1288
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:55,420
gonna no I can't place it there huh I
 

1289
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:03,140
gonna no I can't place it there huh I
don't know how to load it alright anyway

1290
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,150
don't know how to load it alright anyway
 

1291
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:08,279
don't know how to load it alright anyway
these were the cars over here didn't

1292
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:08,289
these were the cars over here didn't
 

1293
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:10,380
these were the cars over here didn't
actually set and set up any minecart

1294
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:10,390
actually set and set up any minecart
 

1295
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,990
actually set and set up any minecart
mechanics to it though well I found

1296
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,000
mechanics to it though well I found
 

1297
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,579
mechanics to it though well I found
something else here this is the hot and

1298
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:17,589
something else here this is the hot and
 

1299
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,519
something else here this is the hot and
cold video you remember that if the

1300
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:20,529
cold video you remember that if the
 

1301
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:22,499
cold video you remember that if the
minecart went by the lava it would catch

1302
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:22,509
minecart went by the lava it would catch
 

1303
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,799
minecart went by the lava it would catch
on fire if it went by the water that the

1304
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:25,809
on fire if it went by the water that the
 

1305
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:30,539
on fire if it went by the water that the
fire would go out pretty cool I think I

1306
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:30,549
fire would go out pretty cool I think I
 

1307
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:32,160
fire would go out pretty cool I think I
was doing an experiment here to where I

1308
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,170
was doing an experiment here to where I
 

1309
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,710
was doing an experiment here to where I
had I was loading mobs into the minecart

1310
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:34,720
had I was loading mobs into the minecart
 

1311
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,859
had I was loading mobs into the minecart
and then pushing it away and I think I

1312
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:37,869
and then pushing it away and I think I
 

1313
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:40,289
and then pushing it away and I think I
found at least at a certain time in the

1314
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:40,299
found at least at a certain time in the
 

1315
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:45,329
found at least at a certain time in the
game if a mine if my mom was in a

1316
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:45,339
game if a mine if my mom was in a
 

1317
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,549
game if a mine if my mom was in a
minecart it was it took longer for it to

1318
00:38:47,549 --> 00:38:47,559
minecart it was it took longer for it to
 

1319
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:51,059
minecart it was it took longer for it to
be spawned I think I think that's what

1320
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:51,069
be spawned I think I think that's what
 

1321
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:52,499
be spawned I think I think that's what
what I was trying to figure out anyway

1322
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:52,509
what I was trying to figure out anyway
 

1323
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:55,079
what I was trying to figure out anyway
that's that's what it seemed we got the

1324
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:55,089
that's that's what it seemed we got the
 

1325
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:56,819
that's that's what it seemed we got the
loader over here for the Frogger game

1326
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:56,829
loader over here for the Frogger game
 

1327
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:02,840
loader over here for the Frogger game
see if we can ride it Oh

1328
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:02,850

 

1329
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:13,180

oh that's weird whoa pretty bouncy oh

1330
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,190

 

1331
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,080

we're good things good

1332
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,090
we're good things good
 

1333
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:22,400
we're good things good
totally normal whoo yeah it made it

1334
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,410
totally normal whoo yeah it made it
 

1335
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,170
totally normal whoo yeah it made it
across and somehow I was planning to

1336
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:27,180
across and somehow I was planning to
 

1337
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,270
across and somehow I was planning to
time it just right where you would have

1338
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,280
time it just right where you would have
 

1339
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,250
time it just right where you would have
to jump from one boat to another boat

1340
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:31,260
to jump from one boat to another boat
 

1341
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,500
to jump from one boat to another boat
and another boat and somehow get across

1342
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:33,510
and another boat and somehow get across
 

1343
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,440
and another boat and somehow get across
which would have been impossible but I

1344
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:36,450
which would have been impossible but I
 

1345
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,720
which would have been impossible but I
didn't know it at the time look what I

1346
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:41,730
didn't know it at the time look what I
 

1347
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,210
didn't know it at the time look what I
found guys out in the middle of nowhere

1348
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,220
found guys out in the middle of nowhere
 

1349
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,480
found guys out in the middle of nowhere
here this was my second ether experiment

1350
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:47,490
here this was my second ether experiment
 

1351
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,960
here this was my second ether experiment
and the main goal with this one was to

1352
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:50,970
and the main goal with this one was to
 

1353
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,260
and the main goal with this one was to
have actual boat holding systems and

1354
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,270
have actual boat holding systems and
 

1355
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,630
have actual boat holding systems and
boat return systems and docking stations

1356
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
boat return systems and docking stations
 

1357
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,450
boat return systems and docking stations
and and just try to make it a little

1358
00:39:59,450 --> 00:39:59,460
and and just try to make it a little
 

1359
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,480
and and just try to make it a little
fancier than what I had come on man let

1360
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:05,490
fancier than what I had come on man let
 

1361
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:11,200
fancier than what I had come on man let
me sleep oh yeah

1362
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,210
me sleep oh yeah
 

1363
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,100
me sleep oh yeah
all right let's try it out see got a

1364
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,110
all right let's try it out see got a
 

1365
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:22,730
all right let's try it out see got a
boat here yep yeah it works pretty good

1366
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:22,740
boat here yep yeah it works pretty good
 

1367
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,840
boat here yep yeah it works pretty good
oh we have a loading system over there

1368
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:25,850
oh we have a loading system over there
 

1369
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,640
oh we have a loading system over there
yeah so with this thing oh and we have a

1370
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:28,650
yeah so with this thing oh and we have a
 

1371
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,400
yeah so with this thing oh and we have a
another door here so if somebody pulled

1372
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:31,410
another door here so if somebody pulled
 

1373
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,710
another door here so if somebody pulled
in behind you they wouldn't crash into

1374
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:33,720
in behind you they wouldn't crash into
 

1375
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,420
in behind you they wouldn't crash into
your boat I was trying to design this

1376
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:35,430
your boat I was trying to design this
 

1377
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,290
your boat I was trying to design this
for servers like for transportation on

1378
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:39,300
for servers like for transportation on
 

1379
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,640
for servers like for transportation on
servers with lots of people in mind you

1380
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:43,650
servers with lots of people in mind you
 

1381
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,830
servers with lots of people in mind you
leave it then it goes to the boat

1382
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:45,840
leave it then it goes to the boat
 

1383
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,770
leave it then it goes to the boat
returned and it would get added back

1384
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:48,780
returned and it would get added back
 

1385
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,050
returned and it would get added back
into that yeah and I think let's see if

1386
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,060
into that yeah and I think let's see if
 

1387
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:59,440
into that yeah and I think let's see if
we can find an area with a few boats I

1388
00:40:59,440 --> 00:40:59,450
we can find an area with a few boats I
 

1389
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,390
we can find an area with a few boats I
don't see it anywhere

1390
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,400

 

1391
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,960

mm-hmm was that the only place with a

1392
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:07,970
mm-hmm was that the only place with a
 

1393
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:16,900
mm-hmm was that the only place with a
boat I guess so hmm all right anyway I I

1394
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:16,910
boat I guess so hmm all right anyway I I
 

1395
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,090
boat I guess so hmm all right anyway I I
think I had a speed boost system with

1396
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,100
think I had a speed boost system with
 

1397
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,720
think I had a speed boost system with
this dude

1398
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:19,730
this dude
 

1399
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,420
this dude
let's try load another boat in just to

1400
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:22,430
let's try load another boat in just to
 

1401
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:27,120
let's try load another boat in just to
try it let's see this is the ez loader

1402
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,130
try it let's see this is the ez loader
 

1403
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,700
try it let's see this is the ez loader
and when I design this I I tried to make

1404
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:30,710
and when I design this I I tried to make
 

1405
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,090
and when I design this I I tried to make
it fit into a chunk properly like very

1406
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:34,100
it fit into a chunk properly like very
 

1407
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,930
it fit into a chunk properly like very
specifically so people could copy/paste

1408
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:36,940
specifically so people could copy/paste
 

1409
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:41,350
specifically so people could copy/paste
different chunks into their their

1410
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:41,360
different chunks into their their
 

1411
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,320
different chunks into their their
servers for some reason I thought that

1412
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,330
servers for some reason I thought that
 

1413
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,150
servers for some reason I thought that
would be a good idea it doesn't really

1414
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,160
would be a good idea it doesn't really
 

1415
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,310
would be a good idea it doesn't really
make sense but I like design this

1416
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:48,320
make sense but I like design this
 

1417
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,609
make sense but I like design this
intersection to be 16 by 16 and the

1418
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:51,619
intersection to be 16 by 16 and the
 

1419
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:54,400
intersection to be 16 by 16 and the
roads I made kind of an even number two

1420
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,410
roads I made kind of an even number two
 

1421
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,890
roads I made kind of an even number two
I tried making eight blocks wide there

1422
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:56,900
I tried making eight blocks wide there
 

1423
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,480
I tried making eight blocks wide there
actually 10 blocks wide it does it

1424
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,490
actually 10 blocks wide it does it
 

1425
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,510
actually 10 blocks wide it does it
doesn't make a lot of sense but yeah I

1426
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:01,520
doesn't make a lot of sense but yeah I
 

1427
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,630
doesn't make a lot of sense but yeah I
had well multiplayer in mind but then I

1428
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
had well multiplayer in mind but then I
 

1429
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,310
had well multiplayer in mind but then I
found out later that it didn't work on

1430
