00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:03,750
to be stone slabs they can get messed up
 

41
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,310
to be stone slabs they can get messed up
if too many items enter at once that

42
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,320
if too many items enter at once that
 

43
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,980

few episodes I've been a little bit like

60
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,970
few episodes I've been a little bit like
 

61
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,940
few episodes I've been a little bit like
frustrated with this game it's because a

62
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:34,950
frustrated with this game it's because a
 

63
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,950
frustrated with this game it's because a
lot of stuff hasn't worked I've had that

64
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
lot of stuff hasn't worked I've had that
 

65
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,350
lot of stuff hasn't worked I've had that
big lag issue and it was driving me nuts

66
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
big lag issue and it was driving me nuts
 

67
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,490
big lag issue and it was driving me nuts
like I wasn't able to do any redstone

68
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:42,500
like I wasn't able to do any redstone
 

69
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,990
like I wasn't able to do any redstone
cuz redstone is all about timing and you

70
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,000
cuz redstone is all about timing and you
 

71
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,880
cuz redstone is all about timing and you
can't do redstone if you can't tell the

72
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:46,890
can't do redstone if you can't tell the
 

73
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,960
can't do redstone if you can't tell the
timing of the game because it's lagging

74
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:49,970
timing of the game because it's lagging
 

75
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,810
timing of the game because it's lagging
though shouldn't be in there all right I

76
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:53,820
though shouldn't be in there all right I
 

77
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,490
though shouldn't be in there all right I
think that's all good kind of want to

78
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:55,500
think that's all good kind of want to
 

79
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,899
think that's all good kind of want to
watch these items and just see where

80
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:56,909
watch these items and just see where
 

81
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,910
watch these items and just see where
they're going make sure no more messed

82
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:58,920
they're going make sure no more messed
 

83
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,090
they're going make sure no more messed
up it was this that one or two I found

up it was this that one or two I found
 

85
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,959
up it was this that one or two I found
one at the start that was messed up too

86
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:04,969
one at the start that was messed up too
 

87
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,570
one at the start that was messed up too
alright so they're going down but yeah

this is the big snapshot we've been
 

91
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,670
this is the big snapshot we've been
waiting for it seems like the lag issues

92
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
waiting for it seems like the lag issues
 

93
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,089
waiting for it seems like the lag issues
been

94
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:14,099
been
 

95
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,869

bunch of stuff is just a lot smoother I

98
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:19,409
bunch of stuff is just a lot smoother I

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
logged in and is like wow what's my
 

101
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,849
logged in and is like wow what's my
frame rate that cuz it seemed like I was

102
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:25,859
frame rate that cuz it seemed like I was
 

103
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,949
frame rate that cuz it seemed like I was
at like 240 frames per second or

104
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:27,959
at like 240 frames per second or
 

105
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,140
at like 240 frames per second or
something but now is this just running a

106
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,150
something but now is this just running a
 

107
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,479
something but now is this just running a
lot smoother which is great

108
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:32,489
lot smoother which is great
 

109
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,520
lot smoother which is great
it doesn't seem smooth right now because

110
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,530
it doesn't seem smooth right now because
 

111
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,140
it doesn't seem smooth right now because
I'm recording at 30fps

I'm recording at 30fps
 

113
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,149
I'm recording at 30fps
and because the Nexus is doing all kinds

114
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:38,159
and because the Nexus is doing all kinds
 

115
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,339

of crazy stuff I'm actually getting

116
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:40,349
of crazy stuff I'm actually getting
 

117
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,080
of crazy stuff I'm actually getting
pretty bad framerate at the moment but

118
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,090
pretty bad framerate at the moment but
 

119
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,910
pretty bad framerate at the moment but
just in general it is pretty good okay

120
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:46,920
just in general it is pretty good okay
 

121
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,210
just in general it is pretty good okay

122
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,220
that must be nether warts I think it's
 

123
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,159
that must be nether warts I think it's
okay now there's that sheep in here he's

124
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,169
okay now there's that sheep in here he's
 

125

been in here forever but yeah guys is
 

127
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,190
been in here forever but yeah guys is
the plan for today the challenge or the

128
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,200
the plan for today the challenge or the
 

129
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,990
the plan for today the challenge or the
goal the project I have in mind is we're

130
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
goal the project I have in mind is we're
 

131
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,830
goal the project I have in mind is we're
gonna make an automated tree farm that's

132
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
gonna make an automated tree farm that's
 

133
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,580
gonna make an automated tree farm that's
what I would like to do first thing we

134
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:07,590
what I would like to do first thing we
 

135
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,289
what I would like to do first thing we
gotta do is catch a ghast for it so

136
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:09,299
gotta do is catch a ghast for it so
 

137
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,960
gotta do is catch a ghast for it so
we're gonna head over to the nether and

138
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:10,970
we're gonna head over to the nether and
 

139
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,550
we're gonna head over to the nether and
I will meet you there once my morning

140
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,560
I will meet you there once my morning

00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
voice is gone hopefully yeah actually
 

143
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,129
voice is gone hopefully yeah actually
before we go do that let's try something

144
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:19,139
before we go do that let's try something
 

145
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,170
before we go do that let's try something
here together so I got like a cutaway of

146
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,180
here together so I got like a cutaway of
 

147
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,869
here together so I got like a cutaway of
an item filter like you see how it it

148
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
an item filter like you see how it it
 

149
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,879
an item filter like you see how it it
looks like that over there so I copied

150
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:25,889
looks like that over there so I copied
 

151
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,490
looks like that over there so I copied
that over here there's a significant

152
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:28,500
that over here there's a significant
 

153
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,890
that over here there's a significant
flaw with my design in the Nexus

154
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:30,900
flaw with my design in the Nexus
 

155
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,689
flaw with my design in the Nexus
basically let's say we're filtering oak

156
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:35,699
basically let's say we're filtering oak
 

157
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:38,149
basically let's say we're filtering oak
wood planks right if this was the start

158
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
wood planks right if this was the start
 

159
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,619
wood planks right if this was the start
to fill up let's see to a certain point

160
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:42,629
to fill up let's see to a certain point
 

161
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,140
to fill up let's see to a certain point
like say all this the chest below filled

162
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,150
like say all this the chest below filled
 

163
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,080
like say all this the chest below filled
up with items what's going on it's not

164
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,090
up with items what's going on it's not
 

165
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,289
up with items what's going on it's not
working oh I'm doing it in the wrong one

166
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:54,299
working oh I'm doing it in the wrong one
 

167
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,289
working oh I'm doing it in the wrong one
right it's supposed to be the top one

168
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:57,299
right it's supposed to be the top one
 

169
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,179
right it's supposed to be the top one
not the bottom one it's like what's

170
00:03:59,179 --> 00:03:59,189
not the bottom one it's like what's
 

171
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,189
not the bottom one it's like what's
going on that's not right

172
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:01,199
going on that's not right
 

173
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,199
going on that's not right
I'm trying to prove a point here and

174
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,209
I'm trying to prove a point here and
 

175
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,210
I'm trying to prove a point here and
it's not it's not happening yeah so if

176
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,220
it's not it's not happening yeah so if
 

177
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,550
it's not it's not happening yeah so if
this starts to fill up I think it'll

178
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
this starts to fill up I think it'll
 

179
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,699
this starts to fill up I think it'll
mess up right oh maybe not oh that's

180
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:16,709
mess up right oh maybe not oh that's
 

181
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,839
mess up right oh maybe not oh that's
that's good

182
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:19,849

 

183
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:21,890

well I was worried about nothing then

184
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:21,900
well I was worried about nothing then
 

185
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,600
well I was worried about nothing then
apparently I thought like if this filled

186
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:23,610
apparently I thought like if this filled
 

187
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,969
apparently I thought like if this filled
up then these stone blocks would go out

188
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:25,979
up then these stone blocks would go out
 

189
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,369
up then these stone blocks would go out
of place and mess the whole thing up but

190
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:28,379
of place and mess the whole thing up but
 

191
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,570
of place and mess the whole thing up but
it seems to be okay actually all right

192
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:32,580
it seems to be okay actually all right
 

193
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,010
it seems to be okay actually all right
never mind

194
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,020
never mind
 

195
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,890
never mind
Nexus is working just fine food me

196
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:39,900
Nexus is working just fine food me
 

197
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,300
Nexus is working just fine food me
hungry me eat you all right guys so

198
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,310
hungry me eat you all right guys so
 

199
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,129
hungry me eat you all right guys so
here's the plan we are over here at the

200
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:46,139
here's the plan we are over here at the
 

201
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,070
here's the plan we are over here at the
the gold farm we're here because this

202
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
the gold farm we're here because this
 

203
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,140
the gold farm we're here because this
thing will spawn gas for us every so

204
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,150
thing will spawn gas for us every so
 

205
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,969
thing will spawn gas for us every so
often and we're gonna try to catch one

206
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:52,979
often and we're gonna try to catch one
 

207
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,279
often and we're gonna try to catch one
and bring them to the overworld let's

208
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:55,289
and bring them to the overworld let's
 

209
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:58,480
and bring them to the overworld let's
just make a portal to begin with here

210
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,490
just make a portal to begin with here
 

211
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,040
just make a portal to begin with here
just so that we know where it's gonna

212
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,050
just so that we know where it's gonna
 

213
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,040
just so that we know where it's gonna
generate in the overworld I know there's

214
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,050
generate in the overworld I know there's
 

215
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,439
generate in the overworld I know there's
a lot of tree farm designs that use

216
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:06,449
a lot of tree farm designs that use
 

217
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,870
a lot of tree farm designs that use
Withers so like automatically collect

218
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
Withers so like automatically collect
 

219
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,620
Withers so like automatically collect
the wood and that they're really good

220
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:11,630
the wood and that they're really good
 

221
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,330
the wood and that they're really good
definitely really good we're gonna try

222
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:14,340
definitely really good we're gonna try
 

223
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,469
definitely really good we're gonna try
to do one of it that uses gas so for a

224
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
to do one of it that uses gas so for a
 

225
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,700
to do one of it that uses gas so for a
couple of reasons just because I think

226
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:19,710
couple of reasons just because I think
 

227
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,490
couple of reasons just because I think
it'll be more fun is the main reason but

228
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:22,500
it'll be more fun is the main reason but
 

229
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,999
it'll be more fun is the main reason but
also I'm a little afraid of the winner

230
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,009
also I'm a little afraid of the winner
 

231
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,770
also I'm a little afraid of the winner
ones because sometimes the updates can

232
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:27,780
ones because sometimes the updates can
 

233
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,839
ones because sometimes the updates can
cause them to act it's weird and then

234
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:29,849
cause them to act it's weird and then
 

235
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,070
cause them to act it's weird and then
you have a wither loose in your world a

236
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,080
you have a wither loose in your world a
 

237
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,370
you have a wither loose in your world a
little bit worried about that okay this

238
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,380
little bit worried about that okay this
 

239
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,390
little bit worried about that okay this
is not exactly an ideal place to come

240
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,400
is not exactly an ideal place to come
 

241
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,010
is not exactly an ideal place to come
out actually this might be by the ice

242
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,020
out actually this might be by the ice
 

243
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,170
out actually this might be by the ice
spike biome right I think so all right

244
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,180
spike biome right I think so all right
 

245
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,140
spike biome right I think so all right
what we're gonna do first off here he is

246
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,150
what we're gonna do first off here he is
 

247
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,320
what we're gonna do first off here he is
break this portal and we're gonna resize

248
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,330
break this portal and we're gonna resize
 

249
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,360
break this portal and we're gonna resize
it so that a gas can go through it

250
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,370
it so that a gas can go through it
 

251
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,850
it so that a gas can go through it
hopefully without suffocating cuz right

252
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:01,860
hopefully without suffocating cuz right
 

253
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,409
hopefully without suffocating cuz right
now it's just too small we need it to be

254
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:03,419
now it's just too small we need it to be
 

255
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,950
now it's just too small we need it to be
four blocks tall and probably wanted at

256
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
four blocks tall and probably wanted at
 

257
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,950
four blocks tall and probably wanted at
least five blocks wide alright hopefully

258
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
least five blocks wide alright hopefully
 

259
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,959
least five blocks wide alright hopefully
this will work out okay the idea is we

260
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:14,969
this will work out okay the idea is we
 

261
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,640
this will work out okay the idea is we
want the gas to come through the portal

262
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:16,650
want the gas to come through the portal
 

263
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,129
want the gas to come through the portal
and then he's kind of stuck in a cage

264
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,139
and then he's kind of stuck in a cage
 

265
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,510
and then he's kind of stuck in a cage
here he shouldn't be able to move too

266
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,520
here he shouldn't be able to move too
 

267
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,820
here he shouldn't be able to move too
much if we go through the portal we can

268
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:22,830
much if we go through the portal we can
 

269
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,529
much if we go through the portal we can
hopefully get away from him pretty

270
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:24,539
hopefully get away from him pretty
 

271
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,959
hopefully get away from him pretty
quickly without him blowing himself up

272
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:26,969
quickly without him blowing himself up
 

273
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,839
quickly without him blowing himself up
or us up and then once we come through

274
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:29,849
or us up and then once we come through
 

275
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,339
or us up and then once we come through
we want to break the portal so he

276
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:31,349
we want to break the portal so he
 

277
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,970
we want to break the portal so he
doesn't get sent back

278
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:32,980
doesn't get sent back
 

279
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,940
doesn't get sent back
and then we we have them this is gonna

280
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:35,950
and then we we have them this is gonna
 

281
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,320
and then we we have them this is gonna
be the most tricky part of the whole

282
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,330
be the most tricky part of the whole
 

283
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,040
be the most tricky part of the whole
thing most challenging part I think and

284
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,050
thing most challenging part I think and
 

285
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,450
thing most challenging part I think and
we're trying to figure this out as we go

286
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:42,460
we're trying to figure this out as we go
 

287
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,230
we're trying to figure this out as we go
instead of me like figuring this all out

288
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
instead of me like figuring this all out
 

289
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,420
instead of me like figuring this all out
and creative before handle we're doing

290
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,430
and creative before handle we're doing
 

291
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,650
and creative before handle we're doing
it like the good old days or we

292
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:49,660
it like the good old days or we
 

293
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,110
it like the good old days or we
discovered together I think that'll be

294
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,120
discovered together I think that'll be
 

295
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,250
discovered together I think that'll be
more fun oh snap oh snap but it might

296
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,260
more fun oh snap oh snap but it might
 

297
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,500
more fun oh snap oh snap but it might
also be doomed for failure I'm not sure

298
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:58,510
also be doomed for failure I'm not sure
 

299
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,930
also be doomed for failure I'm not sure
this could this is a project that could

300
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:00,940
this could this is a project that could
 

301
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,140
this could this is a project that could
easily not work they added some new

302
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,150
easily not work they added some new
 

303
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,150
easily not work they added some new
sounds for the magma cubes that yes I

304
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
sounds for the magma cubes that yes I
 

305
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,220

sound like slinkys now all right we got

308
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:14,890
sound like slinkys now all right we got
 

309
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,920

a ghast here it's freaking out a little
 

311
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,420
a ghast here it's freaking out a little
bit it's all good now we have to trap

312
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,430
bit it's all good now we have to trap
 

313
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,250

him I'm tempted to go in there with an

314
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,260
him I'm tempted to go in there with an
 

315
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,050
him I'm tempted to go in there with an
invisibility potion and see what happens

316
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,060

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:27,850
them out of there
 

509
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,270
them out of there
I don't want to go in there and then

510
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,280

and it'll block him off so now we have

520
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,120
and it'll block him off so now we have
 

521
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,570
and it'll block him off so now we have
to reduce his cage as small as possible

522
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:48,580
to reduce his cage as small as possible
 

523

think he moved right okay if that works
 

529
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
think he moved right okay if that works
we should be able to place the block

530
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
we should be able to place the block
 

531
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,960
we should be able to place the block
right on top we can take good we reduced

532
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:12,970
right on top we can take good we reduced
 

533
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,240
right on top we can take good we reduced
the size we're getting smaller

534
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,250
the size we're getting smaller
 

535
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,550
the size we're getting smaller
aha there we go so we got um trapped in

aha there we go so we got um trapped in
 

537
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,550
aha there we go so we got um trapped in
a four by four by four cage now super

538
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:23,560
a four by four by four cage now super
 

539
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
a four by four by four cage now super
tight you'll notice he doesn't even turn

540
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:25,570
tight you'll notice he doesn't even turn

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:33,610
that that that's really important but
 

547
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,420
that that that's really important but
this kind of looks funny so I made a

548
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,430
this kind of looks funny so I made a
 

549
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,310
this kind of looks funny so I made a
backup of the world here just in case I

550
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
backup of the world here just in case I
 

551
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,490
backup of the world here just in case I
mess up as well like if we kill them or

552
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:41,500
mess up as well like if we kill them or
 

553
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,100
mess up as well like if we kill them or
or something stupid happens we'll be

554
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,110
or something stupid happens we'll be
 

555
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,010
or something stupid happens we'll be
able to revert and I don't have to go

556
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,020
able to revert and I don't have to go
 

557
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,840
able to revert and I don't have to go
through this terrible process all over

558
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:48,850
through this terrible process all over
 

559
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,050
through this terrible process all over
again but we're gonna start

560
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,060
again but we're gonna start
 

561
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,270
again but we're gonna start
experimenting now so we got to get them

562
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:54,280
experimenting now so we got to get them
 

563
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,900
experimenting now so we got to get them
shooting we'll probably have to change

564
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:57,910
shooting we'll probably have to change
 

565
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,310
shooting we'll probably have to change
this out with stone right so that so

566
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
this out with stone right so that so
 

567
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,720
this out with stone right so that so
that he doesn't free himself or

568
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:03,730
that he doesn't free himself or
 

569
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,370
that he doesn't free himself or
something

570
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,380
something
 

571
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,390
something
okay so let's you know I kind of thought

572
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,400
okay so let's you know I kind of thought
 

573
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,520
okay so let's you know I kind of thought
hmm

574
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,530
hmm
 

575
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,290
hmm
like there's no middle block now is the

576
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:13,300
like there's no middle block now is the
 

577
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,480
like there's no middle block now is the
problem

578
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:14,490
problem
 

579
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,769
problem
does let's try this one

580
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:18,779
does let's try this one
 

581
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,870
does let's try this one
I guess oh yeah you could shoot through

582
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:23,880
I guess oh yeah you could shoot through
 

583
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,720
I guess oh yeah you could shoot through
that

584
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:25,730
that
 

585
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,740
that
well happens if you do it on this one

586
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:27,750
well happens if you do it on this one
 

587
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:34,160
well happens if you do it on this one
then you can shoot through that one too

588
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,170
then you can shoot through that one too
 

589
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,610
then you can shoot through that one too
that's weird so it's not like censored

590
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:37,620
that's weird so it's not like censored
 

591
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,199
that's weird so it's not like censored
then alright so we can have a hole that

592
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:42,209
then alright so we can have a hole that
 

593
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,960
then alright so we can have a hole that
he shoots through next question is how

594
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:44,970
he shoots through next question is how
 

595
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,540
he shoots through next question is how
do we get them to shoot the wood because

596
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,550
do we get them to shoot the wood because
 

597
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,340
do we get them to shoot the wood because
we're gonna have the trees get harvested

598
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,350
we're gonna have the trees get harvested
 

599
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,860
we're gonna have the trees get harvested
and then get pushed into a line like all

600
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:51,870
and then get pushed into a line like all
 

601
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,540
and then get pushed into a line like all
the wood into a line and then we got to

602
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:53,550
the wood into a line and then we got to
 

603
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,880
the wood into a line and then we got to
get them to shoot the wood and then we

604
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:55,890
get them to shoot the wood and then we
 

605
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,290
get them to shoot the wood and then we
have to collect it

606
00:15:59,290 --> 00:15:59,300

 

607
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,100

missed all right I'm gonna move out of

608
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,110
missed all right I'm gonna move out of
 

609
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,850
missed all right I'm gonna move out of
the way oh he doesn't see down missed

610
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:09,860
the way oh he doesn't see down missed
 

611
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,570
the way oh he doesn't see down missed
this might be tricky oh it's because we

612
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:14,580
this might be tricky oh it's because we
 

613
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,490
this might be tricky oh it's because we
got it kind of to the side we want it

614
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:16,500
got it kind of to the side we want it
 

615
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,579
got it kind of to the side we want it
right in front of the hole right yeah we

616
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:19,589
right in front of the hole right yeah we
 

617
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:22,340
right in front of the hole right yeah we
were one block to the left there do it

618
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:22,350
were one block to the left there do it
 

619
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,519
were one block to the left there do it
like this now you shouldn't have trouble

620
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:25,529
like this now you shouldn't have trouble
 

621
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:31,180
like this now you shouldn't have trouble
did he didn't break that iron did he I

622
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,190

 

623
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,829

think irons pretty blast-resistant I

624
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
think irons pretty blast-resistant I
 

625
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,930
think irons pretty blast-resistant I
must have broke that what you can't

626
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:38,940
must have broke that what you can't
 

627
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,470
must have broke that what you can't
break spruce wood

628
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:43,480

 

629
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,120

fact yeah there you go we got it you
 

633
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,410
fact yeah there you go we got it you
gotta get that you drop from it - this

634
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,420
gotta get that you drop from it - this
 

635
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,810
gotta get that you drop from it - this
isn't looking very promising all right

636
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:03,820
isn't looking very promising all right
 

637
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,669
isn't looking very promising all right
let me think about this for a second how

638
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
let me think about this for a second how
 

639
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,960
let me think about this for a second how
are we gonna do this aha so I got a

640
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:09,970
are we gonna do this aha so I got a
 

641
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,449
are we gonna do this aha so I got a
pretty good idea here I think we're

642
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:12,459
pretty good idea here I think we're
 

643
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:16,280
pretty good idea here I think we're
gonna use water downward flowing water

644
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,290
gonna use water downward flowing water
 

645
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,210
gonna use water downward flowing water
okay I killed that bat that was

646
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:18,220
okay I killed that bat that was
 

647
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,429
okay I killed that bat that was
unintentional but I enjoyed it yeah

648
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
unintentional but I enjoyed it yeah
 

649
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,890
unintentional but I enjoyed it yeah
we're going to do this let's try this

650
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:25,900
we're going to do this let's try this
 

651
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,110
we're going to do this let's try this
out so the idea is it should make the

652
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,120
out so the idea is it should make the
 

653
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,380
out so the idea is it should make the
bullet go down all right instead of

654
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:31,390
bullet go down all right instead of
 

655
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,090
bullet go down all right instead of
shooting at us it'll go down and then we

656
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,100
shooting at us it'll go down and then we
 

657
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,750
shooting at us it'll go down and then we
can aim it at whatever we want is the

658
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:36,760
can aim it at whatever we want is the
 

659
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:49,980
can aim it at whatever we want is the
theory still hit us it does seem like

660
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:49,990
theory still hit us it does seem like
 

661
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,100
theory still hit us it does seem like
it's going down more though here maybe

662
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,110
it's going down more though here maybe
 

663
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,780
it's going down more though here maybe
we need something in front of us to

664
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:57,790
we need something in front of us to
 

665
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,880
we need something in front of us to
protect us let's try this

666
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:01,890
protect us let's try this
 

667
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,810
protect us let's try this
that was way off to the left that was

668
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:06,820
that was way off to the left that was
 

669
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,720
that was way off to the left that was
fine that hurt

670
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:12,730

 

671
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,640

not working as good as I hoped let's go

672
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:17,650
not working as good as I hoped let's go
 

673
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,250
not working as good as I hoped let's go
up a step

674
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,260
up a step
 

675
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,960

oh yeah this might be it

676
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:23,970
oh yeah this might be it
 

677
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,960
oh yeah this might be it
we're still getting hit though aren't we

678
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:26,970
we're still getting hit though aren't we
 

679
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:33,870
we're still getting hit though aren't we
not that time not that time oh we might

680
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:33,880
not that time not that time oh we might
 

681
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:41,790
not that time not that time oh we might
have found the answer here oh yeah I

682
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:41,800
have found the answer here oh yeah I
 

683
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,700
have found the answer here oh yeah I
think this might be good calm down

684
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:46,710
think this might be good calm down
 

685
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,320
think this might be good calm down
alright so the idea is we would try to

686
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,330
alright so the idea is we would try to
 

687
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,140
alright so the idea is we would try to
get the wood to go in a straight line in

688
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,150
get the wood to go in a straight line in
 

689
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,110
get the wood to go in a straight line in
front and like keep keep filling up that

690
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
front and like keep keep filling up that
 

691
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,080
front and like keep keep filling up that
spot and yeah you see that it dropped as

692
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,090
spot and yeah you see that it dropped as
 

693
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,800
spot and yeah you see that it dropped as
wood good very good

694
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:04,810
wood good very good
 

695
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:10,680
wood good very good
let's try again yeah we got to it almost

696
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,690
let's try again yeah we got to it almost
 

697
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,150
let's try again yeah we got to it almost
seems like it's not destroying the wood

698
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
seems like it's not destroying the wood
 

699
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,640
seems like it's not destroying the wood
either

700
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:13,650
either
 

701
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,220
either
yeah we got to that time the challenge

702
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,230
yeah we got to that time the challenge
 

703
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,880
yeah we got to that time the challenge
will be trying to make this efficient as

704
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:20,890
will be trying to make this efficient as
 

705
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,180
will be trying to make this efficient as
well so we don't lose it every time got

706
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,190
well so we don't lose it every time got
 

707
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,960
well so we don't lose it every time got
three that time all right

708
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:27,970
three that time all right
 

709
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,390
three that time all right
oh I didn't put the wood down but the

710
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:33,400
oh I didn't put the wood down but the
 

711
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,080
oh I didn't put the wood down but the
idea is we could be we want to make this

712
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,090
idea is we could be we want to make this
 

713
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,050
idea is we could be we want to make this
so we can afk right so the idea is we

714
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,060
so we can afk right so the idea is we
 

715
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,310
so we can afk right so the idea is we
could be like facing this direction

716
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,320
could be like facing this direction
 

717
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,220
could be like facing this direction
planting trees put something heavy on my

718
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,230
planting trees put something heavy on my
 

719
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,360
planting trees put something heavy on my

720
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,370
right mouse button right trees grow get
 

721
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,850

auto harvested the wood gets pushed

722
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:50,860
auto harvested the wood gets pushed
 

723
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,420
auto harvested the wood gets pushed
around the front here it's harvested put

724
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,430
around the front here it's harvested put
 

725
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,210
around the front here it's harvested put
some hoppers down below maybe some way

726
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:57,220
some hoppers down below maybe some way
 

727
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,830
some hoppers down below maybe some way
of preventing the fire from destroying

728
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840
of preventing the fire from destroying
 

729
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,550
of preventing the fire from destroying
everything

730
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:01,560

 

731
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,570

so we're not getting shot in the face

732
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:03,580
so we're not getting shot in the face
 

733
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,640
so we're not getting shot in the face
anymore right yeah I think this will

734
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:08,650
anymore right yeah I think this will
 

735
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,910
anymore right yeah I think this will
work okay look at this

736
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:11,920
work okay look at this
 

737
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,710
work okay look at this
decided to try it without the water to

738
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:13,720
decided to try it without the water to
 

739
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,930
decided to try it without the water to
see if it was actually doing anything it

740
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:15,940
see if it was actually doing anything it
 

741
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,730
see if it was actually doing anything it
definitely was because I'm getting shot

742
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:17,740
definitely was because I'm getting shot
 

743
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,580
definitely was because I'm getting shot
in the face every time without it so we

744
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:20,590
in the face every time without it so we
 

745
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,480
in the face every time without it so we
need the water oh maybe not every time I

746
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,490
need the water oh maybe not every time I
 

747
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,070
need the water oh maybe not every time I
hit the gas shoots randomly but yeah it

748
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,080
hit the gas shoots randomly but yeah it
 

749
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,990
hit the gas shoots randomly but yeah it
the water was definitely changing the

750
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,000
the water was definitely changing the
 

751
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,190
the water was definitely changing the
trajectory well I guess the next thing

752
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
trajectory well I guess the next thing
 

753
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,600
trajectory well I guess the next thing
we got to do here is figure out how to

754
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,610
we got to do here is figure out how to
 

755
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,180
we got to do here is figure out how to
get the most out of these shots so we

756
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,190
get the most out of these shots so we
 

757
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,920
get the most out of these shots so we
lose the least amount of wood and it's

758
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:40,930
lose the least amount of wood and it's
 

759
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,070
lose the least amount of wood and it's
the most efficient that that we can get

760
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
the most efficient that that we can get
 

761
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,560
the most efficient that that we can get
with this design let's see what happens

762
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:46,570
with this design let's see what happens
 

763
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,840
with this design let's see what happens
if we put hoppers here first stop so

764
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:48,850
if we put hoppers here first stop so
 

765
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,820
if we put hoppers here first stop so
we'll put wood over top see if it can

766
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:50,830
we'll put wood over top see if it can
 

767
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,340
we'll put wood over top see if it can
collect it's pretty consistently I put a

768
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,350
collect it's pretty consistently I put a
 

769
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,220
collect it's pretty consistently I put a
trapdoor in there

770
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,230
trapdoor in there
 

771
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,550
trapdoor in there
hopefully he doesn't shoot it looks like

772
00:20:59,550 --> 00:20:59,560
hopefully he doesn't shoot it looks like
 

773
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,730
hopefully he doesn't shoot it looks like
we're okay did we get we got two that

774
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:02,740
we're okay did we get we got two that
 

775
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:11,360
we're okay did we get we got two that
time all right that's good try it again

776
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,370

 

777
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,050

she broke all three we got three good

778
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,060
she broke all three we got three good
 

779
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,340
she broke all three we got three good
hoppers seems to be working okay

780
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:19,350

 

781
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,700

yeah we got both of them very good I'm

782
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:23,710
yeah we got both of them very good I'm
 

783
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,190
yeah we got both of them very good I'm
running out of wood does it do these

784
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,200
running out of wood does it do these
 

785
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,930
running out of wood does it do these
tests we're kind of far away from base

786
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:27,940
tests we're kind of far away from base
 

787
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,660
tests we're kind of far away from base
is the only problem with this yeah I

788
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,670
is the only problem with this yeah I
 

789
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,700
is the only problem with this yeah I
think we got both of them let's see it

790
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:35,710
think we got both of them let's see it
 

791
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,090
think we got both of them let's see it
does cause a fire on the top here

792
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,100
does cause a fire on the top here
 

793
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,480
does cause a fire on the top here
should be 11 yeah we got 11 very very

794
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,490
should be 11 yeah we got 11 very very
 

795
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,330
should be 11 yeah we got 11 very very
good actually does the gas blow-up

796
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,340
good actually does the gas blow-up
 

797
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,440
good actually does the gas blow-up
hoppers I don't think he does let's

798
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,450
hoppers I don't think he does let's
 

799
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,780
hoppers I don't think he does let's
let's check that out just to see if we

800
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:53,790
let's check that out just to see if we
 

801
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,830
let's check that out just to see if we
have to worry about that

802
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:54,840
have to worry about that
 

803
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,320
have to worry about that
oh man I'm jumping high yeah it looks

804
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,330
oh man I'm jumping high yeah it looks
 

805
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,410
oh man I'm jumping high yeah it looks
like the hoppers are okay that looked

806
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:03,420
like the hoppers are okay that looked
 

807
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,030
like the hoppers are okay that looked
like a direct hit to it yeah I think

808
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,040
like a direct hit to it yeah I think
 

809
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,150
like a direct hit to it yeah I think
we're okay with the hoppers not breaking

810
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:10,160
we're okay with the hoppers not breaking
 

811
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,910
we're okay with the hoppers not breaking
one idea like if we're worried about the

812
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:13,920
one idea like if we're worried about the
 

813
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,570
one idea like if we're worried about the
fire

814
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:14,580
fire
 

815
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:21,160
fire
we could have let's make some slabs I

816
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,170

 

817
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,890

don't think we could just put like slabs

818
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:23,900
don't think we could just put like slabs
 

819
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,430
don't think we could just put like slabs
here but we could have like a sweeping

820
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:28,440
here but we could have like a sweeping
 

821
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,380
here but we could have like a sweeping
mechanic so every so often like on a

822
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,390
mechanic so every so often like on a
 

823
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,500
mechanic so every so often like on a
clock have this slab push over to the

824
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:33,510
clock have this slab push over to the
 

825
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,450
clock have this slab push over to the
right for a split second and then pull

826
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:35,460
right for a split second and then pull
 

827
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,800
right for a split second and then pull
back and that will get rid of the fire

828
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:39,810
back and that will get rid of the fire
 

829
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,330
back and that will get rid of the fire
if it's on top of any of the wood like

830
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:41,340
if it's on top of any of the wood like
 

831
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,760
if it's on top of any of the wood like
if there's a wood here on fire this slab

832
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:43,770
if there's a wood here on fire this slab
 

833
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,110
if there's a wood here on fire this slab
goes over top it's gonna put out the

834
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
goes over top it's gonna put out the
 

835
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,190
goes over top it's gonna put out the
fire and then retract that might be one

836
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
fire and then retract that might be one
 

837
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
fire and then retract that might be one
way to do it well I guess just to see if

838
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:52,650
way to do it well I guess just to see if
 

839
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,680
way to do it well I guess just to see if
it works or not let's put iron trapdoors

840
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:54,690
it works or not let's put iron trapdoors
 

841
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,490
it works or not let's put iron trapdoors
on top of this wood alright my worry is

842
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:58,500
on top of this wood alright my worry is
 

843
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,890
on top of this wood alright my worry is
like the gas ball might hit the side of

844
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:00,900
like the gas ball might hit the side of
 

845
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,870
like the gas ball might hit the side of
the trapdoor and then it won't destroy

846
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
the trapdoor and then it won't destroy
 

847
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,390
the trapdoor and then it won't destroy
the wood I'm not sure but we'll find out

848
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:05,400
the wood I'm not sure but we'll find out
 

849
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,310
the wood I'm not sure but we'll find out
here yes okay would that do oh no it's

850
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
here yes okay would that do oh no it's
 

851
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,110
here yes okay would that do oh no it's
still got it still got it

852
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,120
still got it still got it
 

853
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,200
still got it still got it
oh okay yeah that might be a good way of

854
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,210
oh okay yeah that might be a good way of
 

855
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,920
oh okay yeah that might be a good way of
doing it then then there's no moving

856
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:21,930
doing it then then there's no moving
 

857
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,320
doing it then then there's no moving
parts it just works you know that's

858
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,330
parts it just works you know that's
 

859
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,050
parts it just works you know that's
usually a better way of doing things

860
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,060
usually a better way of doing things
 

861
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,610
usually a better way of doing things
still have the fire down here but if we

862
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:28,620
still have the fire down here but if we
 

863
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,090
still have the fire down here but if we
lower the blocks it won't happen

864
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,100

 

865
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,750

yeah I like that a lot

866
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:36,760
yeah I like that a lot
 

867
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,700
yeah I like that a lot
all right guys well I'm I'm very happy

868
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:39,710
all right guys well I'm I'm very happy
 

869
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,260
all right guys well I'm I'm very happy
with what we got here so far like the

870
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,270
with what we got here so far like the
 

871
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,330
with what we got here so far like the
harvesting mechanics this we got our gas

872
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:43,340
harvesting mechanics this we got our gas
 

873
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,280
harvesting mechanics this we got our gas
steer he seems to get 100% drops out of

874
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,290
steer he seems to get 100% drops out of
 

875
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,010
steer he seems to get 100% drops out of
the wood he destroys which is great the

876
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,020
the wood he destroys which is great the
 

877
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,750
the wood he destroys which is great the
hoppers down below here never seemed to

878
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:52,760
hoppers down below here never seemed to
 

879
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,200
hoppers down below here never seemed to
miss picking up the wood and basically

880
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,210
miss picking up the wood and basically
 

881
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,180
miss picking up the wood and basically
we'll have a delivery system from the

882
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,190
we'll have a delivery system from the
 

883
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,760
we'll have a delivery system from the
tree farm that will push the wood into

884
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:00,770
tree farm that will push the wood into
 

885
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,000
tree farm that will push the wood into
place here like kind of like this get

886
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,010
place here like kind of like this get
 

887
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,910
place here like kind of like this get
into position we found out how to stop

888
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:06,920
into position we found out how to stop
 

889
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,950
into position we found out how to stop
the fires from the gas balls and if we

890
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
the fires from the gas balls and if we
 

891
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,990
the fires from the gas balls and if we
have slabs on the ground here or just no

892
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,000
have slabs on the ground here or just no
 

893
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,840
have slabs on the ground here or just no
blocks at all have absolutely zero fires

894
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:13,850
blocks at all have absolutely zero fires
 

895
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,310
blocks at all have absolutely zero fires
and we got the trap door Oh actually

896
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
and we got the trap door Oh actually
 

897
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,140
and we got the trap door Oh actually
we'll probably want to put like obsidian

898
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,150
we'll probably want to put like obsidian
 

899
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,910
we'll probably want to put like obsidian
or something here so it can't push this

900
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:21,920
or something here so it can't push this
 

901
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,640
or something here so it can't push this
far a block of obsidian here or

902
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:24,650
far a block of obsidian here or
 

903
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,880
far a block of obsidian here or
something but yeah we got the trap door

904
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:27,890
something but yeah we got the trap door
 

905
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,800
something but yeah we got the trap door
there I added a little safety mechanic

906
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:29,810
there I added a little safety mechanic
 

907
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,300
there I added a little safety mechanic
so it's always closed unless we're

908
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,310
so it's always closed unless we're
 

909
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,130
so it's always closed unless we're
standing here on this pressure plate

910
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:35,140
standing here on this pressure plate
 

911
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,080
standing here on this pressure plate
that'll put up the trap door put an iron

912
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,090
that'll put up the trap door put an iron
 

913
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,360
that'll put up the trap door put an iron
fence here so that we're out of position

914
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,370
fence here so that we're out of position
 

915
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,010
fence here so that we're out of position
like we were sometimes getting hit if we

916
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,020
like we were sometimes getting hit if we
 

917
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,480
like we were sometimes getting hit if we
were right against this block in front

918
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,490
were right against this block in front
 

919
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,930
were right against this block in front
here and I put another trap door here so

920
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:46,940
here and I put another trap door here so
 

921
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,160
here and I put another trap door here so
there's no fire bonding in this position

922
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,170
there's no fire bonding in this position
 

923
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:54,070
there's no fire bonding in this position
and yeah it just seems to work one 100%

924
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
and yeah it just seems to work one 100%
 

925
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,110
and yeah it just seems to work one 100%
so far all we got to do now is build the

926
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
so far all we got to do now is build the
 

927
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,690
so far all we got to do now is build the
tree farm kind of an important part of

928
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:01,700
tree farm kind of an important part of
 

929
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,780
tree farm kind of an important part of
this as well but that's gonna have to

930
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:04,790
this as well but that's gonna have to
 

931
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,760
this as well but that's gonna have to
wait until the next episode

932
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:05,770
wait until the next episode
 

933
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,780
wait until the next episode
unfortunately because it is time to wrap

934
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:07,790
unfortunately because it is time to wrap
 

935
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,060
unfortunately because it is time to wrap
it up for today so here we go we got the

936
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,070
it up for today so here we go we got the
 

937
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,360
it up for today so here we go we got the
comments of the day that say what

938
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,370
comments of the day that say what
 

939
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,670
comments of the day that say what
happened to drum nouvion nights I need

940
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:15,680
happened to drum nouvion nights I need
 

941
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,420
happened to drum nouvion nights I need
more Team Canada so we went to record

942
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,430
more Team Canada so we went to record
 

943
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,670
more Team Canada so we went to record
that like we released three episodes we

944
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:21,680
that like we released three episodes we
 

945
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,670
that like we released three episodes we
went to record it one night and oh yeah

946
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:24,680
went to record it one night and oh yeah
 

947
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,140
went to record it one night and oh yeah
you got a hold or you got a press

948
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,150
you got a hold or you got a press
 

949
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,200
you got a hold or you got a press
