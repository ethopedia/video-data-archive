happen and as you can see I've added a
 

79
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,420
happen and as you can see I've added a
couple things on to it so we now have

80
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:23,430
couple things on to it so we now have
 

81
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,720
couple things on to it so we now have
two Pistons over here that that come out

I have to break them afterwards

94
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
I have to break them afterwards
 

95
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,440
I have to break them afterwards
I'd say give enough time for the

96
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,450
I'd say give enough time for the
 

97
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,940
I'd say give enough time for the
sandwich maker there to move all the

98

this whole thing would jam up eventually

102
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:48,630
this whole thing would jam up eventually
 

103
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,000
this whole thing would jam up eventually
so yeah they just extend for a little

104
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,010
so yeah they just extend for a little
 

105
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,220
so yeah they just extend for a little
bit in order to do that I set up a

106
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,230
bit in order to do that I set up a
 

107
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,120
bit in order to do that I set up a
hopper timer out here let's go outside

108
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,130
hopper timer out here let's go outside
 

109
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,890
hopper timer out here let's go outside
right over here this times how long they

110
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:00,900
right over here this times how long they
 

111
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,750
right over here this times how long they
stay extended depending on how many

112
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:02,760
stay extended depending on how many
 

113
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,949
stay extended depending on how many
items we have in there

00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
flawless system here you can see we got
 

121
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,789
flawless system here you can see we got
saplings all over the place I'm gonna

122
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:13,799
saplings all over the place I'm gonna
 

123
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:14,930
saplings all over the place I'm gonna
have to redo this

124
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:14,940
have to redo this
 

125
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,759
have to redo this
look at this all these saplings are

126
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:19,769
look at this all these saplings are
 

127
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,460
look at this all these saplings are
supposed to go in the hopper over here

128
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,470
supposed to go in the hopper over here
 

129
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,850
supposed to go in the hopper over here
and we have absolutely none exactly as I

130
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:25,860
and we have absolutely none exactly as I
 

131
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,979

pistons they crush the leaves pretty

136
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:33,600
pistons they crush the leaves pretty
 

137
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,720
pistons they crush the leaves pretty
much get most of all the leaves and and

138
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:37,730
much get most of all the leaves and and
 

139
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,280

saplings are supposed to drop down into
 

143
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,470

144
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
these hop
 

145
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,449
these hop
I had carefully placed down below here

146
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:44,459
I had carefully placed down below here
 

147
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,640
I had carefully placed down below here
but we collect absolutely no sap things

148
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,650
but we collect absolutely no sap things
 

149
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,190
but we collect absolutely no sap things
with this thing which I found a little

150
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
with this thing which I found a little
 

151
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,020
with this thing which I found a little
bit surprising I thought that would work

152
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,030
bit surprising I thought that would work
 

153
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,690
bit surprising I thought that would work
I'm pretty sure that's how you you're

154
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:53,700
I'm pretty sure that's how you you're
 

155
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,690
I'm pretty sure that's how you you're
supposed to do it traits but what

156
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:56,700
supposed to do it traits but what
 

157
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,759
supposed to do it traits but what
happens I think the piston head counts

158
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:58,769
happens I think the piston head counts
 

159
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,530
happens I think the piston head counts
as a solid block now so you know instead

160
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:03,540
as a solid block now so you know instead
 

161
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,180
as a solid block now so you know instead
of falling down the saplings either go

162
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,190
of falling down the saplings either go
 

163
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,490
of falling down the saplings either go
up or they go out into the wiring they

164
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,500
up or they go out into the wiring they
 

165
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,069
up or they go out into the wiring they
don't go down right let's let's check

166
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:10,079
don't go down right let's let's check
 

167
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,030
don't go down right let's let's check
that out actually I was a little

168
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
that out actually I was a little
 

169
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,930
that out actually I was a little
surprised

170
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:11,940
surprised
 

171
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,460
surprised
do we have any spare pistons around here

172
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:15,470
do we have any spare pistons around here
 

173
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,289
do we have any spare pistons around here
okay let us check this out I'm not sure

174
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:18,299
okay let us check this out I'm not sure
 

175
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,810
okay let us check this out I'm not sure
if I got my facts wrong or what I forget

176
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:20,820
if I got my facts wrong or what I forget
 

177
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,460
if I got my facts wrong or what I forget
so many things in this game or things

178
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,470
so many things in this game or things
 

179
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,500
so many things in this game or things
change and then it mixes me all up I

180
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:24,510
change and then it mixes me all up I
 

181
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,659
change and then it mixes me all up I
don't know what's going on anymore but

182
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:26,669
don't know what's going on anymore but
 

183
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,689
don't know what's going on anymore but
I'm pretty sure this is not a full

184
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:29,699
I'm pretty sure this is not a full
 

185
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:36,560
I'm pretty sure this is not a full
collision box right yeah I threw I threw

186
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,570
collision box right yeah I threw I threw
 

187
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,300
collision box right yeah I threw I threw
items through the piston head and they

188
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,310
items through the piston head and they
 

189
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,330
items through the piston head and they
go on top to arm as well lower then then

190
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:44,340
go on top to arm as well lower then then
 

191
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,570
go on top to arm as well lower then then
the top of the piston head right so I'm

192
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,580
the top of the piston head right so I'm
 

193
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,440
the top of the piston head right so I'm
not sure why that's happening even I'm

194
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,450
not sure why that's happening even I'm
 

195
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,969
not sure why that's happening even I'm
pretty sure in the past if you did

196
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:52,979
pretty sure in the past if you did
 

197
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,560
pretty sure in the past if you did
something like that let's just double

198
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,570
something like that let's just double
 

199
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,480
something like that let's just double
check so it should stay in the piston

200
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,490
check so it should stay in the piston
 

201
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,490
check so it should stay in the piston
arm I would think okay it did oh and

202
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,500
arm I would think okay it did oh and
 

203
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,740
arm I would think okay it did oh and
then when it retracted it shot died oh

204
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:09,750
then when it retracted it shot died oh
 

205
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,960
then when it retracted it shot died oh
maybe that's what's happening then let's

206
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:11,970
maybe that's what's happening then let's
 

207
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,550
maybe that's what's happening then let's
try this one more time see what happens

208
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,560
try this one more time see what happens
 

209
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,210
try this one more time see what happens
okay where'd it go guys I think our

210
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:20,220
okay where'd it go guys I think our
 

211
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,740
okay where'd it go guys I think our
sapling ran away did it shoot through

212
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:23,750
sapling ran away did it shoot through
 

213
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:30,070
sapling ran away did it shoot through
over here somewhere I think is this gone

214
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080

 

215
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,990

all right so it doesn't always go into

216
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000
all right so it doesn't always go into
 

217
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,260
all right so it doesn't always go into
the piston arm area for sure so I'm

218
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,270
the piston arm area for sure so I'm
 

219
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,940
the piston arm area for sure so I'm
gonna have to change my setup there with

220
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:37,950
gonna have to change my setup there with
 

221
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,339
gonna have to change my setup there with
that but other than that we are pretty

222
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:40,349
that but other than that we are pretty
 

223
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,650
that but other than that we are pretty
close to a fully working tree farm here

224
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:42,660
close to a fully working tree farm here
 

225
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,750
close to a fully working tree farm here
today I want to make this area look

226
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:44,760
today I want to make this area look
 

227
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,629
today I want to make this area look
nicer though and do a couple things

228
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:47,639
nicer though and do a couple things
 

229
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,159
nicer though and do a couple things
around here we do have the zombie

230
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,169
around here we do have the zombie
 

231
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,570
around here we do have the zombie
spawner as well would be nice to do

232
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:50,580
spawner as well would be nice to do
 

233
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,430
spawner as well would be nice to do
something with this turn it into an XP

234
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,440
something with this turn it into an XP
 

235
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,469
something with this turn it into an XP
farm because we're going to be afk here

236
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
farm because we're going to be afk here
 

237
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,330
farm because we're going to be afk here
anyways it would be cool if we

238
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,340
anyways it would be cool if we
 

239
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,260
anyways it would be cool if we
got something out of it all right let's

240
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,270
got something out of it all right let's
 

241
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,450
got something out of it all right let's
give this a try guys so I changed out

242
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:02,460
give this a try guys so I changed out
 

243
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,700
give this a try guys so I changed out
the regular pistons the sticky pistons I

244
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:04,710
the regular pistons the sticky pistons I
 

245
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,070
the regular pistons the sticky pistons I
moved them all back by one and then put

246
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,080
moved them all back by one and then put
 

247
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,770
moved them all back by one and then put
trapdoors on them so the trapdoors are

248
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:09,780
trapdoors on them so the trapdoors are
 

249
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,080
trapdoors on them so the trapdoors are
we're gonna break the leaves and because

250
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,090
we're gonna break the leaves and because
 

251
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,780
we're gonna break the leaves and because
they don't take up a full block I

252
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:13,790
they don't take up a full block I
 

253
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,969
they don't take up a full block I
believe we'll find out

254
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:16,979
believe we'll find out
 

255
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,550
believe we'll find out
I think the saplings should fall through

256
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,560
I think the saplings should fall through
 

257
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,689
I think the saplings should fall through
or land on top of them if they're open

258
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:22,699
or land on top of them if they're open
 

259
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,700
or land on top of them if they're open
instead of flying up and out onto the

260
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,710
instead of flying up and out onto the
 

261
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,219
instead of flying up and out onto the
wiring hopefully there wasn't enough

262
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:28,229
wiring hopefully there wasn't enough
 

263
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,990
wiring hopefully there wasn't enough
space to do it in the on this side

264
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
space to do it in the on this side
 

265
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,040
space to do it in the on this side
though so I'm going to leave them as

266
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,050
though so I'm going to leave them as
 

267
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,830
though so I'm going to leave them as
regulars and hopefully won't be too big

268
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
regulars and hopefully won't be too big
 

269
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,990
regulars and hopefully won't be too big
of a problem also we got wiring over

270
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
of a problem also we got wiring over
 

271
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,150
of a problem also we got wiring over
here so I kept these ones as solid

272
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
here so I kept these ones as solid
 

273
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,710
here so I kept these ones as solid
blocks it's not perfect but basically we

274
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
blocks it's not perfect but basically we
 

275
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,780
blocks it's not perfect but basically we
just need to get one sapling from each

276
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:44,790
just need to get one sapling from each
 

277
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,680
just need to get one sapling from each
tree we chopped down here right so that

278
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:48,690
tree we chopped down here right so that
 

279
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,650
tree we chopped down here right so that
we'd never run outs with regular oak

280
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:51,660
we'd never run outs with regular oak
 

281
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,710
we'd never run outs with regular oak
trees I think it's one in 20 chance when

282
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
trees I think it's one in 20 chance when
 

283
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,580
trees I think it's one in 20 chance when
you break a sapling

284
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:55,590
you break a sapling
 

285
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,279
you break a sapling
jungle trees I think is a one in forty

286
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:58,289
jungle trees I think is a one in forty
 

287
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:02,210
jungle trees I think is a one in forty
chance and I'm not sure about the other

288
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,220
chance and I'm not sure about the other
 

289
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,909
chance and I'm not sure about the other
ones all right let's go tree tree has

290
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
ones all right let's go tree tree has
 

291
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,430
ones all right let's go tree tree has
grown and trapped us inside let's break

292
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,440
grown and trapped us inside let's break
 

293
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,940
grown and trapped us inside let's break
that okay what did that do

294
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:15,950
that okay what did that do
 

295
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,800
that okay what did that do
is there any saplings on the ground

296
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:18,810
is there any saplings on the ground
 

297
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,710
is there any saplings on the ground
outside here or in the wiring I don't

298
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:21,720
outside here or in the wiring I don't
 

299
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,570
outside here or in the wiring I don't
see any all right did we collect any we

300
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:26,580
see any all right did we collect any we
 

301
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,300
see any all right did we collect any we
got two yes success okay that's okay

302
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,310
got two yes success okay that's okay
 

303
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,629
got two yes success okay that's okay
let's take a quick peek inside yeah all

304
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:35,639
let's take a quick peek inside yeah all
 

305
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,580
let's take a quick peek inside yeah all
the trap doors opened or most of them

306
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:37,590
the trap doors opened or most of them
 

307
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:37,909
the trap doors opened or most of them
anyway

308
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
anyway
 

309
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,790
anyway
that's too bad maybe we'll try one more

310
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
that's too bad maybe we'll try one more
 

311
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,650
that's too bad maybe we'll try one more
see if that messes it up

312
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:44,660
see if that messes it up
 

313
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,440
see if that messes it up
I was hoping they would stay flat you

314
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,450
I was hoping they would stay flat you
 

315
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,140
I was hoping they would stay flat you
know better all right

316
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,150
know better all right
 

317
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,570
know better all right
now what has happened uh yeah I think

318
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:58,580
now what has happened uh yeah I think
 

319
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,780
now what has happened uh yeah I think
it's okay let's check our our hopper

320
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:01,790
it's okay let's check our our hopper
 

321
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,660
it's okay let's check our our hopper
here again so you've got any saplings

322
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:03,670
here again so you've got any saplings
 

323
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,520
here again so you've got any saplings
we got one okay as long as we didn't get

324
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,530
we got one okay as long as we didn't get
 

325
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,500
we got one okay as long as we didn't get
one every time that is good enough and I

326
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,510
one every time that is good enough and I
 

327
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,510
one every time that is good enough and I
just did one last thing here guys I made

328
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
just did one last thing here guys I made
 

329
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,090
just did one last thing here guys I made
this wire go up to the dropper over here

330
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,100
this wire go up to the dropper over here
 

331
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,070
this wire go up to the dropper over here
so the idea is I'm going to manually

332
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
so the idea is I'm going to manually
 

333
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,470
so the idea is I'm going to manually
fill this with saplings of whatever type

334
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:20,480
fill this with saplings of whatever type
 

335
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,210
fill this with saplings of whatever type

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,430
I want like if I want birch trees or
jungle trees I load that up before we

338
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:24,440
jungle trees I load that up before we
 

339
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,850
jungle trees I load that up before we
start the AFT session rights with

340
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:27,860
start the AFT session rights with
 

341
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,740
start the AFT session rights with
whatever type I want I guess we'll have

342
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:29,750
whatever type I want I guess we'll have
 

343
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,029
whatever type I want I guess we'll have
to enter from this side now okay and

344
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:34,039
to enter from this side now okay and
 

345
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,390
to enter from this side now okay and
every time we grow a tree this should

346
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,400
every time we grow a tree this should
 

347
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,080
every time we grow a tree this should
give me one sapling back and I fixed the

348

give me one sapling back and I fixed the
 

349
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,719
give me one sapling back and I fixed the
wiring to siliceous then now yeah we

350
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:43,729
wiring to siliceous then now yeah we
 

351
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,670

this too but I don't think it's worth
 

357
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,150
this too but I don't think it's worth
worth the bother all right guys very

358

worth the bother all right guys very
 

359
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,130
worth the bother all right guys very
cool so this tree farm is just about

360
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:57,140
cool so this tree farm is just about
 

361
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,930

bit of time here making it look half
 

365
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,140
bit of time here making it look half
decent hopefully I'm gonna try see what

366
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,150
decent hopefully I'm gonna try see what
 

367

you didn't know especially when you just

376
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
you didn't know especially when you just
 

377
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,640
you didn't know especially when you just
finish a building you're and you're

378
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,650
finish a building you're and you're
 

379
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,920
finish a building you're and you're
happy with everything there's nothing

380
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:26,930
happy with everything there's nothing
 

381
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,870

worse than when the water washes it all

382
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
worse than when the water washes it all
 

383
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,110
worse than when the water washes it all
away and then you gotta figure out what

384
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,120
away and then you gotta figure out what
 

385
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,500
away and then you gotta figure out what
what broke all right maybe I'll put a

386
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,510
what broke all right maybe I'll put a
 

387
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,960
what broke all right maybe I'll put a
light right there otherwise it's gonna

388
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:37,970
light right there otherwise it's gonna
 

389
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,230
light right there otherwise it's gonna
be pretty dark here and we might hook up

390
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,240
be pretty dark here and we might hook up
 

391
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,460
be pretty dark here and we might hook up
the zombie spawn or two I think that

392
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,470
the zombie spawn or two I think that
 

393
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,160
the zombie spawn or two I think that
would be a good idea but yeah let's talk

394
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,170
would be a good idea but yeah let's talk
 

395
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,640
would be a good idea but yeah let's talk
for a little bit oh and by the way the

396
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:48,650
for a little bit oh and by the way the
 

397
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,980
for a little bit oh and by the way the
plan is I think this is the middle right

398
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:50,990
plan is I think this is the middle right
 

399
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,840
plan is I think this is the middle right
here this block in this block so we're

401
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,550
here this block in this block so we're
gonna line the portal up so that when we

gonna line the portal up so that when we
 

403
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,830
gonna line the portal up so that when we
come out we see the gas base you

404
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:57,840
come out we see the gas base you
 

405
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,990
come out we see the gas base you
staring right at us then we walked to

406
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
staring right at us then we walked to
 

407
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,660
staring right at us then we walked to
the left here and we're gonna walk

408

the left here and we're gonna walk
 

409
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,320
the left here and we're gonna walk
underneath this line of logs it's the

410
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,330
underneath this line of logs it's the
 

411
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,680
underneath this line of logs it's the
only way of getting over here and then

412
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,690
only way of getting over here and then
 

413
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,570
only way of getting over here and then
we'll walk up to the spots I think

414
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:11,580
we'll walk up to the spots I think
 

415

679
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,540

here towards a positive we go one two

680
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,550
here towards a positive we go one two
 

681
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,630
here towards a positive we go one two
three right next to the gas stage is

682
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:26,640
three right next to the gas stage is
 

683
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,700
three right next to the gas stage is
where it ends and then towards the

684
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:28,710
where it ends and then towards the
 

685
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,590
where it ends and then towards the
negative we need it to go four so one

686
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:30,600
negative we need it to go four so one
 

687
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,770
negative we need it to go four so one
two three four gives us an 8x8 the

688
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:33,780
two three four gives us an 8x8 the
 

689
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,240
two three four gives us an 8x8 the
maximum spawning size

690
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,250
maximum spawning size
 

691
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,120
maximum spawning size
the spawner and we're gonna put water

692
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,130
the spawner and we're gonna put water
 

693
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,030
the spawner and we're gonna put water
against this back wall right and push

694
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,040
against this back wall right and push
 

695
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,610
against this back wall right and push
them this way towards us because we're

696
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:44,620
them this way towards us because we're
 

697
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,790
them this way towards us because we're
gonna be afk there and we'll collect

698
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:47,800
gonna be afk there and we'll collect
 

699
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,530
gonna be afk there and we'll collect
them all together I guess we'll have to

700
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:49,540
them all together I guess we'll have to
 

701
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,660
them all together I guess we'll have to
figure out maybe with the iron golems a

702
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:51,670
figure out maybe with the iron golems a
 

703
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,590
figure out maybe with the iron golems a
way of killing them

704
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,600
way of killing them
 

705
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,290
way of killing them
so that they'll automatically drop XP as

706
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:55,300
so that they'll automatically drop XP as
 

707
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,410
so that they'll automatically drop XP as

00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:27,550
hoppers facing into this chest so this
 

769
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,820
hoppers facing into this chest so this
is where the wood is gonna collect and

770
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:29,830
is where the wood is gonna collect and

yeah let's just give it a try make sure
 

773
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,290
yeah let's just give it a try make sure
it doesn't catch on fire or something

to see let's try out these other trees

784
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
to see let's try out these other trees
 

785
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,029
to see let's try out these other trees
too so jungle trees make sure they can

786
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
too so jungle trees make sure they can
 

787
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,180
too so jungle trees make sure they can
grow they're gonna grow it definitely is

788
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,190
grow they're gonna grow it definitely is
 

789
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,799
grow they're gonna grow it definitely is

never did try it in the tree farm now

796
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:15,830
never did try it in the tree farm now
 

797
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:22,230
never did try it in the tree farm now
that we got it all finished seemed fine

798
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
that we got it all finished seemed fine
 

799
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,210
that we got it all finished seemed fine
it's gonna branch out which might cause

800
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,220
it's gonna branch out which might cause
 

801
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,009
it's gonna branch out which might cause
problems if we run it for a long time

802
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:27,019
problems if we run it for a long time
 

803
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,500
problems if we run it for a long time
but as long as I clean up the stray

but as long as I clean up the stray
 

805
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,990
but as long as I clean up the stray
branches from the tree it should be good

806
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,000

 

807
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,500

yeah you could move quickly on the land
 

843
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,680
