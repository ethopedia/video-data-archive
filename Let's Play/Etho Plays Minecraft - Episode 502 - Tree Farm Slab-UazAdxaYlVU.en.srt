let's play episode so check this out I

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,410
let's play episode so check this out I
have set a new record for myself ever

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:18,420
have set a new record for myself ever

since the villagers changed I've always

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,490
since the villagers changed I've always
 

13
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,400
since the villagers changed I've always
wondered like could you totally lock out

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,410
wondered like could you totally lock out
 

15
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,980
wondered like could you totally lock out
the trades with a villager and I got

16
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:24,990
the trades with a villager and I got
 

17
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,170
the trades with a villager and I got
this cleric to lock out five of the

18
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,180
this cleric to lock out five of the
 

19
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,450
this cleric to lock out five of the
seven trades which I've never done

20
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:29,460
seven trades which I've never done
 

21
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,930
seven trades which I've never done
before so there's a slim chance here we

22
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:32,940
before so there's a slim chance here we
 

23
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,610
before so there's a slim chance here we
might actually do it I thought I would

24
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:34,620
might actually do it I thought I would
 

25
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,770
might actually do it I thought I would
start recording and just see if it

26
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:36,780
start recording and just see if it
 

27
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,299
start recording and just see if it
happens so here we go do it one at a

28
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:41,309
happens so here we go do it one at a
 

29
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,569
happens so here we go do it one at a
time now it's it unlocked them okay so

30
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:44,579
time now it's it unlocked them okay so
 

31
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,279
time now it's it unlocked them okay so
five is my new record we didn't get

32
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:46,289
five is my new record we didn't get
 

33
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,529
five is my new record we didn't get
beyond that all right that was kind of

34
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:48,539
beyond that all right that was kind of
 

35
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,779
beyond that all right that was kind of
anticlimactic

36
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:49,789
anticlimactic
 

37
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,279
anticlimactic
what is your guys's record have you gone

38
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:52,289
what is your guys's record have you gone
 

39
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,790
what is your guys's record have you gone
beyond five is it possible I think it is

40
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:55,800
beyond five is it possible I think it is
 

41
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,920
beyond five is it possible I think it is
but very unlikely so the plan for today

42
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:00,930
but very unlikely so the plan for today
 

43
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,110

guys we're gonna be working on slab city

44
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
guys we're gonna be working on slab city
 

45
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,750
guys we're gonna be working on slab city
some more here tried to figure out what

46
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
some more here tried to figure out what
 

47
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,950
some more here tried to figure out what
we're doing with it a little bit better

48
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
we're doing with it a little bit better
 

49
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,010
we're doing with it a little bit better
I just introduced the idea last time and

50
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,020
I just introduced the idea last time and
 

51
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,390
I just introduced the idea last time and
you guys seem to really enjoy it so

52
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,400
you guys seem to really enjoy it so
 

53
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,300
you guys seem to really enjoy it so
that's cool it's a simple idea but I

54
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,310
that's cool it's a simple idea but I
 

55
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,550
that's cool it's a simple idea but I
think it has a lot of potential looking

56
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
think it has a lot of potential looking
 

57
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,710
think it has a lot of potential looking
through the comments the main thing you

58
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
through the comments the main thing you
 

59
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,810
through the comments the main thing you
guys mention is oh I can't believe Ito

60
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:20,820
guys mention is oh I can't believe Ito
 

61
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,149
guys mention is oh I can't believe Ito
is working with with even numbers he's

62
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,159
is working with with even numbers he's
 

63
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,359
is working with with even numbers he's
crazy and I was doing that because I

64
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:26,369
crazy and I was doing that because I
 

65
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,080
crazy and I was doing that because I
wanted the these slabs or tiles or

66
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,090
wanted the these slabs or tiles or
 

67
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,490
wanted the these slabs or tiles or
whatever we're building here to align

68
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,500
whatever we're building here to align
 

69
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,740
whatever we're building here to align
with the chunk borders here I thought

70
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:33,750
with the chunk borders here I thought
 

71
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,120
with the chunk borders here I thought
that would be a cool thing and we never

72
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,130
that would be a cool thing and we never
 

73
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,399
that would be a cool thing and we never
build with even numbers it would be make

74
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:37,409
build with even numbers it would be make
 

75
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,499
build with even numbers it would be make
it look a little different cuz you use

76
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:39,509
it look a little different cuz you use
 

77
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,940
it look a little different cuz you use
different patterns and stuff when you

78
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:40,950
different patterns and stuff when you
 

79
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,179
different patterns and stuff when you
work with even numbers but you know I

80
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:44,189
work with even numbers but you know I
 

81
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,460
work with even numbers but you know I
thought about it more after you guys

82
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,470
thought about it more after you guys
 

83
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,039
thought about it more after you guys
mentioned it's like yeah I think we'll

84
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,049
mentioned it's like yeah I think we'll
 

85
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,740
mentioned it's like yeah I think we'll
switch over to odd because anytime you

86
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:51,750
switch over to odd because anytime you
 

87
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,499
switch over to odd because anytime you
do like technical stuff like with water

88
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:54,509
do like technical stuff like with water
 

89
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,209
do like technical stuff like with water
streams or minecart tracks or red stone

90
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:58,219
streams or minecart tracks or red stone
 

91
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,980
streams or minecart tracks or red stone
building with even is just terrible it

92
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:00,990
building with even is just terrible it
 

93
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,649
building with even is just terrible it
really is so I think it's a good idea to

94
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:03,659
really is so I think it's a good idea to
 

95
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,469
really is so I think it's a good idea to
change we're gonna go to 9 by 9 by 5

96
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
change we're gonna go to 9 by 9 by 5
 

97
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:14,069
change we're gonna go to 9 by 9 by 5
tiles instead of 8 by 4

98
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:14,079

 

99
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,309

aha

100
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,319
aha
 

101
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,949
aha
very good so it looks almost exactly the

102
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:17,959
very good so it looks almost exactly the
 

103
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,509
very good so it looks almost exactly the
same to what we had before but we have

104
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:19,519
same to what we had before but we have
 

105
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,910
same to what we had before but we have
switched over to odd numbers nine by

106
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
switched over to odd numbers nine by
 

107
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,789
switched over to odd numbers nine by
nine by five tiles but they share

108
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:24,799
nine by five tiles but they share
 

109
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,009
nine by five tiles but they share
borders with each other so for example

110
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:27,019
borders with each other so for example
 

111
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:29,319
borders with each other so for example
this this is the border with this style

112
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:29,329
this this is the border with this style
 

113
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,250
this this is the border with this style
but it's also the border of this style

114
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,260
but it's also the border of this style
 

115
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,750
but it's also the border of this style
so it's like nine by nine by five minus

116
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:34,760
so it's like nine by nine by five minus
 

117
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,780
so it's like nine by nine by five minus
one on all the dimensions so eight by

118
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:37,790
one on all the dimensions so eight by
 

119
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,949
one on all the dimensions so eight by
eight by four which is what we had

120
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
eight by four which is what we had
 

121
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,830
eight by four which is what we had
before so it's really no change except

122
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
before so it's really no change except
 

123
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,619
before so it's really no change except
we have odd numbers now does that make

124
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:44,629
we have odd numbers now does that make
 

125
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,089
we have odd numbers now does that make
sense sure it does makes total sense

126
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:48,099
sense sure it does makes total sense
 

127
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,559
sense sure it does makes total sense
uh-huh okay so what I want to do now

128
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:50,569
uh-huh okay so what I want to do now
 

129
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,270
uh-huh okay so what I want to do now
guys I want to start adding some details

130
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,280
guys I want to start adding some details
 

131
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,709
guys I want to start adding some details
to this maybe not to the point where

132
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:53,719
to this maybe not to the point where
 

133
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:59,379
to this maybe not to the point where
it's totally finished but so it looks a

134
00:02:59,379 --> 00:02:59,389
it's totally finished but so it looks a
 

135
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,699
it's totally finished but so it looks a
little bit better because right now it's

136
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:00,709
little bit better because right now it's
 

137
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,009
little bit better because right now it's
really plain and then we'll start doing

138
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:03,019
really plain and then we'll start doing
 

139
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,929
really plain and then we'll start doing
some other building here I'm gonna do

140
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:04,939
some other building here I'm gonna do
 

141
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,490
some other building here I'm gonna do
something I don't think we've ever done

142
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:06,500
something I don't think we've ever done
 

143
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,509
something I don't think we've ever done
in this series or at least I can't

144
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:10,519
in this series or at least I can't
 

145
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,009
in this series or at least I can't
recall any time I've done this we're

146
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:12,019
recall any time I've done this we're
 

147
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:16,979
recall any time I've done this we're
gonna use jungle planks oh my goodness

148
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:16,989
gonna use jungle planks oh my goodness
 

149
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,270
gonna use jungle planks oh my goodness
if you don't know I actually don't like

150
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
if you don't know I actually don't like
 

151
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,860
if you don't know I actually don't like
jungle planks but I'm starting to not

152
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:23,870
jungle planks but I'm starting to not
 

153
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,780
jungle planks but I'm starting to not
hate them as much I think I think we'll

154
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:25,790
hate them as much I think I think we'll
 

155
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,159
hate them as much I think I think we'll
try it with this bill just for some

156
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,169
try it with this bill just for some
 

157
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:32,860
try it with this bill just for some
variation and maybe let's do our ugly

158
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:32,870
variation and maybe let's do our ugly
 

159
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,030
variation and maybe let's do our ugly
brick thing over here instead because

160
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
brick thing over here instead because
 

161
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,770
brick thing over here instead because

240
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
sure oak is good cuz it matches the path
 

241
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,180
sure oak is good cuz it matches the path
block there and it'll go with a few

242
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,190
block there and it'll go with a few
 

243
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,770
block there and it'll go with a few
other blocks were using so I I kind of

244
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:41,780
other blocks were using so I I kind of
 

245
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,170
other blocks were using so I I kind of
like that right we could even mix in

246
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,180
like that right we could even mix in
 

247
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,379
like that right we could even mix in
some jungle wood with this alright so

some jungle wood with this alright so
 

249
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,909
some jungle wood with this alright so
check it out here we've added that some

250
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:48,919
check it out here we've added that some
 

251
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,490
check it out here we've added that some
details to our builds and I think it's

252
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:51,500
details to our builds and I think it's
 

253
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,200
details to our builds and I think it's
feeling a bit better I think it looks a

254
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,210
feeling a bit better I think it looks a
 

255
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,909
feeling a bit better I think it looks a
bit better now but it's not all the way

256
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
bit better now but it's not all the way
 

257
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,219
bit better now but it's not all the way
there is it at least that's my feeling I

258
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:00,229
there is it at least that's my feeling I
 

259
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,500
there is it at least that's my feeling I
feel like something's not quite right

260
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,510
feel like something's not quite right
 

261
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,800
feel like something's not quite right
with it but we're off to hopefully a

262
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:05,810
with it but we're off to hopefully a
 

263
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,820
with it but we're off to hopefully a
good start

264
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:06,830
good start
 

265
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,850
good start
so you see we've got the jungle wood

266
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:09,860
so you see we've got the jungle wood
 

267
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,740
so you see we've got the jungle wood
mixed in here I've added some coarse

268
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:11,750
mixed in here I've added some coarse
 

269
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,500
mixed in here I've added some coarse
dirt in places some brown concrete some

270
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,510
dirt in places some brown concrete some
 

271
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,190
dirt in places some brown concrete some
flowers and grass underneath here I

272
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,200
flowers and grass underneath here I
 

273
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,350
flowers and grass underneath here I
added a design with the slabs this feels

274
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
added a design with the slabs this feels
 

275
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,089
added a design with the slabs this feels
very plain up here still we should do

276
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:25,099
very plain up here still we should do
 

277
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,620
very plain up here still we should do
something with that maybe turn it into a

278
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:26,630
something with that maybe turn it into a
 

279
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,409
something with that maybe turn it into a
water tower with a pool of water you can

280
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:29,419
water tower with a pool of water you can
 

281
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:30,670
water tower with a pool of water you can
see at the top right now I think it's

282
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,680
see at the top right now I think it's
 

283
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,409
see at the top right now I think it's
still just grass there isn't it let's

284
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:32,419
still just grass there isn't it let's
 

285
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,290
still just grass there isn't it let's
double check

286
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:35,300

 

287
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,659

yeah so maybe we'll put like a pond in

288
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:37,669
yeah so maybe we'll put like a pond in
 

289
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:41,110
yeah so maybe we'll put like a pond in
the top there for a bit of variation - I

290
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
the top there for a bit of variation - I
 

291
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,850
the top there for a bit of variation - I
think that'd be cool whoops and made

292
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:45,860
think that'd be cool whoops and made
 

293
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,309
think that'd be cool whoops and made
sort of a a door thing here this is

294
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
sort of a a door thing here this is
 

295
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,710
sort of a a door thing here this is
gonna go into a building I think and

296
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720

 

297
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,570

yeah

298
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:54,580
yeah
 

299
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,089
yeah

automate it though I do want to try to

320
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
automate it though I do want to try to
 

321
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,309
automate it though I do want to try to
do something a little bit cool with it

322
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:27,319

 

323
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,920

observers you need observers so I'll try

324
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:29,930
observers you need observers so I'll try
 

325
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,290
observers you need observers so I'll try
show you the plan I want to be able to

326
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:32,300
show you the plan I want to be able to
 

327
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,580
show you the plan I want to be able to
plant the tree like right here have it

328
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:36,590
plant the tree like right here have it
 

329
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,140
plant the tree like right here have it
automatically grow and then push the

330
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,150
automatically grow and then push the
 

331
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,379
automatically grow and then push the
wood out of the hole up to this level

332
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:41,389
wood out of the hole up to this level
 

333
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,180
wood out of the hole up to this level
here kind of like we did in our our

334
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,190
here kind of like we did in our our
 

335
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,149
here kind of like we did in our our
Brown mushroom firm we built recently

336
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:45,159
Brown mushroom firm we built recently
 

337
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,070
Brown mushroom firm we built recently
although I did just design a new thing

338
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
although I did just design a new thing
 

339
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,170
although I did just design a new thing
for doing it so it's gonna be slightly

340
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,180
for doing it so it's gonna be slightly
 

341
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,689
for doing it so it's gonna be slightly
different because I couldn't remember

342
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:52,699
different because I couldn't remember
 

343
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,420
different because I couldn't remember
how I did that and I was too lazy to go

344
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,430
how I did that and I was too lazy to go
 

345
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,490
how I did that and I was too lazy to go
check okay so we're gonna have an

346
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:57,500
check okay so we're gonna have an
 

347
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,760
check okay so we're gonna have an
observer block check whenever the tree

348
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:00,770
observer block check whenever the tree
 

349
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,770
observer block check whenever the tree
is planted and then we want it to shoot

350
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:02,780
is planted and then we want it to shoot
 

351
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,230
is planted and then we want it to shoot
out bonemeal at the tree out of a

352
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,240
out bonemeal at the tree out of a
 

353
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,080
out bonemeal at the tree out of a
dispenser here so this will be full of

354
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,090
dispenser here so this will be full of
 

355
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,649
dispenser here so this will be full of
bone meal okay so I just ripped up the

356
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:11,659
bone meal okay so I just ripped up the
 

357
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,969
bone meal okay so I just ripped up the
ground here so I can show you how to do

358
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:12,979
ground here so I can show you how to do
 

359
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,170
ground here so I can show you how to do
the redstone for this real quick

360
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:14,180
the redstone for this real quick
 

361
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,480
the redstone for this real quick
hopefully first thing we're gonna do is

362
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,490
hopefully first thing we're gonna do is
 

363
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,059
hopefully first thing we're gonna do is
put a repeater here so now when we plant

364
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:19,069
put a repeater here so now when we plant
 

365
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,370
put a repeater here so now when we plant
the tree you can see it activates that

366
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:21,380
the tree you can see it activates that
 

367
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,860
the tree you can see it activates that
repeater and we want to send this a

368
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,870
repeater and we want to send this a
 

369
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,700
repeater and we want to send this a
bunch of pulses so first thing we'll do

370
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:27,710
bunch of pulses so first thing we'll do
 

371
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,809
bunch of pulses so first thing we'll do
is set up a a timer a long delay or

372
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:31,819
is set up a a timer a long delay or
 

373
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,899
is set up a a timer a long delay or
whatever so now and we wouldn't do this

374
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:33,909
whatever so now and we wouldn't do this
 

375
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,670
whatever so now and we wouldn't do this
you see it slowly fades out there so

376
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:36,680
you see it slowly fades out there so
 

377
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,889
you see it slowly fades out there so
it'll keep this comparator active for

378
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:38,899
it'll keep this comparator active for
 

379
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,709
it'll keep this comparator active for
quite a while and then we do a pulse

380
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:41,719
quite a while and then we do a pulse
 

381
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,890
quite a while and then we do a pulse
pulsar like this so signal goes around

382
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:44,900
pulsar like this so signal goes around
 

383
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,430
pulsar like this so signal goes around
and back to itself in subtract mode and

384
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
and back to itself in subtract mode and
 

385
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,030
and back to itself in subtract mode and
it'll send the pawl

386
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
it'll send the pawl
 

387
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,019
it'll send the pawl
- this constantly so now all right so

388
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:56,029
- this constantly so now all right so
 

389
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,259
- this constantly so now all right so
that'll be our tree growth system very

390
00:08:59,259 --> 00:08:59,269
that'll be our tree growth system very
 

391
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,910
that'll be our tree growth system very
good all right so the next thing we want

392
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:00,920
good all right so the next thing we want
 

393
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,620
good all right so the next thing we want
to add is some way of pushing the wood

394
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:02,630
to add is some way of pushing the wood
 

395
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,569
to add is some way of pushing the wood
blocks out of the hole here because

396
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:04,579
blocks out of the hole here because
 

397
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,009
blocks out of the hole here because
after the tree grows there's gonna be

398
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:06,019
after the tree grows there's gonna be
 

399
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,860
after the tree grows there's gonna be
two logs in there and like if you go

400
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:08,870
two logs in there and like if you go
 

401
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,819
two logs in there and like if you go
chop them down

402
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:09,829
chop them down
 

403
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:13,269
chop them down
guess what you're stuck down here so as

404
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
guess what you're stuck down here so as
 

405
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,670
guess what you're stuck down here so as
a little convenience thing we'll try to

406
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
a little convenience thing we'll try to
 

407
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,410
a little convenience thing we'll try to
push him out with the double extender

408
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:17,420
push him out with the double extender
 

409
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,999
push him out with the double extender
that goes upwards right the reason we're

410
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:22,009
that goes upwards right the reason we're
 

411
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:26,530
that goes upwards right the reason we're
going to blocks down though is like if

412
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:26,540
going to blocks down though is like if
 

413
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,210
going to blocks down though is like if
we were to try to screw the trees on the

414
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:28,220
we were to try to screw the trees on the
 

415
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,210
we were to try to screw the trees on the
surface you have to have the dispenser

416
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,220
surface you have to have the dispenser
 

417
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,499
surface you have to have the dispenser
next to it like that right and it's

418
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:32,509
next to it like that right and it's
 

419
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,809
next to it like that right and it's
gonna be sticking out of the ground plus

420
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:34,819
gonna be sticking out of the ground plus
 

421
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:37,269
gonna be sticking out of the ground plus
you need all the redstone to do the

422
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
you need all the redstone to do the
 

423
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,400
you need all the redstone to do the
tricks so that's gonna be on the surface

424
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,410
tricks so that's gonna be on the surface
 

425
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,889
tricks so that's gonna be on the surface
- and by putting it two blocks down we

426
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:41,899
- and by putting it two blocks down we
 

427
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:43,840
- and by putting it two blocks down we
can hide everything and try to make it

428
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:43,850
can hide everything and try to make it
 

429
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,300
can hide everything and try to make it
look nice even if you do it like this

430
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,310
look nice even if you do it like this
 

431
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,720
look nice even if you do it like this
where you have the dispenser facing up

432
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:48,730
where you have the dispenser facing up
 

433
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,439
where you have the dispenser facing up
to a tree like that that has bonemeal in

434
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:52,449
to a tree like that that has bonemeal in
 

435
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,269
to a tree like that that has bonemeal in
it doesn't hit the sapling it hits the

436
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
it doesn't hit the sapling it hits the
 

437
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,129
it doesn't hit the sapling it hits the
dirt block so that won't grow the tree

438
00:09:59,129 --> 00:09:59,139
dirt block so that won't grow the tree
 

439
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,870
dirt block so that won't grow the tree
otherwise you could hide it underground

440
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:01,880
otherwise you could hide it underground
 

441
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,840
otherwise you could hide it underground
pretty easy but unfortunately that's not

442
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:04,850
pretty easy but unfortunately that's not
 

443
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,660
pretty easy but unfortunately that's not
the case if you have a grass block here

444
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:06,670
the case if you have a grass block here
 

445
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,840
the case if you have a grass block here
it tries to bonemeal the grass so you

446
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:10,850
it tries to bonemeal the grass so you
 

447
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,730
it tries to bonemeal the grass so you
get the sparkles but it won't grow the

448
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:12,740
get the sparkles but it won't grow the
 

449
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,620
get the sparkles but it won't grow the
tree either aha nothing happens anyways

450
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:17,630
tree either aha nothing happens anyways
 

451
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,500
tree either aha nothing happens anyways
let's get to it here so I prep the area

452
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:20,510
let's get to it here so I prep the area
 

453
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,050
let's get to it here so I prep the area
here again for our double extender or

454
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,060
here again for our double extender or
 

455
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,870
here again for our double extender or
vertical the extender and what we got to

456
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:25,880
vertical the extender and what we got to
 

457
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,480
vertical the extender and what we got to
do this is the block that the sapling

458
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,490
do this is the block that the sapling
 

459
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,720
do this is the block that the sapling
grows on so we want to get two sticky

460
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:31,730
grows on so we want to get two sticky
 

461
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,490
grows on so we want to get two sticky
pistons facing up under it's like a sow

462
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:36,500
pistons facing up under it's like a sow
 

463
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,990
pistons facing up under it's like a sow
and now we've got to activate them in

464
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
and now we've got to activate them in
 

465
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,800
and now we've got to activate them in
the right sequence so the trick is to

466
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:41,810
the right sequence so the trick is to
 

467
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,980
the right sequence so the trick is to
put a block there next to the dirt block

468
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:44,990
put a block there next to the dirt block
 

469
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,530
put a block there next to the dirt block
got a block there and and then what I

470
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,540
got a block there and and then what I
 

471
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,290
got a block there and and then what I
think a regular piston goes there

472
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,300
think a regular piston goes there
 

473
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,860
think a regular piston goes there
an observer facing the other way we want

474
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:56,870
an observer facing the other way we want
 

475
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,960
an observer facing the other way we want
the observer to get activated by the

476
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:58,970
the observer to get activated by the
 

477
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,999
the observer to get activated by the
piston arm extending

478
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:03,009

 

479
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,110

it's really hard to place in the way you

480
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
it's really hard to place in the way you
 

481
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,410
it's really hard to place in the way you
want sometimes okay so this is the site

482
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:08,420
want sometimes okay so this is the site
 

483
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,569
want sometimes okay so this is the site
that detects its so when the piston arm

484
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:10,579
that detects its so when the piston arm
 

485
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,090
that detects its so when the piston arm
goes up this detects it sends power to

486
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,100
goes up this detects it sends power to
 

487
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,710
goes up this detects it sends power to
that and that'll activate this piston

488
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
that and that'll activate this piston
 

489
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,040
that and that'll activate this piston
when it's up here makes sense yes it

490
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,050
when it's up here makes sense yes it
 

491
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,910
when it's up here makes sense yes it
does okay now to activate this in the

492
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
does okay now to activate this in the
 

493
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,429
does okay now to activate this in the
right sequence we set this to four and

494
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:26,439
right sequence we set this to four and
 

495
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:31,090
right sequence we set this to four and
then we do a branching path so I think

496
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,100
then we do a branching path so I think
 

497
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,819
then we do a branching path so I think
for for this one and thirteen ticks on

498
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:33,829
for for this one and thirteen ticks on
 

499
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:38,860
for for this one and thirteen ticks on
this side so that's four repeaters we'll

500
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:38,870
this side so that's four repeaters we'll
 

501
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,069
this side so that's four repeaters we'll
leave one at one and do that so if we

502
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
leave one at one and do that so if we
 

503
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,069
leave one at one and do that so if we
send a pulse to the wire here it'll make

504
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:45,079
send a pulse to the wire here it'll make
 

505
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,869
send a pulse to the wire here it'll make
the block go up and then make it come

506
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:46,879
the block go up and then make it come
 

507
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,319
the block go up and then make it come
down it activates it twice let's try it

508
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:50,329
down it activates it twice let's try it
 

509
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:57,759
down it activates it twice let's try it
out Oh observer okay let's let's check

510
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:57,769
out Oh observer okay let's let's check
 

511
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,840
out Oh observer okay let's let's check
it out again that's like as fast as you

512
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:01,850
it out again that's like as fast as you
 

513
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,320
it out again that's like as fast as you
can do it with this

514
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,330
can do it with this
 

515
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,120
can do it with this
so we still got one last thing we got to

516
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,130
so we still got one last thing we got to
 

517
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,560
so we still got one last thing we got to
do with our design here we have to

518
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,570
do with our design here we have to
 

519
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,040
do with our design here we have to
detect when the tree grows over here and

520
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,050
detect when the tree grows over here and
 

521
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,650
detect when the tree grows over here and
then tell that double extender to

522
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:14,660
then tell that double extender to
 

523
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,430
then tell that double extender to
activate basically we could check using

524
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:18,440
activate basically we could check using
 

525
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,020
activate basically we could check using
this observer like when the sapling

526
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,030
this observer like when the sapling
 

527
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,050
this observer like when the sapling
turns into a wood logs and cause

528
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,060
turns into a wood logs and cause
 

529
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,880
turns into a wood logs and cause
something to happen but that's actually

530
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:24,890
something to happen but that's actually
 

531
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,770
something to happen but that's actually
really difficult to do it gets really

532
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:26,780
really difficult to do it gets really
 

533
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,720
really difficult to do it gets really
complicated so we're gonna do it the

534
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:28,730
complicated so we're gonna do it the
 

535
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,280
complicated so we're gonna do it the
old-fashioned way where we're just gonna

536
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,290
old-fashioned way where we're just gonna
 

537
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,100
old-fashioned way where we're just gonna
set up a second thing here that goes

538
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,110
set up a second thing here that goes
 

539
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,790
set up a second thing here that goes
like this and we keep this powered so

540
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
like this and we keep this powered so
 

541
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,830
like this and we keep this powered so
that when the log appears over here when

542
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:38,840
that when the log appears over here when
 

543
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,950
that when the log appears over here when
the sapling turns into a log then the

544
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:41,960
the sapling turns into a log then the
 

545
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,990
the sapling turns into a log then the
signal can pass through and then from

546
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
signal can pass through and then from
 

547
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,910
signal can pass through and then from
here we tell to go to that extender

548
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
here we tell to go to that extender
 

549
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,160
here we tell to go to that extender
basically the problem is if we do that

550
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,170
basically the problem is if we do that
 

551
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,230
basically the problem is if we do that
we run into another problem those double

552
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,240
we run into another problem those double
 

553
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,420
we run into another problem those double
that double extender they're the piston

554
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:55,430
that double extender they're the piston
 

555
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,210
that double extender they're the piston
comes up to here and then this for Peter

556
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,220
comes up to here and then this for Peter
 

557
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,580
comes up to here and then this for Peter
powers it so it prevents it from being

558
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:00,590
powers it so it prevents it from being
 

559
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,680
powers it so it prevents it from being
able to retract so we have two unpowered

560
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:02,690
able to retract so we have two unpowered
 

561
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,730
able to retract so we have two unpowered
as' at the right time too in order for

562
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:06,740
as' at the right time too in order for
 

563
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,700
as' at the right time too in order for
that thing not to jam so this gets a

564
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:09,710
that thing not to jam so this gets a
 

565
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,830
that thing not to jam so this gets a
little bit more complicated because of

566
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:11,840
little bit more complicated because of
 

567
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,130
little bit more complicated because of
that we have to add an RS nor latch here

568
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,140
that we have to add an RS nor latch here
 

569
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,050
that we have to add an RS nor latch here
so piston piston here and basically they

570
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,060
so piston piston here and basically they
 

571
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,480
so piston piston here and basically they
when this pushes the block over this

572
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,490
when this pushes the block over this
 

573
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,000
when this pushes the block over this
gets unpowered and then we just got a

574
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,010
gets unpowered and then we just got a
 

575
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,890
gets unpowered and then we just got a
time it just writes so the timing is for

576
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:28,900
time it just writes so the timing is for
 

577
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,450
time it just writes so the timing is for
set that to four and then we need four

578
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:31,460
set that to four and then we need four
 

579
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,410
set that to four and then we need four
repeaters set it for here

580
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:34,420
repeaters set it for here
 

581
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,200
repeaters set it for here
okay and that keeps a count of like how

582
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,210
okay and that keeps a count of like how
 

583
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,850
okay and that keeps a count of like how
long it takes the double extender to

584
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:39,860
long it takes the double extender to
 

585
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,600
long it takes the double extender to
extend and retract basically next thing

586
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:43,610
extend and retract basically next thing
 

587
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,490
extend and retract basically next thing
we got to do you see we got a trapdoor

588
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:45,500
we got to do you see we got a trapdoor
 

589
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,520
we got to do you see we got a trapdoor
down here like we saw before if we send

590
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:48,530
down here like we saw before if we send
 

591
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,350
down here like we saw before if we send
this a pulse that activates this twice

592
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,360
this a pulse that activates this twice
 

593
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,790
this a pulse that activates this twice
and

594
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:53,800

 

595
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,489

oh and then where is it cuz of that

596
00:13:59,489 --> 00:13:59,499
oh and then where is it cuz of that
 

597
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:07,079
oh and then where is it cuz of that
thing did that mess it up oh whoa oh

598
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:07,089
thing did that mess it up oh whoa oh
 

599
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:17,009
thing did that mess it up oh whoa oh
yeah work that time hmm well basically

600
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:17,019
yeah work that time hmm well basically
 

601
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,389
yeah work that time hmm well basically
from this we're supposed to branch down

602
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
from this we're supposed to branch down
 

603
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,009
from this we're supposed to branch down
to here and I don't know why that didn't

604
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:23,019
to here and I don't know why that didn't
 

605
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,979
to here and I don't know why that didn't
work actually let's just see what

606
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:25,989
work actually let's just see what
 

607
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:30,629
work actually let's just see what
happens if we put a log there oh good

608
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
happens if we put a log there oh good
 

609
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,650
happens if we put a log there oh good
that was good that's what's supposed to

610
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:31,660
that was good that's what's supposed to
 

611
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:40,429
that was good that's what's supposed to
do okay looks good okay we might be fine

612
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:40,439
do okay looks good okay we might be fine
 

613
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:43,019
do okay looks good okay we might be fine
let's give it a test test run here so

614
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:43,029
let's give it a test test run here so
 

615
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:49,049
let's give it a test test run here so
we're gonna plant a sapling yeah I think

616
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:49,059
we're gonna plant a sapling yeah I think
 

617
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:49,949
we're gonna plant a sapling yeah I think
we're good to go

618
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:49,959
we're good to go
 

619
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,470
we're good to go
okay there we go so I copied our design

620
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
okay there we go so I copied our design
 

621
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,759
okay there we go so I copied our design
three more times here we're gonna have

622
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:53,769
three more times here we're gonna have
 

623
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,269
three more times here we're gonna have
four trees in total and the reason for

624
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
four trees in total and the reason for
 

625
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,220
four trees in total and the reason for
that is just because we have no way of

626
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,230
that is just because we have no way of
 

627
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,199
that is just because we have no way of
clearing the leaves with her or gizmo

628
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:01,209
clearing the leaves with her or gizmo
 

629
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,869
clearing the leaves with her or gizmo
here so they have to de-spawn naturally

630
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:03,879
here so they have to de-spawn naturally
 

631
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,109
here so they have to de-spawn naturally
which which takes a bit of time right if

632
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:07,119
which which takes a bit of time right if
 

633
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,549
which which takes a bit of time right if
you're just doing one tree at a time

634
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:08,559
you're just doing one tree at a time
 

635
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,239
you're just doing one tree at a time
waiting for two despawn it's not really

636
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:12,249
waiting for two despawn it's not really
 

637
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:15,840
waiting for two despawn it's not really
you're not gonna use it even for is kind

638
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:15,850
you're not gonna use it even for is kind
 

639
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,410
you're not gonna use it even for is kind
of on the low side but it's something

640
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:18,420
of on the low side but it's something
 

641
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,119
of on the low side but it's something
well we got it covered over here so

642
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:21,129
well we got it covered over here so
 

643
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,650
well we got it covered over here so
we're gonna do our first real test with

644
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:22,660
we're gonna do our first real test with
 

645
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,840
we're gonna do our first real test with
this now we find out if it's actually

646
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:24,850
this now we find out if it's actually
 

647
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,239
this now we find out if it's actually
practical or not you can design

648
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:27,249
practical or not you can design
 

649
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,499
practical or not you can design
something and then when you got to use

650
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:28,509
something and then when you got to use
 

651
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:32,299
something and then when you got to use
this like well that's cool but no no

652
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:32,309
this like well that's cool but no no
 

653
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:34,049
this like well that's cool but no no
we'll try it with the different

654
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:34,059
we'll try it with the different
 

655
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,119
we'll try it with the different
different trees here - so spruce works

656
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:36,129
different trees here - so spruce works
 

657
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:41,030
different trees here - so spruce works
oh it did stop okay good whoo

658
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
oh it did stop okay good whoo
 

659
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,619
oh it did stop okay good whoo
acacia might be a troublesome one that

660
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:43,629
acacia might be a troublesome one that
 

661
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:46,949
acacia might be a troublesome one that
looks dying okay I think we tried oak

662
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
looks dying okay I think we tried oak
 

663
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,900
looks dying okay I think we tried oak
already birch trees Oh

664
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:52,910

 

665
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,829

purchase good and jungle trees so we

666
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:56,839
purchase good and jungle trees so we
 

667
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,600
purchase good and jungle trees so we
can't do dark oak with this that's the

668
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:58,610
can't do dark oak with this that's the
 

669
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,180
can't do dark oak with this that's the
only limitation but this is something I

670
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,190
only limitation but this is something I
 

671
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,710
only limitation but this is something I
wanted for our base to just having a

672
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
wanted for our base to just having a
 

673
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,600
wanted for our base to just having a
nice open field here so if we want to

674
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:04,610
nice open field here so if we want to
 

675
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,480
nice open field here so if we want to
plant two by two trees we have a place

676
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,490
plant two by two trees we have a place
 

677
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,329
plant two by two trees we have a place
to grow it's you know because a lot of

678
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:10,339
to grow it's you know because a lot of
 

679
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:12,150
to grow it's you know because a lot of
our base is gonna be these little 9x9

680
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
our base is gonna be these little 9x9
 

681
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,759
our base is gonna be these little 9x9
areas and this is a like two of them to

682
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:15,769
areas and this is a like two of them to
 

683
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,400
areas and this is a like two of them to
buy two of them right we've got quite a

684
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,410
buy two of them right we've got quite a
 

685
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,490
buy two of them right we've got quite a
bit more space so we chop it down and

686
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:21,500
bit more space so we chop it down and
 

687
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,259
bit more space so we chop it down and
you see we don't have to go down there

688
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:23,269
you see we don't have to go down there
 

689
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:27,100
you see we don't have to go down there
to get the wood we might want to put a

690
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,110
to get the wood we might want to put a
 

691
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,860
to get the wood we might want to put a
block over top or some glass so that we

692
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:29,870
block over top or some glass so that we
 

693
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,090
block over top or some glass so that we
can reach it all yeah cuz I don't really

694
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,100
can reach it all yeah cuz I don't really
 

695
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,970
can reach it all yeah cuz I don't really
like that and having to Pillar up to the

696
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:36,980
like that and having to Pillar up to the
 

697
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,879
like that and having to Pillar up to the
gravit right so I was thinking of

698
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:39,889
gravit right so I was thinking of
 

699
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:41,590
gravit right so I was thinking of
something here I don't I don't really

700
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
something here I don't I don't really
 

701
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,180
something here I don't I don't really
like this having a chest with the

702
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,190
like this having a chest with the
 

703
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,800
like this having a chest with the
saplings in because you got to go over

704
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:44,810
saplings in because you got to go over
 

705
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,840
saplings in because you got to go over
here and grab for however many you're

706
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:46,850
here and grab for however many you're
 

707
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,870
here and grab for however many you're
gonna plant and then like put them back

708
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:49,880
gonna plant and then like put them back
 

709
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,019
gonna plant and then like put them back
and what I would like is some way of

710
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:53,029
and what I would like is some way of
 

711
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,960
and what I would like is some way of
dispensing for saplings at a time for

712
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:55,970
dispensing for saplings at a time for
 

713
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,780
dispensing for saplings at a time for
whichever one we choose so we're gonna

714
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:58,790
whichever one we choose so we're gonna
 

715
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,120
whichever one we choose so we're gonna
put put a device over here for doing

716
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,130
put put a device over here for doing
 

717
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,790
put put a device over here for doing
that I just figured out how to do it is

718
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:03,800
that I just figured out how to do it is
 

719
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,159
that I just figured out how to do it is
this is one of the jane kiaus Treadstone

720
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,169
this is one of the jane kiaus Treadstone
 

721
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,100
this is one of the jane kiaus Treadstone
jobs I've ever done but it works it's

722
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,110
jobs I've ever done but it works it's
 

723
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,610
jobs I've ever done but it works it's
like really weird the way I got this

724
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:12,620
like really weird the way I got this
 

725
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,230
like really weird the way I got this
thing to to work so I think we will go

726
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,240
thing to to work so I think we will go
 

727
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,850
thing to to work so I think we will go
in a little bit here just so it's not

728
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:18,860
in a little bit here just so it's not
 

729
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,899
in a little bit here just so it's not
totally flat walls either you know and

730
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:21,909
totally flat walls either you know and
 

731
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:24,250
totally flat walls either you know and
I'm gonna use dark oak for now but it'll

732
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,260
I'm gonna use dark oak for now but it'll
 

733
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,510
I'm gonna use dark oak for now but it'll
probably change this to something else

734
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
probably change this to something else
 

735
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,070
probably change this to something else
later but this is our shape like this

736
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
later but this is our shape like this
 

737
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,110
later but this is our shape like this
and then we're gonna have six dispensers

738
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,120
and then we're gonna have six dispensers
 

739
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,409
and then we're gonna have six dispensers
for the six different types of trees or

740
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:34,419
for the six different types of trees or
 

741
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:41,529
for the six different types of trees or
droppers I mean over here and then we'll

742
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:41,539
droppers I mean over here and then we'll
 

743
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:44,140
droppers I mean over here and then we'll
do it like this where we have some stone

744
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,150
do it like this where we have some stone
 

745
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:50,470
do it like this where we have some stone
brick or some other block down here like

746
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
brick or some other block down here like
 

747
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,730
brick or some other block down here like
so and then let's grab six buttons and

748
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:54,740
so and then let's grab six buttons and
 

749
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,789
so and then let's grab six buttons and
we'll align them over here so basically

750
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
we'll align them over here so basically
 

751
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,899
we'll align them over here so basically
press the button here we get four

752
00:17:58,899 --> 00:17:58,909
press the button here we get four
 

753
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:00,700
press the button here we get four
saplings for whatever tree goes there

754
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:00,710
saplings for whatever tree goes there
 

755
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,360
saplings for whatever tree goes there
okay oh you know what guys as we do this

756
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,370
okay oh you know what guys as we do this
 

757
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,190
okay oh you know what guys as we do this
I got a story I could tell you two today

758
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,200

773
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,370
in general I've I'm in decent shape but
which one are we missing dark oak let's

774
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:30,380
which one are we missing dark oak let's
 

775
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,100
which one are we missing dark oak let's
go up there I'm in decent shape but over

776
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,110
go up there I'm in decent shape but over
 

777
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,419
go up there I'm in decent shape but over
the years I've been getting worse and

778
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:34,429
the years I've been getting worse and
 

779
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,430
the years I've been getting worse and
worse shape to be honest like I used to

780
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:36,440
worse shape to be honest like I used to
 

781
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,820
worse shape to be honest like I used to
play sports I used to do tennis and and

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,320
wasn't really sure what kind of results
I would get so just to give you an

948
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,330
I would get so just to give you an
 

949
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,780
I would get so just to give you an
example from my own experience here the

950
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:41,790
example from my own experience here the
 

951
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,820
example from my own experience here the
one exercise I've been doing the most in

952
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:43,830
one exercise I've been doing the most in
 

953
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,910
one exercise I've been doing the most in
this last month is sit-ups like I'll do

954
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:46,920
this last month is sit-ups like I'll do
 

955
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,650
this last month is sit-ups like I'll do
sit-ups and then I'll take a day or two

956
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:48,660
sit-ups and then I'll take a day or two
 

957
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,850
sit-ups and then I'll take a day or two
break from it and then I'll do them

958
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:49,860
break from it and then I'll do them
 

959
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,470
break from it and then I'll do them
again because you're supposed to give

960
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:51,480
again because you're supposed to give
 

961
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,720
again because you're supposed to give
your muscles time to recover I don't

962
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:53,730
your muscles time to recover I don't
 

963
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,740
your muscles time to recover I don't
know how long it you're actually

964
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:54,750
know how long it you're actually
 

965
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,960
know how long it you're actually
supposed to I don't know much about

966
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:55,970
supposed to I don't know much about
 

967
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,030
supposed to I don't know much about
exercising but I've just been doing it

968
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,040
exercising but I've just been doing it
 

969
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,070
exercising but I've just been doing it
like every second or third day basically

970
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,080
like every second or third day basically
 

971
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,820
like every second or third day basically
and that seems to be working out we got

972
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:04,830
and that seems to be working out we got
 

973
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,950
and that seems to be working out we got
four but like I said I could only view

974
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:09,960
four but like I said I could only view
 

975
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,370
four but like I said I could only view
about ten the first time and after about

976
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:13,380
about ten the first time and after about
 

977
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,919
about ten the first time and after about
a month I can do it 80 like in one shot

978
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:15,929
a month I can do it 80 like in one shot
 

979
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,130
a month I can do it 80 like in one shot
or one set or whatever they're called so

980
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,140
or one set or whatever they're called so
 

981
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,230
or one set or whatever they're called so
in a way it's almost like I'm eight

982
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,240
in a way it's almost like I'm eight
 

983
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,870
in a way it's almost like I'm eight
times stronger within a month just by

984
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:23,880
times stronger within a month just by
 

985
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,870
times stronger within a month just by
exercising that muscle so that is pretty

986
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
exercising that muscle so that is pretty
 

987
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,090
exercising that muscle so that is pretty
significant if you ask me what was that

988
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,100
significant if you ask me what was that
 

989
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,520
significant if you ask me what was that
sound is that a new cave sound I've

990
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:37,530
sound is that a new cave sound I've
 

991
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,600
sound is that a new cave sound I've
never heard that before

992
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:38,610
never heard that before
 

993
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,060
never heard that before
I think cuz I've updated I have the new

994
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,070
I think cuz I've updated I have the new
 

995
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:47,090
I think cuz I've updated I have the new
sounds but I'm still on the old 1.12 but

996
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,100
sounds but I'm still on the old 1.12 but
 

997
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,130
sounds but I'm still on the old 1.12 but
yeah anyways this is something I'm

998
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:49,140
yeah anyways this is something I'm
 

999
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,630
yeah anyways this is something I'm
excited about right now so I thought I'd

1000
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
excited about right now so I thought I'd
 

1001
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,250
excited about right now so I thought I'd
share my experience with you just in

1002
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:52,260
share my experience with you just in
 

1003
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,130
share my experience with you just in
case it encourages you definitely

1004
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,140
case it encourages you definitely
 

1005
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,330
case it encourages you definitely
nothing bad about exercising but let's

1006
00:23:59,330 --> 00:23:59,340
nothing bad about exercising but let's
 

1007
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,430
nothing bad about exercising but let's
get back to this so those redstone

1008
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
get back to this so those redstone
 

1009
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,710
get back to this so those redstone
torches lock all these droppers so you

1010
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:03,720
torches lock all these droppers so you
 

1011
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,290
torches lock all these droppers so you
can see even if I send them a signal

1012
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:05,300
can see even if I send them a signal
 

1013
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,790
can see even if I send them a signal
doesn't shoot anything out it's only

1014
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:07,800
doesn't shoot anything out it's only
 

1015
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,760
doesn't shoot anything out it's only
when we press the button it unlocks the

1016
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:10,770
when we press the button it unlocks the
 

1017
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,650
when we press the button it unlocks the
dropper turns the redstone torch off and

1018
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:12,660
dropper turns the redstone torch off and
 

1019
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,960
dropper turns the redstone torch off and
then we send it four pulses and we get

1020
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:17,970
then we send it four pulses and we get
 

1021
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,660
then we send it four pulses and we get
forced saplings pretty simple so yeah

1022
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,670
forced saplings pretty simple so yeah
 

1023
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,250
forced saplings pretty simple so yeah
like all of these receive the four

1024
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,260
like all of these receive the four
 

1025
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,500
like all of these receive the four
pulses all all six of these droppers but

1026
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,510
pulses all all six of these droppers but
 

1027
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,180
pulses all all six of these droppers but
only the one that's unlocked will

1028
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,190
only the one that's unlocked will
 

1029
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,720
only the one that's unlocked will
actually shoot the items out and in

1030
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:29,730
actually shoot the items out and in
 

1031
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,060
actually shoot the items out and in
order to get four pulses we have to run

1032
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,070
order to get four pulses we have to run
 

1033
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,980
order to get four pulses we have to run
this extra set of observers in the back

1034
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:33,990
this extra set of observers in the back
 

1035
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,450
this extra set of observers in the back
there which we trigger with a trapdoor

1036
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:37,460
there which we trigger with a trapdoor
 

1037
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,030
there which we trigger with a trapdoor
so we have a lot of decorating and stuff

1038
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,040
so we have a lot of decorating and stuff
 

1039
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,780
so we have a lot of decorating and stuff
to do around here still

1040
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:43,790
to do around here still
 

1041
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,670
to do around here still
writing this I don't know it's better

1042
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:48,680
writing this I don't know it's better
 

1043
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,010
writing this I don't know it's better
right uh maybe you should put clay here

1044
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:51,020
right uh maybe you should put clay here
 

1045
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,260
right uh maybe you should put clay here
instead of wood it would make more sense

1046
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,270
instead of wood it would make more sense
 

1047
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,560
instead of wood it would make more sense
baby I don't know we got a lot of stuff

1048
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:56,570
baby I don't know we got a lot of stuff
 

1049
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,670
baby I don't know we got a lot of stuff
to do though let me know what you think

1050
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:57,680
to do though let me know what you think
 

1051
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,160
to do though let me know what you think
about this part of its like is this a

1052
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,170
about this part of its like is this a
 

1053
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,130
about this part of its like is this a
good or should we change it I don't know

1054
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:03,140
good or should we change it I don't know
 

1055
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,840
good or should we change it I don't know
today was more of a technical day

1056
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:04,850
today was more of a technical day
 

1057
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,310
today was more of a technical day
because that was what I was in the mood

1058
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
because that was what I was in the mood
 

1059
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,330
because that was what I was in the mood
for

1060
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:07,340
for
 

1061
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,730
for
we still need to decorate this I'm gonna

1062
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:09,740
we still need to decorate this I'm gonna
 

1063
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,620
we still need to decorate this I'm gonna
just put a border around it I think

1064
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:11,630
just put a border around it I think
 

1065
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:16,210
just put a border around it I think
that's definitely an improvement it's

1066
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:16,220
that's definitely an improvement it's
 

1067
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,610
that's definitely an improvement it's
important we do technical stuff though

1068
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:18,620
important we do technical stuff though
 

1069
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,830
important we do technical stuff though
and actually build farms with the space

1070
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:20,840
and actually build farms with the space
 

1071
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,720
and actually build farms with the space
otherwise we're not gonna come here and

1072
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:22,730
otherwise we're not gonna come here and
 

1073
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,050
otherwise we're not gonna come here and
and use it right and it's not gonna have

1074
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,060
and use it right and it's not gonna have
 

1075
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,880
and use it right and it's not gonna have
much character if it doesn't have unique

1076
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:27,890
much character if it doesn't have unique
 

1077
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,070
much character if it doesn't have unique
farms like this is something we don't

1078
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
farms like this is something we don't
 

1079
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,900
farms like this is something we don't
have built anywhere else in the world so

1080
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:31,910
have built anywhere else in the world so
 

1081
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,130
have built anywhere else in the world so
it's kind of cool all right that feels a

1082
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,140
it's kind of cool all right that feels a
 

1083
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,760
it's kind of cool all right that feels a
little bit better this is ugly though

1084
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:38,770
little bit better this is ugly though
 

1085
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,060
little bit better this is ugly though
what do we do about this we save it for

1086
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,070
what do we do about this we save it for
 

1087
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,370
what do we do about this we save it for
another day because that is the ephah

1088
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:45,380
another day because that is the ephah
 

1089

another day because that is the ephah
way all right guys I think we're gonna

1090
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:47,930
way all right guys I think we're gonna
 

1091
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,690
way all right guys I think we're gonna
wrap up here for today actually so

1092
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:49,700
wrap up here for today actually so
 

1093
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,790

here's the comment of the day it says I

1094
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:51,800
here's the comment of the day it says I
 

1095
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,000
here's the comment of the day it says I
am loving this new base idea as someone

1096
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,010
am loving this new base idea as someone
 

1097
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,190
am loving this new base idea as someone
who really enjoys modular design like

1098
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
who really enjoys modular design like
 

1099
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,490
who really enjoys modular design like
this I think it's great how it will look

1100
00:25:59,490 --> 00:25:59,500
this I think it's great how it will look
 

1101
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,280
