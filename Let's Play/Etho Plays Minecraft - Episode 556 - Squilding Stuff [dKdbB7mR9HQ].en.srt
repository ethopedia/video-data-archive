we're gonna get all snooty here as we
 

13
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,109
we're gonna get all snooty here as we
stare down on the world with our judging

stare down on the world with our judging
 

15
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,109
stare down on the world with our judging
eyes and let's determine

16
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
eyes and let's determine
 

17
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,710
eyes and let's determine
once and for all what the 16 best log

18
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
once and for all what the 16 best log
 

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,509
once and for all what the 16 best log
textures are

20
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
textures are
 

21
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,189
textures are
i'm curious how my opinions are going to

22
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
i'm curious how my opinions are going to
 

23
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,029
i'm curious how my opinions are going to
line up with your opinions on this

24
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
line up with your opinions on this
 

25
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,710
line up with your opinions on this
obviously my opinions are just straight

26
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
obviously my opinions are just straight
 

27
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,550
obviously my opinions are just straight
facts though so i'm never wrong but uh

28
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
facts though so i'm never wrong but uh
 

29
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,870
facts though so i'm never wrong but uh
yeah

30
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
yeah
 

31
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,110
yeah
it should be interesting let's pick them

32
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
it should be interesting let's pick them
 

33
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
it should be interesting let's pick them
up and let's put them down in the right

34
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
up and let's put them down in the right
 

35
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,590
up and let's put them down in the right
order

36
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
order
 

37
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,350
order
all right here we go we're gonna arrange

38
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
all right here we go we're gonna arrange
 

39
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,670
all right here we go we're gonna arrange
them from least useful to most useful

40
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
them from least useful to most useful
 

41
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,630
them from least useful to most useful
and hopefully

42
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
and hopefully
 

43
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,350
and hopefully
nobody disputes my first choice here i'm

the birch logs i've never once been able
 

49
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,069

83
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,310
this one just kind of stands out to me
and usually i want to build something

that looks pleasing
all right next we got the spruce log

88
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
all right next we got the spruce log
 

89
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,429
all right next we got the spruce log
surprise surprise you would you might

90
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
surprise surprise you would you might
 

91
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,630
surprise surprise you would you might
think that would be at the top of the

92
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
think that would be at the top of the
 

93
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,990
think that would be at the top of the
list no no no

94
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
list no no no
 

95
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,310
list no no no
i find spruce logs are kind of like the

96
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
i find spruce logs are kind of like the
 

97
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,749
i find spruce logs are kind of like the
younger brother to

98
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
younger brother to
 

99
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,990
younger brother to
dark oak anytime i use spruce in a build

100
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
dark oak anytime i use spruce in a build
 

101
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,510
dark oak anytime i use spruce in a build
it's like i should just use dark oak it

102
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
it's like i should just use dark oak it
 

103
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,630
it's like i should just use dark oak it
would look better

104
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
would look better
 

105
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,030
would look better
and that's why it's more towards the

106
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
and that's why it's more towards the
 

107
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,149
and that's why it's more towards the
useless side

108
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
useless side
 

109
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,830
useless side
another surprising one i would go for

110
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
another surprising one i would go for
 

111
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,830
another surprising one i would go for
warp next the problem with this one

112
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
warp next the problem with this one
 

113
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,510
warp next the problem with this one
i want to use it you know but it's got

114
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
i want to use it you know but it's got
 

115
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,429
i want to use it you know but it's got
two colors in it it's got the light blue

116
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
two colors in it it's got the light blue
 

117
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,870
two colors in it it's got the light blue
and it's got like the purplish color and

118
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
and it's got like the purplish color and
 

119
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,190
and it's got like the purplish color and
that makes it so much harder

120
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
that makes it so much harder
 

121
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,350
that makes it so much harder
to use in a build because you introduced

122
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
to use in a build because you introduced
 

123
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,710
to use in a build because you introduced
two colors with it that's kind of the

124
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
two colors with it that's kind of the
 

125
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,230
two colors with it that's kind of the
problem with the birch as well

126
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
problem with the birch as well
 

127
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,510
problem with the birch as well
i'd like acacia but i find it's like a

128
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
i'd like acacia but i find it's like a
 

129
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,190
i'd like acacia but i find it's like a
little too bright most of the time

130
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
little too bright most of the time
 

131
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,709
little too bright most of the time
and then the one i've been sleeping on

132
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
and then the one i've been sleeping on
 

133
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,789
and then the one i've been sleeping on
for a long time here is jungle logs the

134
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
for a long time here is jungle logs the
 

135
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,310
for a long time here is jungle logs the
stripped ones actually looks pretty good

136
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
stripped ones actually looks pretty good
 

137
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,910
stripped ones actually looks pretty good
especially mixed with some of the other

138
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
especially mixed with some of the other
 

139
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,870
especially mixed with some of the other
logs in the game

140
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
logs in the game
 

141
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,630
logs in the game
it's like i'm abandoning a child almost

142
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
it's like i'm abandoning a child almost
 

143
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,790
it's like i'm abandoning a child almost
but for many years dark oak

144
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
but for many years dark oak
 

145
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,470
but for many years dark oak
was my favorite log and now it's kind of

146
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
was my favorite log and now it's kind of
 

147
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,750
was my favorite log and now it's kind of
taking a back seat we're going to put it

148
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
taking a back seat we're going to put it
 

149
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,589
taking a back seat we're going to put it
pretty close in the middle of our list

150
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
pretty close in the middle of our list
 

151
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,110
pretty close in the middle of our list
because we got this guy now and this

152
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
because we got this guy now and this
 

153
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,030
because we got this guy now and this
guy's just so much better for most the

154
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
guy's just so much better for most the
 

155
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,910
guy's just so much better for most the
cases where i would

156
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
cases where i would
 

157
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,229
cases where i would
want to use this uh we'll go for crimson

158
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
want to use this uh we'll go for crimson
 

159
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,990
want to use this uh we'll go for crimson
next surprisingly this works with a lot

160
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
next surprisingly this works with a lot
 

161
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,350
next surprisingly this works with a lot
of blocks in the game like all the

162
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
of blocks in the game like all the
 

163
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,790

guardians
 

295
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,590
guardians
they would laser the squid and kill them

296
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
they would laser the squid and kill them
 

297
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,189
they would laser the squid and kill them
and we would collect the drops but

298
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
and we would collect the drops but
 

299
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,510
and we would collect the drops but
uh squid don't just spawn anywhere

300
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
uh squid don't just spawn anywhere
 

301
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,150
uh squid don't just spawn anywhere
anymore they only spawn in oceans and

302
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
anymore they only spawn in oceans and
 

303
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,350
anymore they only spawn in oceans and
in rivers and this is not an ocean

304
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
in rivers and this is not an ocean
 

305
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,790
in rivers and this is not an ocean
even where the guardians are spawning

306
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
even where the guardians are spawning
 

307
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,870
even where the guardians are spawning
this is not an ocean it's like desert

308
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
this is not an ocean it's like desert
 

309
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,990
this is not an ocean it's like desert
plains and

310
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
plains and
 

311
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,749
plains and
yeah there's no way to get squid

312
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
yeah there's no way to get squid
 

313
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,350
yeah there's no way to get squid
spawning in there anymore it's just not

314
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
spawning in there anymore it's just not
 

315
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,070
spawning in there anymore it's just not
possible

316
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
possible
 

317
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,950
possible
so we're gonna have to find a new spot

318
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
so we're gonna have to find a new spot
 

319
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,629
so we're gonna have to find a new spot
and i don't feel like draining an ocean

320
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
and i don't feel like draining an ocean
 

321
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,990
and i don't feel like draining an ocean
today so it's probably gonna have to be

322
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
today so it's probably gonna have to be
 

323
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,189
today so it's probably gonna have to be
a river

324
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
a river
 

325
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,670

looking around our area here i was

326
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
looking around our area here i was
 

327
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,430
looking around our area here i was
actually kind of surprised we have a

328
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
actually kind of surprised we have a
 

329
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,990
actually kind of surprised we have a
spot

330
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
spot
 

331
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,070
spot
right around here with no rivers

332
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
right around here with no rivers
 

333
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,310
right around here with no rivers
so we don't have to like drain the

334
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
so we don't have to like drain the
 

335
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,270
so we don't have to like drain the
rivers

336
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
rivers
 

337
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,830
rivers
which would be such a huge time saver i

338
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
which would be such a huge time saver i
 

339
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,390
which would be such a huge time saver i
think if we're around this tower here

340
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
think if we're around this tower here
 

341
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,230
think if we're around this tower here
you get major bonus points if you know

342
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
you get major bonus points if you know
 

343
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,430
you get major bonus points if you know
what this is from

344
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
what this is from
 

345
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,990
what this is from
uh i think that i think we've got a

346
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
uh i think that i think we've got a
 

347
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,590
uh i think that i think we've got a
river right here and look as soon as we

348
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
river right here and look as soon as we
 

349
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,230
river right here and look as soon as we
approach it

350
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
approach it
 

351
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,990
approach it
squid spawn in here so this is like a

352
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
squid spawn in here so this is like a
 

353
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,590
squid spawn in here so this is like a
prime location nice big chunk of water

354
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
prime location nice big chunk of water
 

355
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,590
prime location nice big chunk of water
river biome to work with yeah that's

356
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
river biome to work with yeah that's
 

357
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,110
river biome to work with yeah that's
great so the hard part of this is all

358
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
great so the hard part of this is all
 

359
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,990
great so the hard part of this is all
done for us pretty

360
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
done for us pretty
 

361
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,629
done for us pretty
much uh i think we will drain a little

362
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
much uh i think we will drain a little
 

363
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,629
much uh i think we will drain a little
bit of the river though i think this u

364
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
bit of the river though i think this u
 

365
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,629
bit of the river though i think this u
shape over here the part that sticks out

366
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
shape over here the part that sticks out
 

367
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,070
shape over here the part that sticks out
and then maybe we'll connect that side

368
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
and then maybe we'll connect that side
 

369
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,830
and then maybe we'll connect that side
of the river to

370
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
of the river to
 

371
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,990
of the river to
like over here somewhere just so we

372
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
like over here somewhere just so we
 

373
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,430
like over here somewhere just so we
still have rivers and it looks nice in

374
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
still have rivers and it looks nice in
 

375
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,150
still have rivers and it looks nice in
our world

376
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
our world
 

377
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,070
our world
maybe we'll make a tunnel through the

378
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
maybe we'll make a tunnel through the
 

379
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,270
maybe we'll make a tunnel through the
ground or something i don't know we'll

380
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
ground or something i don't know we'll
 

381
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,909
ground or something i don't know we'll
see

382
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
see
 

383
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,510
see
but yeah we'll drain this spot and then

384
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
but yeah we'll drain this spot and then
 

385
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,710
but yeah we'll drain this spot and then
we'll have to stand like a hundred

386
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
we'll have to stand like a hundred
 

387
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,870
we'll have to stand like a hundred
blocks towards the tower there

388
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
blocks towards the tower there
 

389
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,510
blocks towards the tower there
just double checking making sure these

390
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
just double checking making sure these
 

391
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,870
just double checking making sure these
are in river biome

392
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
are in river biome
 

393
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,469
are in river biome
and not in desert like if we go over

394
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
and not in desert like if we go over
 

395
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,110
and not in desert like if we go over
here it's water but it's actually desert

396
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
here it's water but it's actually desert
 

397
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,870
here it's water but it's actually desert
and that won't work it's got to be river

398
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
and that won't work it's got to be river
 

399
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,830
and that won't work it's got to be river
so just double check

400
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
so just double check
 

401
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,990
so just double check
all this we got room to expand if we

402
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
all this we got room to expand if we
 

403
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,029
all this we got room to expand if we
need to

404
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
need to
 

405
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,029
need to
but i think we're just going to aim for

406
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
but i think we're just going to aim for
 

407
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,629
but i think we're just going to aim for
like 32

408
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
like 32
 

409
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,909
like 32
columns of water i don't have a lot of

410
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
columns of water i don't have a lot of
 

411
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,430
columns of water i don't have a lot of
experience making squid farms but i

412
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
experience making squid farms but i
 

413
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,230
experience making squid farms but i
think i've heard

414
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
think i've heard
 

415
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,909
think i've heard
like you don't really need a lot and

416
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
like you don't really need a lot and
 

417
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,909
like you don't really need a lot and
it's like diminishing returns

418
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
it's like diminishing returns
 

419
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,189
it's like diminishing returns
obviously it's better if you have more

420
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
obviously it's better if you have more
 

421
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,350
obviously it's better if you have more
water but it's like less

422
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
water but it's like less
 

423
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,510
water but it's like less
effective the more you have i'm hoping

424
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
effective the more you have i'm hoping
 

425
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,670
effective the more you have i'm hoping
that's good enough we'll see

426
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
that's good enough we'll see
 

427
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,350
that's good enough we'll see
so we'll have 16 on that side and 16 on

428
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
so we'll have 16 on that side and 16 on
 

429
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,150
so we'll have 16 on that side and 16 on
this side

430
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
this side
 

431
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,390
this side
yep so that's our general plan we got it

432
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
yep so that's our general plan we got it
 

433
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,070
yep so that's our general plan we got it
figured out let's get to

434
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
figured out let's get to
 

435
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,670
figured out let's get to
setting things up we're going to drain

436
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
setting things up we're going to drain
 

437
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,270
setting things up we're going to drain
the u-shape first

438
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280

 

439
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,830

please go away walker i don't want you

440
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
please go away walker i don't want you
 

441
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,990
please go away walker i don't want you
anymore

442
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000

 

443
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,950

habit that loss serious problem not for

444
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
habit that loss serious problem not for
 

445
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,589
habit that loss serious problem not for
me though

446
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599

 

447
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,029

you know i was just thinking they made

448
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
you know i was just thinking they made
 

449
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,950
you know i was just thinking they made
it so hay bales and beds reduce fall

450
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
it so hay bales and beds reduce fall
 

451
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,029
it so hay bales and beds reduce fall
damage if there's any block in this game

452
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
damage if there's any block in this game
 

453
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,189
damage if there's any block in this game
that should reduce fall damage

454
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
that should reduce fall damage
 

455
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,670
that should reduce fall damage
it should be the sponge right

456
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680

 

457
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,510

oh snappers all right so i've been

458
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
oh snappers all right so i've been
 

459
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,589
oh snappers all right so i've been
preparing the area here squid spawned

460
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
preparing the area here squid spawned
 

461
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,510
preparing the area here squid spawned
from y63 down to

462
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
from y63 down to
 

463
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,550
from y63 down to
46 i think so i'm digging a big hole and

464
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
46 i think so i'm digging a big hole and
 

465
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,830
46 i think so i'm digging a big hole and
we're gonna stand in the middle and

466
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
we're gonna stand in the middle and
 

467
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,189
we're gonna stand in the middle and
we'll be able to view both sides

468
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
we'll be able to view both sides
 

469
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,870
we'll be able to view both sides
hopefully is the plan

470
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
hopefully is the plan
 

471
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,950
hopefully is the plan
but i found a ton of caves while doing

472
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
but i found a ton of caves while doing
 

473
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,390
but i found a ton of caves while doing
this and i think we're actually like

474
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
this and i think we're actually like
 

475
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,790
this and i think we're actually like
within range of the guardian farm so the

476
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
within range of the guardian farm so the
 

477
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,950
within range of the guardian farm so the
these have been killing my rates on the

478
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
these have been killing my rates on the
 

479
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,870
these have been killing my rates on the
guardians for sure

480
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
guardians for sure
 

481
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,309
guardians for sure
or we should probably light these up i

482
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
or we should probably light these up i
 

483
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,390
or we should probably light these up i
found a pig over here hey buddy

484
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
found a pig over here hey buddy
 

485
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,469
found a pig over here hey buddy
just chilling out in a cave that was

486
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479

couple oddities with squid
 

537
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,070
couple oddities with squid
that uh will be hard to show you in the

538
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
that uh will be hard to show you in the
 

539
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,430
that uh will be hard to show you in the
let's play world just because we have to

00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
stand like 100 blocks away from this
 

543
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,029
stand like 100 blocks away from this
farm for it to work properly

544
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
farm for it to work properly
 

545
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,110
farm for it to work properly
and uh there's gonna be some confusing

546
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
and uh there's gonna be some confusing
 

547
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,469
and uh there's gonna be some confusing
stuff here so first off

548
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
stuff here so first off
 

549
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,949
stuff here so first off
one test i did was to check if squid

550
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
one test i did was to check if squid
 

551
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,149
one test i did was to check if squid
actually spawn

552
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
actually spawn
 

553
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,550
actually spawn
in bubble columns and they do both

554
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
in bubble columns and they do both
 

555
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,070
in bubble columns and they do both
upward and downward

556
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
upward and downward
 

557
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,350
upward and downward
i thought you know you could just put

558
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
i thought you know you could just put
 

559
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,269
i thought you know you could just put
magma blocks on the ground to make a

560
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
magma blocks on the ground to make a
 

561
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,790
magma blocks on the ground to make a
farm and they'll get pulled down into

562
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
farm and they'll get pulled down into
 

563
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,550
farm and they'll get pulled down into
them in fields

564
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
them in fields
 

565
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,870
them in fields
but that doesn't really happen uh they

566
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
but that doesn't really happen uh they
 

567
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,550
but that doesn't really happen uh they
totally ignore

568
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
totally ignore
 

569
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,750
totally ignore
being moved by the bubble columns

570
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
being moved by the bubble columns
 

571
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,030
being moved by the bubble columns
and they'll only touch them if they

572
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
and they'll only touch them if they
 

573
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,870
and they'll only touch them if they
accidentally swim into them

574
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
accidentally swim into them
 

575
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,269
accidentally swim into them
so the other thing is the game tries to

576
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
so the other thing is the game tries to
 

577
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,150
so the other thing is the game tries to
move them

578
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
move them
 

579
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,509
move them
with the bubble columns and then they

580
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
with the bubble columns and then they
 

581
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,630
with the bubble columns and then they
like get snapped back into position

582
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
like get snapped back into position
 

583
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,990
like get snapped back into position
so you'll sometimes see like flying

584
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
so you'll sometimes see like flying
 

585
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,110
so you'll sometimes see like flying
squid and stuff so that's fun

586
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
squid and stuff so that's fun
 

587
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,750
squid and stuff so that's fun
uh anyways what we're planning on doing

588
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
uh anyways what we're planning on doing
 

589
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,269
uh anyways what we're planning on doing
with our squid farm

590
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
with our squid farm
 

591
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,509
with our squid farm
is to have two columns one we'll have

592
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
is to have two columns one we'll have
 

593
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,509
is to have two columns one we'll have
just regular water i think downward

594
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
just regular water i think downward
 

595
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,550
just regular water i think downward
flowing

596
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
flowing
 

597
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,470
flowing
will probably work that'll go down and

598
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
will probably work that'll go down and
 

599
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,150
will probably work that'll go down and
we'll have a bubble column going

600
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
we'll have a bubble column going
 

601
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,509
we'll have a bubble column going
up it'll be a pair of two and i'm

602
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
up it'll be a pair of two and i'm
 

603

up it'll be a pair of two and i'm
planning on putting

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
planning on putting
 

605
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,190
planning on putting
like a mine cart that goes around on our

606
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
like a mine cart that goes around on our

is uh squid
 

621
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,630
is uh squid
should get picked up by the minecart it

622
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
should get picked up by the minecart it
 

623
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,910
should get picked up by the minecart it
might be a little weird i don't know

just wanted to like double check like

640
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
just wanted to like double check like
 

641
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,550
just wanted to like double check like
what happens if you get a million of

642
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
what happens if you get a million of
 

643
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,910
what happens if you get a million of
these guys in just to make sure that

644
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
these guys in just to make sure that
 

645
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,670
these guys in just to make sure that
doesn't break it

646
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
doesn't break it
 

647
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,030
doesn't break it
and it kind of does a little bit

648
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
and it kind of does a little bit
 

649
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,710
and it kind of does a little bit
but i think it'll fall through

650
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
but i think it'll fall through
 

651
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,190
but i think it'll fall through
eventually

652
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
eventually
 

653
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,630
eventually
i hope maybe it's struggling a little

654
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
i hope maybe it's struggling a little
 

655
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,389
i hope maybe it's struggling a little
bit oh there it goes okay

656
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
bit oh there it goes okay
 

657
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,069
bit oh there it goes okay
good stuff all right so we are back in

658
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
good stuff all right so we are back in
 

659
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,430
good stuff all right so we are back in
the let's play world now we're gonna

660
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
the let's play world now we're gonna
 

661
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,630
the let's play world now we're gonna
start building this thing

662
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
start building this thing
 

663
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,310
start building this thing
so we're lining the soul soil up with

664
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
so we're lining the soul soil up with
 

665
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,990
so we're lining the soul soil up with
the spots we picked out before in the

666
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
the spots we picked out before in the
 

667
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,030
the spots we picked out before in the
river biome

668
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
river biome
 

669
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,150
river biome
and uh we're starting at y 45

670
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
and uh we're starting at y 45
 

671
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,750
and uh we're starting at y 45
i think is what we want like above this

672
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
i think is what we want like above this
 

673
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,550
i think is what we want like above this
whole soil here 44.875 when we're

674
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
whole soil here 44.875 when we're
 

675
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,910
whole soil here 44.875 when we're
standing on it

676
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
standing on it
 

677
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,670
standing on it
and uh as you saw it's a really simple

678
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
and uh as you saw it's a really simple
 

679
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,949
and uh as you saw it's a really simple
design it's not going to take us very

680
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
design it's not going to take us very
 

681
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,590
design it's not going to take us very
long

682
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
long
 

683
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,430
long
so we'll have activator rail power rail

684
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
so we'll have activator rail power rail
 

685
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,870
so we'll have activator rail power rail
and then to get it to go up

686
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
and then to get it to go up
 

687
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,750
and then to get it to go up
we put one over here too and break it

688
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
we put one over here too and break it
 

689
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,470
we put one over here too and break it
and then

690
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
and then
 

691
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,069
and then
we take advantage of the fact that

692
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
we take advantage of the fact that
 

693
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,829
we take advantage of the fact that
minecarts can travel diagonally through

694
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
minecarts can travel diagonally through
 

695
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,110
minecarts can travel diagonally through
blocks

696
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
blocks
 

697
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,030
blocks
and we'll just encase it with glass like

698
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
and we'll just encase it with glass like
 

699
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,550
and we'll just encase it with glass like
this get rid of the middle one

700
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
this get rid of the middle one
 

701
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,829
this get rid of the middle one
and build it up so i think we can share

702
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
and build it up so i think we can share
 

703
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,670
and build it up so i think we can share
the campfires between two of these

704
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
the campfires between two of these
 

705
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,110
the campfires between two of these
things so i'm going to try to do that as

706
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
things so i'm going to try to do that as
 

707
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,990
things so i'm going to try to do that as
well

708
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
well
 

709
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,030
well
we'll put it like over here all right

710
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
we'll put it like over here all right
 

711
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,470
we'll put it like over here all right
very good very good so we kind of got

712
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
very good very good so we kind of got
 

713
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,990
very good very good so we kind of got
the squid farm set up now we're just

714
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
the squid farm set up now we're just
 

715
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,310
the squid farm set up now we're just
testing it out it's in the rough stages

716
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
testing it out it's in the rough stages
 

717
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,430
testing it out it's in the rough stages
and from what i've seen we probably

718
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
and from what i've seen we probably
 

719
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,269
and from what i've seen we probably
need like double to triple the water at

720
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
need like double to triple the water at
 

721
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,110
need like double to triple the water at
least in here

722
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
least in here
 

723
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,710
least in here
how many squid we got this time we got

724
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
how many squid we got this time we got
 

725
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,949
how many squid we got this time we got
one we got two we got three

726
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
one we got two we got three
 

727
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,230
one we got two we got three
on that side and four five

728
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
on that side and four five
 

729
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,470
on that side and four five
i think we want like 15 or so right um

730
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
i think we want like 15 or so right um
 

731
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,590
i think we want like 15 or so right um
yeah so we did hook it up though

732
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
yeah so we did hook it up though
 

733
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,870
yeah so we did hook it up though
flip the lever and we got rid of the

734
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
flip the lever and we got rid of the
 

735
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,550
flip the lever and we got rid of the
redstone blocks we have a switch for it

736
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
redstone blocks we have a switch for it
 

737
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,990
redstone blocks we have a switch for it
instead

738
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
instead
 

739
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,710
instead
and the minecarts come down and grab the

740
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
and the minecarts come down and grab the
 

741
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,509
and the minecarts come down and grab the
squid

742
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
squid
 

743
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,030
squid
oh there he goes they get ejected into

744
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
oh there he goes they get ejected into
 

745
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,030
oh there he goes they get ejected into
the campfire and then we set up some

746
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
the campfire and then we set up some
 

747
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,470
the campfire and then we set up some
droppers down here

748
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
droppers down here
 

749
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,230
droppers down here
that whenever something's in here it

750
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
that whenever something's in here it
 

751
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,629
that whenever something's in here it
automatically shoots it out

752
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639

 

753
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,230

and then it goes into a water stream all

754
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
and then it goes into a water stream all
 

755
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,870
and then it goes into a water stream all
combines together and just for now

756
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
combines together and just for now
 

757
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,110
combines together and just for now
it is shooting out right over here so

758
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
it is shooting out right over here so
 

759
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,230
it is shooting out right over here so
we'll probably want to set up some

760
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
we'll probably want to set up some
 

761
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,069
we'll probably want to set up some
hoppers here and some chests to collect

762
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
hoppers here and some chests to collect
 

763
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,269
hoppers here and some chests to collect
the drops

764
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
the drops
 

765
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,949
the drops
so in general i don't really like the

766
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
so in general i don't really like the
 

767
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,350
so in general i don't really like the
afk at farm so i tried to design this in

768
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
afk at farm so i tried to design this in
 

769
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,790
afk at farm so i tried to design this in
a way where

770
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
a way where
 

771
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,629
a way where
when we approach the farm like when

772
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
when we approach the farm like when
 

773
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,990
when we approach the farm like when
we're in the area

774
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
we're in the area
 

775
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,750
we're in the area
uh this since this is the first water

776
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
uh this since this is the first water
 

777
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,350
uh this since this is the first water
that gets loaded we should get a nice

778
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
that gets loaded we should get a nice
 

779
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,670
that gets loaded we should get a nice
wave of squid spawning every time

780
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
wave of squid spawning every time
 

781
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,470
wave of squid spawning every time
we got one we got two three yeah i think

782
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
we got one we got two three yeah i think
 

783
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,590
we got one we got two three yeah i think
we got like five there

784
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
we got like five there
 

785
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,750
we got like five there
so so it's not too bad like every time

786
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
so so it's not too bad like every time
 

787
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,670
so so it's not too bad like every time
we approach it if we're getting 10 to 16

788
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
we approach it if we're getting 10 to 16
 

789
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,829
we approach it if we're getting 10 to 16
ink or whatever

790
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
ink or whatever
 

791
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,069
ink or whatever
that's pretty good okay so we got one we

792
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
that's pretty good okay so we got one we
 

793
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,949
that's pretty good okay so we got one we
got two

794
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959

 

795
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,750

i think we got three here three isn't

796
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
i think we got three here three isn't
 

797
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,269
i think we got three here three isn't
really ideal we might need to double the

798
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
really ideal we might need to double the
 

799
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,509
really ideal we might need to double the
size of this but the problem is

800
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
size of this but the problem is
 

801
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,269
size of this but the problem is
we uh we don't have any glass we don't

802
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
we uh we don't have any glass we don't
 

803
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,870
we uh we don't have any glass we don't
have villagers to buy glass

804
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
have villagers to buy glass
 

805
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,030
have villagers to buy glass
we uh just used up all our sandstone i

806
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
we uh just used up all our sandstone i
 

807
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,190
we uh just used up all our sandstone i
believe as well working on this so

808
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
believe as well working on this so
 

809
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,110
believe as well working on this so
we're hurting on the resources we really

810
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
we're hurting on the resources we really
 

811
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,710
we're hurting on the resources we really
got to work on the infrastructure of our

812
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
got to work on the infrastructure of our
 

813
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,230
got to work on the infrastructure of our
let's play world and this was one of the

814
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
let's play world and this was one of the
 

815
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,269
let's play world and this was one of the
things

816
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
things
 

817
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,910
things
like we needed a trickle of squid coming

818
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
like we needed a trickle of squid coming
 

819
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,990
like we needed a trickle of squid coming
in again so that's why we did this today

820
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
in again so that's why we did this today
 

821
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,670
in again so that's why we did this today
okay so moving on here we're gonna get

822
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
okay so moving on here we're gonna get
 

823
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,269
okay so moving on here we're gonna get
to our building project which

824
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
to our building project which
 

825
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,069
to our building project which
just happens to use ink sacs for the

826
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
just happens to use ink sacs for the
 

827
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,269
just happens to use ink sacs for the
dark prismarine

828

dark prismarine
 

829
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,750
dark prismarine
and now we can craft this without uh

830
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
and now we can craft this without uh
 

831
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,190
and now we can craft this without uh
worrying about running out

832
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
worrying about running out
 

833
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,190
worrying about running out
aha so what are we going to be working

aha so what are we going to be working
 

835
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,110
aha so what are we going to be working
on well a certain project

836
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
on well a certain project
 

837
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,870

and we ran into a problem when we worked
on this before we got to the second

864
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
on this before we got to the second
 

865
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,269
on this before we got to the second
floor i was like wait a minute

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
wait a minute since i don't really know
 

869
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,389
wait a minute since i don't really know
how to build houses

870
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
how to build houses
 

871
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,629
how to build houses

00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
the roof is like over here and there's
 

873
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,069
the roof is like over here and there's
not going to be enough vertical height

874
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
not going to be enough vertical height
 

875
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,189
not going to be enough vertical height
on the second floor

876
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
on the second floor
 

877
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,110
on the second floor
if like the roof over here comes across

878
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
if like the roof over here comes across
 

879
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,230
if like the roof over here comes across
it's only going to be like one or two

880
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
it's only going to be like one or two
 

881
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,829
it's only going to be like one or two
blocks tall in certain places so

882
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
blocks tall in certain places so
 

883
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,990
blocks tall in certain places so
yeah that discouraged me last time i

884
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
yeah that discouraged me last time i
 

885
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,750
yeah that discouraged me last time i
worked on this but not anymore i think i

886
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
worked on this but not anymore i think i
 

887
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,710
worked on this but not anymore i think i
know what we're gonna do we're gonna

888
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
know what we're gonna do we're gonna
 

889
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
know what we're gonna do we're gonna
have to build this side taller

890
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
have to build this side taller
 

891
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,189
have to build this side taller
and just make some adjustments uh

892
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
and just make some adjustments uh
 

893
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,470
and just make some adjustments uh
overall though just looking at the

894
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
overall though just looking at the
 

895
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,069
overall though just looking at the
structure i still do like the block

896
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
structure i still do like the block
 

897
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,509
structure i still do like the block
palette i chose for this i think it's

898
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
palette i chose for this i think it's
 

899
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,030
palette i chose for this i think it's
pretty good but there are definitely

900
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
pretty good but there are definitely
 

901
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,829
pretty good but there are definitely
some

902
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
some
 

903
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,150
some
design choices i questioned myself on

904
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
design choices i questioned myself on
 

905
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,470
design choices i questioned myself on
now like why

906
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
now like why
 

907
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,550
now like why
why did i use full blocks here is a big

908
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
why did i use full blocks here is a big
 

909
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,829
why did i use full blocks here is a big
question huh

910
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
question huh
 

911
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,949
question huh
why would you do that use pains they add

912
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
why would you do that use pains they add
 

913
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:29,590
why would you do that use pains they add
depth

914
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
depth
 

915
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,230
depth
and uh just look better always most the

916
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
and uh just look better always most the
 

917
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,269
and uh just look better always most the
time anyway

918
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
time anyway
 

919
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,269
time anyway
so we're gonna switch those out i think

920
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
so we're gonna switch those out i think
 

921
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,670
so we're gonna switch those out i think
we will get rid of the window

922
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
we will get rid of the window
 

923
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,110
we will get rid of the window
i'll just show you a couple a couple

924
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
i'll just show you a couple a couple
 

925
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,470
i'll just show you a couple a couple
changes we're making here but i'll do

926
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
changes we're making here but i'll do
 

927
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,990
changes we're making here but i'll do
most of this off camera

928
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
most of this off camera
 

929
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,590
most of this off camera
get pains there so we have a bit more

930
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
get pains there so we have a bit more
 

931
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,910
get pains there so we have a bit more
depth in the build uh

932
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
depth in the build uh
 

933
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,269
depth in the build uh
a lot of the windows i think we will

934
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
a lot of the windows i think we will
 

935
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,110
a lot of the windows i think we will
keep the fences but not this one

936
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
keep the fences but not this one
 

937
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,189
keep the fences but not this one
next to the mushroom stems this will

938
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
next to the mushroom stems this will
 

939
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,629
next to the mushroom stems this will
also be glass

940
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
also be glass
 

941
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,030
also be glass
i think that makes sense so for a long

942
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
i think that makes sense so for a long
 

943
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,829
i think that makes sense so for a long
time i had a huge aversion to using

944
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
time i had a huge aversion to using
 

945
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,430
time i had a huge aversion to using
jungle planks i kind of just wrote them

946
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
jungle planks i kind of just wrote them
 

947
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,949
jungle planks i kind of just wrote them
off from being in the game like i was

948
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
off from being in the game like i was
 

949
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,310
off from being in the game like i was
never going to build with them

950
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
never going to build with them
 

951
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,590
never going to build with them
but now it's like i just love the things

952
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
but now it's like i just love the things
 

953
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,110
but now it's like i just love the things

so we're going to switch out the acacia
 

955
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,790
so we're going to switch out the acacia
floor i think the jungle planks will

956
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
floor i think the jungle planks will
 

957
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,150
floor i think the jungle planks will
look a lot better

958
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
look a lot better
 

959
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,389
look a lot better
they have that like peachy color that

960
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
they have that like peachy color that
 

961
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,069
they have that like peachy color that
works really well with brick

962
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
works really well with brick
 

963
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,310
works really well with brick
while the acacia here kind of stands out

964
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
while the acacia here kind of stands out
 

965
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,829
while the acacia here kind of stands out
it's a little hard on the eyes

966
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
it's a little hard on the eyes
 

967
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,269
it's a little hard on the eyes
and i think this will just be a lot

968
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
and i think this will just be a lot
 

969
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,110
and i think this will just be a lot
nicer so something i've kind of learned

970
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
nicer so something i've kind of learned
 

971
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,910
nicer so something i've kind of learned
about building

972
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
about building
 

973
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,670
about building
lately is like you want to establish

974
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
lately is like you want to establish
 

975
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,030
lately is like you want to establish
patterns in your building and then

976
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
patterns in your building and then
 

977
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,870
patterns in your building and then
follow through with those patterns so

978
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
follow through with those patterns so
 

979
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,710
follow through with those patterns so
that like when you see something you can

980
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
that like when you see something you can
 

981
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,990
that like when you see something you can
anticipate

982
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
anticipate
 

983
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,829
anticipate
how it should look in other places as

984
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
how it should look in other places as
 

985
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,590
how it should look in other places as
well if that makes sense so i'll give

986
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
well if that makes sense so i'll give
 

987
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,189
well if that makes sense so i'll give
you an example here like we have brick

988
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
you an example here like we have brick
 

989
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,350
you an example here like we have brick
then we have a spruce log running across

990
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
then we have a spruce log running across
 

991
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,670
then we have a spruce log running across
white terracotta that's good over there

992
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
white terracotta that's good over there
 

993
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,790
white terracotta that's good over there
same thing brick

994
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
same thing brick
 

995
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,189
same thing brick
spruce white terracotta but then there's

996
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
spruce white terracotta but then there's
 

997
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,269
spruce white terracotta but then there's
some places here where it's like

998
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
some places here where it's like
 

999
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,470
some places here where it's like
i ditched that rule this goes

1000
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
i ditched that rule this goes
 

1001
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,629
i ditched that rule this goes
brick to prismarine there this is fine

1002
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
brick to prismarine there this is fine
 

1003
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,509
brick to prismarine there this is fine
over here

1004
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
over here
 

1005
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,829
over here
but then on the balcony especially i

1006
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
but then on the balcony especially i
 

1007
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,870
but then on the balcony especially i
noticed

1008
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
noticed
 

1009
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,310
noticed
we have a spot here where it just goes

1010
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
we have a spot here where it just goes
 

1011
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,990
we have a spot here where it just goes
to white terracotta

1012
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
to white terracotta
 

1013
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,230
to white terracotta
and now like what do we put above this i

1014
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
and now like what do we put above this i
 

1015
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,829
and now like what do we put above this i
don't know i think i'm going to switch

1016
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
don't know i think i'm going to switch
 

1017
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,350
don't know i think i'm going to switch
this to brick and then we'll do the log

1018
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
this to brick and then we'll do the log
 

1019
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,550
this to brick and then we'll do the log
and then

1020
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
and then
 

1021
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,310
and then
white terracotta above that makes more

1022
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
white terracotta above that makes more
 

1023
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,670
white terracotta above that makes more
sense to me

1024
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
sense to me
 

1025
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,150
sense to me
so let's get this switched out not quite

1026
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
so let's get this switched out not quite
 

1027
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,670
so let's get this switched out not quite
sure what the mushroom blocks are about

1028
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
sure what the mushroom blocks are about
 

1029
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,269
sure what the mushroom blocks are about
but i think we'll ditch them or

1030
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
but i think we'll ditch them or
 

1031
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,629
but i think we'll ditch them or
well maybe we'll just make them a bit

1032
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
well maybe we'll just make them a bit
 

1033
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,870
well maybe we'll just make them a bit
more gentle we'll go for this instead

1034
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
more gentle we'll go for this instead
 

1035
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,629
more gentle we'll go for this instead
we got a bit of a weird profile on the

1036
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
we got a bit of a weird profile on the
 

1037
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,150
we got a bit of a weird profile on the
fireplace and chimney on this thing i

1038
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
fireplace and chimney on this thing i
 

1039
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,590
fireplace and chimney on this thing i
think i was trying to taper it down to a

1040
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
think i was trying to taper it down to a
 

1041
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:21,990
think i was trying to taper it down to a
single

1042
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
single
 

1043
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,910
single
block thickness at the top here and i do

1044
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
block thickness at the top here and i do
 

1045
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,430
block thickness at the top here and i do
it really quickly

1046
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
it really quickly
 

1047
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,509
it really quickly
uh it's probably got to be a bit bulkier

1048
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
uh it's probably got to be a bit bulkier
 

1049
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,629
uh it's probably got to be a bit bulkier
so we're going to

1050
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
so we're going to
 

1051
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,310
so we're going to
adjust this as well ditch the brick here

1052
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
adjust this as well ditch the brick here
 

1053
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,629
adjust this as well ditch the brick here
keep that stone brick all the way up we

1054
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
keep that stone brick all the way up we
 

1055
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,069
keep that stone brick all the way up we
will add walls

1056
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
will add walls
 

1057
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,110
will add walls
to round it out a bit and kind of

1058
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
to round it out a bit and kind of
 

1059
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,110
to round it out a bit and kind of
get like an in-between block with it

1060
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
get like an in-between block with it
 

1061
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,550
get like an in-between block with it
well uh this is like

1062
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
well uh this is like
 

1063
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,870
well uh this is like
two or three hours later of very finicky

1064
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
two or three hours later of very finicky
 

1065
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,829
two or three hours later of very finicky
building but

1066
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
building but
 

1067
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,350
building but
we got it done check it out oh just look

1068
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
we got it done check it out oh just look
 

1069
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,189
we got it done check it out oh just look
look at that shot now look at the

1070
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:51,199
look at that shot now look at the
 

1071
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,949
look at that shot now look at the
difference it's uh

1072
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
difference it's uh
 

1073
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,069
difference it's uh
it's pretty much the same isn't it

1074
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
it's pretty much the same isn't it
 

1075
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,389
it's pretty much the same isn't it
uh-huh there's a reason i don't build

1076
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
uh-huh there's a reason i don't build
 

1077
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,189
uh-huh there's a reason i don't build
roofs guys

1078
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
roofs guys
 

1079
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,189
roofs guys
what's the point you can't tell anyways

1080
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
what's the point you can't tell anyways
 

1081
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,389
what's the point you can't tell anyways
uh no you cannot

1082
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
uh no you cannot
 

1083
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,990
uh no you cannot
actually now that we can fly around in

1084
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
actually now that we can fly around in
 

1085
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,669
actually now that we can fly around in
the game it's kind of important

1086
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
the game it's kind of important
 

1087
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,110
the game it's kind of important
uh that side of the building was like

1088
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
uh that side of the building was like
 

1089
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,390
uh that side of the building was like
pretty much done though before we

1090
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
pretty much done though before we
 

1091
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,150
pretty much done though before we
started that's the money shot over there

1092
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
started that's the money shot over there
 

1093
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,429
started that's the money shot over there
but you can see now

1094
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
but you can see now
 

1095
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,949
but you can see now
we got the other sides of the building a

1096
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
we got the other sides of the building a
 

1097
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,710
we got the other sides of the building a
little bit more complete as well

1098
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
little bit more complete as well
 

1099
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,870
little bit more complete as well
this is our chimney side kind of

1100
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
this is our chimney side kind of
 

1101
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,069
this is our chimney side kind of
scattered

1102
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
scattered
 

1103
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,630
scattered
brick granite and the terracotta

1104
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
brick granite and the terracotta
 

1105
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,510
brick granite and the terracotta
together

1106
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
together
 

1107
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,029
together
chimney i think is looking a lot better

1108
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
chimney i think is looking a lot better
 

1109
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,750
chimney i think is looking a lot better
we got uh some actual roof action

1110
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
we got uh some actual roof action
 

1111
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,630
we got uh some actual roof action
happening here

1112
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
happening here
 

1113
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,789
happening here
that's kind of cool i like that and then

1114
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
that's kind of cool i like that and then
 

1115
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,830
that's kind of cool i like that and then
this is other main side of the building

1116
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840
this is other main side of the building
 

1117
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,390
this is other main side of the building
here so the roof used to go

1118
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
here so the roof used to go
 

1119
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,110
here so the roof used to go
kind of like that i ditched the the two

1120
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
kind of like that i ditched the the two
 

1121
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,870
kind of like that i ditched the the two
ends on it and kept the middle section

1122
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
ends on it and kept the middle section
 

1123
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,590
ends on it and kept the middle section
where it was

1124
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
where it was
 

1125
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,270
where it was
and then i just added this bit on the

1126
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
and then i just added this bit on the
 

1127
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,350
and then i just added this bit on the

1129
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,950
top to heighten the building and i think
that looks pretty cool

1130
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
that looks pretty cool
 

1131
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,430

really like to add mini farms in my
 

1161
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,870
really like to add mini farms in my
my buildings like this just so that they

1162
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
my buildings like this just so that they
 

1163
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,789
my buildings like this just so that they
serve some sort of function

1164
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
serve some sort of function
 

1165
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,350
serve some sort of function
and there's a reason to visit them so

1166
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
and there's a reason to visit them so
 

1167
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,110
and there's a reason to visit them so
like we added the cocoa farm to one of

1168
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
like we added the cocoa farm to one of
 

1169
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,110
like we added the cocoa farm to one of
our sandy city buildings recently

our sandy city buildings recently
 

1171
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,950
our sandy city buildings recently
and i'll probably try stick something in

1285
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,630
and it like snakes back and forth up the
thing here with a bunch of repeaters

1286
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
thing here with a bunch of repeaters
 

1287
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,630
thing here with a bunch of repeaters
but when we farm the dark oak we only

1288
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
but when we farm the dark oak we only
 

1289
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,390
but when we farm the dark oak we only
want two of these to activate the bottom

1290
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
want two of these to activate the bottom
 

1291
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,789
want two of these to activate the bottom
two not the top four

1292
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
two not the top four
 

1293
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,149
two not the top four
and the only way to really control that

1294
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
and the only way to really control that
 

1295
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,830
and the only way to really control that
is to take the tnt out when we want to

1296
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
is to take the tnt out when we want to
 

1297
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,230
is to take the tnt out when we want to
farm dark oak and put it back in

1298
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
farm dark oak and put it back in
 

1299
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,870
farm dark oak and put it back in
but what we can do what i realized is

1300
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
but what we can do what i realized is
 

1301
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,789
but what we can do what i realized is
just add a switch

1302
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
just add a switch
 

1303
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,549
just add a switch
over here after the second dispenser

1304
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
over here after the second dispenser
 

1305
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,710
over here after the second dispenser
we're gonna lock the repeaters we'll

1306
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
we're gonna lock the repeaters we'll
 

1307
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,870
we're gonna lock the repeaters we'll
have like an on off to lock them

1308
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
have like an on off to lock them
 

1309
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,310
have like an on off to lock them
and then the signal won't be able to

1310
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
and then the signal won't be able to
 

1311
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,549
and then the signal won't be able to
pass through so we also built a similar

1312
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
pass through so we also built a similar
 

1313
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,549
pass through so we also built a similar
version of this tree farm on hermitcraft

1314
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
version of this tree farm on hermitcraft
 

1315
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,830
version of this tree farm on hermitcraft
but i like what we did there a little

1316
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
but i like what we did there a little
 

1317
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,990
but i like what we did there a little
bit more where we have two towers one on

1318
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
bit more where we have two towers one on
 

1319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,669
bit more where we have two towers one on
the other side as well

1320
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
the other side as well
 

1321
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,950
the other side as well
it doesn't really do anything on

1322
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
it doesn't really do anything on
 

1323
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,950
it doesn't really do anything on
hermitcraft this is for show

1324
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
hermitcraft this is for show
 

1325
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,029
hermitcraft this is for show
but on here i think we'll also add the

1326
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
but on here i think we'll also add the
 

1327
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,789
but on here i think we'll also add the
tower to bounce out the look of the tree

1328
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
tower to bounce out the look of the tree
 

1329
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,510
tower to bounce out the look of the tree
farm and we'll

1330
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
farm and we'll
 

1331
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,230
farm and we'll
use that to run a redstone signal up to

1332
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
use that to run a redstone signal up to
 

1333
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,630
use that to run a redstone signal up to
our

1334
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
our
 

1335
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,310
our
dark oak switch up there to lock the

1336
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
dark oak switch up there to lock the
 

1337
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,470
dark oak switch up there to lock the
repeaters and we'll add like a lever

1338
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
repeaters and we'll add like a lever
 

1339
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,430
repeaters and we'll add like a lever
here or something

1340
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,440
here or something
 

1341
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,990
here or something
to send the signal up or maybe a button

1342
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
to send the signal up or maybe a button
 

1343
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,510
to send the signal up or maybe a button
over here to switch between them

1344
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
over here to switch between them
 

1345
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,830
over here to switch between them
oh no darn it

1346
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
oh no darn it
 

1347
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,909
oh no darn it
there might be a flaw with the plan guys

1348
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:15,919
there might be a flaw with the plan guys
 

1349
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,230
there might be a flaw with the plan guys
uh when i flipped the switch

1350
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
uh when i flipped the switch
 

1351
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,990
uh when i flipped the switch
the tree farm blew up ah

1352
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
the tree farm blew up ah
 

1353
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,350
