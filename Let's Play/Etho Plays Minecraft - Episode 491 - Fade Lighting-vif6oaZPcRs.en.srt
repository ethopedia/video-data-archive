00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,509

Oh No

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:08,519
Oh No
 

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,549
Oh No
I can't see anything you know why

4
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
I can't see anything you know why
 

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,959
I can't see anything you know why
because it's dark in here

6
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:14,969
because it's dark in here
 

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,510
because it's dark in here
oh yeah detective Ito cracks the case

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:20,520
oh yeah detective Ito cracks the case
 

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,450
oh yeah detective Ito cracks the case
guys my observation skills are top-notch

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:23,460
guys my observation skills are top-notch
 

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,859
guys my observation skills are top-notch
as always hmm welcome back to another

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:27,869
as always hmm welcome back to another
 

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,320
as always hmm welcome back to another
episode of the let's play series how're

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,330
episode of the let's play series how're
 

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,490
episode of the let's play series how're
you doing today

16
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:31,500
you doing today
 

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,470
you doing today
seriously though the reason we are in a

18
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,480
seriously though the reason we are in a
 

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,049
seriously though the reason we are in a
dark room here is because I had a little

20
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:36,059
dark room here is because I had a little
 

21
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,950
dark room here is because I had a little
idea I wanted to try out might be cool

22
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:39,960
idea I wanted to try out might be cool
 

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,840
idea I wanted to try out might be cool
might be kind of stupid we'll find out

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:41,850
might be kind of stupid we'll find out
 

25
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,080
might be kind of stupid we'll find out
once we see it here but basically I want

26
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,090
once we see it here but basically I want
 

27
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,330
once we see it here but basically I want
to try make some fade lighting in

28
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:47,340
to try make some fade lighting in
 

29
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,790
to try make some fade lighting in
Minecraft so in this game there's

30
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:49,800
Minecraft so in this game there's
 

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,430
Minecraft so in this game there's
basically two states of lighting you

32
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,440
basically two states of lighting you
 

33
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,389
basically two states of lighting you
have on and you have off and even if you

34
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
have on and you have off and even if you
 

35
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,130
have on and you have off and even if you
use like a comparator or something it

36
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,140
use like a comparator or something it
 

37
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,500
use like a comparator or something it
doesn't save like the lighting doesn't

38
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,510
doesn't save like the lighting doesn't
 

39
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,720
doesn't save like the lighting doesn't
get weaker the further away the the

40
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:02,730
get weaker the further away the the
 

41
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,479
get weaker the further away the the
power signal is it's just again on and

42
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:05,489
power signal is it's just again on and
 

43
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,670
power signal is it's just again on and
off right boop boop boop boop on off so

44
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:10,680
off right boop boop boop boop on off so
 

45
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,630
off right boop boop boop boop on off so
what we want to try to do is make

46
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:11,640
what we want to try to do is make
 

47
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,490
what we want to try to do is make
lighting that can fade in and out or

48
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:13,500
lighting that can fade in and out or
 

49
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,850
lighting that can fade in and out or
pulse or something of that nature and if

50
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:16,860
pulse or something of that nature and if
 

51
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,560
pulse or something of that nature and if
it's cool we might actually use it in a

52
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:18,570
it's cool we might actually use it in a
 

53
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,350
it's cool we might actually use it in a
build but I expect it's going to cause a

54
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
build but I expect it's going to cause a
 

55
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,140
build but I expect it's going to cause a
lot of legs might take up a lot of space

56
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,150
lot of legs might take up a lot of space
 

57
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,649
lot of legs might take up a lot of space
and might not even look cool I'm not

58
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:27,659
and might not even look cool I'm not
 

59
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,319
and might not even look cool I'm not
sure we'll find out so I guess I have a

60
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,329
sure we'll find out so I guess I have a
 

61
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,490
sure we'll find out so I guess I have a
rough idea of what I want to do with

62
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
rough idea of what I want to do with
 

63
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:34,789
rough idea of what I want to do with
this

64
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
this
 

65
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
this
I guess maybe we'll try put a light here

66
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:36,890
I guess maybe we'll try put a light here
 

67
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,819
I guess maybe we'll try put a light here
and just see if we can do that so the

68
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:40,829
and just see if we can do that so the
 

69
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,289
and just see if we can do that so the
way we're going to create the fade

70
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:42,299
way we're going to create the fade
 

71
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,910
way we're going to create the fade
effect is by having a whole row of lamps

72
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
effect is by having a whole row of lamps
 

73
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,950
effect is by having a whole row of lamps
so if we have a lamp here at the lamp

74
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
so if we have a lamp here at the lamp
 

75
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,870
so if we have a lamp here at the lamp
it's going to be light level 15 and then

76
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:53,880
it's going to be light level 15 and then
 

77
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,940
it's going to be light level 15 and then
14 here 13 it's actually not going to

78
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:58,950
14 here 13 it's actually not going to
 

79
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,889
14 here 13 it's actually not going to
light up very much is it because it's

80
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:00,899
light up very much is it because it's
 

81
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,359
light up very much is it because it's
going to be light level 12 or so by the

82
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:02,369
going to be light level 12 or so by the
 

83
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,800
going to be light level 12 or so by the
time it finally gets out of the hole

84
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:03,810
time it finally gets out of the hole
 

85
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,899
time it finally gets out of the hole
here well I think this is the closest we

86
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:05,909
here well I think this is the closest we
 

87
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,020
here well I think this is the closest we
can actually get it so we'll try this

88
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,030
can actually get it so we'll try this
 

89
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,720
can actually get it so we'll try this
out first so gonna have a big row of

90
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,730
out first so gonna have a big row of
 

91
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,940
out first so gonna have a big row of
lights in

92
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:13,950
lights in
 

93
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,260
lights in
underground here and then we'll run a

94
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,270
underground here and then we'll run a
 

95
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,770
underground here and then we'll run a
comparator signal to this and try to

96
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:18,780
comparator signal to this and try to
 

97
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,100
comparator signal to this and try to
control that and see what happens so I

98
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,110
control that and see what happens so I
 

99
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,720
control that and see what happens so I
thought about it a little bit more here

100
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:23,730
thought about it a little bit more here
 

101
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,979
thought about it a little bit more here
and it's actually probably a lot easier

102
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:24,989
and it's actually probably a lot easier
 

103
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,220
and it's actually probably a lot easier
than I expected all you got to do set up

104
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,230
than I expected all you got to do set up
 

105
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,699
than I expected all you got to do set up
some lamps I have 13 of them here run

106
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:31,709
some lamps I have 13 of them here run
 

107
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,000
some lamps I have 13 of them here run
some redstone over top we'll go up to

108
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,010
some redstone over top we'll go up to
 

109
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,550
some redstone over top we'll go up to
here then the comparator into a hopper

110
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
here then the comparator into a hopper
 

111
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,199
here then the comparator into a hopper
kind of like a hopper clock thing where

112
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,209
kind of like a hopper clock thing where
 

113
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,309
kind of like a hopper clock thing where
you have two cooperates facing each

114
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:43,319
you have two cooperates facing each
 

115
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,530
you have two cooperates facing each
other and then depending on which one of

116
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,540
other and then depending on which one of
 

117
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,839
other and then depending on which one of
these is powered it'll control whether

118
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:49,849
these is powered it'll control whether
 

119
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,069
these is powered it'll control whether
the enderpearls we have here are going

120
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:52,079
the enderpearls we have here are going
 

121
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,740
the enderpearls we have here are going
to flow into this hopper or this one so

122
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:54,750
to flow into this hopper or this one so
 

123
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,350
to flow into this hopper or this one so
we'll put in quite a few hundred pearls

124
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
we'll put in quite a few hundred pearls
 

125
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,690
we'll put in quite a few hundred pearls
here right now that is bouncing back and

126
00:02:59,690 --> 00:02:59,700
here right now that is bouncing back and
 

127
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,100
here right now that is bouncing back and
forth right so what we want to do is

128
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,110
forth right so what we want to do is
 

129
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,979
forth right so what we want to do is
probably set up like a sticky piston

130
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:05,989
probably set up like a sticky piston
 

131
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,720
probably set up like a sticky piston
with a redstone block and like if it's

132
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:08,730
with a redstone block and like if it's
 

133
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,699
with a redstone block and like if it's
here this hoppers locked so they all go

134
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:10,709
here this hoppers locked so they all go
 

135
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,050
here this hoppers locked so they all go
into here if we extend it then they flow

136
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,060
into here if we extend it then they flow
 

137
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,180
into here if we extend it then they flow
into this one and the light recedes how

138
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,190
into this one and the light recedes how
 

139
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,039
into this one and the light recedes how
quickly is that going to happen here

140
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,049
quickly is that going to happen here
 

141
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,039
quickly is that going to happen here
pretty slow okay so that might be one of

142
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,049
pretty slow okay so that might be one of
 

143
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,020
pretty slow okay so that might be one of
the challenges is how do we speed that

144
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,030
the challenges is how do we speed that
 

145
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,160
the challenges is how do we speed that
up okay so I thought we would detect it

146
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,170
up okay so I thought we would detect it
 

147
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,190
up okay so I thought we would detect it
out here before we do anything so at max

148
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,200
out here before we do anything so at max
 

149
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,110
out here before we do anything so at max
brightness this is what the floor

150
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,120
brightness this is what the floor
 

151
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,660
brightness this is what the floor
lighting looks like and then we have the

152
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:38,670
lighting looks like and then we have the
 

153
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,759
lighting looks like and then we have the
switch over here flip that and they'll

154
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:40,769
switch over here flip that and they'll
 

155
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,809
switch over here flip that and they'll
start fading out start fading out yeah

156
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:44,819
start fading out start fading out yeah
 

157
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,660
start fading out start fading out yeah
there we go so I think that actually

158
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:47,670
there we go so I think that actually
 

159
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,420
there we go so I think that actually
looks kind of cool I do like it but it's

160
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,430
looks kind of cool I do like it but it's
 

161
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,059
looks kind of cool I do like it but it's
it's way too slow right we want a faster

162
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:53,069
it's way too slow right we want a faster
 

163
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,949
it's way too slow right we want a faster
fade effect for it to look cool

164
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
fade effect for it to look cool
 

165
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,740
fade effect for it to look cool
I think that's neat you can switch it at

166
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:57,750
I think that's neat you can switch it at
 

167
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,400
I think that's neat you can switch it at
any time it will fade in or out also I

168
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,410
any time it will fade in or out also I
 

169
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,349
any time it will fade in or out also I
just wanted to try putting tools in the

170
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:03,359
just wanted to try putting tools in the
 

171
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,509
just wanted to try putting tools in the
hoppers instead of enderpearls so they

172
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
hoppers instead of enderpearls so they
 

173
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,670
hoppers instead of enderpearls so they
have that the advantage of stacking 1 /

174
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
have that the advantage of stacking 1 /
 

175
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,460
have that the advantage of stacking 1 /
1 / stack instead of 16 per stack like

176
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,470
1 / stack instead of 16 per stack like
 

177
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,089
1 / stack instead of 16 per stack like
enderpearls

178
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:11,099
enderpearls
 

179
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,259
enderpearls
which means this will be 16 times faster

180
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:14,269
which means this will be 16 times faster
 

181
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,699
which means this will be 16 times faster
but it's too quick

182
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:16,709
but it's too quick
 

183
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,099
but it's too quick
it's tipping every three light so it's a

184
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:19,109
it's tipping every three light so it's a
 

185
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,900
it's tipping every three light so it's a
very chunky fade in and out

186
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:22,910
very chunky fade in and out
 

187
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,890
very chunky fade in and out
ideally we would want something that

188
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:24,900
ideally we would want something that
 

189
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,580
ideally we would want something that
stacks 2/3 which doesn't exist so we

190
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:28,590
stacks 2/3 which doesn't exist so we
 

191
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,990
stacks 2/3 which doesn't exist so we
might need to do something fancy with

192
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
might need to do something fancy with
 

193
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,990
might need to do something fancy with
redstone to make that happen got ya all

194
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
redstone to make that happen got ya all
 

195
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,700
redstone to make that happen got ya all
right it's a very cool guy so I tried a

196
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:37,710
right it's a very cool guy so I tried a
 

197
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,890
right it's a very cool guy so I tried a
few different designs out here and I

198
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:39,900
few different designs out here and I
 

199
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,960
few different designs out here and I
think we came across the winner so check

200
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:41,970
think we came across the winner so check
 

201
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,810
think we came across the winner so check
this one out so I have it hooked up to

202
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:44,820
this one out so I have it hooked up to
 

203
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,219
this one out so I have it hooked up to
this pressure plate right now stare to

204
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:46,229
this pressure plate right now stare to
 

205
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,860
this pressure plate right now stare to
this torch so if we step on it mmm

206
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:50,870
this torch so if we step on it mmm
 

207
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,029
this torch so if we step on it mmm
and if we hop off mmm pretty good right

208
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:56,039
and if we hop off mmm pretty good right
 

209
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,680
and if we hop off mmm pretty good right
like that is the speed I was hoping for

210
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:57,690
like that is the speed I was hoping for
 

211
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,339
like that is the speed I was hoping for
on this and it's a smooth transition I

212
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:00,349
on this and it's a smooth transition I
 

213
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:05,050
on this and it's a smooth transition I
think that's really good and like

214
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,060
think that's really good and like
 

215
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,219
think that's really good and like
another thing about this we're in a very

216
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:07,229
another thing about this we're in a very
 

217
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,499
another thing about this we're in a very
clean sterile room right now like it's

218
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:09,509
clean sterile room right now like it's
 

219
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,350
clean sterile room right now like it's
totally flat floor very plain texture I

220
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
totally flat floor very plain texture I
 

221
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,060
totally flat floor very plain texture I
think if we were to put this in a room

222
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,070
think if we were to put this in a room
 

223
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,310
think if we were to put this in a room
that was a bit more chaotic um

224
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
that was a bit more chaotic um
 

225
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
that was a bit more chaotic um
and had like walls and stuff around the

226
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,330
and had like walls and stuff around the
 

227
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,469
and had like walls and stuff around the
fade effect would look even cooler let's

228
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:21,479
fade effect would look even cooler let's
 

229
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,899
fade effect would look even cooler let's
just try that out very dangerous to you

230
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:23,909
just try that out very dangerous to you
 

231
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,140
just try that out very dangerous to you
by the way I got a record just a moment

232
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,150
by the way I got a record just a moment
 

233
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,680
by the way I got a record just a moment
ago pretty happy about that all right so

234
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:30,690
ago pretty happy about that all right so
 

235
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:37,850
ago pretty happy about that all right so
now oh oh what happened there aha so you

236
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:37,860
now oh oh what happened there aha so you
 

237
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,379
now oh oh what happened there aha so you
can see the fade effect on the blocks on

238
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:39,389
can see the fade effect on the blocks on
 

239
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,210
can see the fade effect on the blocks on
on the side there looks pretty nice I

240
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,220
on the side there looks pretty nice I
 

241
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,659
on the side there looks pretty nice I
think so one downside about this design

242
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:44,669
think so one downside about this design
 

243
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,640
think so one downside about this design
is we have to make a sacrifice instead

244
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:46,650
is we have to make a sacrifice instead
 

245
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,210
is we have to make a sacrifice instead
of I'll show you that too instead of 13

246
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,220
of I'll show you that too instead of 13
 

247
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,930
of I'll show you that too instead of 13
lamps we're doing nine now and it's

248
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:53,940
lamps we're doing nine now and it's
 

249
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,149
lamps we're doing nine now and it's
almost not noticeable try to try to make

250
00:05:59,149 --> 00:05:59,159
almost not noticeable try to try to make
 

251
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,450
almost not noticeable try to try to make
an episode here buddy get out of my face

252
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:02,460
an episode here buddy get out of my face
 

253
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,320
an episode here buddy get out of my face
I better eat something here quick if

254
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,330
I better eat something here quick if
 

255
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,430
I better eat something here quick if
you're wondering why I have the pumpkin

256
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
you're wondering why I have the pumpkin
 

257
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,560
you're wondering why I have the pumpkin
pie it's because I did the trading with

258
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:09,570
pie it's because I did the trading with
 

259
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,480
pie it's because I did the trading with
that farmer villager from our pumpkin

260
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,490
that farmer villager from our pumpkin
 

261
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,570
that farmer villager from our pumpkin
farm and had to buy some pumpkin pie off

262
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,580
farm and had to buy some pumpkin pie off
 

263
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,140
farm and had to buy some pumpkin pie off
of them done lock the trades yeah one

264
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,150
of them done lock the trades yeah one
 

265
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,790
of them done lock the trades yeah one
downside is because we're using nine

266
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:19,800
downside is because we're using nine
 

267
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,740
downside is because we're using nine
lamps we had to sacrifice a little bit

268
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:21,750
lamps we had to sacrifice a little bit
 

269
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,649
lamps we had to sacrifice a little bit
of the fade so when it gets down to near

270
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:24,659
of the fade so when it gets down to near
 

271
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,600
of the fade so when it gets down to near
totally faded out you see it just kind

272
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,610
totally faded out you see it just kind
 

273
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,370
totally faded out you see it just kind
of disappeared there didn't it fade all

274
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,380
of disappeared there didn't it fade all
 

275
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,499
of disappeared there didn't it fade all
the way down

276
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:30,509
the way down
 

277
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,179
the way down
it's almost not noticeable though so I

278
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:32,189
it's almost not noticeable though so I
 

279
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:35,209
it's almost not noticeable though so I
think it's okay but let's go check this

280
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:35,219
think it's okay but let's go check this
 

281
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:41,119
think it's okay but let's go check this
out so you weren't here a moment ago so

282
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:41,129
out so you weren't here a moment ago so
 

283
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,439
out so you weren't here a moment ago so
it's basically the same thing as we did

284
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:42,449
it's basically the same thing as we did
 

285
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,480
it's basically the same thing as we did
before with the hoppers except for using

286
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,490
before with the hoppers except for using
 

287
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,459
before with the hoppers except for using
droppers now and these are full of

288
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:46,469
droppers now and these are full of
 

289
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:50,390
droppers now and these are full of
swords so had to do like a zig-zag

290
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
swords so had to do like a zig-zag
 

291
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,839
swords so had to do like a zig-zag
pattern here with the redstone so

292
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:52,849
pattern here with the redstone so
 

293
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,749
pattern here with the redstone so
whenever one sword goes into here one

294
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:56,759
whenever one sword goes into here one
 

295
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,640
whenever one sword goes into here one
lamp turns on because of this pattern

296
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:58,650
lamp turns on because of this pattern
 

297
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,959
lamp turns on because of this pattern
because sometimes the redstone signal

298
00:06:59,959 --> 00:06:59,969
because sometimes the redstone signal
 

299
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,050
because sometimes the redstone signal
extends by 2 or 3 and this is a pattern

300
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,060
extends by 2 or 3 and this is a pattern
 

301
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,790
extends by 2 or 3 and this is a pattern
that that works so I just came up with

302
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
that that works so I just came up with
 

303
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,769
that that works so I just came up with
this I've done this before but it it my

304
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:09,779
this I've done this before but it it my
 

305
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,300
this I've done this before but it it my
old method of this didn't work in this

306
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,310
old method of this didn't work in this
 

307
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,100
old method of this didn't work in this
case because we have the clay blocks

308
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,110
case because we have the clay blocks
 

309
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,510
case because we have the clay blocks
above here so I had to come up with a

310
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,520
above here so I had to come up with a
 

311
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,939
above here so I had to come up with a
different pattern and this seems to work

312
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:16,949
different pattern and this seems to work
 

313
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:19,640
different pattern and this seems to work
and one other thing about this is we

314
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:19,650
and one other thing about this is we
 

315
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,559
and one other thing about this is we
have a clock running here I cheated a

316
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:21,569
have a clock running here I cheated a
 

317
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,489
have a clock running here I cheated a
little bit I turn the sound down uh-huh

318
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:25,499
little bit I turn the sound down uh-huh
 

319
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:28,070
little bit I turn the sound down uh-huh
what we got to do is have some way of

320
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
what we got to do is have some way of
 

321
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,659
what we got to do is have some way of
shutting this off in the final version

322
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:29,669
shutting this off in the final version
 

323
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,149
shutting this off in the final version
of this so when this dropper is full or

324
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:32,159
of this so when this dropper is full or
 

325
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,420
of this so when this dropper is full or
empty then we want to tell this clock to

326
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,430
empty then we want to tell this clock to
 

327
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,980
empty then we want to tell this clock to
shut off I think and then when we step

328
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:36,990
shut off I think and then when we step
 

329
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,629
shut off I think and then when we step
on the pressure plates or flip a lever

330
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
on the pressure plates or flip a lever
 

331
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,089
on the pressure plates or flip a lever
we want to turn on again and also

332
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:43,099
we want to turn on again and also
 

333
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,619
we want to turn on again and also
control this piston you'll notice it

334
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:45,629
control this piston you'll notice it
 

335
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:47,269
control this piston you'll notice it
doesn't make any noise while it's fading

336
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:47,279
doesn't make any noise while it's fading
 

337
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,929
doesn't make any noise while it's fading
in or out so if we can just shut it off

338
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:50,939
in or out so if we can just shut it off
 

339
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,399
in or out so if we can just shut it off
when we don't need to be running then it

340
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:52,409
when we don't need to be running then it
 

341
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,159
when we don't need to be running then it
will be nice and smooth

342
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,169
will be nice and smooth
 

343
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,499
will be nice and smooth
aha another cool thing about this

344
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:57,509
aha another cool thing about this
 

345
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,449
aha another cool thing about this
because we're using a comparator clock

346
00:07:59,449 --> 00:07:59,459
because we're using a comparator clock
 

347
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,199
because we're using a comparator clock
one way we can affect the amount of time

348
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,209
one way we can affect the amount of time
 

349
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,320
one way we can affect the amount of time
it takes is by just adjusting these

350
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,330
it takes is by just adjusting these
 

351
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,869
it takes is by just adjusting these
repeaters here so if we wanted to like

352
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
repeaters here so if we wanted to like
 

353
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,670
repeaters here so if we wanted to like
stayed in quicker than it fades out for

354
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:10,680
stayed in quicker than it fades out for
 

355
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,079
stayed in quicker than it fades out for
example we could set one of these two

356
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,089
example we could set one of these two
 

357
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:18,350
example we could set one of these two
two and neither one two one and I think

358
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,360
two and neither one two one and I think
 

359
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,230
two and neither one two one and I think
I broke this actually let's let's go

360
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
I broke this actually let's let's go
 

361

we got the boss monster got my gear back
alright to drop anything non-essential

412
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,310
alright to drop anything non-essential
 

413
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,140
alright to drop anything non-essential
here

414
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,150
here
 

415
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:06,730

Oh Pistons I want those back um actually

416
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:06,740
Oh Pistons I want those back um actually
 

417
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,910
Oh Pistons I want those back um actually
tell you what let's block this okay

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:08,920
tell you what let's block this okay
 

419
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,990
tell you what let's block this okay
because we could have another accident

420
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,000
because we could have another accident
 

421
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,560
because we could have another accident
here otherwise okay so we're back to

422
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:14,570
here otherwise okay so we're back to
 

423
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,690
here otherwise okay so we're back to
business here the nice thing about this

424
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:16,700
business here the nice thing about this
 

425
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,460
business here the nice thing about this
design that I wanted to show you just by

426
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:18,470
design that I wanted to show you just by
 

427
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,770
design that I wanted to show you just by
changing those repeaters now we can

428
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:20,780
changing those repeaters now we can
 

429
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,320
changing those repeaters now we can
easily adjust the time it takes to fade

430
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,330
easily adjust the time it takes to fade
 

431
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,600
easily adjust the time it takes to fade
in and out so this is with the fade in

432
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:25,610
in and out so this is with the fade in
 

433
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,600
in and out so this is with the fade in
at 1 and the fade out at 2 you see it's

434
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,610
at 1 and the fade out at 2 you see it's
 

435
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,710
at 1 and the fade out at 2 you see it's
twice as slow to fade out as to fade in

436
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:31,720
twice as slow to fade out as to fade in
 

437
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,420
twice as slow to fade out as to fade in
so you can control it really easily just

438
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:34,430
so you can control it really easily just
 

439
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,510
so you can control it really easily just
by changing those repeaters alright

440
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:37,520
by changing those repeaters alright
 

441
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,710
by changing those repeaters alright
everybody so let's take a little break

442
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
everybody so let's take a little break
 

443
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,150
everybody so let's take a little break
from that and we're going to do a

444
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
from that and we're going to do a
 

445
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,420
from that and we're going to do a
follow-up on last

446
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,430
follow-up on last
 

447
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,940
follow-up on last
episode so you remember I was having a

448
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:43,950
episode so you remember I was having a
 

449
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,650
episode so you remember I was having a
lot of trouble with the minecarts some

450
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:45,660
lot of trouble with the minecarts some
 

451
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,420
lot of trouble with the minecarts some
of them were moving faster than others

452
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,430
of them were moving faster than others
 

453
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,670
of them were moving faster than others
and I did some tests I could not figure

454
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
and I did some tests I could not figure
 

455
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,760
and I did some tests I could not figure
out why I thought it was because mine

456
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:52,770
out why I thought it was because mine
 

457
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,470
out why I thought it was because mine
carts move faster when they have items

458
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
carts move faster when they have items
 

459
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,450
carts move faster when they have items
inside but when I tested it they moved

460
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,460
inside but when I tested it they moved
 

461
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,910
inside but when I tested it they moved
at the same speed and you guys pointed

462
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:58,920
at the same speed and you guys pointed
 

463
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,130
at the same speed and you guys pointed
out my test was flawed because when I

464
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,140
out my test was flawed because when I
 

465
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,519
out my test was flawed because when I
tried it I had nothing but power rails I

466
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:04,529
tried it I had nothing but power rails I
 

467
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,380
tried it I had nothing but power rails I
didn't have any regular rails and that

468
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,390
didn't have any regular rails and that
 

469
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,310
didn't have any regular rails and that
sounds correct to me so we're going to

470
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
sounds correct to me so we're going to
 

471
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,889
sounds correct to me so we're going to
try it again here two hopper mine carts

472
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:12,899
try it again here two hopper mine carts
 

473
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,570
try it again here two hopper mine carts
we're going to throw items in one of

474
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:14,580
we're going to throw items in one of
 

475
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,769
we're going to throw items in one of
them one of them will leave empty and

476
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:15,779
them one of them will leave empty and
 

477
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,210
them one of them will leave empty and
we'll see if they move at the same speed

478
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,220
we'll see if they move at the same speed
 

479
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,410
we'll see if they move at the same speed
or not I really messed this up did I

480
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,420
or not I really messed this up did I
 

481
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,079
or not I really messed this up did I
okay well well bridge the gap here

482
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:24,089
okay well well bridge the gap here
 

483
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,310
okay well well bridge the gap here
because we got to activate these at the

484
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:25,320
because we got to activate these at the
 

485
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,769
because we got to activate these at the
same time we'll put the leaver like this

486
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:27,779
same time we'll put the leaver like this
 

487
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,560
same time we'll put the leaver like this
okay this should work

488
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:29,570
okay this should work
 

489
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,670
okay this should work
okay so right now they're moving at the

490
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
okay so right now they're moving at the
 

491
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,430
okay so right now they're moving at the
same speed but they should lose speed on

492
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:34,440
same speed but they should lose speed on
 

493
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,910
same speed but they should lose speed on
the unpowered rails here right once they

494
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
the unpowered rails here right once they
 

495
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,769
the unpowered rails here right once they
get items is was the theory anyways so

496
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:42,779
get items is was the theory anyways so
 

497
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,060
get items is was the theory anyways so
give it a bunch of items and they're

498
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,070
give it a bunch of items and they're
 

499
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,640
give it a bunch of items and they're
still going at the same yeah they look

500
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,650
still going at the same yeah they look
 

501
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,560
still going at the same yeah they look
neck-and-neck to me maybe we needed a

502
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,570
neck-and-neck to me maybe we needed a
 

503
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,519
neck-and-neck to me maybe we needed a
longer track uh-huh okay so that seems

504
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:55,529
longer track uh-huh okay so that seems
 

505
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:57,050
longer track uh-huh okay so that seems
to be what it is guys these are both

506
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,060
to be what it is guys these are both
 

507
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,390
to be what it is guys these are both
empty right now we'll turn this on

508
00:11:59,390 --> 00:11:59,400
empty right now we'll turn this on
 

509
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,000
empty right now we'll turn this on
they'll stay neck-and-neck but we got

510
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,010
they'll stay neck-and-neck but we got
 

511
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,320
they'll stay neck-and-neck but we got
rid of some of the power rails here so

512
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,330
rid of some of the power rails here so
 

513
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,910
rid of some of the power rails here so
they have a bigger opportunity to slow

514
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:04,920
they have a bigger opportunity to slow
 

515
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,040
they have a bigger opportunity to slow
down and it's when they're going slow

516
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,050
down and it's when they're going slow
 

517
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,310
down and it's when they're going slow
that they start to drift apart here so

518
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
that they start to drift apart here so
 

519
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,269
that they start to drift apart here so
with just one item can't really see much

520
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:14,279
with just one item can't really see much
 

521
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,850
with just one item can't really see much
of a difference right so it's not like

522
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:16,860
of a difference right so it's not like
 

523
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,040
of a difference right so it's not like
one item makes makes or breaks it it's

524
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,050
one item makes makes or breaks it it's
 

525
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,949
one item makes makes or breaks it it's
when it starts to get a bunch of items

526
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:23,959

 

527
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,690

you see they're starting to trail off a

528
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:26,700
you see they're starting to trail off a
 

529
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,150
you see they're starting to trail off a
little bit this one's slowing down the

530
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,160
little bit this one's slowing down the
 

531
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,090
little bit this one's slowing down the
one width item slows down and if we give

532
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,100
one width item slows down and if we give
 

533
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,130
one width item slows down and if we give
it a lot items then there's a big change

534
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,140
it a lot items then there's a big change
 

535
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,269
it a lot items then there's a big change
see that aha so we figured it out all

536
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
see that aha so we figured it out all
 

537
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,740
see that aha so we figured it out all
right anyways that's not an issue

538
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:42,750
right anyways that's not an issue
 

539
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,260
right anyways that's not an issue
anymore I did redo the track since last

540
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,270
anymore I did redo the track since last
 

541
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,600
anymore I did redo the track since last
episode so we got this all finished got

542
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:47,610
episode so we got this all finished got
 

543
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,280
episode so we got this all finished got
rid of all the T intersections and it's

544
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,290
rid of all the T intersections and it's
 

545
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,579
rid of all the T intersections and it's
one straight track all the way down now

546
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:51,589
one straight track all the way down now
 

547
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:54,700
one straight track all the way down now
so this should be good

548
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:54,710
so this should be good
 

549
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,480
so this should be good
alright guys we're going to check out

550
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,490
alright guys we're going to check out
 

551
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,060
alright guys we're going to check out
something pretty trippy here I just used

552
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,070
something pretty trippy here I just used
 

553
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,060
something pretty trippy here I just used
a rocket down this tunnel over here and

554
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,070
a rocket down this tunnel over here and
 

555
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,820
a rocket down this tunnel over here and
it creates a really weird effect it's

556
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:04,830
it creates a really weird effect it's
 

557
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,410
it creates a really weird effect it's
kind of hard to fly down here but if we

558
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,420
kind of hard to fly down here but if we
 

559
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,920
kind of hard to fly down here but if we
can let's get rid of the cursor - okay

560
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:09,930
can let's get rid of the cursor - okay
 

561
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,490
can let's get rid of the cursor - okay
here we go here we go

562
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:12,500
here we go here we go
 

563
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,750
here we go here we go
there we go Oh some of the the chunks

564
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
there we go Oh some of the the chunks
 

565
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,900
there we go Oh some of the the chunks
are disappearing isn't that weird I

566
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:20,910
are disappearing isn't that weird I
 

567
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,790
are disappearing isn't that weird I
don't know what it is it's I guess it's

568
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
don't know what it is it's I guess it's
 

569
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,120
don't know what it is it's I guess it's
a quick flash of stone that makes it

570
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,130
a quick flash of stone that makes it
 

571
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,130
a quick flash of stone that makes it
really odd I keep hitting my head on the

572
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,140
really odd I keep hitting my head on the
 

573
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,040
really odd I keep hitting my head on the
on the top here - not a lot of leeway

574
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,050
on the top here - not a lot of leeway
 

575
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,530
on the top here - not a lot of leeway
well that's my stop

576
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:32,540
well that's my stop
 

577
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,810
well that's my stop
ah-ha this goes to the guardian farm -

578
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:35,820
ah-ha this goes to the guardian farm -
 

579
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,890
ah-ha this goes to the guardian farm -
now by the way I put in a little

580
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:36,900
now by the way I put in a little
 

581
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,830
now by the way I put in a little
shortcut which we don't need to go to

582
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:39,840
shortcut which we don't need to go to
 

583
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,860
shortcut which we don't need to go to
but it's a way to get to the mushroom

584
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:42,870
but it's a way to get to the mushroom
 

585
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,570
but it's a way to get to the mushroom
farm quickly yeah so now that that track

586
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:47,580
farm quickly yeah so now that that track
 

587
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,160
farm quickly yeah so now that that track
is done I think we're going to do one

588
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,170
is done I think we're going to do one
 

589
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,690
is done I think we're going to do one
more run-through of the mushroom farm

590
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:50,700
more run-through of the mushroom farm
 

591
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,880
more run-through of the mushroom farm
together here because I got the

592
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:52,890
together here because I got the
 

593
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,380
together here because I got the
impression some of you might have been a

594
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,390
impression some of you might have been a
 

595
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,810
impression some of you might have been a
little disappointed last episode we

596
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:56,820
little disappointed last episode we
 

597
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,660
little disappointed last episode we
didn't see the fully finished thing even

598
00:13:59,660 --> 00:13:59,670
didn't see the fully finished thing even
 

599
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,830
didn't see the fully finished thing even
though I thought we covered it pretty

600
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:00,840
though I thought we covered it pretty
 

601
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,700
though I thought we covered it pretty
well but yeah just to be sure here so

602
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:04,710
well but yeah just to be sure here so
 

603
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,840
well but yeah just to be sure here so
I'm going to try run through this pretty

604
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:05,850
I'm going to try run through this pretty
 

605
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,940
I'm going to try run through this pretty
quick grow the mushrooms then we chop

606
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:07,950
quick grow the mushrooms then we chop
 

607
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,440
quick grow the mushrooms then we chop
them down run along here both sides

608
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,450
them down run along here both sides
 

609
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:18,590
them down run along here both sides
oh I fall down again I do that every

610
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,600
oh I fall down again I do that every
 

611
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,050
oh I fall down again I do that every
time okay so now that we chopped down

612
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,060
time okay so now that we chopped down
 

613
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,880
time okay so now that we chopped down
the most most of the mushroom we got to

614
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:22,890
the most most of the mushroom we got to
 

615
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,280
the most most of the mushroom we got to
get the stalks I think it was this

616
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,290
get the stalks I think it was this
 

617
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,250
get the stalks I think it was this
button right we just press that once

618
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,260
button right we just press that once
 

619
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,870
button right we just press that once
then I run down the middle here take out

620
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:29,880
then I run down the middle here take out
 

621
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,250
then I run down the middle here take out
the middle middle stalks alright this

622
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:34,260
the middle middle stalks alright this
 

623
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,540
the middle middle stalks alright this
looks pretty good I didn't see any

624
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:35,550
looks pretty good I didn't see any
 

625
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,290
looks pretty good I didn't see any
problems I'm going to throw a couple

626
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:38,300
problems I'm going to throw a couple
 

627
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,460
problems I'm going to throw a couple
tracks on the ground here - that will

628
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:40,470
tracks on the ground here - that will
 

629
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,190
tracks on the ground here - that will
play an important Slater here but now

630
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:43,200
play an important Slater here but now
 

631
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,330
play an important Slater here but now
that we got them all chopped down we've

632

get the water streams running which will

636
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,270
get the water streams running which will
 

637
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,210
get the water streams running which will
push them all all the blocks to the

638
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,220
push them all all the blocks to the
 

639
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,510
push them all all the blocks to the
middles down the hole and then we got to

640
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:53,520
middles down the hole and then we got to
 

641
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,430
middles down the hole and then we got to
pick it up with our newly made minecart

642
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
pick it up with our newly made minecart
 

643
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,760
pick it up with our newly made minecart
track so that was over here press a

644
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:58,770
track so that was over here press a
 

645
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,380
track so that was over here press a
button they should run down and

button they should run down and
 

647
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,820
button they should run down and
hopefully not collide with each other

648
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:01,830
hopefully not collide with each other
 

649
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:07,900
hopefully not collide with each other
this time after the change

650
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:07,910

 

651
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,800

break the redstone somewhere
 

655
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,220

what's going on I did do something weird

656
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,230
what's going on I did do something weird

problem oh okay I accidentally broke the
 

661
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,670
problem oh okay I accidentally broke the
redstone line at some point and changed

662
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:28,680
redstone line at some point and changed
 

663
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
redstone line at some point and changed
it I didn't think it would matter okay

664
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,170
it I didn't think it would matter okay
 

665

so these are writing down they're

666
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,220
so these are writing down they're
 

667
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,980
so these are writing down they're
picking up the mushroom blocks through

668
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:33,990
picking up the mushroom blocks through
 

669
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,600
picking up the mushroom blocks through
the grounds looks like hopefully they

670
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:38,610
the grounds looks like hopefully they
 

671
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,130
the grounds looks like hopefully they
are anyways let's just double-check here

672
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,140
are anyways let's just double-check here
 

673
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,440
are anyways let's just double-check here
we'll run ahead this one should have

674
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,450
we'll run ahead this one should have
 

675
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,470
we'll run ahead this one should have
something by now know if we can catch up

676
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:45,480
something by now know if we can catch up
 

677
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,870
something by now know if we can catch up
this one it should have in now yeah okay

678
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:47,880
this one it should have in now yeah okay
 

679
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,570
this one it should have in now yeah okay
so dig get some whoo

680
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:50,580
so dig get some whoo
 

681
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,600
so dig get some whoo
all right run down the line here so

682
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:53,610
all right run down the line here so
 

683
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,580
all right run down the line here so
they've been they returned back to the

684
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:55,590
they've been they returned back to the
 

685
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,720
they've been they returned back to the
PEZ dispenser stack and unload I think

686
00:15:59,720 --> 00:15:59,730
PEZ dispenser stack and unload I think
 

687
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,550
PEZ dispenser stack and unload I think
they all finished

688
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:01,560
they all finished
 

689
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,410
they all finished
I made one change here since last

690
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:03,420
I made one change here since last
 

691
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,060
I made one change here since last
episode as well so they're unloading

692
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,070
episode as well so they're unloading
 

693
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,100
episode as well so they're unloading
here I added in a item filter so I was

694
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,110
here I added in a item filter so I was
 

695
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,800
here I added in a item filter so I was
worried I get those power rails land on

696
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:12,810
worried I get those power rails land on
 

697
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,830
worried I get those power rails land on
on the ground there or zombie flesh or

698
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:15,840
on the ground there or zombie flesh or
 

699
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,290
on the ground there or zombie flesh or
bones or something it would end up in

700
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:18,300
bones or something it would end up in
 

701
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,600
bones or something it would end up in
our storage chests there go to our

702
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:20,610
our storage chests there go to our
 

703
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,610
our storage chests there go to our
furnaces and then clog our furnaces so I

704
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:22,620
furnaces and then clog our furnaces so I
 

705
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,700
furnaces and then clog our furnaces so I
decide to separate the garbage so that

706
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:25,710
decide to separate the garbage so that
 

707
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,170
decide to separate the garbage so that
how our rails should end up in this

708
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:27,180
how our rails should end up in this
 

709
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,750
how our rails should end up in this
garbage chest instead of in our storage

710
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:29,760
garbage chest instead of in our storage
 

711
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,000
garbage chest instead of in our storage
chests here now but yeah this will fill

712
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,010
chests here now but yeah this will fill
 

713
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,860
chests here now but yeah this will fill
up with mushrooms and then that should

714
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:33,870
up with mushrooms and then that should
 

715
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,890
up with mushrooms and then that should
head off once it's totally full to the

716
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:36,900
head off once it's totally full to the
 

717
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,040
head off once it's totally full to the
super smelter down the track here okay

718
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,050
super smelter down the track here okay
 

719
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,330
super smelter down the track here okay
it looks like it's just about done

720
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,340
it looks like it's just about done
 

721
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,020
it looks like it's just about done
unloading here I left it for a while

722
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,030
unloading here I left it for a while
 

723
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,220
unloading here I left it for a while
okay just finished I'm going to throw in

724
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,230
okay just finished I'm going to throw in
 

725
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,110
okay just finished I'm going to throw in
some redstone torches here too just to

726
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,120
some redstone torches here too just to
 

727
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,930
some redstone torches here too just to
show you the garbage filter so if we go

728
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:50,940
show you the garbage filter so if we go
 

729
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,280
show you the garbage filter so if we go
down again they ended up in G in here as

730
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,290
down again they ended up in G in here as
 

731
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,720
down again they ended up in G in here as
well as our power rails and I guess

732
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:56,730
well as our power rails and I guess
 

733
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,980
well as our power rails and I guess
there was a mushroom somewhere on the

734
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:57,990
there was a mushroom somewhere on the
 

735
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,170
there was a mushroom somewhere on the
track so if all those items when it's

736
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:00,180
track so if all those items when it's
 

737
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,520
track so if all those items when it's
the storage minecart here they would

738
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,530
the storage minecart here they would
 

739
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,560
the storage minecart here they would
have clogged the furnaces so now we have

740
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,570
have clogged the furnaces so now we have
 

741
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,800
have clogged the furnaces so now we have
a safety net for that so that's good

742
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:05,810
a safety net for that so that's good
 

743
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,750
a safety net for that so that's good
from one harvest this is how my mushroom

744
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:08,760
from one harvest this is how my mushroom
 

745
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,420
from one harvest this is how my mushroom
blocks we got not quite a full minecart

746
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:11,430
blocks we got not quite a full minecart
 

747
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,390
blocks we got not quite a full minecart
chest here but just about these other

751
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,750
ones I have in my inventory was from a
previous chopped down so I'm going to

752
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
previous chopped down so I'm going to
 

753
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,310
previous chopped down so I'm going to
put these in here just to make sure this

754
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,320
put these in here just to make sure this
 

755
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,180
put these in here just to make sure this
works is

756
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,190
works is
 

757
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,010
works is
well let those go in so once it fills up

758

that's going to head off to the super

764
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,400
that's going to head off to the super
 

765
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,570
that's going to head off to the super
smeltery so we'll go chase it awesome so

766
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:38,580
smeltery so we'll go chase it awesome so
 

767
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,130
smeltery so we'll go chase it awesome so
yeah it looks like our unloaders working

yeah it looks like our unloaders working
 

769
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,260
yeah it looks like our unloaders working
here as well so the mushroom blocks are

770
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,270
here as well so the mushroom blocks are
 

771
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,870
here as well so the mushroom blocks are
going into storage into the into the

going into storage into the into the
 

773
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,000
going into storage into the into the
fuel for the super smelter I'm going to

774
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,010
fuel for the super smelter I'm going to
 

775
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,560
fuel for the super smelter I'm going to
go ahead and just speed this up I'm

776
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,570
go ahead and just speed this up I'm
 

777
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,710
go ahead and just speed this up I'm
going to throw the mushrooms in manually

778
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
going to throw the mushrooms in manually
 

779
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,900
going to throw the mushrooms in manually
most of them will leave a few here all

780
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:53,910
most of them will leave a few here all
 

781
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,680
most of them will leave a few here all
right put that in here and probably do

782
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,690
right put that in here and probably do
 

783
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,260
right put that in here and probably do
another full load and just want to make

784

why so it definitely delivered the stuff
 

811
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,630
why so it definitely delivered the stuff
which means the stuff is probably in

812
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
which means the stuff is probably in
 

813
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,650
which means the stuff is probably in
waiting to be picked up somewhere here

814
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:05,660
waiting to be picked up somewhere here
 

815
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,620
waiting to be picked up somewhere here
and the other big thing is like if I

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:09,630
and the other big thing is like if I
 

817
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,440
and the other big thing is like if I
leave something after I finish it I

821
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,620
don't remember how it works so it's hard
to fix it if something goes wrong it's

to fix it if something goes wrong it's
 

823
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,480
to fix it if something goes wrong it's
like it's like this stuff got stuck in

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,490
like it's like this stuff got stuck in
 

825
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:27,520
like it's like this stuff got stuck in

826
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:27,530

 

827
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:34,480

yep looks like detective Ito cracked
another case guys I am on a roll today I

836
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,630
another case guys I am on a roll today I
 

837
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,750
another case guys I am on a roll today I
tell you what okay so I do have a plan

838
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:52,760
tell you what okay so I do have a plan
 

839
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,030
tell you what okay so I do have a plan
for the rest this episode now we're

840
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,040
for the rest this episode now we're
 

841
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,560
for the rest this episode now we're
going to get started on a project here

842
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:56,570
going to get started on a project here
 

843
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,020
going to get started on a project here
where do I want to start it I think that

844
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,030
where do I want to start it I think that
 

845
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,580
where do I want to start it I think that
was the spot this is that River by the

846
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:03,590
was the spot this is that River by the
 

847
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,800
was the spot this is that River by the
way you remember a long time ago I dug

848
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:05,810
way you remember a long time ago I dug
 

849
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,600
way you remember a long time ago I dug
this out connected the river all the way

850
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,610
this out connected the river all the way
 

851
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,110
this out connected the river all the way
so this is like an area we started but

852
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
so this is like an area we started but
 

853
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,170
so this is like an area we started but
never hit anything with I would like to

854
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:14,180
never hit anything with I would like to
 

855
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,540
never hit anything with I would like to
eventually maybe branch out this way

856
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:18,550
eventually maybe branch out this way
 

857
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,780
eventually maybe branch out this way
I've got our home sweet home here I

858
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:21,790
I've got our home sweet home here I
 

859
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,600
I've got our home sweet home here I
don't know how many of you remember that

860
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:24,610
don't know how many of you remember that
 

861
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,010
don't know how many of you remember that
so yeah we're going to start another

862
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,020
so yeah we're going to start another
 

863
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,830
so yeah we're going to start another
project in this vicinity on the

864
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
project in this vicinity on the
 

865
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,010
project in this vicinity on the
riverbank here I think right over here

866
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,020
riverbank here I think right over here
 

867
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,320
riverbank here I think right over here
so the plan is to take advantage of that

868
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,330
so the plan is to take advantage of that
 

869
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,790
so the plan is to take advantage of that
fade lighting idea I want to actually

870
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:39,800
fade lighting idea I want to actually
 

871
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,780
fade lighting idea I want to actually
use it in a build all right it's trying

872
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:43,790
use it in a build all right it's trying
 

873
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,040
use it in a build all right it's trying
to think what we could do what we could

874
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,050
to think what we could do what we could
 

875
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,410
to think what we could do what we could
do and then I remembered we never really

876
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:47,420
do and then I remembered we never really
 

877
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,150
do and then I remembered we never really
did anything with the Dragon Age in our

878
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,160
did anything with the Dragon Age in our
 

879
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,700
did anything with the Dragon Age in our
world here so we're going to make kind

880
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:51,710
world here so we're going to make kind
 

881
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,070
world here so we're going to make kind
of like a trophy room I guess for for

882
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
of like a trophy room I guess for for
 

883
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,720
of like a trophy room I guess for for
the dragon egg and I guess started here

884
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:58,730
the dragon egg and I guess started here
 

885
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,640
the dragon egg and I guess started here
so our goal is to make like a cool room

886
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:00,650
so our goal is to make like a cool room
 

887
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,040
so our goal is to make like a cool room
we wanted to have a lot of atmosphere

888
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,050
we wanted to have a lot of atmosphere
 

889
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,710
we wanted to have a lot of atmosphere

890
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:05,720
and seal epics and that kind of stuff we
 

891
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,020
and seal epics and that kind of stuff we
don't really we're not really going for

892
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,030
don't really we're not really going for
 

893
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,120
don't really we're not really going for
functionality with this it's just for

894
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,130
functionality with this it's just for
 

895
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,290
functionality with this it's just for
life show more so and I did a little bit

896
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:14,300
life show more so and I did a little bit
 

897
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,780
life show more so and I did a little bit
of building and creative already you

898
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:16,790
of building and creative already you
 

899
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,900
of building and creative already you
remember on mine crack the cobblestone

900
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:19,910
remember on mine crack the cobblestone
 

901
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,120
remember on mine crack the cobblestone
t-rex I wanted to see if I could do that

902
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,130
t-rex I wanted to see if I could do that
 

903

908
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:29,510
think it's good enough yeah so we're
 

909
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,270
think it's good enough yeah so we're
just going to try to get the entrance

910
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
just going to try to get the entrance
 

911
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,620
just going to try to get the entrance
done for today guys it's going to be

912
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:32,630
done for today guys it's going to be
 

913
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,580
done for today guys it's going to be
like a 2 3 episode projects if I was yes

914
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:35,590
like a 2 3 episode projects if I was yes
 

915
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,169
like a 2 3 episode projects if I was yes
and of course I always lowball so it's

916
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:38,179
and of course I always lowball so it's
 

917
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,120
and of course I always lowball so it's
probably to be more

918
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,130
probably to be more
 

919
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,960
probably to be more
but yeah so just baby steps here so we

920
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:43,970
but yeah so just baby steps here so we
 

921
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,890
but yeah so just baby steps here so we
have a double arch amazing right

922
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:47,900
have a double arch amazing right
 

923
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,100
have a double arch amazing right
horizontal arch meets vertical arch I'm

924
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,110
horizontal arch meets vertical arch I'm
 

925
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,930
horizontal arch meets vertical arch I'm
very creative this is like the frame to

926
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:55,940
very creative this is like the frame to
 

927
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,180
very creative this is like the frame to
our entrance I the statue we're building

928
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,190
our entrance I the statue we're building
 

929
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,590
our entrance I the statue we're building
is three blocks wide so I want to put

930
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
is three blocks wide so I want to put
 

931
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,390
is three blocks wide so I want to put
that in the middle here and then we're

932
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:01,400
that in the middle here and then we're
 

933
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,890
that in the middle here and then we're
going to have a staircase to go down

934
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:02,900
going to have a staircase to go down
 

935
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,040
going to have a staircase to go down
into the trophy room all right that's my

936
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,050
into the trophy room all right that's my
 

937
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,120
into the trophy room all right that's my
plan and I think we will do a mix of

938
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,130
plan and I think we will do a mix of
 

939
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,000
plan and I think we will do a mix of
cobble and sandstone brick stairs here

940
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,010
cobble and sandstone brick stairs here
 

941
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,480
cobble and sandstone brick stairs here
do the line down the middle and I want

942
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,490
do the line down the middle and I want
 

943
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,220
do the line down the middle and I want
the statute to be a little bit lower

944
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,230
the statute to be a little bit lower
 

945
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,230
the statute to be a little bit lower
than the ground level here because I I

946
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
than the ground level here because I I
 

947
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,820
than the ground level here because I I
noticed it looks too good when you look

948
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:21,830
noticed it looks too good when you look
 

949
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,450
noticed it looks too good when you look
at straight on edits I think what we'll

950
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:25,460
at straight on edits I think what we'll
 

951
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,540
at straight on edits I think what we'll
do is go down here as well and we'll

952
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:31,550
do is go down here as well and we'll
 

953
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,740
do is go down here as well and we'll
hollow this out and do something like

954
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:35,750
hollow this out and do something like
 

955
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,590
hollow this out and do something like
this well create like a second level

956
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:38,600
this well create like a second level
 

957
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,790
this well create like a second level
down here I think would look cool yeah

958
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:42,800
down here I think would look cool yeah
 

959
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,620
down here I think would look cool yeah
we'll do it like that we'll meet up with

960
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:44,630
we'll do it like that we'll meet up with
 

961
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,510
we'll do it like that we'll meet up with
the arch here let's put another block

962
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:46,520
the arch here let's put another block
 

963
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,460
the arch here let's put another block
over here this will all be grass make it

964
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,470
over here this will all be grass make it
 

965
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,850
over here this will all be grass make it
blend in with the nature and then maybe

966
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:54,860
blend in with the nature and then maybe
 

967
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,270
blend in with the nature and then maybe
we'll do another arch another horizontal

968
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:58,280
we'll do another arch another horizontal
 

969
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,750
we'll do another arch another horizontal
arch here and this will meet up with the

970
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
arch here and this will meet up with the
 

971
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:09,610
arch here and this will meet up with the
statue and it will keep going down yeah

972
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:09,620
statue and it will keep going down yeah
 

973
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,740
statue and it will keep going down yeah
I think this is about the shape we're

974
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:11,750
I think this is about the shape we're
 

975
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,260
I think this is about the shape we're
gonna go for I think this is good we're

976
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,270
gonna go for I think this is good we're
 

977
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,760
gonna go for I think this is good we're
not going to do an arch with the Santa

978
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:15,770
not going to do an arch with the Santa
 

979
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,750
not going to do an arch with the Santa
site it's probably going to be a

980
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:16,760
site it's probably going to be a
 

981
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,570
site it's probably going to be a
rectangle but I threw in an arch over

982
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:19,580
rectangle but I threw in an arch over
 

983
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,610
rectangle but I threw in an arch over
there and it's going to go up into like

984
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:21,620
there and it's going to go up into like
 

985
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,340
there and it's going to go up into like
a dome shape I think would be cool

986
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,350
a dome shape I think would be cool
 

987
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,680
a dome shape I think would be cool
aha the reason we're using clay might be

988
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:29,690
aha the reason we're using clay might be
 

989
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,540
aha the reason we're using clay might be
a little bit of an odd choice maybe but

990
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:31,550
a little bit of an odd choice maybe but
 

991
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,270
a little bit of an odd choice maybe but
I think I think it's a good idea because

992
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,280
I think I think it's a good idea because
 

993
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,240
I think I think it's a good idea because
it goes well with a grey stone which we

994
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,250
it goes well with a grey stone which we
 

995
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,340
it goes well with a grey stone which we
have a lot of here and if we didn't do

996
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,350
have a lot of here and if we didn't do
 

997
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,210
have a lot of here and if we didn't do
this it would be a very great build

998
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,220
this it would be a very great build
 

999
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,380
this it would be a very great build
because the statues going to be gray

1000
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,390
because the statues going to be gray
 

1001
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,340
because the statues going to be gray
here it's going to be made out of

1002
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,350
here it's going to be made out of
 

1003
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,770
here it's going to be made out of
cobblestone and with this as the

1004
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:47,780
cobblestone and with this as the
 

1005
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,350
cobblestone and with this as the
backdrop I think it'll make the statue

1006
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:50,360
backdrop I think it'll make the statue
 

1007
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,330
backdrop I think it'll make the statue
stand out more because you'll be able to

1008
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,340
stand out more because you'll be able to
 

1009
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,350
stand out more because you'll be able to
see it against the

1010
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
see it against the
 

1011
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,009
see it against the
different colored backdrop that way okay

1012
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:57,019
different colored backdrop that way okay
 

1013
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,799
different colored backdrop that way okay
so we have our eggshell entrance

1014
00:23:59,799 --> 00:23:59,809
so we have our eggshell entrance
 

1015
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:02,529
so we have our eggshell entrance
framework or whatever built and what you

1016
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:02,539
framework or whatever built and what you
 

1017
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:03,249
framework or whatever built and what you
would call it

1018
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:03,259
would call it
 

1019
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:06,009
would call it
I built a base for the Statue here maybe

1020
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:06,019
I built a base for the Statue here maybe
 

1021
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,840
I built a base for the Statue here maybe
we'll try to improve this a little bit

1022
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:07,850
we'll try to improve this a little bit
 

1023
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,680
we'll try to improve this a little bit
more pretty plain right now and then on

1024
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:11,690
more pretty plain right now and then on
 

1025
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,320
more pretty plain right now and then on
top is going to be the head then we have

1026
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,330
top is going to be the head then we have
 

1027
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,180
top is going to be the head then we have
our staircase to go down here this is

1028
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,190
our staircase to go down here this is
 

1029
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,950
our staircase to go down here this is
going to lead most likely to a long

1030
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:17,960
going to lead most likely to a long
 

1031
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,720
going to lead most likely to a long
hallway with lighting in as well

1032
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:19,730
hallway with lighting in as well
 

1033
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,999
hallway with lighting in as well
fade lighting and then at the end of the

1034
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:22,009
fade lighting and then at the end of the
 

1035
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:24,009
fade lighting and then at the end of the
hallway they'll be a room with the

1036
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:24,019
hallway they'll be a room with the
 

1037
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,649
hallway they'll be a room with the
dragon egg in and probably some more

1038
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:26,659
dragon egg in and probably some more
 

1039
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:29,830
dragon egg in and probably some more
lighting and stuff is the plan and you

1040
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
lighting and stuff is the plan and you
 

1041
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,859
lighting and stuff is the plan and you
can see over here behind the statute

1042
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:32,869
can see over here behind the statute
 

1043
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:34,210
can see over here behind the statute
we're going to put in fade lighting too

1044
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,220
we're going to put in fade lighting too
 

1045
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,239
we're going to put in fade lighting too
and hopefully make the head glowed in

1046
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:37,249
and hopefully make the head glowed in
 

1047
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:40,539
and hopefully make the head glowed in
different ways we'll see we'll have to

1048
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:40,549
different ways we'll see we'll have to
 

1049
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,979
different ways we'll see we'll have to
get into that next episode though

1050
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:41,989
get into that next episode though
 

1051
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:43,090
get into that next episode though
because we probably don't have time

1052
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,100
because we probably don't have time
 

1053
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,419
because we probably don't have time
today but yeah let's see if I can build

1054
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:46,429
today but yeah let's see if I can build
 

1055
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:49,419
today but yeah let's see if I can build
the head on camera here I tried to

1056
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:49,429
the head on camera here I tried to
 

1057
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:51,759
the head on camera here I tried to
memorize it because I built in creative

1058
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:51,769
memorize it because I built in creative
 

1059
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,769
memorize it because I built in creative
already I'll see if I can show you how

1060
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:53,779
already I'll see if I can show you how
 

1061
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,950
already I'll see if I can show you how
to do it not that you probably want to

1062
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
to do it not that you probably want to
 

1063
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,869
to do it not that you probably want to
copy it it doesn't look like it doesn't

1064
00:24:58,869 --> 00:24:58,879
copy it it doesn't look like it doesn't
 

1065
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:02,399
copy it it doesn't look like it doesn't
look super good or anything it's the

1066
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:02,409
look super good or anything it's the
 

1067
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:04,720
look super good or anything it's the
best I could do though so this is what

1068
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:04,730
best I could do though so this is what
 

1069
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,379
best I could do though so this is what
we're trying to build right I already

1070
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:08,389
we're trying to build right I already
 

1071
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:11,229
we're trying to build right I already
forgot I think then we go stairs facing

1072
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:11,239
forgot I think then we go stairs facing
 

1073
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:16,720
forgot I think then we go stairs facing
this way for the eyes and over here okay

1074
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:16,730
this way for the eyes and over here okay
 

1075
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,759
this way for the eyes and over here okay
and then for the top of the head I think

1076
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:21,769
and then for the top of the head I think
 

1077
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:24,369
and then for the top of the head I think
it's just slabs if I remember right or

1078
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:24,379
it's just slabs if I remember right or
 

1079
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:26,830
it's just slabs if I remember right or
no I think it stairs this way stairs

1080
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:26,840
no I think it stairs this way stairs
 

1081
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,180
no I think it stairs this way stairs
this way oh yeah I do have dual monitors

1082
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,190
this way oh yeah I do have dual monitors
 

1083
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,960
this way oh yeah I do have dual monitors
but I never use them I got like a free

1084
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:34,970
but I never use them I got like a free
 

1085
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,580
but I never use them I got like a free
monitor when I bought my computer but

1086
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:36,590
monitor when I bought my computer but
 

1087
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,580
monitor when I bought my computer but
it's not very good so I don't like using

1088
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:39,590
it's not very good so I don't like using
 

1089
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,430
it's not very good so I don't like using
it like this the color and and stuff on

1090
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:42,440
it like this the color and and stuff on
 

1091
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,759
it like this the color and and stuff on
its not not good at all so behind the

1092
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:45,769
its not not good at all so behind the
 

1093
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:46,810
its not not good at all so behind the
eyes here we're going to put some

1094
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:46,820
eyes here we're going to put some
 

1095
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,239
eyes here we're going to put some
magenta glass so they'll have that

1096
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:49,249
magenta glass so they'll have that
 

1097
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:52,149
magenta glass so they'll have that
glossy look to them you know between the

1098
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
glossy look to them you know between the
 

1099
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,859
glossy look to them you know between the
eyes I think we go just cobblestone and

1100
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:55,869
eyes I think we go just cobblestone and
 

1101
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:01,210
eyes I think we go just cobblestone and
then this is our mouse the mouse I think

1102
