and we can still put the pressure plate

428
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
and we can still put the pressure plate
 

429
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,269
and we can still put the pressure plate
on that and then we'll try it out

move on to something else start a new
world or something like that

678
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
world or something like that
 

679
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,310
world or something like that
we got gravel walls guys look at this

680
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
we got gravel walls guys look at this
 

681
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,829
we got gravel walls guys look at this
gravel walls we are far from done

682
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
gravel walls we are far from done
 

683
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,829
gravel walls we are far from done
uh yep

684
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
uh yep
 

685
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,990
uh yep

out of this spruce wood i think

694
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
out of this spruce wood i think
 

695
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,030
out of this spruce wood i think
get we should be able to build this

696
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040

let's just take some dirt from here uh

702
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
let's just take some dirt from here uh
 

703
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,829
let's just take some dirt from here uh

and then just going to put that there
 

709
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,110
and then just going to put that there
temporarily

710
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
temporarily
 

711
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,189
temporarily
build up some spruce walls

712
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199

 

713
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,509

over here the cave spider spawner is

714
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
over here the cave spider spawner is
 

715
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,389
over here the cave spider spawner is
right

716
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
right
 

717
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,829
right
there

718
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839

 

719
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,749

um you have to be careful about that i

720
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
um you have to be careful about that i
 

721
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,670
um you have to be careful about that i
guess we'll bring this out

722
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
guess we'll bring this out
 

723
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,269
guess we'll bring this out
do the same for this one

724
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279

 

725
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,949

build it up one more block am i out of

726
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
build it up one more block am i out of
 

727
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,710
build it up one more block am i out of
spruce no

728
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
spruce no
 

729
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,870
spruce no
okay

730
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880

 

731
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,749

let's use stairs across the top here

732
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759

 

733
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,509

and that's basically the size of the

734
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
and that's basically the size of the
 

735
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,790
and that's basically the size of the
thing

736
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
thing
 

737
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,470
thing
we're gonna have dispensers at the top

738
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
we're gonna have dispensers at the top
 

739
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,550
we're gonna have dispensers at the top
and below these is where the flowers go

740
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
and below these is where the flowers go
 

741
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,629
and below these is where the flowers go
so these these dispensers will be able

742
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
so these these dispensers will be able
 

743
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,310
so these these dispensers will be able
to grow the flowers

744
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
to grow the flowers
 

745
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,430
to grow the flowers
and pressure plates

746
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
and pressure plates
 

747
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,870
and pressure plates
should we use wood ones i guess we

748
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
should we use wood ones i guess we
 

749
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,470
should we use wood ones i guess we
should use stone ones right because

750
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
should use stone ones right because
 

751
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,910
should use stone ones right because
otherwise if the flowers land

752
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
otherwise if the flowers land
 

753
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,710
otherwise if the flowers land
on top of them uh they'll trigger it

754
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
on top of them uh they'll trigger it
 

755
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,470
on top of them uh they'll trigger it
without me wanting them to be so we'll

756
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
without me wanting them to be so we'll
 

757
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,030
without me wanting them to be so we'll
put that there

758
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
put that there
 

759
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,790
put that there
and now that we place the dirt here

760
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
and now that we place the dirt here
 

761
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,590
and now that we place the dirt here
we'll remove it because we gotta go down

762
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
we'll remove it because we gotta go down
 

763
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,670
we'll remove it because we gotta go down
um

764
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
um
 

765
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,590
um
below these see let's hope

766
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
below these see let's hope
 

767
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,110
below these see let's hope
let's hope we don't run into something

768
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
let's hope we don't run into something
 

769
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,550
let's hope we don't run into something
here we're gonna put redstone all along

770
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560

 

771
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,829

i think

772
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
i think
 

773
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,189
i think
yep i think that's right and then

774
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
yep i think that's right and then
 

775
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,670
yep i think that's right and then
kind of level with the redstone we want

776
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
kind of level with the redstone we want
 

777
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,189
kind of level with the redstone we want
sticky pistons which i don't have on me

778
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
sticky pistons which i don't have on me
 

779
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,189
sticky pistons which i don't have on me
one sec all right guys so i

780
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:51,199
one sec all right guys so i
 

781
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,870
one sec all right guys so i
i just went ahead and built it because

782
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
i just went ahead and built it because
 

783
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,790
i just went ahead and built it because
it took like four minutes to build

784
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
it took like four minutes to build
 

785
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,710
it took like four minutes to build
and it's redstone stuff not everybody

786
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
and it's redstone stuff not everybody
 

787
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,910
and it's redstone stuff not everybody
likes redstone

788
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
likes redstone
 

789
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,030
likes redstone
because they're crazy but uh

790
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
because they're crazy but uh
 

791
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,710

quick so
uh each of the the pressure plates

830
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
uh each of the the pressure plates
 

831
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,750
uh each of the the pressure plates
corresponds to

832
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
corresponds to
 

833
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,990
corresponds to
each of these rows right and it kind of

834
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
each of these rows right and it kind of
 

835
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,870
each of these rows right and it kind of
goes up

836
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
goes up
 

837
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,350
goes up
and around there's some repeaters up

838
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
and around there's some repeaters up
 

839
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,029
and around there's some repeaters up
there that go to the dispensers behind

840
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
there that go to the dispensers behind
 

841
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,710
there that go to the dispensers behind
these blocks

842
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
these blocks
 

843
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,190
these blocks
um basically the pressure plates power

844
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
um basically the pressure plates power
 

845
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,950
um basically the pressure plates power
these pistons diagonally

846
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
these pistons diagonally
 

847
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,830
these pistons diagonally
in like a bud switch sort of thing and

848
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
in like a bud switch sort of thing and
 

849
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,510
in like a bud switch sort of thing and
then

850
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
then
 

851
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,190
then
underneath the pressure plates is this

852
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
underneath the pressure plates is this
 

853
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,870
underneath the pressure plates is this
line of redstone as well that

854
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
line of redstone as well that
 

855
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,710
line of redstone as well that
updates the pistons so that they get

856
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
updates the pistons so that they get
 

857
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,470
updates the pistons so that they get
pushed down

858
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
pushed down
 

859
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,789
pushed down
um this line of redstone from the

860
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
um this line of redstone from the
 

861
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,630
um this line of redstone from the
pressure plates also goes to a

862
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
pressure plates also goes to a
 

863
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,710
pressure plates also goes to a
clock lock which is just a fancy

864
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
clock lock which is just a fancy
 

865
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,310
clock lock which is just a fancy
term for a redstone torch so when you

866
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
term for a redstone torch so when you
 

867
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,430
term for a redstone torch so when you
step on the pressure plates

868
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
step on the pressure plates
 

869
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,510
step on the pressure plates
this torch goes off and then this clock

870
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
this torch goes off and then this clock
 

871
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,950
this torch goes off and then this clock
can run

872
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
can run
 

873
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,430
can run
uh it's just like a basic redstone clock

874
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
uh it's just like a basic redstone clock
 

875
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,789
uh it's just like a basic redstone clock
nothing fancy

876
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799
nothing fancy
 

877
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,190
nothing fancy
every time it goes around in a cycle it

878
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
every time it goes around in a cycle it
 

879
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,310
every time it goes around in a cycle it
sends a pulse to this wire here and then

880
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
sends a pulse to this wire here and then
 

881
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,510
sends a pulse to this wire here and then
depending on which

882
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
depending on which
 

883
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,789
depending on which
piston has its block down the signal can

884
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
piston has its block down the signal can
 

885
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,230
piston has its block down the signal can
pass through and it goes up to the

886
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
pass through and it goes up to the
 

887
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,510
pass through and it goes up to the
dispensers for

888
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
dispensers for
 

889
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,789
dispensers for
whichever flower you are demanding

890
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799

 

891
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,990

and that's it there we go so let's uh

892
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
and that's it there we go so let's uh
 

893
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,270
and that's it there we go so let's uh
let's go ahead and do something else

894
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
let's go ahead and do something else
 

895
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,549
let's go ahead and do something else
here

896
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559

 

897
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,630

last episode i asked you guys what

898
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
last episode i asked you guys what
 

899
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,909
last episode i asked you guys what
should we do

900
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
should we do
 

901
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,270
should we do
about project pokemon here because we

902
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
about project pokemon here because we
 

903
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,870
about project pokemon here because we
have some issues

904
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
have some issues
 

905
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,590
have some issues
a bunch of the villagers died when i set

906
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
a bunch of the villagers died when i set
 

907
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,870
a bunch of the villagers died when i set
it up originally

908
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
it up originally
 

909
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,950
it up originally
i had six slots here even though there

910
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
i had six slots here even though there
 

911
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,230
i had six slots here even though there
was only five different types of

912
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
was only five different types of
 

913
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,950
was only five different types of
villagers now there's 11.

914
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
villagers now there's 11.
 

915
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,350
villagers now there's 11.
oh it's just a big mess and i wasn't

916
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
oh it's just a big mess and i wasn't
 

917
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,070
oh it's just a big mess and i wasn't
really sure

918
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
really sure
 

919
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,110
really sure
what to do and you guys

920
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
what to do and you guys
 

921
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,310
what to do and you guys
gave me absolutely terrible advice the

922
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
gave me absolutely terrible advice the
 

923
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,029
gave me absolutely terrible advice the
worst

924
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
worst
 

925
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,150
worst
ev no you gave me uh the perfect

926
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
ev no you gave me uh the perfect
 

927
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,430
ev no you gave me uh the perfect
solution actually

928
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
solution actually
 

929
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,390
solution actually
so i think the way we should deal with

930
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
so i think the way we should deal with
 

931
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,350
so i think the way we should deal with
things around here

932
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
things around here
 

933
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,830
things around here
like a lot of the things i've built i

934
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
like a lot of the things i've built i
 

935
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,669
like a lot of the things i've built i
would do differently now

936
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
would do differently now
 

937
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,310
would do differently now
like even even these fences i would

938
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
like even even these fences i would
 

939
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,029
like even even these fences i would
probably build

940
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
probably build
 

941
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,590
probably build
everything wood in the man tape out of

942
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
everything wood in the man tape out of
 

943
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,390
everything wood in the man tape out of
spruce wood now instead of oak

944
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
spruce wood now instead of oak
 

945
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,150
spruce wood now instead of oak
because i like it a little bit more and

946
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
because i like it a little bit more and
 

947
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,710
because i like it a little bit more and
we have spruce fences and whatnot

948
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
we have spruce fences and whatnot
 

949
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,830
we have spruce fences and whatnot
so i have to kind of question how should

950
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
so i have to kind of question how should
 

951
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,510
so i have to kind of question how should
i deal with old stuff

952
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
i deal with old stuff
 

953
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,710
i deal with old stuff
like this should i totally renovate it

954
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
like this should i totally renovate it
 

955
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,029
like this should i totally renovate it
or should i

956
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
or should i
 

957
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,909
or should i
never touch it what's the deal i think

958
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
never touch it what's the deal i think
 

959
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,710
never touch it what's the deal i think
the way we'll

960
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
the way we'll
 

961
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,190
the way we'll
we'll approach this like little

962
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
we'll approach this like little
 

963
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,789
we'll approach this like little
little renovations we can do around the

964
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
little renovations we can do around the
 

965
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,789
little renovations we can do around the
place i think is a good good idea like i

966
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
place i think is a good good idea like i
 

967
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,710
place i think is a good good idea like i
noticed this today

968
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
noticed this today
 

969
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,870
noticed this today
obviously i'm trying to i tried to make

970
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
obviously i'm trying to i tried to make
 

971
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,870
obviously i'm trying to i tried to make
a smooth transition around this corner

972
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
a smooth transition around this corner
 

973
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,990
a smooth transition around this corner
and

974
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
and
 

975
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,270
and
it's just terrible isn't it so just a

976
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
it's just terrible isn't it so just a
 

977
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,470
it's just terrible isn't it so just a
little detail like this

978
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
little detail like this
 

979
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,669
little detail like this
we would uh definitely redo because at

980
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
we would uh definitely redo because at
 

981
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,590
we would uh definitely redo because at
the time i couldn't bend

982
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
the time i couldn't bend
 

983
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,029
the time i couldn't bend
or stairs couldn't be bent around

984
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
or stairs couldn't be bent around
 

985
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,669
or stairs couldn't be bent around
corners like they can now

986
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
corners like they can now
 

987
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,789
corners like they can now
actually maybe we'll leave that one

988
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
actually maybe we'll leave that one
 

989
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,750
actually maybe we'll leave that one
does that make sense um so little things

990
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
does that make sense um so little things
 

991
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,350
does that make sense um so little things
like this i think are okay to change

992
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
like this i think are okay to change
 

993
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,870
like this i think are okay to change
around the place

994
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
around the place
 

995
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,750
around the place
but i don't like that

996
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760

 

997
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,870

how did i do that i guess i would put

998
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
how did i do that i guess i would put
 

999
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,230
how did i do that i guess i would put
oh you know what i should do i just

1000
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
oh you know what i should do i just
 

1001
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,990
oh you know what i should do i just
should put a full block up there

1002
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
should put a full block up there
 

1003
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,830
should put a full block up there
instead um but i don't think we're ever

1004
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
instead um but i don't think we're ever
 

1005
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,669
instead um but i don't think we're ever
going to totally redo something like

1006
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
going to totally redo something like
 

1007
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,230
going to totally redo something like
this

1008
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
this
 

1009
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,230
this
because i would rather build something

1010
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
because i would rather build something
 

1011
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,070
because i would rather build something
in a new area

1012
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
in a new area
 

1013
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,190
in a new area
than like destroy and reconstruct

1014
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
than like destroy and reconstruct
 

1015
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,909
than like destroy and reconstruct
something

1016
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
something
 

1017
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,110
something
unless it's totally totally broken um

1018
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120

 

1019
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,110

so the perfect solution you guys gave me

1020
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
so the perfect solution you guys gave me
 

1021
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,990
so the perfect solution you guys gave me
is just to use

1022
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
is just to use
 

1023
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,830
is just to use
doc's switcheroo thing that he has on

1024
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
doc's switcheroo thing that he has on
 

1025
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,029
doc's switcheroo thing that he has on
the minecraft server

1026
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
the minecraft server
 

1027
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,190
the minecraft server
so we have six slots here there's 11

1028
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
so we have six slots here there's 11
 

1029
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,390
so we have six slots here there's 11
different types of villagers

1030
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
different types of villagers
 

1031
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,190
different types of villagers
if we put a switcheroo in we can have

1032
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
if we put a switcheroo in we can have
 

1033
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,190
if we put a switcheroo in we can have
two villagers per slot and that gives us

1034
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
two villagers per slot and that gives us
 

1035
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,350
two villagers per slot and that gives us
room for 12.

1036
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
room for 12.
 

1037
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,909
room for 12.
so yeah we don't have to change a thing

1038
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
so yeah we don't have to change a thing
 

1039
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,270
so yeah we don't have to change a thing
we just have to

1040
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
we just have to
 

1041
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,710
we just have to
hopefully get those put in here

1042
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
hopefully get those put in here
 

1043
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,950
hopefully get those put in here
so we let's just check something because

1044
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
so we let's just check something because
 

1045
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,549
so we let's just check something because
i do have these little pressure plate

1046
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
i do have these little pressure plate
 

1047
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,990
i do have these little pressure plate
things where

1048
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
things where
 

1049
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,669
things where
it shows these chests i'm not sure if

1050
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
it shows these chests i'm not sure if
 

1051
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,190
it shows these chests i'm not sure if
the wiring for that is going to be in

1052
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
the wiring for that is going to be in
 

1053
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,990
the wiring for that is going to be in
the way

1054
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
the way
 

1055
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,510
the way
let's just take a look

1056
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520

 

1057
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,630

all right there's the torch can we go

1058
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
all right there's the torch can we go
 

1059
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,430
all right there's the torch can we go
straight down

1060
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440

 

1061
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,630

oh no look what's down here this is the

1062
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
oh no look what's down here this is the
 

1063
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,789
oh no look what's down here this is the
clock for the

1064
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
clock for the
 

1065
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,470
clock for the
the potion room door

1066
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
the potion room door
 

1067
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,720
the potion room door
i might have to move this

1068
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:16,730

 

1069
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,909

[Music]

1070
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
[Music]
 

1071
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,270
[Music]
all right i'm going to try to set up one

1072
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
all right i'm going to try to set up one
 

1073
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,270
all right i'm going to try to set up one
of these cells

1074
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
of these cells
 

1075
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,750
of these cells
and see if it's possible or not with the

1076
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
and see if it's possible or not with the
 

1077
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,830
and see if it's possible or not with the
amount of space we have

1078
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
amount of space we have
 

1079
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,669
amount of space we have
so i've looked into it here for a bit

1080
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:29,679
so i've looked into it here for a bit
 

1081
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,430
so i've looked into it here for a bit
started setting it up i don't think

1082
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
started setting it up i don't think
 

1083
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,149
started setting it up i don't think
we're gonna have

1084
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
we're gonna have
 

1085
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,669
we're gonna have
much trouble this does not interfere

1086
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
much trouble this does not interfere
 

1087
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,669
much trouble this does not interfere
with the switcheroo thing

1088
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:37,679
with the switcheroo thing
 

1089
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,430
with the switcheroo thing
which is amazing because they're like

1090
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
which is amazing because they're like
 

1091
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,789
which is amazing because they're like
look at these pistons they're all side

1092
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
look at these pistons they're all side
 

1093
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,830
look at these pistons they're all side
by side

1094
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
by side
 

1095
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,390
by side
but because this redstone torch is going

1096
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
but because this redstone torch is going
 

1097
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,149
but because this redstone torch is going
directly to this piston it won't

1098
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159
directly to this piston it won't
 

1099
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,909
directly to this piston it won't
power anything beside it which is nice

1100
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
power anything beside it which is nice
 

1101
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,149
power anything beside it which is nice
the switcheroo is very simple we just

1102
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
the switcheroo is very simple we just
 

1103
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,110
the switcheroo is very simple we just
need like a block

1104
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
need like a block
 

1105
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,230
need like a block
redstone torch block piston

1106
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
redstone torch block piston
 

1107
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,230
redstone torch block piston
and then set this at two we've got a

1108
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
and then set this at two we've got a
 

1109
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,909
and then set this at two we've got a
sticky piston down there with the slime

1110
00:22:59,909 --> 00:22:59,919
sticky piston down there with the slime
 

1111
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,350
sticky piston down there with the slime
block

1112
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
block
 

1113
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,950
block
and yeah that's it we just gotta power

1114
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
and yeah that's it we just gotta power
 

1115
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,029
and yeah that's it we just gotta power
this block from behind

1116
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
this block from behind
 

1117
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,789
this block from behind
so i'll probably hook them all up in a

1118
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
so i'll probably hook them all up in a
 

1119
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,470
so i'll probably hook them all up in a
chain

1120
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
chain
 

1121
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,470
chain
uh added some glowstone for lighting

1122
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
uh added some glowstone for lighting
 

1123
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,710
uh added some glowstone for lighting
here the thing that's giving us

1124
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
here the thing that's giving us
 

1125
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,870
here the thing that's giving us
trouble though that i'll have to redo

1126
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
trouble though that i'll have to redo
 

1127
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,830
trouble though that i'll have to redo
the redstone on

1128
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
the redstone on
 

1129
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,230
the redstone on
is this door

1130
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
is this door
 

1131
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,549
is this door
uh i'll have to change it so it opens

1132
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
uh i'll have to change it so it opens
 

1133
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,390
uh i'll have to change it so it opens
vertically like the

1134
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
vertically like the
 

1135
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,149
vertically like the
it goes up and down uh because

1136
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
it goes up and down uh because
 

1137
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,510
it goes up and down uh because
this oh we can't get to it there

1138
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
this oh we can't get to it there
 

1139
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,669
this oh we can't get to it there
this door these pistons look at this

1140
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
this door these pistons look at this
 

1141
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,630
this door these pistons look at this
like

1142
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,640
like
 

1143
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,710
like
this is for the switcheroo here this

1144
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
this is for the switcheroo here this
 

1145
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,830
this is for the switcheroo here this
piston and

1146
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
piston and
 

1147
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,750
piston and
the wiring is right next to that that's

1148
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
the wiring is right next to that that's
 

1149
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,950
the wiring is right next to that that's
not going to work

1150
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
not going to work
 

1151
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,789
not going to work
so the only way we can get get more

1152
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
so the only way we can get get more
 

1153
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,549
so the only way we can get get more
space is if we move these

1154
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
space is if we move these
 

1155
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,350
space is if we move these
sideways pistons and make them vertical

1156
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
sideways pistons and make them vertical
 

1157
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,870
sideways pistons and make them vertical
and i guess this is a t

1158
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
and i guess this is a t
 

1159
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,390
and i guess this is a t
flip flop for this door so i can

1160
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
flip flop for this door so i can
 

1161
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,310
flip flop for this door so i can
tear this out make it smaller and and

1162
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
tear this out make it smaller and and
 

1163
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,269
tear this out make it smaller and and
what not

1164
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279

 

1165
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,750

i got four of these set up now i just

1166
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:01,760
i got four of these set up now i just
 

1167
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,750
i got four of these set up now i just
have the last two to do but these guys

1168
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
have the last two to do but these guys
 

1169
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:03,990
have the last two to do but these guys
are

1170
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
are
 

1171
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,350
are
kind of in the way i'm wondering if i

1172
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
kind of in the way i'm wondering if i
 

1173
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,950
kind of in the way i'm wondering if i
can get them to swim

1174
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
can get them to swim
 

1175
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,390
can get them to swim
up without killing them

1176
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
up without killing them
 

1177
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,390
up without killing them
swim up you're aquaman

1178
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
swim up you're aquaman
 

1179
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,350
swim up you're aquaman
hmm he didn't seem to like that

1180

in terms of villager trading there's not
a lot of variation anymore just like

a lot of variation anymore just like
 

1375
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,630
a lot of variation anymore just like
little slight variations with the

1376
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
little slight variations with the
 

1377
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,430

uh if we put a block of snow next to it

1492
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
uh if we put a block of snow next to it
 

1493

aha so it ignores one of the snow slabs

1498
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
aha so it ignores one of the snow slabs

with
the thing so all the jump bytes are

00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:00,799
the thing so all the jump bytes are
 

1503
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,070
the thing so all the jump bytes are
actually correct
