27
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,150

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,389
we are actually finishing things like uh
we started that mini storage room and

44
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
we started that mini storage room and
 

45
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,750
we started that mini storage room and
finished it

46
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
finished it
 

47
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,350
finished it
all in one shot which is good

48
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
all in one shot which is good
 

49
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,830

now with this silverfish farm the reason

50
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
now with this silverfish farm the reason

we kind of stepped away from this

52
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
we kind of stepped away from this
 

53
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,350
we kind of stepped away from this
project for a little while

54
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
project for a little while
 

55
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,190

i you see this room up here

56
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
i you see this room up here
 

57
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,910
i you see this room up here
this is basically

58
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920

 

59
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,830

right at this level and in this position

60
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
right at this level and in this position
 

61
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,070
right at this level and in this position
here is where our future

62
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
here is where our future
 

63
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,749
here is where our future
mob system and storage room is going to

64
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
mob system and storage room is going to
 

65
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,190
mob system and storage room is going to
be this is like the level

66
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
be this is like the level
 

67
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,910
be this is like the level
that the floor will be at pretty much

68
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
that the floor will be at pretty much
 

69
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,830
that the floor will be at pretty much
hovering just a little bit above the

70
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
hovering just a little bit above the
 

71
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,310
hovering just a little bit above the
silverfish spawner here

72
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
silverfish spawner here
 

73
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,109
silverfish spawner here
so that will be active and hidden away

74
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
so that will be active and hidden away
 

75
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,950
so that will be active and hidden away
in the basement somewhere

76
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
in the basement somewhere
 

77
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,630
in the basement somewhere
and we're going to have a mob system in

78
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
and we're going to have a mob system in
 

79
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,990
and we're going to have a mob system in
the middle of the storage room like i

80
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
the middle of the storage room like i
 

81
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,710
the middle of the storage room like i
like to do

82
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720

 

83
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,270

now what i did you see this little heidi

84
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
now what i did you see this little heidi
 

85
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,630
now what i did you see this little heidi
thing here

86
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
thing here
 

87
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,789
thing here
basically i sealed myself in for 30

88
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
basically i sealed myself in for 30
 

89
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,030
basically i sealed myself in for 30
minutes or so

90
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
minutes or so
 

91
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,670
minutes or so
came back and i was just checking to see

92
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680

 

93
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,469

if the silver if the silver fish farm

94
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
if the silver if the silver fish farm
 

95
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,990
if the silver if the silver fish farm
here is stable

96
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
here is stable
 

97
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,030
here is stable
and it's not after

98
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
and it's not after
 

99
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,029
and it's not after
it'll run for about 20 minutes or so

100
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
it'll run for about 20 minutes or so
 

101
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,229
it'll run for about 20 minutes or so
fine but then it's

102
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
fine but then it's
 

103
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,990
fine but then it's
it jams up generally so

104
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
it jams up generally so
 

105
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,869
it jams up generally so
it needs to be redone the way i got it

106
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
it needs to be redone the way i got it
 

107
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,790
it needs to be redone the way i got it
built right now is technically

108
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
built right now is technically
 

109
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,990
built right now is technically
correct the problem comes with

110
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
correct the problem comes with
 

111
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,670
correct the problem comes with
the silverfish glitching through blocks

112
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
the silverfish glitching through blocks
 

113
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,869
the silverfish glitching through blocks
like when this piston goes up they will

114
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
like when this piston goes up they will
 

115
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,670
like when this piston goes up they will
sometimes

116
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
sometimes
 

117
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,750
sometimes
not go up with the block they'll get

118
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
not go up with the block they'll get
 

119
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,790
not go up with the block they'll get
stuck inside it

120
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
stuck inside it
 

121
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,470
stuck inside it
and suffocate and gold poi and go places

122
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
and suffocate and gold poi and go places
 

123
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,949
and suffocate and gold poi and go places
where they don't belong

124
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
where they don't belong
 

125
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,110
where they don't belong
so we're going to rebuild it exactly the

126
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
so we're going to rebuild it exactly the
 

127
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,030
so we're going to rebuild it exactly the
same

128
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
same
 

129
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,190
same
this spawning room and that can all stay

130
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
this spawning room and that can all stay
 

131
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,550
this spawning room and that can all stay
but this part here

132
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
but this part here
 

133
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,350
but this part here
all this stuff needs to be moved we're

134
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
all this stuff needs to be moved we're
 

135
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,070
all this stuff needs to be moved we're
going to rebuild it the same though

136
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080

 

137
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,350

something on fire

138
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360

 

139
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,990

i'm going to rebuild it the same except

140
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
i'm going to rebuild it the same except
 

141
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,149
i'm going to rebuild it the same except
instead of having a piston push them up

142
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
instead of having a piston push them up
 

143
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,670
instead of having a piston push them up
from below we're gonna have a piston

144
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
from below we're gonna have a piston
 

145
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,190
from below we're gonna have a piston
push them from the side

146
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
push them from the side
 

147
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,229
push them from the side
so that uh they won't be forced down by

148
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
so that uh they won't be forced down by
 

149
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,869
so that uh they won't be forced down by
gravity which is i think the main

150
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
gravity which is i think the main
 

151
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,190
gravity which is i think the main
culprit behind the problem of them

152
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
culprit behind the problem of them
 

153
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,110
culprit behind the problem of them
glitching through blocks

154
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
glitching through blocks
 

155
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,190
glitching through blocks
and instead of having a drop like i have

156
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
and instead of having a drop like i have
 

157
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,309
and instead of having a drop like i have
here

158
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
here
 

159
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,869
here
we'll just have it all flat i think and

160
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
we'll just have it all flat i think and
 

161
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,430
we'll just have it all flat i think and
not have a water stream pushing them

162
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
not have a water stream pushing them
 

163
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,350
not have a water stream pushing them
and see if that works out better so

164
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
and see if that works out better so
 

165
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,070
and see if that works out better so
off i go and i'll work on that a little

166
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
off i go and i'll work on that a little
 

167
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,430
off i go and i'll work on that a little
bit

168
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440

 

169
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,470

okay so before i had the silverfish fall

170
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
okay so before i had the silverfish fall
 

171
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,710
okay so before i had the silverfish fall
down and they would enter

172
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
down and they would enter
 

173
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,430
down and they would enter
the side of the block of the stone over

174
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
the side of the block of the stone over
 

175
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,470
the side of the block of the stone over
there

176
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
there
 

177
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,589
there
the new plan is to basically move

178
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
the new plan is to basically move
 

179
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,390
the new plan is to basically move
everything over

180
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
everything over
 

181
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,350
everything over
two blocks to the right here and instead

182
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
two blocks to the right here and instead
 

183
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,350
two blocks to the right here and instead
of entering the stone from the side they

184
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
of entering the stone from the side they
 

185
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,949
of entering the stone from the side they
will enter it from

186
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
will enter it from
 

187
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,630
will enter it from
on top so right where this cobble is

188
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
on top so right where this cobble is
 

189
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,309
on top so right where this cobble is
is where they'll enter the block and

190
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
is where they'll enter the block and
 

191
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,789
is where they'll enter the block and
they'll just free roam

192
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
they'll just free roam
 

193
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,550
they'll just free roam
on this part here there'll be no water

194
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
on this part here there'll be no water
 

195
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,589
on this part here there'll be no water
stream

196
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599

 

197
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,550

and then when they enter there uh this

198
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
and then when they enter there uh this
 

199
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,750
and then when they enter there uh this
piston will push out

200
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
piston will push out
 

201
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,189
piston will push out
sideways and prevent any more from

202
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
sideways and prevent any more from
 

203
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,270
sideways and prevent any more from
being able to enter the stone before

204
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
being able to enter the stone before
 

205
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,710
being able to enter the stone before
it's ready

206
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
it's ready
 

207
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,469
it's ready
that's the general plan so basically i

208
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
that's the general plan so basically i
 

209
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,350
that's the general plan so basically i
got to move everything over two blocks

210
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
got to move everything over two blocks
 

211
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,270
got to move everything over two blocks
and since there's no easy way to do that

212
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
and since there's no easy way to do that
 

213
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,270
and since there's no easy way to do that
in minecraft i gotta tear it all down

214
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
in minecraft i gotta tear it all down
 

215
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,310
in minecraft i gotta tear it all down
and rebuild it fun

216
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320

 

217
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,790

okay so here's a little bit of an update

218
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
okay so here's a little bit of an update
 

219
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,830
okay so here's a little bit of an update
on the progress this is about an hour

220
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
on the progress this is about an hour
 

221
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,150
on the progress this is about an hour
later

222
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
later
 

223
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,670
later
not as much done on it as i would have

224
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
not as much done on it as i would have
 

225
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,749
not as much done on it as i would have
liked in this amount of time but the

226
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
liked in this amount of time but the
 

227
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,909
liked in this amount of time but the
thing is i built it once already

228
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
thing is i built it once already
 

229
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,350
thing is i built it once already
and had to tear it out again because

230
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
and had to tear it out again because
 

231
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,270
and had to tear it out again because
the piston that pushes the silverfish

232
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
the piston that pushes the silverfish
 

233
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,950
the piston that pushes the silverfish
out of the way

234
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
out of the way
 

235
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,550
out of the way
was right next to the bud switch so

236
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
was right next to the bud switch so
 

237
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,909
was right next to the bud switch so
every time it would do that it would

238
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
every time it would do that it would
 

239
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,590
every time it would do that it would
update the bud switch

240
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
update the bud switch
 

241
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,469
update the bud switch
which was a mistake now this time i

242
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
which was a mistake now this time i
 

243
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,029
which was a mistake now this time i
built it

244
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
built it
 

245
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,350
built it
i made sure that wouldn't be a problem

246
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
i made sure that wouldn't be a problem
 

247
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,430
i made sure that wouldn't be a problem
this is

248
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
this is
 

249
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,070
this is
in a place where it won't uh cause this

250
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
in a place where it won't uh cause this
 

251
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,670
in a place where it won't uh cause this
to update

252
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
to update
 

253
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,110
to update
so it's basically where we're at right

254
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
so it's basically where we're at right
 

255
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,909
so it's basically where we're at right
now

256
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
now
 

257
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,590
now
it's working good i'm really happy with

258
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
it's working good i'm really happy with
 

259
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,150
it's working good i'm really happy with
this setup

260
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
this setup
 

261
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,870
this setup
uh this little section here is the bud

262
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
uh this little section here is the bud
 

263
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,390
uh this little section here is the bud
switch

264
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
switch
 

265
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,950
switch
piston extends block comes out powers

266
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
piston extends block comes out powers
 

267
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,670
piston extends block comes out powers
this

268
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
this
 

269
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,110
this
wire goes to one torch and then to

270
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
wire goes to one torch and then to
 

271
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,310
wire goes to one torch and then to
repeater

272
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
repeater
 

273
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,909
repeater
power is this block here which is

274
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
power is this block here which is
 

275
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,870
power is this block here which is
diagonal of the piston so

276
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
diagonal of the piston so
 

277
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,550
diagonal of the piston so
that's a pretty compact one i'm happy

278
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
that's a pretty compact one i'm happy
 

279
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,029
that's a pretty compact one i'm happy
with that and

280
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
with that and
 

281
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,189
with that and
then it goes

282
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
then it goes
 

283
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,430
then it goes
over here as well branches this way this

284
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
over here as well branches this way this
 

285
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,029
over here as well branches this way this
goes to the cobble

286
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
goes to the cobble
 

287
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,150
goes to the cobble
for the smooth stone generator and it

288
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
for the smooth stone generator and it
 

289
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,510
for the smooth stone generator and it
is the wire is one two three four five

290
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
is the wire is one two three four five
 

291
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,469
is the wire is one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

292
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
 

293
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,150

294
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
thirteen long
 

295
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,309
thirteen long
so we don't need it to stick a repeater

296
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
so we don't need it to stick a repeater
 

297
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,070
so we don't need it to stick a repeater
in which is good it'll be fast

298
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080

 

299
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,629

not that that matters much so the only

300
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
not that that matters much so the only
 

301
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,830
not that that matters much so the only
thing we need to add yet

302
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
thing we need to add yet
 

303
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,950
thing we need to add yet
is the delay this oh

304
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960

 

305
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,550

this wire here needs to branch off again

306
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
this wire here needs to branch off again
 

307
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,670
this wire here needs to branch off again
to delay and then go to this piston

308
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
to delay and then go to this piston
 

309
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,510
to delay and then go to this piston
and that delay needs to be long enough

310
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
and that delay needs to be long enough
 

311
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,909
and that delay needs to be long enough
to give

312
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
to give
 

313
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,430
to give
time for smooth stone to generate

314
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440

 

315
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,590

and that's all there will be to this and

316
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
and that's all there will be to this and
 

317
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,270
and that's all there will be to this and
i think it's going to work

318
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
i think it's going to work
 

319
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,790
i think it's going to work
pretty confident about this i hope it

320
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
pretty confident about this i hope it
 

321
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,150
pretty confident about this i hope it
does because i don't want to rebuild

322
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
does because i don't want to rebuild
 

323
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,029
does because i don't want to rebuild
this

324
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
this
 

325
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,510
this
another time i've probably done that at

326
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
another time i've probably done that at
 

327
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,150
another time i've probably done that at
least

328
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
least
 

329
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,230
least
10 times total now with this thing

330
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
10 times total now with this thing
 

331
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,710
10 times total now with this thing
so i would like to get it working finely

332
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720

 

333
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,870

all right it's finished got it done

334
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
all right it's finished got it done
 

335
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,749
all right it's finished got it done
and then i tested it out afterwards too

336
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
and then i tested it out afterwards too
 

337
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,430
and then i tested it out afterwards too
and i filled up this entire room

338
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
and i filled up this entire room
 

339
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,550
and i filled up this entire room
with silverfish that's over 150

340
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
with silverfish that's over 150
 

341
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,150
with silverfish that's over 150
no problem at all didn't jam up once

342

no problem at all didn't jam up once
 

343
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,270
no problem at all didn't jam up once
so i'm really happy with it so far i

344
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
so i'm really happy with it so far i
 

345
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,189
so i'm really happy with it so far i
think it's stable

346
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
think it's stable
 

347
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,540
think it's stable
and we can

348
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:18,550
and we can

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,950
finally assume that we won't need to
adjust it anymore in the future

354
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
adjust it anymore in the future
 

355
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,670
adjust it anymore in the future
i'm hoping oh damn no i did it i did it

be on a region border it lags every time
i walk across

364
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
i walk across
 

365
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,110
i walk across
that border pretty much you see that

366
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120

 

367
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,150

try it again yeah

372
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
try it again yeah
 

373
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,990
try it again yeah
so this killing room like i said before

374
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
so this killing room like i said before
 

375
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,629
so this killing room like i said before
is not finalized we will do something

376
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
is not finalized we will do something
 

377
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,270
is not finalized we will do something
a little bit more fancy in the future

378
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
a little bit more fancy in the future
 

379
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,110
a little bit more fancy in the future
but for right now

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
but for right now
 

381
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,629
but for right now
it does the job

382
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639

 

383
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:22,230

let's put a few more don't we

389
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,709

oh well okay let's do it poisoned

390
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719

 

391
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,670

that hit two only 11 seconds worth for

00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
that hit two only 11 seconds worth for
 

393
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,620
that hit two only 11 seconds worth for

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
and then damage
 

399
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,070
and then damage
will it kill them all

400
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
will it kill them all
 

401
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,670
will it kill them all
kill me whoa

402
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680

 

403
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:06,829

oh now they came out you see that

404
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839

 

405
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,949

um

406
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959

 

407
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,630

yeah it's quite a bit of xp just from

408
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
yeah it's quite a bit of xp just from
 

409
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,430
yeah it's quite a bit of xp just from
that little amount

410
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
that little amount
 

411
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,630
that little amount
oh

412
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
oh
 

413
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,389
oh
[Music]

414

415
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,590

okay so let me clean up these guys and

416
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
okay so let me clean up these guys and
 

417
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,790
okay so let me clean up these guys and
i'll show you

418
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
i'll show you
 

419
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,630
i'll show you
the final system here

420
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640

 

421
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,150

all right so we can see it up and

422
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
all right so we can see it up and
 

423
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,790
all right so we can see it up and
running here i had to go away for a

424
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
running here i had to go away for a
 

425
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,590
running here i had to go away for a
little bit

426
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
little bit
 

427
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,150
little bit
and stood next to it for a few minutes

428
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
and stood next to it for a few minutes
 

429
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,030
and stood next to it for a few minutes
again

430
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
again
 

431
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,910
again
that whole room filled up no problem no

432
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
that whole room filled up no problem no
 

433
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,870
that whole room filled up no problem no
jams

434
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
jams
 

435
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,470
jams
so that's about 400 or so silverfish

436
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
so that's about 400 or so silverfish
 

437
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,430
so that's about 400 or so silverfish
it's gone through

438
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
it's gone through
 

439
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,630
it's gone through
without any problems so far

440
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
without any problems so far
 

441
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,750
without any problems so far
so i think we have it working stable

442
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
so i think we have it working stable
 

443
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,509
so i think we have it working stable
finally very happy about that

444
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
finally very happy about that
 

445
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,509
finally very happy about that
i did go with a water screen here after

446
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
i did go with a water screen here after
 

447
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,269
i did go with a water screen here after
all

448
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
all
 

449
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,110
all
just because it seems to help to get

450
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
just because it seems to help to get
 

451
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,670
just because it seems to help to get
them to that point there

452
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
them to that point there
 

453
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,230
them to that point there
a little quicker than if they're free

454
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
a little quicker than if they're free
 

455
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,230
a little quicker than if they're free
roaming on that

456
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
roaming on that
 

457
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,550
roaming on that
area there or so it seems i don't know i

458
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
area there or so it seems i don't know i
 

459
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,630
area there or so it seems i don't know i
might play around with that yet

460
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
might play around with that yet
 

461
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,630
might play around with that yet
that sandstone block there we can

462
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
that sandstone block there we can
 

463
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,389
that sandstone block there we can
probably lower the timing a bit

464
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
probably lower the timing a bit
 

465
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,470
probably lower the timing a bit
to make this even quicker uh

466
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
to make this even quicker uh
 

467
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,389
to make this even quicker uh
basically it just needs to stay out long

468
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
basically it just needs to stay out long
 

469
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,790
basically it just needs to stay out long
enough to give the smooth stone

470
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
enough to give the smooth stone
 

471
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,110
enough to give the smooth stone
time to generate so we could probably

472
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
time to generate so we could probably
 

473
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,550
time to generate so we could probably
cut that

474
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
cut that
 

475
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,269
cut that
time it's extended at least in half if i

476
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
time it's extended at least in half if i
 

477
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,949
time it's extended at least in half if i
was to guess

478
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
was to guess
 

479
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,750
was to guess
but i will have to tinker with that

480
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760

 

481
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,790

i'm all out of keys because we get some

482
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
i'm all out of keys because we get some
 

483
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,150
i'm all out of keys because we get some
more

484
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
more
 

485
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,870
more
uh this wiring nothing changed except i

486
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
uh this wiring nothing changed except i
 

487
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,590
uh this wiring nothing changed except i

489
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,230
added
like i said i was going to the the timer

490
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
like i said i was going to the the timer
 

491
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,110

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,230
and that switches the our snore latch
again

518
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
again
 

519
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,710
again
but it also branches off over here and

520
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
but it also branches off over here and
 

521
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,829
but it also branches off over here and
goes to the top

522
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
goes to the top
 

523
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,190
goes to the top
so this is the same as that pulse

524
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
so this is the same as that pulse
 

525
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,750
so this is the same as that pulse
extender i showed a few episodes ago

526
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
extender i showed a few episodes ago
 

527
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,269
extender i showed a few episodes ago
where there's no wait time afterwards

528
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
where there's no wait time afterwards
 

529
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,550
where there's no wait time afterwards
and it doubles up the length of the

530
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
and it doubles up the length of the
 

531
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,710
and it doubles up the length of the
repeaters

532
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
repeaters
 

533
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,829
repeaters
and basically this just connects to the

534
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
and basically this just connects to the
 

535
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,550
and basically this just connects to the
piston up here

536
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
piston up here
 

537
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,590
piston up here
so that's all there is to it

538
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600

 

539
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,710

um and i guess we'll just

540
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
um and i guess we'll just
 

541
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,389
um and i guess we'll just
have to watch it over time and see how

542
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
have to watch it over time and see how
 

543
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,069
have to watch it over time and see how
it does

544
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
it does
 

545
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,629
it does
this room over here i'll probably make

546
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
this room over here i'll probably make
 

547
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,069
this room over here i'll probably make
instead of making it spread out

548
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
instead of making it spread out
 

549
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,110
instead of making it spread out
horizontally like this i'll probably

550
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
horizontally like this i'll probably
 

551
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,629
horizontally like this i'll probably
have a smart piston push

552
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639

 

553
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,110

these blocks up six blocks and then

554
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
these blocks up six blocks and then
 

555
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,190
these blocks up six blocks and then
we'll push that column to the left or

556
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
we'll push that column to the left or
 

557
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,350
we'll push that column to the left or
something and then

558
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
something and then
 

559
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,829
something and then
have that all push over this ways

560
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839

 

561
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,110

so it should make a six high

562
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
so it should make a six high
 

563
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,230
so it should make a six high
maybe 12 by 12

564
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
maybe 12 by 12
 

565
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,230
maybe 12 by 12
thing of blocks i'll have to do the math

566
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
thing of blocks i'll have to do the math
 

567
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,069
thing of blocks i'll have to do the math
and figure out maybe i need seven i

568
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
and figure out maybe i need seven i
 

569
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,509
and figure out maybe i need seven i
can't remember to get that amount i want

570
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
can't remember to get that amount i want
 

571
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,030
can't remember to get that amount i want
and beyond this

572
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
and beyond this
 

573
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,710
and beyond this
i think we're gonna play around with the

574
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
i think we're gonna play around with the
 

575
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,629
i think we're gonna play around with the
mob system

576
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
mob system
 

577
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,990
mob system
and see how that goes i'm gonna use the

578
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
and see how that goes i'm gonna use the
 

579
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,670
and see how that goes i'm gonna use the
same design i used on the minecraft

580
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
same design i used on the minecraft
 

581
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,629
same design i used on the minecraft
server

582
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
server
 

583
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,150
server
as far as

584
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160

 

585
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,069

efficiency and ease of build and all

586
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
efficiency and ease of build and all
 

587
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,150
efficiency and ease of build and all
that goes i think it's

588
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
that goes i think it's
 

589
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,910
that goes i think it's
probably one of the best options i don't

590
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
probably one of the best options i don't
 

591
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,910
probably one of the best options i don't
want to use one of those

592
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
want to use one of those
 

593
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,910
want to use one of those
mob systems where the water flows over

594
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
mob systems where the water flows over
 

595
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,750
mob systems where the water flows over
the pads because that causes an

596
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
the pads because that causes an
 

597
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,870
the pads because that causes an
extreme amount of lag even though it's

598
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
extreme amount of lag even though it's
 

599
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,790
extreme amount of lag even though it's
probably a little bit quicker

600
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
probably a little bit quicker
 

601
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,389
probably a little bit quicker
i i'm going to try to avoid avoid using

602
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
i i'm going to try to avoid avoid using
 

603
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,870
i i'm going to try to avoid avoid using
something like that

604
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
something like that
 

605
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,470
something like that
i've been listening at this level here

606
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
i've been listening at this level here
 

607
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,710
i've been listening at this level here
and you can just barely hear the pistons

608
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
and you can just barely hear the pistons
 

609
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,150
and you can just barely hear the pistons
and the silverfish noises

610
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
and the silverfish noises
 

611
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,629
and the silverfish noises
so this is going to work out really well

612
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
so this is going to work out really well
 

613
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,590
so this is going to work out really well
we won't

614
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
we won't
 

615
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,069
we won't
have that annoying noise or it won't be

616
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
have that annoying noise or it won't be
 

617
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,990
have that annoying noise or it won't be
very noticeable anyway

618
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
very noticeable anyway
 

619
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,590
very noticeable anyway
uh when we build our storage room up

620
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
uh when we build our storage room up
 

621
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,470
uh when we build our storage room up
here that stuff will be happening in the

622
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
here that stuff will be happening in the
 

623
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,829
here that stuff will be happening in the
basement out of sight out of mind

624
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
basement out of sight out of mind
 

625
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,389
basement out of sight out of mind
which is kind of the idea and uh

626
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
which is kind of the idea and uh
 

627
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,470
which is kind of the idea and uh
at that level there we're we're far

628
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
at that level there we're we're far
 

629
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,389
at that level there we're we're far
enough away from these silverfish that

630
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
enough away from these silverfish that
 

631
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,990
enough away from these silverfish that
they can enter the block because if you

632
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
they can enter the block because if you
 

633
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,550
they can enter the block because if you
get

634
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
get
 

635
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,430
get
too close to them then they track you

636
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,440
too close to them then they track you
 

637
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,790
too close to them then they track you
and they won't enter

638
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
and they won't enter
 

639
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,030
and they won't enter
stone blocks until you're about i think

640
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
stone blocks until you're about i think
 

641
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,470
stone blocks until you're about i think
like eight blocks away from them or

642
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
like eight blocks away from them or
 

643
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,750
like eight blocks away from them or
something i don't know for sure

644
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
something i don't know for sure
 

645
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,829
something i don't know for sure
so that's fine but we're also very close

646
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
so that's fine but we're also very close
 

647
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,430
so that's fine but we're also very close
to the spawner because it

648
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
to the spawner because it
 

649
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,670
to the spawner because it
is i think this height here

650
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
is i think this height here
 

651
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,389
is i think this height here
right in the middle there so

652
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
right in the middle there so
 

653
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,870
right in the middle there so
we can walk quite a ways away from this

654
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
we can walk quite a ways away from this
 

655
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,670
we can walk quite a ways away from this
middle

656
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
middle
 

657
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,949
middle
and still have silverfish spawning

658
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
and still have silverfish spawning
 

659
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,910
and still have silverfish spawning
like if we're over here they'll probably

660
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
like if we're over here they'll probably
 

661
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,949
like if we're over here they'll probably
still be spawning

662
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
still be spawning
 

663
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,590
still be spawning
anywhere in this room actually i think

664
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
anywhere in this room actually i think
 

665
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,870
anywhere in this room actually i think
we would be in range

666
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
we would be in range
 

667
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,230
we would be in range
so

668
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240

 

669
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,069

this is going to turn out pretty good

670
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
this is going to turn out pretty good
 

671
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,670
this is going to turn out pretty good
once it's all said and done

672
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
once it's all said and done
 

673
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,509
once it's all said and done
we're going to head to the end and

674
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
we're going to head to the end and
 

675
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,670
we're going to head to the end and
finish leveling up to level 50

676
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
finish leveling up to level 50
 

677
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,430
finish leveling up to level 50
do an enchantment and

678
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
do an enchantment and
 

679
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,230
do an enchantment and
then i don't know actually you know what

680
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
then i don't know actually you know what
 

681
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,069
then i don't know actually you know what
i wanted to show you too

682
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
i wanted to show you too
 

683
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,189
i wanted to show you too
uh if you notice my pick disappear in

684
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
uh if you notice my pick disappear in
 

685
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:53,829
uh if you notice my pick disappear in
this s

686
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
this s
 

687
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,949
this s
in this episode it's because

688
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
in this episode it's because
 

689
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,430
in this episode it's because
i've been doing some uh demolishing

690
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
i've been doing some uh demolishing
 

691
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,150
i've been doing some uh demolishing
taking the stronghold down harvesting

692
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
taking the stronghold down harvesting
 

693
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,550
taking the stronghold down harvesting
the

694
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
the
 

695
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,629
the
the mossy blocks and the cracked ones

696
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
the mossy blocks and the cracked ones
 

697
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,990
the mossy blocks and the cracked ones
before

698
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
before
 

699
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,069
before
the silverfish destroy them all

700
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
the silverfish destroy them all
 

701
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,910
the silverfish destroy them all
looks pretty cool apparently

702
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
looks pretty cool apparently
 

703
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,750
looks pretty cool apparently
i wasn't here before this must have been

704
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
i wasn't here before this must have been
 

705
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,829
i wasn't here before this must have been
hidden because i found the chest with

706
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
hidden because i found the chest with
 

707
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,829
hidden because i found the chest with
stuff in

708
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839

 

709
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,670

um

710
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
um
 

711
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,350
um
yeah over here there was a staircase

712
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
yeah over here there was a staircase
 

713
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,269
yeah over here there was a staircase
that went down that's all gone

714
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279

 

715
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,829

what was that there's a lot of slimes

716
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
what was that there's a lot of slimes
 

717
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,629
what was that there's a lot of slimes
around this area too and that's about as

718
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
around this area too and that's about as
 

719
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,590
around this area too and that's about as
far as i made it

720
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
far as i made it
 

721
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,069
far as i made it
so i'll probably keep demolishing it

722
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
so i'll probably keep demolishing it
 

723
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,749
so i'll probably keep demolishing it
i don't know if we're building a base

724
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
i don't know if we're building a base
 

725
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,110
i don't know if we're building a base
here we don't really

726
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
here we don't really
 

727
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,069
here we don't really
want this here anyway and it's good to

728
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
want this here anyway and it's good to
 

729
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,990
want this here anyway and it's good to
get the blocks from it

730
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
get the blocks from it
 

731
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,269
get the blocks from it
and it looks kind of cool even with the

732
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
and it looks kind of cool even with the
 

733
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,269
and it looks kind of cool even with the
all the good blocks gone it's really

734
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
all the good blocks gone it's really
 

735
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,430
all the good blocks gone it's really
open now

736
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440

 

737
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,310

all right we got the 50 hoping to get

738
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
all right we got the 50 hoping to get
 

739
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,110
all right we got the 50 hoping to get
something with efficiency and unbreaking

740
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120

 

741
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,590

and we got just that beautiful so

742
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
and we got just that beautiful so
 

743
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,389
and we got just that beautiful so
that'll keep me going for a while again

744
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
that'll keep me going for a while again
 

745
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,150
that'll keep me going for a while again
uh i guess now i think

746
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
uh i guess now i think
 

747
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,629
uh i guess now i think
i think what we'll do is we'll go to a

748
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
i think what we'll do is we'll go to a
 

749
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,310
i think what we'll do is we'll go to a
creative world and just build

750
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320
creative world and just build
 

751
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,509
creative world and just build
the mob system and maybe stress

752
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
the mob system and maybe stress
 

753
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,990
the mob system and maybe stress
test it a little bit i don't really have

754
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
test it a little bit i don't really have
 

755
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,230
test it a little bit i don't really have
mcedit working so i can't build a full

756
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
mcedit working so i can't build a full
 

757
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,509
mcedit working so i can't build a full
one

758
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
one
 

759
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,829
one
in a flat world or anything like that

760
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
in a flat world or anything like that
 

761
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,990
in a flat world or anything like that
like i wanted to before

762
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
like i wanted to before
 

763
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,629
like i wanted to before
but we can play around with it a little

764
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
but we can play around with it a little
 

765
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,269
but we can play around with it a little
bit get it fresh in mind

766
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
bit get it fresh in mind
 

767
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,470
bit get it fresh in mind
so off we go

768
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480

 

769
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,310

yeah so we're in a creative world right

770
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
yeah so we're in a creative world right
 

771
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,990
yeah so we're in a creative world right
now in a super flat

772
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
now in a super flat
 

773
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,749
now in a super flat
and i i just want to build like one

774
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
and i i just want to build like one
 

775
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,749
and i i just want to build like one
layer of the mob system

776
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
layer of the mob system
 

777
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,990
layer of the mob system
to get it fresh in mind and to show you

778
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
to get it fresh in mind and to show you
 

779
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,790
to get it fresh in mind and to show you
guys

780
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
guys
 

781
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,990
guys
uh how to do it in case you want to copy

782
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
uh how to do it in case you want to copy
 

783
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,270
uh how to do it in case you want to copy
it and to run a few tests on it as well

784
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
it and to run a few tests on it as well
 

785
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,710
it and to run a few tests on it as well
afterwards

786
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
afterwards
 

787
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,630
afterwards
so basically there's

788
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640

 

789
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,350

these three by three pads they're very

790
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
these three by three pads they're very
 

791
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,350
these three by three pads they're very
small

792
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
small
 

793
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,710
small
and one more there you start with like a

794
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
and one more there you start with like a
 

795
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,789
and one more there you start with like a
a big flat thing like this

796
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799

 

797
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:33,029

and i think in total there was 12 pads

798
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
and i think in total there was 12 pads
 

799
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:41,590
and i think in total there was 12 pads
yeah it goes like that

800
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600

 

801
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,630

so there's no signs involved with this

802
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
so there's no signs involved with this
 

803
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,990
so there's no signs involved with this
mob system there's no pistons

804
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
mob system there's no pistons
 

805
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,510
mob system there's no pistons
or anything fancy like that it's

806
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
or anything fancy like that it's
 

807
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,990
or anything fancy like that it's
pretty bare bone much like the old

808
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
pretty bare bone much like the old
 

809
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,950
pretty bare bone much like the old
old-school mob systems i used to build

810
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
old-school mob systems i used to build
 

811
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,190
old-school mob systems i used to build
uh

812
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
uh
 

813
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,750
uh
i always built the six by six pad ones

814
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
i always built the six by six pad ones
 

815
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,710
i always built the six by six pad ones
but this one

816
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
but this one
 

817
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,990
but this one
has even smaller ones three by three

818
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
has even smaller ones three by three
 

819
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,390
has even smaller ones three by three
to decrease the amount of time the mobs

820
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
to decrease the amount of time the mobs
 

821
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,750
to decrease the amount of time the mobs
need to wander to

822
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
need to wander to
 

823
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,630
need to wander to
fall into water

824
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640

 

825
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,310

and it seems to work pretty good so

826
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320

 

827
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,029

let's see goes one two three four five

828
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
let's see goes one two three four five
 

829
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,430
let's see goes one two three four five
six

830
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
six
 

831
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,310
six
seven blocks eight blocks from

832
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320

 

833
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,549

the middle the water ends just

834
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
the middle the water ends just
 

835
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,630
the middle the water ends just
short of that

836
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640

 

837
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,190

and i don't think there was water on

838
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
and i don't think there was water on
 

839
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,630
and i don't think there was water on
this side of the pad i think

840
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
this side of the pad i think
 

841
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,549
this side of the pad i think
it went from

842
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
it went from
 

843
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,590
it went from
there the next one

844
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600

 

845
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,549

let's try this let's see how it goes

846
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
let's try this let's see how it goes
 

847
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,350
let's try this let's see how it goes
yeah

848
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
yeah
 

849
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,350
yeah
yeah i think that's what it was

850
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360

 

851
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,470

we'll extend this out

852
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
we'll extend this out
 

853
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,750
we'll extend this out
put another stream

854
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760

 

855
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,549

yeah so this corner one it goes to

856
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
yeah so this corner one it goes to
 

857
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,110
yeah so this corner one it goes to
emerges with that

858
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
emerges with that
 

859
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,789
emerges with that
and the mobs keep getting pushed that

860
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
and the mobs keep getting pushed that
 

861
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,990
and the mobs keep getting pushed that
way

862
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000

 

863
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,669

so it's like that

864
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
so it's like that
 

865
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,350
so it's like that
and we'll probably build this pretty

866
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
and we'll probably build this pretty
 

867
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,870
and we'll probably build this pretty
quick

868
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
quick
 

869
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,150
quick
in the world it'll be i think about 30

870
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
in the world it'll be i think about 30
 

871
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,430
in the world it'll be i think about 30
blocks or so above

872
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
blocks or so above
 

873
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,390
blocks or so above
the the end portal in the stronghold

874
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
the the end portal in the stronghold
 

875
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,390
the the end portal in the stronghold
area there

876
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
area there
 

877
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,669
area there
will kill the mobs by dropping them

878
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
will kill the mobs by dropping them
 

879
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,310
will kill the mobs by dropping them
i might set up emp units i kind of have

880
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
i might set up emp units i kind of have
 

881
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,870
i might set up emp units i kind of have
a plan with that

882
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880

 

883
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,549

yeah that's that's really simple

884
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
yeah that's that's really simple
 

885
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,070
yeah that's that's really simple
and then you don't need that

886
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
and then you don't need that
 

887
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,590
and then you don't need that
don't know what kind of block i should

888
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
don't know what kind of block i should
 

889
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,430
don't know what kind of block i should
build it out out of if you have any

890
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
build it out out of if you have any
 

891
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,390
build it out out of if you have any
suggestions

892
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
suggestions
 

893
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,549
suggestions
let me know um

894
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
let me know um
 

895
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,230
let me know um
i was almost thinking of doing like half

896
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
i was almost thinking of doing like half
 

897
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,669
i was almost thinking of doing like half
slabs on the sides too

898
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
slabs on the sides too
 

899
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,270
slabs on the sides too
to make it look cooler but i'm not sure

900
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
to make it look cooler but i'm not sure
 

901
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,590
to make it look cooler but i'm not sure
if

902
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600

 

903
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,029

letting in that faint lighting will

904
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
letting in that faint lighting will
 

905
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,710
letting in that faint lighting will
cause any problems

906
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720

 

907
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,909

goes like that

908
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919

 

909
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,310

um i think i covered

910
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
um i think i covered
 

911
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:41,190
um i think i covered
above that actually yeah

912
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200

 

913
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,110

yeah something like that and then the

914
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
yeah something like that and then the
 

915
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,390
yeah something like that and then the
walls would go up

916
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
walls would go up
 

917
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,990
walls would go up
two blocks and then the next

918
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
two blocks and then the next
 

919
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,510
two blocks and then the next
next layer would be above that

920
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
next layer would be above that
 

921
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,750
next layer would be above that
i think no wait these pads need to go up

922
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
i think no wait these pads need to go up
 

923
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,830
i think no wait these pads need to go up
two blocks

924
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
two blocks
 

925
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,270
two blocks
so that the mobs can't hop back up

926
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
so that the mobs can't hop back up
 

927
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,270
so that the mobs can't hop back up
the next layer would be over here

928
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
the next layer would be over here
 

929
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:11,110
the next layer would be over here
and i believe i put half slabs

930
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120

 

931
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,750

see where are our wooden ones

932
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
see where are our wooden ones
 

933
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,149
see where are our wooden ones
right there yeah i put half slabs over

934
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
right there yeah i put half slabs over
 

935
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,470
right there yeah i put half slabs over
here i don't know if i'm going to

936
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
here i don't know if i'm going to
 

937
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,950
here i don't know if i'm going to
do it that way because another another

938
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
do it that way because another another
 

939
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,470
do it that way because another another
thing i could do is do like an upside

940
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
thing i could do is do like an upside
 

941
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,549
thing i could do is do like an upside
down half slab here

942
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
down half slab here
 

943
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,029
down half slab here
and then uh spiders

944
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039

 

945
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,430

no that won't work because uh if a

946
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
no that won't work because uh if a
 

947
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,870
no that won't work because uh if a
spider tries to spawn

948
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
spider tries to spawn
 

949
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,549
spider tries to spawn
over here they'll be able to

950
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
over here they'll be able to
 

951
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,470
over here they'll be able to
if there's no half slap so i guess we do

952
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
if there's no half slap so i guess we do
 

953
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,110
if there's no half slap so i guess we do
need it

954
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
need it
 

955
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,669
need it
um i'm going to do a little bit more

956
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
um i'm going to do a little bit more
 

957
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,390
um i'm going to do a little bit more
workout

958
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
workout
 

959
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,870
workout
here off camera and then we'll run some

960
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
here off camera and then we'll run some
 

961
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,990
here off camera and then we'll run some
tests

962
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000

 

963
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,870

yes that's what one layer looks like

964
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
yes that's what one layer looks like
 

965
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,549
yes that's what one layer looks like
it's all enclosed now

966
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
it's all enclosed now
 

967
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,669
it's all enclosed now
each layer is five blocks tall

968
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
each layer is five blocks tall
 

969
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,990
each layer is five blocks tall
and i just did the top out of glass here

970
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
and i just did the top out of glass here
 

971
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,909
and i just did the top out of glass here
so we could see inside but

972
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
so we could see inside but
 

973
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,110
so we could see inside but
you would do it out of some solid block

974
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
you would do it out of some solid block
 

975
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,710
you would do it out of some solid block
and

976
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720

 

977
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,390

in my lp world i'm guessing

978
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
in my lp world i'm guessing
 

979
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,310
in my lp world i'm guessing
i'll start it about y 40 or so

980
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
i'll start it about y 40 or so
 

981
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,590
i'll start it about y 40 or so
and go all the way up to

982
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
and go all the way up to
 

983
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,350
and go all the way up to
why 128 or so i'm it'll be

984
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
why 128 or so i'm it'll be
 

985
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,870
why 128 or so i'm it'll be
i think about 16 layers total

986
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
i think about 16 layers total
 

987
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,549
i think about 16 layers total
which is i figured out with these 12

988
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
which is i figured out with these 12
 

989
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,029
which is i figured out with these 12
pads

990
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
pads
 

991
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,390
pads
12 times 8 is 96

992
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
12 times 8 is 96
 

993
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,070
12 times 8 is 96
and if we do 16 layers 16 times 96

994
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
and if we do 16 layers 16 times 96
 

995
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,350
and if we do 16 layers 16 times 96
is 1536

996
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
is 1536
 

997
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,029
is 1536
so that's quite a bit of spawning space

998
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
so that's quite a bit of spawning space
 

999
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,710
so that's quite a bit of spawning space
i think it'll

1000
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
i think it'll
 

1001
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,950
i think it'll
be sufficient um whatever block i do

1002
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
be sufficient um whatever block i do
 

1003
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,510
be sufficient um whatever block i do
choose to build this out of i gotta

1004
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
choose to build this out of i gotta
 

1005
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,029
choose to build this out of i gotta
i gotta choose something where i can get

1006
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
i gotta choose something where i can get
 

1007
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,590
i gotta choose something where i can get
a lot of it quickly

1008
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
a lot of it quickly
 

1009
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,510
a lot of it quickly
oh i missed a spot so like wooden planks

1010
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
oh i missed a spot so like wooden planks
 

1011
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,510
oh i missed a spot so like wooden planks
is obviously easy to get

1012
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
is obviously easy to get
 

1013
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,710
is obviously easy to get
any any type of wood is pretty easy

1014
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
any any type of wood is pretty easy
 

1015
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,870
any any type of wood is pretty easy
stone is really easy to get like stone

1016
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:12,880
stone is really easy to get like stone
 

1017
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,149
stone is really easy to get like stone
bricks cobblestone

1018
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
bricks cobblestone
 

1019
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,149
bricks cobblestone
regular stone but things like

1020
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
regular stone but things like
 

1021
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,630
regular stone but things like
wool or um

1022
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640

sandstone brick those type of blocks

1024
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,280
sandstone brick those type of blocks
 

1025
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,310
sandstone brick those type of blocks
not really ideal for this

1026
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
not really ideal for this
 

1027
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,990
not really ideal for this
and since like a lot of it's going to be

1028
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
and since like a lot of it's going to be
 

1029
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,750
and since like a lot of it's going to be
underground it doesn't really matter too

1030
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
underground it doesn't really matter too
 

1031
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,750
underground it doesn't really matter too
much what it looks like either

1032
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
much what it looks like either
 

1033
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,630
much what it looks like either
but or maybe we could do sandstone if

1034
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
but or maybe we could do sandstone if
 

1035
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,310
but or maybe we could do sandstone if
it's a mixer's handstone and something

1036
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
it's a mixer's handstone and something
 

1037
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,269
it's a mixer's handstone and something
else that's not

1038
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:43,279
else that's not
 

1039
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,710
else that's not
too tough to get i don't know

1040
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:46,720
too tough to get i don't know
 

1041
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,430
too tough to get i don't know
i would like it to look good maybe not

1042
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
i would like it to look good maybe not
 

1043
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,230
i would like it to look good maybe not
all

1044
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
all
 

1045
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,510
all
one one type of lock like this or one

1046
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,520
one one type of lock like this or one
 

1047
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,990
one one type of lock like this or one
plain pattern and

1048
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
plain pattern and
 

1049
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,269
plain pattern and
i also wanted to try spawn some mobs on

1050
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279
i also wanted to try spawn some mobs on
 

1051
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,630
i also wanted to try spawn some mobs on
here and see how they react

1052
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
here and see how they react
 

1053
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,789
here and see how they react
how quickly they fall in the water

1054
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799

 

1055
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,350

this is they're going to behave just

1056
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
this is they're going to behave just
 

1057
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,149
this is they're going to behave just
like

1058
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
like
 

1059
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,750
like
they would in survival if i was out of

1060
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
they would in survival if i was out of
 

1061
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:19,669
they would in survival if i was out of
the area and they weren't targeting me

1062
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
the area and they weren't targeting me
 

1063
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,269
the area and they weren't targeting me
the big thing is that they don't stay on

1064
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
the big thing is that they don't stay on
 

1065
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,110
the big thing is that they don't stay on
the pads for too long like that guy over

1066
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,120
the pads for too long like that guy over
 

1067
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,310
the pads for too long like that guy over
there

1068
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
there
 

1069
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,029
there
oh don't blow up if they did that

1070
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:29,039
oh don't blow up if they did that
 

1071
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,669
oh don't blow up if they did that
um their idle timer would kick in and

1072
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
um their idle timer would kick in and
 

1073
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,110
um their idle timer would kick in and
then they would get stuck on the pad

1074
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
then they would get stuck on the pad
 

1075
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,909
then they would get stuck on the pad
until

1076
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
until
 

1077
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,190
until
they despawned they wouldn't walk off

1078
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
they despawned they wouldn't walk off
 

1079
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,789
they despawned they wouldn't walk off
if they linger too long that's one of

1080
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:38,799
if they linger too long that's one of
 

1081
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,590
if they linger too long that's one of
the reasons i want the pad so small here

1082
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600

 

1083
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,630

but overall it seems like they're

1084
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
but overall it seems like they're
 

1085
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,350
but overall it seems like they're
wandering off pretty quick

1086
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360

 

1087
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,590

and this thing will spawn zombies

1088
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
and this thing will spawn zombies
 

1089
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,669
and this thing will spawn zombies
skeletons and creepers only these half

1090
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
skeletons and creepers only these half
 

1091
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,830
skeletons and creepers only these half
slabs in the middle prevent spiders from

1092
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
slabs in the middle prevent spiders from
 

1093
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,430
slabs in the middle prevent spiders from
spawning uh and it's only too high in

1094
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
spawning uh and it's only too high in
 

1095
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,350
spawning uh and it's only too high in
here so enderman won't spawn either we

1096
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
here so enderman won't spawn either we
 

1097
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,430
here so enderman won't spawn either we
don't need enderman

1098
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
don't need enderman
 

1099
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,710
don't need enderman
in the main world in our lp because we

1100
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
in the main world in our lp because we
 

1101
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,510
in the main world in our lp because we
have the enderman trap

1102
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
have the enderman trap
 

1103
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,830
have the enderman trap
and i'm also watching this thing here

1104
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:13,840
and i'm also watching this thing here
 

1105
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,669
and i'm also watching this thing here
this is something else i wanted to

1106
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
this is something else i wanted to
 

1107
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,909
this is something else i wanted to
check out that i couldn't really do on

1108
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
check out that i couldn't really do on
 

1109
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,029
check out that i couldn't really do on
the minecraft server

1110
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
the minecraft server
 

1111
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,310
the minecraft server
is uh if we got a lot of mobs in here if

1112
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
is uh if we got a lot of mobs in here if
 

1113
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,029
is uh if we got a lot of mobs in here if
the middle jam up it'll prevent each

1114
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
the middle jam up it'll prevent each
 

1115
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,310
the middle jam up it'll prevent each
other from going down

1116
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
other from going down
 

1117
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,190
other from going down
completely or not

1118
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200

 

1119
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,870

seems like they're getting in each

1120
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
seems like they're getting in each
 

1121
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,310
seems like they're getting in each
other's way but

1122
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
other's way but
 

1123
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,909
other's way but
they're still falling down so that's

1124
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
they're still falling down so that's
 

1125
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,230
they're still falling down so that's
good i don't think it'll be a problem

1126
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,240

 

1127
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,909

yeah they're still falling down that's

1128
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
yeah they're still falling down that's
 

1129
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,630
yeah they're still falling down that's
okay

1130
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640

 

1131
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,029

so this should work out pretty good

1132
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039

 

1133
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,870

and on minecraft it took me about

1134
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
and on minecraft it took me about
 

1135
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,870
and on minecraft it took me about
two or three hours to build that that

1136
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
two or three hours to build that that
 

1137
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,909
two or three hours to build that that
big thing

1138
00:25:59,909 --> 00:25:59,919
big thing
 

1139
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,549
big thing
that was without any materials i had to

1140
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
that was without any materials i had to
 

1141
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:02,950
that was without any materials i had to
grow

1142
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
grow
 

1143
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,110
grow
tons of trees and stuff too and and

1144
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
tons of trees and stuff too and and
 

1145
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,549
tons of trees and stuff too and and
harvest that

1146
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559
harvest that
 

1147
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,430
harvest that
uh in my lp world i got a lot of

1148
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440
uh in my lp world i got a lot of
 

1149
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,269
uh in my lp world i got a lot of
materials so i think it'll go fairly

1150
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,279
materials so i think it'll go fairly
 

1151
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,549
materials so i think it'll go fairly
quick

1152
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
quick
 

1153
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,350
quick
and there's no pistons or anything so i

1154
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
and there's no pistons or anything so i
 

1155
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,990
and there's no pistons or anything so i
it's very cheap

1156
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000

 

1157
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,590

and shouldn't cause too much lag either

1158
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
and shouldn't cause too much lag either
 

1159
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,029
and shouldn't cause too much lag either
because

1160
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
because
 

1161
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,990
because
there's no water currents being made or

1162
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
there's no water currents being made or
 

1163
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,269
there's no water currents being made or
pistons moving or anything like that

1164
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279

 

1165
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,830

so it should be good anyway i'm going to

1166
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
so it should be good anyway i'm going to
 

1167
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,590
so it should be good anyway i'm going to
get going here

1168
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
get going here
 

1169
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,990
get going here
uh i was supposed to record this a few
