00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,459
jumping around all over the place
random blocks everywhere I'm going to

18
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:34,469
random blocks everywhere I'm going to
 

19
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,650
random blocks everywhere I'm going to
make it look better so I sort of started

20
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:36,660
make it look better so I sort of started

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,310
working on that over around this corner
here and I before I could really do

24
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
here and I before I could really do
 

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,040
here and I before I could really do
anything now I had to deal with these

26
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,050
anything now I had to deal with these
 

27
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,020
anything now I had to deal with these
cave spider spawners because I I left

28
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,030
cave spider spawners because I I left
 

29
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,889
cave spider spawners because I I left
them pretty much unfinished and I need

30
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:51,899
them pretty much unfinished and I need
 

31
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,959
them pretty much unfinished and I need
to decide what to do so I got something

32
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:53,969
to decide what to do so I got something
 

33
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,810
to decide what to do so I got something
set up here I spent a few hours on this

34
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:55,820
set up here I spent a few hours on this
 

35
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,069
set up here I spent a few hours on this
trying to figure out their behavior and

36
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
trying to figure out their behavior and
 

37
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,110
trying to figure out their behavior and
all that and I got it working really

38
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
all that and I got it working really
 

39
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,920
all that and I got it working really
good actually it's pretty pretty awesome

40
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:03,930
good actually it's pretty pretty awesome
 

41
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,219
good actually it's pretty pretty awesome
so I was going to do an on camera but I

42
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:07,229
so I was going to do an on camera but I
 

43
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,929
so I was going to do an on camera but I
figured it would take a long time and it

44
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:08,939
figured it would take a long time and it
 

45
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,990
figured it would take a long time and it
it did so we'll just go through it

46
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
it did so we'll just go through it
 

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,920
it did so we'll just go through it
quickly this is my spiral spider

48
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:15,930
quickly this is my spiral spider
 

49
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,249
quickly this is my spiral spider
elevator here yeah so there's a there's

50
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:22,259
elevator here yeah so there's a there's
 

51
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,770
elevator here yeah so there's a there's
two spawners here we got them both

52
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:24,780
two spawners here we got them both
 

53
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,640
two spawners here we got them both
working one of them is underneath here

54
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:30,650
working one of them is underneath here
 

55
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,560
working one of them is underneath here
right over there and it brings the

56
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:36,570
right over there and it brings the
 

57
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,530
right over there and it brings the
spiders into this elevator the problem I

58
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,540
spiders into this elevator the problem I
 

59
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,390
spiders into this elevator the problem I
was having before the main issue with

60
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:41,400
was having before the main issue with
 

61
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,609
was having before the main issue with
these cave spiders is that they would

62
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:43,619
these cave spiders is that they would
 

63
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,249
these cave spiders is that they would
track you and then they wouldn't

64
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:46,259
track you and then they wouldn't
 

65
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,080
track you and then they wouldn't
necessarily go where you wanted them to

66
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,090
necessarily go where you wanted them to
 

67
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,569
necessarily go where you wanted them to
go they would fight water streams in

68
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:50,579
go they would fight water streams in
 

69
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,520
go they would fight water streams in
that so I wanted to come up with a

70
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,530
that so I wanted to come up with a
 

71
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,639
that so I wanted to come up with a
guaranteed way of dealing with them

72
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:55,649
guaranteed way of dealing with them
 

73
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,440
guaranteed way of dealing with them
because I don't like having any dead

74
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,450
because I don't like having any dead
 

75
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,039
because I don't like having any dead
zones or paths finding problems when I

76
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:01,049
zones or paths finding problems when I
 

77
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,910
zones or paths finding problems when I
do this mob stuff and and this is pretty

78
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:04,920
do this mob stuff and and this is pretty
 

79
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,590
do this mob stuff and and this is pretty
much the solution to it I got it figured

80
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,600
much the solution to it I got it figured
 

81
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,800
much the solution to it I got it figured
out figured out a few tricks with cave

82
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:09,810
out figured out a few tricks with cave
 

83
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,479
out figured out a few tricks with cave
spiders that work

84
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:12,489
spiders that work
 

85
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,459
spiders that work
yeah so they all collect here they're

86
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:15,469
yeah so they all collect here they're
 

87
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,220
yeah so they all collect here they're
one-hit kill because they drop 15 blocks

88
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,230
one-hit kill because they drop 15 blocks
 

89
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:27,039
one-hit kill because they drop 15 blocks
and these guys go up there's also so we

90
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,049
and these guys go up there's also so we
 

91
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,360
and these guys go up there's also so we
just went right over top the other

92
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,370
just went right over top the other
 

93
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,449
just went right over top the other
spider spawner here these spiders they

94
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:34,459
spider spawner here these spiders they
 

95
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,420
spider spawner here these spiders they
go to an elevator behind this wall can't

96
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,430
go to an elevator behind this wall can't
 

97
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,559
go to an elevator behind this wall can't
really show it to you because it's

98
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:38,569
really show it to you because it's
 

99
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,330
really show it to you because it's
closed up but that's what happens these

100
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:43,340
closed up but that's what happens these
 

101
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,209
closed up but that's what happens these
ones they join in with that elevator it

102
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:46,219
ones they join in with that elevator it
 

103
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:49,929
ones they join in with that elevator it
dropped some 15 blocks onto a fence post

104
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:49,939
dropped some 15 blocks onto a fence post
 

105
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:58,000

you can sorta see the elevator here it's

108
00:02:59,679 --> 00:02:59,689
you can sorta see the elevator here it's
 

109
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,839
you can sorta see the elevator here it's
going up and around spiraling up and

110
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:01,849
going up and around spiraling up and
 

111
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,369
going up and around spiraling up and
then the very top oh maybe I'll poke my

is I actually do have a working on off
 

135
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,339
is I actually do have a working on off
switch for these spawners now so I got

136
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:48,349
switch for these spawners now so I got
 

137
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,439
switch for these spawners now so I got
shut off we can look inside safely

138
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:50,449
shut off we can look inside safely
 

139
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:55,709
shut off we can look inside safely
without the spiders jumping all over us

okay so let's pillar up here I'll show

142
00:03:59,559 --> 00:03:59,569
okay so let's pillar up here I'll show
 

143
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:07,790
okay so let's pillar up here I'll show
you the drop area yeah okay so

144
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:07,800
you the drop area yeah okay so
 

145
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,450
you the drop area yeah okay so
this is a stream that pushes them down

146
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:10,460
this is a stream that pushes them down
 

147
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,910
this is a stream that pushes them down
see the block is coming towards us

148
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:12,920
see the block is coming towards us
 

149
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,760
see the block is coming towards us
there's a sign here and above there is

150
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:16,770
there's a sign here and above there is
 

151
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,250
there's a sign here and above there is
this water block this is to drown them

152
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,260
this water block this is to drown them
 

153
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,820
this water block this is to drown them
in case they decide to start climbing up

154
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:22,830
in case they decide to start climbing up
 

155
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,440
in case they decide to start climbing up
here and they somehow make it all the

156
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,450
here and they somehow make it all the
 

157
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,410
here and they somehow make it all the
way to the top I don't want them jamming

158
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:27,420
way to the top I don't want them jamming
 

159
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,530
way to the top I don't want them jamming
spiders from falling down here so that's

160
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:30,540
spiders from falling down here so that's
 

161
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,240
spiders from falling down here so that's
a safety I don't think that actually

162
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,250
a safety I don't think that actually
 

163
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,540
a safety I don't think that actually
happens though from what I can tell but

164
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:35,550
happens though from what I can tell but
 

165
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,190
happens though from what I can tell but
just in case it's a little bit of a

166
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,200
just in case it's a little bit of a
 

167
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,990
just in case it's a little bit of a
safety they fall down 15 blocks on to

168
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
safety they fall down 15 blocks on to
 

169
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,290
safety they fall down 15 blocks on to
the fence post here there's that one one

170
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:48,300
the fence post here there's that one one
 

171
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,720
the fence post here there's that one one
high gap I guess for them to fit through

172
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:50,730
high gap I guess for them to fit through
 

173
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,580
high gap I guess for them to fit through
so they don't climb I think I added that

174
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:52,590
so they don't climb I think I added that
 

175
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,140
so they don't climb I think I added that
recently then they fall down to that

176
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,150
recently then they fall down to that
 

177
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,780
recently then they fall down to that
second chamber and that's this is really

178
00:04:59,780 --> 00:04:59,790
second chamber and that's this is really
 

179
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,630
second chamber and that's this is really
annoying I might not be able to get out

180
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:02,640
annoying I might not be able to get out
 

181
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,820
annoying I might not be able to get out
of here come on come on

182
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:06,830
of here come on come on
 

183
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,410
of here come on come on
yeah they fall into another chamber here

184
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:09,420
yeah they fall into another chamber here
 

185
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,940
yeah they fall into another chamber here
this is just so that they're out of the

186
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:10,950
this is just so that they're out of the
 

187
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,730
this is just so that they're out of the
way for more spiders to fall onto the

188
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:13,740
way for more spiders to fall onto the
 

189
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,620
way for more spiders to fall onto the
fence post otherwise they might land on

190
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:15,630
fence post otherwise they might land on
 

191
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,080
fence post otherwise they might land on
each other and take no fall damage which

192
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,090
each other and take no fall damage which
 

193
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,750
each other and take no fall damage which
is an issue and then they fall into this

194
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:20,760
is an issue and then they fall into this
 

195
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,870
is an issue and then they fall into this
three block area and I got I played

196
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
three block area and I got I played
 

197
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,340
three block area and I got I played
around with this a bit and I think a

198
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,350
around with this a bit and I think a
 

199
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,250
around with this a bit and I think a
three block area is best for them to the

200
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:31,260
three block area is best for them to the
 

201
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,790
three block area is best for them to the
be in I'm able to hit them or reach all

202
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
be in I'm able to hit them or reach all
 

203
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,070
be in I'm able to hit them or reach all
the way to the top there if they try to

204
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,080
the way to the top there if they try to
 

205
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,020
the way to the top there if they try to
climb when you hit them they'll they'll

206
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,030
climb when you hit them they'll they'll
 

207
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,760
climb when you hit them they'll they'll
touch this water scream and they'll fall

208
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:40,770
touch this water scream and they'll fall
 

209
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,610
touch this water scream and they'll fall
back down instead of a staying at the

210
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:43,620
back down instead of a staying at the
 

211
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,590
back down instead of a staying at the
top usually which is good because if

212
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
top usually which is good because if
 

213
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,870
top usually which is good because if
they're if they're at the top here then

214
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:47,880
they're if they're at the top here then
 

215
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,630
they're if they're at the top here then
spiders aren't able to flow in like

216
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:50,640
spiders aren't able to flow in like
 

217
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,330
spiders aren't able to flow in like
while you're killing them which will

218
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:53,340
while you're killing them which will
 

219
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,150
while you're killing them which will
plug up the drop area and then when more

220
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
plug up the drop area and then when more
 

221
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,220
plug up the drop area and then when more
spiders fall in they might not take fall

222
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,230
spiders fall in they might not take fall
 

223
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,250
spiders fall in they might not take fall
damage which is an issue yep and so they

224
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,260
damage which is an issue yep and so they
 

225
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,650
damage which is an issue yep and so they
they always take 15 blocks fall damage

226
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:06,660
they always take 15 blocks fall damage
 

227
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,370
they always take 15 blocks fall damage
that's being carefully controlled so I

228
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,380
that's being carefully controlled so I
 

229
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,720
that's being carefully controlled so I
don't have to use a stone sword to kill

230
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:11,730
don't have to use a stone sword to kill
 

231
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,170
don't have to use a stone sword to kill
them anymore I can use my fists it's

232
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,180
them anymore I can use my fists it's
 

233
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,680
them anymore I can use my fists it's
regulated properly

234
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:17,690
regulated properly
 

235
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,050
regulated properly
and the other thing the reason I'm doing

236
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,060
and the other thing the reason I'm doing
 

237
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,640
and the other thing the reason I'm doing
the elevator like this I played around

238
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:21,650
the elevator like this I played around
 

239
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,500
the elevator like this I played around
with a whole bunch of different ways of

240
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:23,510
with a whole bunch of different ways of
 

241
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,900
with a whole bunch of different ways of
doing it I tried having solid water

242
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:25,910
doing it I tried having solid water
 

243
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,510
doing it I tried having solid water
source blocks in a one by one area for

244
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:28,520
source blocks in a one by one area for
 

245
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,450
source blocks in a one by one area for
them to swim up they don't like to swim

246
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:31,460
them to swim up they don't like to swim
 

247
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,820
them to swim up they don't like to swim
properly like normal mobs they can

248
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:33,830
properly like normal mobs they can
 

249
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,450
properly like normal mobs they can
actually go down solid water source

250
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:37,460
actually go down solid water source
 

251
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,520
actually go down solid water source
blocks somehow like without swimming if

252
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,530
blocks somehow like without swimming if
 

253
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,000
blocks somehow like without swimming if
they're tracking you then I tried using

254
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,010
they're tracking you then I tried using
 

255
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,670
they're tracking you then I tried using
ladders for them to climb up that didn't

256
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
ladders for them to climb up that didn't
 

257
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,270
ladders for them to climb up that didn't
work out all that well then I tried just

258
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
work out all that well then I tried just
 

259
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,100
work out all that well then I tried just
having them climb on their own like if

260
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,110
having them climb on their own like if
 

261
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,140
having them climb on their own like if
they'd get bunched together but that

262
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,150
they'd get bunched together but that
 

263
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,470
they'd get bunched together but that
seems to depend on if they're tracking

264
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:56,480
seems to depend on if they're tracking
 

265
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,690
seems to depend on if they're tracking
you if like you know if you have bunch

266
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:01,700
you if like you know if you have bunch
 

267
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,220
you if like you know if you have bunch
of spiders in a one by one area like

268
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,230
of spiders in a one by one area like
 

269
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,950
of spiders in a one by one area like
this sometimes they'll start climbing up

270
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:05,960
this sometimes they'll start climbing up
 

271
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,830
this sometimes they'll start climbing up
and then they'll climb up to the top and

272
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
and then they'll climb up to the top and
 

273
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,250
and then they'll climb up to the top and
stay there

274
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,260
stay there
 

275
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,430
stay there
I had like a water stream at the top to

276
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:12,440
I had like a water stream at the top to
 

277
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,790
I had like a water stream at the top to
push him when they did that over to the

278
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:15,800
push him when they did that over to the
 

279
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,680
push him when they did that over to the
side and then fall down but that didn't

280
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:17,690
side and then fall down but that didn't
 

281
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,080
side and then fall down but that didn't
work unless I was that near the thing

282
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,090
work unless I was that near the thing
 

283
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,350
work unless I was that near the thing
for them to to start climbing if they're

284
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
for them to to start climbing if they're
 

285
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,630
for them to to start climbing if they're
on their own they won't climb unless

286
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:25,640
on their own they won't climb unless
 

287
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,050
on their own they won't climb unless
they're tracking you so I settled with

288
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,060
they're tracking you so I settled with
 

289
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,970
they're tracking you so I settled with
this thing it's a little bit big and a

290
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:30,980
this thing it's a little bit big and a
 

291
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,040
this thing it's a little bit big and a
little bit slow but it's guaranteed to

292
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,050
little bit slow but it's guaranteed to
 

293
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,100
little bit slow but it's guaranteed to
get them up regardless of where you're

294
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,110
get them up regardless of where you're
 

295
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,330
get them up regardless of where you're
standing it'll take them up and they

296
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:40,340
standing it'll take them up and they
 

297
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,210
standing it'll take them up and they
won't drown in it they can't get stuck

298
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,220
won't drown in it they can't get stuck
 

299
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,210
won't drown in it they can't get stuck
in it so it's it's a good compromise and

300
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,220
in it so it's it's a good compromise and
 

301
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,130
in it so it's it's a good compromise and
I left I made this area here glass

302
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,140
I left I made this area here glass
 

303
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,200
I left I made this area here glass
because I want to have a little clicking

304
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,210
because I want to have a little clicking
 

305
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,440
because I want to have a little clicking
area see it in action just just for

306
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,450
area see it in action just just for
 

307
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,320
area see it in action just just for
looks I'll probably put a stone wall or

308
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,330
looks I'll probably put a stone wall or
 

309
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,870
looks I'll probably put a stone wall or
something in front with a little viewing

310
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:58,880
something in front with a little viewing
 

311
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,120
something in front with a little viewing
area yeah so this area here still needs

312
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,130
area yeah so this area here still needs
 

313
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,100
area yeah so this area here still needs
to be cleaned up quite a bit like the

314
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,110
to be cleaned up quite a bit like the
 

315
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,000
to be cleaned up quite a bit like the
ceiling needs to be raised and walls and

316
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,010
ceiling needs to be raised and walls and
 

317
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,890
ceiling needs to be raised and walls and
all that stuff I just wanted to show you

00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:11,900
all that stuff I just wanted to show you
 

319
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,680
all that stuff I just wanted to show you
this before I started covering

320
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,690
this before I started covering
 

321
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,590
this before I started covering
everything even more so like like this

everything even more so like like this
 

323
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,860
everything even more so like like this
wiring here I got wiring running all

324
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:20,870
wiring here I got wiring running all
 

325
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,620
wiring here I got wiring running all
around the spawner area I'll show you

326
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:23,630
around the spawner area I'll show you
 

327
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,650
around the spawner area I'll show you
how the lighting works to shut it on or

328
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:26,660
how the lighting works to shut it on or
 

329
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,680
how the lighting works to shut it on or
to shut it that bad back turn it on or

330
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:29,690
to shut it that bad back turn it on or
 

331
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,850
to shut it that bad back turn it on or
off

332
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:30,860
off
 

333
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,969
off
let's just hop down here this is inside

334
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:34,979
let's just hop down here this is inside
 

335
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,409
let's just hop down here this is inside
of the spawner area 8x8 room you can see

336
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:39,419
of the spawner area 8x8 room you can see
 

337
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,459
of the spawner area 8x8 room you can see
we got pistons on up one on each side

338
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:43,469
we got pistons on up one on each side
 

339
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,910
we got pistons on up one on each side
with a with a glowing pumpkin there you

340
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:46,920
with a with a glowing pumpkin there you
 

341
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,250
with a with a glowing pumpkin there you
can use glowstone or a torch or

342
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,260
can use glowstone or a torch or
 

343
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,540
can use glowstone or a torch or
something when that lever outside there

344
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:53,550
something when that lever outside there
 

345
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,009
something when that lever outside there
is switched these Pistons extend which

346
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:58,019
is switched these Pistons extend which
 

347
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,639
is switched these Pistons extend which
block that which allows the spiders to

348
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:01,649
block that which allows the spiders to
 

349
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:07,040
block that which allows the spiders to
spawn again and then you can see he's

350
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,050
spawn again and then you can see he's
 

351
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,540
spawn again and then you can see he's
fighting the water current that's right

352
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:08,550
fighting the water current that's right
 

353
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,579
fighting the water current that's right
it's trying to avoid with this thing

354
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:10,589
it's trying to avoid with this thing
 

355
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:13,940
it's trying to avoid with this thing
although not totally avoidable due to

356
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:13,950
although not totally avoidable due to
 

357
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,639
although not totally avoidable due to
the positioning of this but as long as

358
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:19,649
the positioning of this but as long as
 

359
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,620
the positioning of this but as long as
I'm on the opposite side of this wall

360
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,630
I'm on the opposite side of this wall
 

361
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,990
I'm on the opposite side of this wall
they'll they'll go this towards this

362
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
they'll they'll go this towards this
 

363
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,740
they'll they'll go this towards this
direction and they'll go on top of these

364
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:30,750
direction and they'll go on top of these
 

365
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,780
direction and they'll go on top of these
stairs here this is the trick this is

366
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:32,790
stairs here this is the trick this is
 

367
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,310
stairs here this is the trick this is
the trick I wanted to point out if the

368
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,320
the trick I wanted to point out if the
 

369
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,410
the trick I wanted to point out if the
spiders have an air block above the

370
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
spiders have an air block above the
 

371
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,819
spiders have an air block above the
water stream they're able to fight

372
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:40,829
water stream they're able to fight
 

373
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,340
water stream they're able to fight
against it like you just saw but if they

374
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,350
against it like you just saw but if they
 

375
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,980
against it like you just saw but if they
have a solid block above the water

376
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:45,990
have a solid block above the water
 

377
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,069
have a solid block above the water
stream then they are not able to fight

378
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:48,079
stream then they are not able to fight
 

379
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,939
stream then they are not able to fight
against it if they're tracking you so

380
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:51,949
against it if they're tracking you so
 

381
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:54,590
against it if they're tracking you so
this is what I came up with I got a roll

382
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:54,600
this is what I came up with I got a roll
 

383
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,050
this is what I came up with I got a roll
of stairs you could do this on all four

384
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,060
of stairs you could do this on all four
 

385
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,540
of stairs you could do this on all four
sides really and it should work

386
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:58,550
sides really and it should work
 

387
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,710
sides really and it should work
regardless of where you're standing I

388
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
regardless of where you're standing I
 

389
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,400
regardless of where you're standing I
just have on one side because that's I

390
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,410
just have on one side because that's I
 

391
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,100
just have on one side because that's I
don't know I might I might add it to all

392
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,110
don't know I might I might add it to all
 

393
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,769
don't know I might I might add it to all
four sides but got a water stream

394
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:09,779
four sides but got a water stream
 

395
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,139
four sides but got a water stream
pushing them on top the stairs there

396
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:12,149
pushing them on top the stairs there
 

397
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,180
pushing them on top the stairs there
with these signs holding the water in

398
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,190
with these signs holding the water in
 

399
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,740
with these signs holding the water in
place could use vents gates as well

400
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:17,750
place could use vents gates as well
 

401
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,960
place could use vents gates as well
spiders oops will you push it onto the

402
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:20,970
spiders oops will you push it onto the
 

403
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,240
spiders oops will you push it onto the
stairs and then the screen will push

404
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,250
stairs and then the screen will push
 

405
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,240
stairs and then the screen will push
them this way they won't be able to

406
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,250
them this way they won't be able to
 

407
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,170
them this way they won't be able to
fight the current and they get sucked up

408
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,180
fight the current and they get sucked up
 

409
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,819
fight the current and they get sucked up
to this area here which is a bit

410
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:31,829
to this area here which is a bit
 

411
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:37,189
to this area here which is a bit
complicated this is the start of the

412
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:37,199
complicated this is the start of the
 

413
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:40,130
complicated this is the start of the
elevator right here but you'll notice I

414
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,140
elevator right here but you'll notice I
 

415
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,450
elevator right here but you'll notice I
have this is the water source

416
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:44,460
have this is the water source
 

417
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,889
have this is the water source
right there so kind of zigzags too over

418
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:48,899
right there so kind of zigzags too over
 

419
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,280
right there so kind of zigzags too over
there the reason for that is when the

420
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,290
there the reason for that is when the
 

421
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,840
there the reason for that is when the
spiders get pushed onto these stairs

422
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:53,850
spiders get pushed onto these stairs
 

423
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,790
spiders get pushed onto these stairs
they're only going to be about half on

424
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:55,800
they're only going to be about half on
 

425
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,680
they're only going to be about half on
the step they won't be right against

426
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:57,690
the step they won't be right against
 

427
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,850
the step they won't be right against
this wall here so if you have a solid

428
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:01,860
this wall here so if you have a solid
 

429
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,430
this wall here so if you have a solid
block where this stair is oops if that's

430
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
block where this stair is oops if that's
 

431
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,920
block where this stair is oops if that's
solid blocks they're going to be

432
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:09,930
solid blocks they're going to be
 

433
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,010
solid blocks they're going to be
somewhere around this position here

434
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,020
somewhere around this position here
 

435
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,320
somewhere around this position here
between the two blocks they'll run into

436
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,330
between the two blocks they'll run into
 

437
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,090
between the two blocks they'll run into
the wall and they'll they'll get stuck

438
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,100
the wall and they'll they'll get stuck
 

439
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:24,190
the wall and they'll they'll get stuck
so you need to have two stairs here

440
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,200

 

441
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,840

OOP that was a weird positioning I liked

442
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:26,850
OOP that was a weird positioning I liked
 

443
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,389
OOP that was a weird positioning I liked
how you can get your stairs back now

444
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
how you can get your stairs back now
 

445
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,240
how you can get your stairs back now
when you when you break them it's not

446
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,250
when you when you break them it's not
 

447
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,949
when you when you break them it's not
going to let me put it in the right spot

448
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:33,959
going to let me put it in the right spot
 

449
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,780
going to let me put it in the right spot
is it come on there we go yeah so if

450
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:38,790
is it come on there we go yeah so if
 

451
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,670
is it come on there we go yeah so if
they're in between here and you have the

452
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:40,680
they're in between here and you have the
 

453
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,470
they're in between here and you have the
stream going it's going that way and

454
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,480
stream going it's going that way and
 

455
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,760
stream going it's going that way and
then zigzags it'll suck them up they

456
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:49,770
then zigzags it'll suck them up they
 

457
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,440
then zigzags it'll suck them up they
have a block over top they won't be able

458
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,450
have a block over top they won't be able
 

459
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,970
have a block over top they won't be able
to fight the current all the way up the

460
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:52,980
to fight the current all the way up the
 

461
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,680
to fight the current all the way up the
elevator they'll they have a block over

462
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:54,690
elevator they'll they have a block over
 

463
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,800
elevator they'll they have a block over
top except where the signs are and it

464
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:57,810
top except where the signs are and it
 

465
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,310
top except where the signs are and it
seems to work okay got a sign on a sign

466
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:01,320
seems to work okay got a sign on a sign
 

467
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,090
seems to work okay got a sign on a sign
here to hold this water in place and

468
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,100
here to hold this water in place and
 

469
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,290
here to hold this water in place and
that's that's how that all works so I

470
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:09,300
that's that's how that all works so I
 

471
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,550
that's that's how that all works so I
did that with both of them and yeah no

472
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:13,560
did that with both of them and yeah no
 

473
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,860
did that with both of them and yeah no
problem so far so the plan for the rest

474
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:18,870
problem so far so the plan for the rest
 

475
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,630
problem so far so the plan for the rest
of this episode is just to kind of clean

476
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:20,640
of this episode is just to kind of clean
 

477
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,970
of this episode is just to kind of clean
this area up a little bit better we need

478
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:22,980
this area up a little bit better we need
 

479
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,920
this area up a little bit better we need
to add some more features as well I want

480
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:24,930
to add some more features as well I want
 

481
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,100
to add some more features as well I want
to add a lever here somewhere I'm not

482
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,110
to add a lever here somewhere I'm not
 

483
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,300
to add a lever here somewhere I'm not
sure which side to turn the Steve spider

484
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,310
sure which side to turn the Steve spider
 

485
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,240
sure which side to turn the Steve spider
spawning on or off so that they're not

486
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,250
spawning on or off so that they're not
 

487
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,069
spawning on or off so that they're not
annoying us if we don't need them to be

488
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:37,079
annoying us if we don't need them to be
 

489
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,870
annoying us if we don't need them to be
at the moment the wiring is the two

490
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:41,880
at the moment the wiring is the two
 

491
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,690
at the moment the wiring is the two
spawners have isolated wiring this is a

492
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:44,700
spawners have isolated wiring this is a
 

493
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,980
spawners have isolated wiring this is a
lever for one of them it goes around and

494
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:48,990
lever for one of them it goes around and
 

495
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,319
lever for one of them it goes around and
I believe that piston is right here yeah

496
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:54,329
I believe that piston is right here yeah
 

497
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,860
I believe that piston is right here yeah
so

498
00:12:59,860 --> 00:12:59,870

 

499
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,320

so this is how this works redstone

500
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,330
so this is how this works redstone
 

501
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,990
so this is how this works redstone
wiring powers this block which powers

502
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
wiring powers this block which powers
 

503
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,090
wiring powers this block which powers
the piston which is adjacent to it and

504
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,100
the piston which is adjacent to it and
 

505
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,950
the piston which is adjacent to it and
we extend the wiring using a repeater

506
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:12,960
we extend the wiring using a repeater
 

507
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,150
we extend the wiring using a repeater
here powers this block this wire pulls

508
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,160
here powers this block this wire pulls
 

509
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,269
here powers this block this wire pulls
the current through that block and

510
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
the current through that block and
 

511
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,010
the current through that block and
continues on here again there's a piston

512
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,020
continues on here again there's a piston
 

513
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,870
continues on here again there's a piston
right behind this wood block get a

514
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
right behind this wood block get a
 

515
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,820
right behind this wood block get a
little viewing area here for looking at

516
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:28,830
little viewing area here for looking at
 

517
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,150
little viewing area here for looking at
the poor little spiders as they go with

518
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
the poor little spiders as they go with
 

519
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:42,230
the poor little spiders as they go with
up the elevator okay so we need to

520
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
up the elevator okay so we need to
 

521
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,750
up the elevator okay so we need to
connect this wiring with the with this

522
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
connect this wiring with the with this
 

523
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,329
connect this wiring with the with this
wiring over here so you goes all the way

524
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:50,339
wiring over here so you goes all the way
 

525
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,130
wiring over here so you goes all the way
around and hook up a lever so we can get

526
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,140
around and hook up a lever so we can get
 

527
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,790
around and hook up a lever so we can get
control both of them

528
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:01,800

 

529
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,290

it'll be pretty simple to connect the

530
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,300
it'll be pretty simple to connect the
 

531
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,480
it'll be pretty simple to connect the
two together this this looks like a

532
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,490
two together this this looks like a
 

533
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,760
two together this this looks like a
really good spot here to do it I'm going

534
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:08,770
really good spot here to do it I'm going
 

535
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,160
really good spot here to do it I'm going
to change things around a little bit

536
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,170
to change things around a little bit
 

537
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,690
to change things around a little bit
though move this repeater step we'll

538
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:15,700
though move this repeater step we'll
 

539
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,890
though move this repeater step we'll
have wire there so you can either pull

540
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:19,900
have wire there so you can either pull
 

541
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,140
have wire there so you can either pull
power through a block if you have the

542
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,150
power through a block if you have the
 

543
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,780
power through a block if you have the
repeater on this side or you can put

544
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,790
repeater on this side or you can put
 

545
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,190
repeater on this side or you can put
power through the block if you have it

546
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,200
power through the block if you have it
 

547
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,310
power through the block if you have it
on the other side so let's go over there

548
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,320
on the other side so let's go over there
 

549
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,450
on the other side so let's go over there
we're just going to switch that if we

550
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:33,460
we're just going to switch that if we
 

551
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,860
we're just going to switch that if we
can get in there okay so instead of that

552
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:39,870
can get in there okay so instead of that
 

553
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:48,329
can get in there okay so instead of that
we will have the repeater here and that

554
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:48,339
we will have the repeater here and that
 

555
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,190
we will have the repeater here and that
will send power to the wire on the other

556
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,200
will send power to the wire on the other
 

557
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,150
will send power to the wire on the other
side yeah okay and then we can just pull

558
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
side yeah okay and then we can just pull
 

559
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:02,820
side yeah okay and then we can just pull
this down right here and we'll switch

560
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:02,830
this down right here and we'll switch
 

561
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,880
this down right here and we'll switch
this repeater so yeah we could either

562
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:05,890
this repeater so yeah we could either
 

563
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,540
this repeater so yeah we could either
put the repeater here or we could put it

564
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:09,550
put the repeater here or we could put it
 

565
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,410
put the repeater here or we could put it
on this side doesn't matter this is fine

566
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,420
on this side doesn't matter this is fine
 

567
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,079
on this side doesn't matter this is fine
I guess I'll get rid of this second

568
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,089
I guess I'll get rid of this second
 

569
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,990
I guess I'll get rid of this second
lever since we don't need it anymore

570
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
lever since we don't need it anymore
 

571
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,370
lever since we don't need it anymore
you can see it's steam powered all the

572
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:20,380
you can see it's steam powered all the
 

573
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:27,630
you can see it's steam powered all the
way around now the reason I'm sending

574
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:27,640
way around now the reason I'm sending
 

575
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,370
way around now the reason I'm sending
power through block like this is just to

576
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:29,380
power through block like this is just to
 

577
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,199
power through block like this is just to
keep the wiring all at the same height

578
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:31,209
keep the wiring all at the same height
 

579
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,420
keep the wiring all at the same height
instead of going over top to this

580
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,430
instead of going over top to this
 

581
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,600
instead of going over top to this
pumpkin because I can't put wiring on a

582
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:36,610
pumpkin because I can't put wiring on a
 

583
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,930
pumpkin because I can't put wiring on a
pumpkin so it seems like a good place to

584
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:39,940
pumpkin so it seems like a good place to
 

585
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,840
pumpkin so it seems like a good place to
put the repeaters

586
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:43,850

 

587
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,530

okay the next issue we have you probably

588
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:48,540
okay the next issue we have you probably
 

589
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,769
okay the next issue we have you probably
saw it already but like if you kill the

590
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:51,779
saw it already but like if you kill the
 

591
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,040
saw it already but like if you kill the
spiders here some of the drops are going

592
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,050
spiders here some of the drops are going
 

593
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,050
spiders here some of the drops are going
to land on this iron bar yeah and

594
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,060
to land on this iron bar yeah and
 

595
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,460
to land on this iron bar yeah and
there's one flaw with this as I'm

596
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,470
there's one flaw with this as I'm
 

597
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,110
there's one flaw with this as I'm
hitting them like that they will be up

598
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
hitting them like that they will be up
 

599
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,620
hitting them like that they will be up
at the water stream so that might cause

600
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:06,630
at the water stream so that might cause
 

601
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,840
at the water stream so that might cause
one or two not to take the fall damage

602
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:10,850
one or two not to take the fall damage
 

603
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,970
one or two not to take the fall damage
because they're blocking the area but

604
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:13,980
because they're blocking the area but
 

605
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,230
because they're blocking the area but
yeah you see how the string is getting

606
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
yeah you see how the string is getting
 

607
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,079
yeah you see how the string is getting
stuck on this bar here we could either

608
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,089
stuck on this bar here we could either
 

609
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,490
stuck on this bar here we could either
could either put a piston behind there

610
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:22,500
could either put a piston behind there
 

611
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,460
could either put a piston behind there
to push it off or we could use a water

612
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,470
to push it off or we could use a water
 

613
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,350
to push it off or we could use a water
screen to push it off I'm not sure what

614
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:30,360
screen to push it off I'm not sure what
 

615
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,269
screen to push it off I'm not sure what
we'll do the switch to turn the spawners

616
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
we'll do the switch to turn the spawners
 

617
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,560
we'll do the switch to turn the spawners
on or off I think maybe putting on here

618
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:39,570
on or off I think maybe putting on here
 

619
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,019
on or off I think maybe putting on here
a quiz okay

620
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:44,029
a quiz okay
 

621
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,040
a quiz okay
yeah we should be able to take power

622
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,050
yeah we should be able to take power
 

623
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,449
yeah we should be able to take power
from over here on that side and then

624
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:50,459
from over here on that side and then
 

625
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,300
from over here on that side and then
maybe we'll have a button here we can

626
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,310
maybe we'll have a button here we can
 

627
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,530
maybe we'll have a button here we can
press to push these items on somehow

628
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:56,540
press to push these items on somehow
 

629
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:04,640
press to push these items on somehow
this side is clear yeah it's okay

630
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:04,650
this side is clear yeah it's okay
 

631
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,049
this side is clear yeah it's okay
that's what we'll do we'll have a button

632
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:07,059
that's what we'll do we'll have a button
 

633
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,159
that's what we'll do we'll have a button
here and maybe some glowstone polite the

634
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:11,169
here and maybe some glowstone polite the
 

635
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:14,760
here and maybe some glowstone polite the
area cool thing I noticed ever since the

636
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:14,770
area cool thing I noticed ever since the
 

637
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,529
area cool thing I noticed ever since the
recent patches I'm not getting Enderman

638
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:16,539
recent patches I'm not getting Enderman
 

639
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,230
recent patches I'm not getting Enderman
down in my cave here which is cool

640
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,240
down in my cave here which is cool
 

641
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,390
down in my cave here which is cool
because before they were teleporting

642
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:21,400
because before they were teleporting
 

643
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,919
because before they were teleporting
down all the time which is annoying

644
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:24,929
down all the time which is annoying
 

645
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:28,649
down all the time which is annoying
moving blocks around had me a little

646
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:28,659
moving blocks around had me a little
 

647
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,330
moving blocks around had me a little
worried they were going to cause

648
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:30,340
worried they were going to cause
 

649
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,080
worried they were going to cause
problems on future but hopefully that's

650
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,090
problems on future but hopefully that's
 

651
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:43,380
problems on future but hopefully that's
not a problem anymore okay so that I was

652
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,390
not a problem anymore okay so that I was
 

653
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,580
not a problem anymore okay so that I was
going to say something else but I can't

654
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:44,590
going to say something else but I can't
 

655
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,820
going to say something else but I can't
remember now so I got a I got a path

656
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:50,830
remember now so I got a I got a path
 

657
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,440
remember now so I got a I got a path
here for the wire it's it's really

658
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,450
here for the wire it's it's really
 

659
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,820
here for the wire it's it's really
simple just goes down here I added this

660
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:56,830
simple just goes down here I added this
 

661
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,649
simple just goes down here I added this
little bit and then it connects to our

662
00:17:58,649 --> 00:17:58,659
little bit and then it connects to our
 

663
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:02,519
little bit and then it connects to our
loop which goes around and then it goes

664
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:02,529
loop which goes around and then it goes
 

665
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,950
loop which goes around and then it goes
to that other loop where we connected

666
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
to that other loop where we connected
 

667
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,710
to that other loop where we connected
and it goes around the other spawner so

668
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:07,720
and it goes around the other spawner so
 

669
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:17,590
and it goes around the other spawner so
this will take care of it all try it out

670
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600

 

671
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,820

yep this one's powered and is this other

672
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:21,830
yep this one's powered and is this other
 

673
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,590
yep this one's powered and is this other
one powered yes it is

674
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:26,600
one powered yes it is
 

675
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,620
one powered yes it is
so we have our switch on or off there

676
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:28,630
so we have our switch on or off there
 

677
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,890
so we have our switch on or off there
let's hook up our our piston I think

678
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:32,900
let's hook up our our piston I think
 

679
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,820
let's hook up our our piston I think
I'll use a piston I'm gonna try just

680
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:39,830
I'll use a piston I'm gonna try just
 

681
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,440
I'll use a piston I'm gonna try just
stick it in the back here like right

682
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,450
stick it in the back here like right
 

683
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,970
stick it in the back here like right
over here

684
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:44,980

 

685
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:52,770

wrong way oh and we can't get it out now

686
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:52,780

 

687
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,270

there okay

688
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
there okay
 

689
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:03,340
there okay
put all that back there and if we put

690
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:03,350
put all that back there and if we put
 

691
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,250
put all that back there and if we put
the button right here we could probably

692
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,260
the button right here we could probably
 

693
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,710
the button right here we could probably
just put a wire over here and that'll be

694
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:11,720
just put a wire over here and that'll be
 

695
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,130
just put a wire over here and that'll be
very very simple and hidden which is

696
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,140
very very simple and hidden which is
 

697
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,270
very very simple and hidden which is
nice let's try it out though

698
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:22,280
nice let's try it out though
 

699
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,180
nice let's try it out though
get some light on the area I'm going to

700
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,190
get some light on the area I'm going to
 

701
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,340
get some light on the area I'm going to
throw some blocks on the bar hi shad

702
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,350
throw some blocks on the bar hi shad
 

703
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,840
throw some blocks on the bar hi shad
really get some spiders in here because

704
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:31,850
really get some spiders in here because
 

705
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,580
really get some spiders in here because
that might push them through the glass

706
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,590
that might push them through the glass
 

707
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,830
that might push them through the glass
or something crazy yeah works like that

708
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:38,840
or something crazy yeah works like that
 

709
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,570
or something crazy yeah works like that
I'm gonna get some spiders Oh make sure

710
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:40,580
I'm gonna get some spiders Oh make sure
 

711
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,460
I'm gonna get some spiders Oh make sure
it doesn't do anything dangerous oh and

712
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:45,470
it doesn't do anything dangerous oh and
 

713
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,590
it doesn't do anything dangerous oh and
I maybe I'll replace this with nether X

714
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
I maybe I'll replace this with nether X
 

715
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,690
I maybe I'll replace this with nether X
or nether nether brick so we can see the

716
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:52,700
or nether nether brick so we can see the
 

717
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,090
or nether nether brick so we can see the
button clear cuz right now it's it's the

718
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,100
button clear cuz right now it's it's the
 

719
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,980
button clear cuz right now it's it's the
same colors the back

720
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:58,990

 

721
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,870

yeah so this is one of the problems I'm

722
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
yeah so this is one of the problems I'm
 

723
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,169
yeah so this is one of the problems I'm
having with this still they are tracking

724
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:04,179
having with this still they are tracking
 

725
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:06,000
having with this still they are tracking
me if I'm on the other side of that wall

726
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,010
me if I'm on the other side of that wall
 

727
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,760
me if I'm on the other side of that wall
just because of where the spawner is I

728
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:08,770
just because of where the spawner is I
 

729
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,980
just because of where the spawner is I
couldn't really avoid that so even if

730
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:13,990
couldn't really avoid that so even if
 

731
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,600
couldn't really avoid that so even if
this is covered they're still tracking

732
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:15,610
this is covered they're still tracking
 

733
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,850
this is covered they're still tracking
me so basically I I just have to be on

734
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:20,860
me so basically I I just have to be on
 

735
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,840
me so basically I I just have to be on
the other side of a imaginary line here

736
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:23,850
the other side of a imaginary line here
 

737
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,149
the other side of a imaginary line here
I'm over here it's fine it works a lot

738
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:27,159
I'm over here it's fine it works a lot
 

739
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,570
I'm over here it's fine it works a lot
better than it did before where I was

740
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:30,580
better than it did before where I was
 

741
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,500
better than it did before where I was
doing that stare trick down there they

742
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:34,510
doing that stare trick down there they
 

743
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,549
doing that stare trick down there they
really weren't cooperating because

744
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
really weren't cooperating because
 

745
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,500
really weren't cooperating because
before I would pretty much have to be in

746
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:40,510
before I would pretty much have to be in
 

747
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,230
before I would pretty much have to be in
the corner for it to work and and now I

748
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,240
the corner for it to work and and now I
 

749
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,120
the corner for it to work and and now I
can just be somewhere on the sides does

750
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,130
can just be somewhere on the sides does
 

751
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,600
can just be somewhere on the sides does
it matter

752
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:45,610
it matter
 

753
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,250
it matter
and same with same with that one there

754
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,260
and same with same with that one there
 

755
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,659
and same with same with that one there
the way of their position there was no

756
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:51,669
the way of their position there was no
 

757
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,289
the way of their position there was no
way I could get them to all go into one

758
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:54,299
way I could get them to all go into one
 

759
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,580
way I could get them to all go into one
stream together from the two spawners

760
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:58,590
stream together from the two spawners
 

761
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,560
stream together from the two spawners
without them tracking me enough and not

762
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:01,570
without them tracking me enough and not
 

763
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,350
without them tracking me enough and not
oh what am I saying

764
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,360
oh what am I saying
 

765
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,430
oh what am I saying
disobeying the water streams they were

766
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:08,440
disobeying the water streams they were
 

767
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,700
disobeying the water streams they were
disobeying the water streams before but

768
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:11,710
disobeying the water streams before but
 

769
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,880
disobeying the water streams before but
now it works which is important I got

770
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:14,890
now it works which is important I got
 

771
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,029
now it works which is important I got
the nether brick on the other side here

772
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
the nether brick on the other side here
 

773
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,899
the nether brick on the other side here
not sure where I'm going to put the

774
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:18,909
not sure where I'm going to put the
 

775
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,110
not sure where I'm going to put the
glowstone

776
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,120

 

777
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,000

and maybe I'll put signs below your Adam

778
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,010
and maybe I'll put signs below your Adam
 

779
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:31,019
and maybe I'll put signs below your Adam
will figure it out pretty happy with

780
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:31,029
will figure it out pretty happy with
 

781
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,419
will figure it out pretty happy with
this let's try out the piston though see

782
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:33,429
this let's try out the piston though see
 

783
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:43,019
this let's try out the piston though see
what it goes yeah it's fine even if even

784
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:43,029
what it goes yeah it's fine even if even
 

785
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,519
what it goes yeah it's fine even if even
if it does add it won't crush the mob's

786
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:44,529
if it does add it won't crush the mob's
 

787
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:47,159
if it does add it won't crush the mob's
piston piston arms you can't stuff I

788
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:47,169
piston piston arms you can't stuff I
 

789
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:48,960
piston piston arms you can't stuff I
think the mobs and they're not getting

790
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:48,970
think the mobs and they're not getting
 

791
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,640
think the mobs and they're not getting
pushed through the glass which is what I

792
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:50,650
pushed through the glass which is what I
 

793
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:55,200
pushed through the glass which is what I
was worried about so all in all I'm

794
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,210
