00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,030
well like they spawn at three different
 

197
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,249
well like they spawn at three different
heights there they'll spawn one block

only one I'm not very very good at
 

225
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,260
only one I'm not very very good at
explaining things but it's very

explaining things but it's very
 

227
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,879
explaining things but it's very
difficult to make them hit the trip

difficult to make them hit the trip
 

229

it where will have the most success so
that works out pretty good and I did it

234
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,280
that works out pretty good and I did it
 

235
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,430
that works out pretty good and I did it
for this side too I feel like I'm

236

the record is not a good thing I feel

240
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:58,849
the record is not a good thing I feel
 

241
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,610
the record is not a good thing I feel
like I'm shouting with it like I'm

242
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:00,620
like I'm shouting with it like I'm
 

243
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,720
like I'm shouting with it like I'm
talking over it

244
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:06,730

 

245
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,080

man I don't think I've heard this one

246
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,090
man I don't think I've heard this one
 

247
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,080
man I don't think I've heard this one
all the way through that's kind of cool

248
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,090
all the way through that's kind of cool
 

249
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,970
all the way through that's kind of cool
ending to it

alright guys uh what should we do today

252
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:16,870
alright guys uh what should we do today
 

253
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,700
alright guys uh what should we do today
let me think of something

254
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:19,710
let me think of something
 

255
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,380
let me think of something
so I decided let's hop into a creative

256
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,390
so I decided let's hop into a creative
 

257
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,270
so I decided let's hop into a creative
world very quickly here I just want to

258
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,280
world very quickly here I just want to
 

259
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,040
world very quickly here I just want to
show you what I mean about the spider

260
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,050
show you what I mean about the spider
 

261
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,320
show you what I mean about the spider
thing cuz I I wasn't too happy with my

262
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,330
thing cuz I I wasn't too happy with my
 

263
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,500
thing cuz I I wasn't too happy with my
explanation honestly so pretend this is

264
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:31,510
explanation honestly so pretend this is
 

265
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,620
explanation honestly so pretend this is
the level where the tripwire is if my

266
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:34,630
the level where the tripwire is if my
 

267
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,450
the level where the tripwire is if my
spider activates it these lights will

268
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,460
spider activates it these lights will
 

269
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,910
spider activates it these lights will
turn on and we gotta find a height where

270
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:38,920
turn on and we gotta find a height where
 

271
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,850
turn on and we gotta find a height where
they will die when they fall and

272
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:40,860
they will die when they fall and
 

273
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,900
they will die when they fall and
activate that so he didn't die that's no

274
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:45,910
activate that so he didn't die that's no
 

275
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,100
activate that so he didn't die that's no
good he dies at that height but the

276
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,110
good he dies at that height but the
 

277
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,600
good he dies at that height but the
lights didn't turn on so the tripwire

278
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:51,610
lights didn't turn on so the tripwire
 

279
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,140
lights didn't turn on so the tripwire
never got tripped ah see that's what we

280
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,150
never got tripped ah see that's what we
 

281
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,740
never got tripped ah see that's what we
want he died and the lights turned on

282
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:57,750
want he died and the lights turned on
 

283
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,290
want he died and the lights turned on
uh-huh go a little higher nope

284
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:01,300
uh-huh go a little higher nope
 

285
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,460
uh-huh go a little higher nope
higher nope do it there hey it works

286
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,470
higher nope do it there hey it works
 

287
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,160
higher nope do it there hey it works
again but only for this one height you

288
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,170
again but only for this one height you
 

289
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,470
again but only for this one height you
see you see how the spacing works I got

290
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,480
see you see how the spacing works I got
 

291
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,750
see you see how the spacing works I got
the red clay blocks where it works the

292
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:12,760
the red clay blocks where it works the
 

293
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,720
the red clay blocks where it works the
way I want there's very few places where

294
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:18,730
way I want there's very few places where
 

295
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,280
way I want there's very few places where
you have two of these red blocks

296
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,290
you have two of these red blocks
 

297
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,170
you have two of these red blocks
together where it does what we want and

298
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,180
together where it does what we want and
 

299
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,180
together where it does what we want and
there's no place where there's three of

300
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,190
there's no place where there's three of
 

301
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,140
there's no place where there's three of
them together so basically it's at this

302
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,150
them together so basically it's at this
 

303
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,200
them together so basically it's at this
height here this is where the spawner is

304
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,210
height here this is where the spawner is
 

305
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,420
height here this is where the spawner is
so one block above it works level with

306
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,430
so one block above it works level with
 

307
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,860
so one block above it works level with
the spawner it works but the block below

308
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:34,870
the spawner it works but the block below
 

309
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,830
the spawner it works but the block below
it doesn't and I'm not going to find a

310
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:37,840
it doesn't and I'm not going to find a
 

311
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,270
it doesn't and I'm not going to find a
place where all three of the Heights

312
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,280
place where all three of the Heights
 

313
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:47,010
place where all three of the Heights
work so this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

314
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,020
work so this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
 

315
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,820
work so this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 13 14 block space between the trip

316
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:50,830
12 13 14 block space between the trip
 

317
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,430
12 13 14 block space between the trip
wire and the spawning space for the

318
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
wire and the spawning space for the
 

319
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,990
wire and the spawning space for the
spawner okay I have an idea for a

320
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
spawner okay I have an idea for a
 

321
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,020
spawner okay I have an idea for a
project guys this this is mostly gonna

322
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,030
project guys this this is mostly gonna
 

323
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,090
project guys this this is mostly gonna
be my project though it's cuz it's gonna

324
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,100
be my project though it's cuz it's gonna
 

325
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,840
be my project though it's cuz it's gonna
be repetitive and very large-scale so

326
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:06,850
be repetitive and very large-scale so
 

327
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,520
be repetitive and very large-scale so
I'm gonna work on it off-camera but I'll

328
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:08,530
I'm gonna work on it off-camera but I'll
 

329
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm gonna work on it off-camera but I'll
introduce you to how I'm doing it but a

330
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,370
introduce you to how I'm doing it but a
 

331
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,970
introduce you to how I'm doing it but a
long time ago I made this tree farm and

332
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:14,980
long time ago I made this tree farm and
 

333
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,520
long time ago I made this tree farm and
as soon as I made it I was like we need

334
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,530
as soon as I made it I was like we need
 

335
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,200
as soon as I made it I was like we need
a ceiling for this thing yet I'll do it

336
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,210
a ceiling for this thing yet I'll do it
 

337
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,220
a ceiling for this thing yet I'll do it
later

338
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,230
later
 

339
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,740
later
and all this time has passed and I feel

340
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:22,750
and all this time has passed and I feel
 

341
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,290
and all this time has passed and I feel
bad I never put a ceiling on this thing

342
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,300
bad I never put a ceiling on this thing
 

343
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,500
bad I never put a ceiling on this thing
it's still dirt and cobwebs up there and

344
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,510
it's still dirt and cobwebs up there and
 

345
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,379
it's still dirt and cobwebs up there and
it's it's kind of nasty I never gave it

346
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:31,389
it's it's kind of nasty I never gave it
 

347
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:34,379
it's it's kind of nasty I never gave it
a nice ceiling so I think we should do

348
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:34,389
a nice ceiling so I think we should do
 

349
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,170
a nice ceiling so I think we should do
that today this isn't just any tree farm

350
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:37,180
that today this isn't just any tree farm
 

351
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,150
that today this isn't just any tree farm
as the thing this is a very important

352
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160
as the thing this is a very important
 

353
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,579
as the thing this is a very important
tree farm it's it's the donator tree

354
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:41,589
tree farm it's it's the donator tree
 

355
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,600
tree farm it's it's the donator tree
farm which is and was and forever will

356
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:45,610
farm which is and was and forever will
 

357
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,250
farm which is and was and forever will
be important to my channel because

358
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,260
be important to my channel because
 

359
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,740
be important to my channel because
without the donations I got from people

360
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:49,750
without the donations I got from people
 

361
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,480
without the donations I got from people
before I was a YouTube partner I

362
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:51,490
before I was a YouTube partner I
 

363
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,660
before I was a YouTube partner I
probably would have like made a lot less

364
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,670
probably would have like made a lot less
 

365
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,240
probably would have like made a lot less
videos and never would have become the

366
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,250
videos and never would have become the
 

367
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,449
videos and never would have become the
YouTube channel that I did today without

368
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:00,459
YouTube channel that I did today without
 

369
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,490
YouTube channel that I did today without
the support from from all these guys and

370
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:02,500
the support from from all these guys and
 

371
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,769

00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:04,779
all the people in the mineshaft that I
 

373
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,269
all the people in the mineshaft that I
gave science to as well so I made this

374
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
gave science to as well so I made this
 

375
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,490
gave science to as well so I made this
as a way of saying thanks and and to

376
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:11,500
as a way of saying thanks and and to
 

377

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:15,339
for me so I should take it this step
 

381
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,050
for me so I should take it this step
further and finish the roof actually

382
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,060
further and finish the roof actually
 

383
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,430
further and finish the roof actually
make it look nice for them so basically

384
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
make it look nice for them so basically
 

385
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,220
make it look nice for them so basically
I'm it is a very large project so I

386
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,230
I'm it is a very large project so I
 

387
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm it is a very large project so I
can't get too fancy with it but my plan

388
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:28,680
can't get too fancy with it but my plan
 

389
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,960
can't get too fancy with it but my plan
is like it should look nice I don't

390
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:33,970
is like it should look nice I don't
 

391
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,150
is like it should look nice I don't
think I'm cutting corners but I think

392
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
think I'm cutting corners but I think
 

393
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,699
think I'm cutting corners but I think
it'll look good but basically I made the

394
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:38,709
it'll look good but basically I made the
 

395
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,340
it'll look good but basically I made the
wrong type of wood there spruce I want

396
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,350
wrong type of wood there spruce I want
 

397
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,160
wrong type of wood there spruce I want
spruce spruce and birch wood looked very

398
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,170
spruce spruce and birch wood looked very
 

399
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,069
spruce spruce and birch wood looked very
good together I kind of marked out a

400
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,079
good together I kind of marked out a
 

401
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,509
good together I kind of marked out a
grid here oh man this is tough all right

402
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
grid here oh man this is tough all right
 

403
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,970
grid here oh man this is tough all right
so I think I got to go up just do that

404
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:56,980
so I think I got to go up just do that
 

405
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,920
so I think I got to go up just do that
I'll have to shave a whole layer off the

406
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:58,930
I'll have to shave a whole layer off the
 

407
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,650
I'll have to shave a whole layer off the
ceiling at least and in some places more

408
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:01,660
ceiling at least and in some places more
 

409
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,759
ceiling at least and in some places more
and I think well press shift instead of

410
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:05,769
and I think well press shift instead of
 

411
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,009
and I think well press shift instead of
control I'm still getting used to my key

412
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:08,019
control I'm still getting used to my key
 

413
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:14,040
control I'm still getting used to my key
switch I think I'm gonna do a grid of

414
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,050
switch I think I'm gonna do a grid of
 

415
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,990
switch I think I'm gonna do a grid of
like 2x2 squares and then afterwards

416
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
like 2x2 squares and then afterwards
 

417
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,360
like 2x2 squares and then afterwards
come by here and connect them to try and

418
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,370
come by here and connect them to try and
 

419
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,759
come by here and connect them to try and
make it look not so uniform try to give

420
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:23,769
make it look not so uniform try to give
 

421
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:31,320
make it look not so uniform try to give
it a cool pattern let's see like that's

422
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,330
it a cool pattern let's see like that's
 

423
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,780
it a cool pattern let's see like that's
so yeah like I'll have a grid of all

424
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:33,790
so yeah like I'll have a grid of all
 

425
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,930
so yeah like I'll have a grid of all
these like 2x2 squares here I'll do a

426
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:36,940
these like 2x2 squares here I'll do a
 

427
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,370
these like 2x2 squares here I'll do a
few just just to show you what I mean

428
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,380
few just just to show you what I mean
 

429
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,690
few just just to show you what I mean
doot doot doot doot doot

430
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:44,700
doot doot doot doot doot
 

431
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:52,050
doot doot doot doot doot
Birchwood like so so imagine the whole

432
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,060
Birchwood like so so imagine the whole
 

433
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:59,220
Birchwood like so so imagine the whole
ceiling like this and then I better put

434
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,230
ceiling like this and then I better put
 

435
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,750
ceiling like this and then I better put
torches up in these areas that I'm

436
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:00,760
torches up in these areas that I'm
 

437
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,250
torches up in these areas that I'm
removing them too otherwise I'm gonna

438
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:02,260
removing them too otherwise I'm gonna
 

439
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:10,259
removing them too otherwise I'm gonna
have trouble but basically oops I should

440
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:10,269
have trouble but basically oops I should
 

441
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,860
have trouble but basically oops I should
probably do it and then show you because

442
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:12,870
probably do it and then show you because
 

443
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,019
probably do it and then show you because
just setting up a tiny examples taken

444
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:16,029
just setting up a tiny examples taken
 

445
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,540
just setting up a tiny examples taken
forever here just been mining away it is

446
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:21,550
forever here just been mining away it is
 

447
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,190
forever here just been mining away it is
a very big project but I'm getting close

448
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
a very big project but I'm getting close
 

449
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,370
a very big project but I'm getting close
to done removing all the stone so

450
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:26,380
to done removing all the stone so
 

451
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,139
to done removing all the stone so
awesome having the trees because I'm

452
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:28,149
awesome having the trees because I'm
 

453
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:30,290
awesome having the trees because I'm
using them as scaffolding basically and

454
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:30,300
using them as scaffolding basically and
 

455
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,430
using them as scaffolding basically and
it's it's making this a lot easier

456
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:32,440
it's it's making this a lot easier
 

457
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,170
it's it's making this a lot easier
otherwise I can't reach the ceiling and

458
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,180
otherwise I can't reach the ceiling and
 

459
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,860
otherwise I can't reach the ceiling and
I'd have to pillar up all like every

460
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:37,870
I'd have to pillar up all like every
 

461
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,750
I'd have to pillar up all like every
like five blocks I move I would have to

462
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
like five blocks I move I would have to
 

463
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,340
like five blocks I move I would have to
like pull her up and that would just be

464
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,350
like pull her up and that would just be
 

465
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,840
like pull her up and that would just be
a nightmare um but look at all this

466
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:45,850
a nightmare um but look at all this
 

467
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,510
a nightmare um but look at all this
space so it goes all the way from well a

468
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:51,520
space so it goes all the way from well a
 

469
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,819
space so it goes all the way from well a
little further out here yet even all the

470
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:53,829
little further out here yet even all the
 

471
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:56,370
little further out here yet even all the
way from here to that wall back there

472
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:56,380
way from here to that wall back there
 

473
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,310
way from here to that wall back there
and all the way from that wall to up

474
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,320
and all the way from that wall to up
 

475
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,819
and all the way from that wall to up
there oh no I've made a mistake guys big

well not patterns but like give it
 

635
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,640
well not patterns but like give it
variation because it's pretty plain the

636
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:43,650
variation because it's pretty plain the
 

637
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,210
variation because it's pretty plain the
way it is but I think I'm gonna do like

638
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,220
way it is but I think I'm gonna do like
 

639
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,200
way it is but I think I'm gonna do like
this like take outlines and then and

640
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,210
this like take outlines and then and
 

641
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,610
this like take outlines and then and
then like do this so now we have this

642
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:55,620
then like do this so now we have this
 

643
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,600
then like do this so now we have this
like I don't know what you call it what

644
00:17:59,600 --> 00:17:59,610
like I don't know what you call it what
 

645
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,070
like I don't know what you call it what
is that called

646
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,080
is that called
 

647
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,820
is that called
not quite triangle thing I don't know

648
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:04,830
not quite triangle thing I don't know
 

649
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,860
not quite triangle thing I don't know
yeah so I'll do that throughout the

650
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:06,870
yeah so I'll do that throughout the
 

651
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,000
yeah so I'll do that throughout the
whole thing like maybe I'll do another

652
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,010
whole thing like maybe I'll do another
 

653
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,340
whole thing like maybe I'll do another
one over here and just add a little bit

654
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,350
one over here and just add a little bit
 

655
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,930
one over here and just add a little bit
of variation to the thing a little bit

656
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:14,940
of variation to the thing a little bit
 

657
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,640
of variation to the thing a little bit
of randomness and I think that's gonna

658
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:16,650
of randomness and I think that's gonna
 

659
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,780
of randomness and I think that's gonna
make it a whole lot better once once I

660
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:20,790
make it a whole lot better once once I
 

661
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,160
make it a whole lot better once once I
get that done maybe let's just take a

662
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,170
get that done maybe let's just take a
 

663
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:32,930
get that done maybe let's just take a
look at this yeah I think so cuz as it

664
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:32,940
look at this yeah I think so cuz as it
 

665
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,790
look at this yeah I think so cuz as it
is right now it's very repetitive it's

666
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:34,800
is right now it's very repetitive it's
 

667
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,140
is right now it's very repetitive it's
not it's not too fancy but once you get

668
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,150
not it's not too fancy but once you get
 

669
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,320
not it's not too fancy but once you get
get it like that it's there's a lot less

670
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,330
get it like that it's there's a lot less
 

671
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,420
get it like that it's there's a lot less
spruce this way too as well and I think

672
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,430
spruce this way too as well and I think
 

673
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,440
spruce this way too as well and I think
that's better and you'll just I think

674
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,450
that's better and you'll just I think
 

675
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,980
that's better and you'll just I think
it'll look a lot cooler anyway that's

676
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:51,990
it'll look a lot cooler anyway that's
 

677
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,510
it'll look a lot cooler anyway that's
all we're gonna do with this today I'll

678
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
all we're gonna do with this today I'll
 

679
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,870
all we're gonna do with this today I'll
maybe finish it tomorrow or something

680
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:55,880
maybe finish it tomorrow or something
 

681
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,010
maybe finish it tomorrow or something
one more thing we're gonna do this

682
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,020
one more thing we're gonna do this
 

683
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,190
one more thing we're gonna do this
episode before I end it a little bit of

684
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
episode before I end it a little bit of
 

685
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,310
episode before I end it a little bit of
research for the Nexus you guys aren't

686
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,320
research for the Nexus you guys aren't
 

687
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,190
research for the Nexus you guys aren't
supposed to be here so I asked I gave

688
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
supposed to be here so I asked I gave
 

689
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,080
supposed to be here so I asked I gave
you like three ideas last episode I

690
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,090
you like three ideas last episode I
 

691
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,450
you like three ideas last episode I
asked what your favorite was and it was

692
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:17,460
asked what your favorite was and it was
 

693
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,000
asked what your favorite was and it was
a surprisingly close poll I guess like

694
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,010
a surprisingly close poll I guess like
 

695
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,860
a surprisingly close poll I guess like
most people seem to prefer the next I

696
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:27,870
most people seem to prefer the next I
 

697
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,320
most people seem to prefer the next I
would say about 40 to 50 percent said

698
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,330
would say about 40 to 50 percent said
 

699
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,060
would say about 40 to 50 percent said
they wanted to see me build the Nexus so

700
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,070
they wanted to see me build the Nexus so
 

701
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,250
they wanted to see me build the Nexus so
that was the favorite then it was kind

702
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:34,260
that was the favorite then it was kind
 

703
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,450
that was the favorite then it was kind
of evenly split between

704
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:36,460
of evenly split between
 

705
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,700
of evenly split between
well a little bit of lag there between

706
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:38,710
well a little bit of lag there between
 

707
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,509
well a little bit of lag there between
the Ender zoo and the redstone castle

708
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:42,519
the Ender zoo and the redstone castle
 

709
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,190
the Ender zoo and the redstone castle
museum thing but a lot of people said

710
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
museum thing but a lot of people said
 

711
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,769
museum thing but a lot of people said
they wanted to see that too so for the

712
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:49,779
they wanted to see that too so for the
 

713
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:52,649
they wanted to see that too so for the
Nexus I know where I want to build it

714
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:52,659
Nexus I know where I want to build it
 

715
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,960
Nexus I know where I want to build it
already and I'll show you kind of what

716
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:54,970
already and I'll show you kind of what
 

717
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,539
already and I'll show you kind of what
the plan is with that it's gonna be a

718
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:57,549
the plan is with that it's gonna be a
 

719
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,310
the plan is with that it's gonna be a
lot of planning a lot of resource

720
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,320
lot of planning a lot of resource
 

721
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,169
lot of planning a lot of resource
gathering with with the Nexus is the

722
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:01,179
gathering with with the Nexus is the
 

723
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,850
gathering with with the Nexus is the
thing it's it's gonna be the toughest of

724
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:02,860
thing it's it's gonna be the toughest of
 

725
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,279
thing it's it's gonna be the toughest of
the projects to get rolling because I

726
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:05,289
the projects to get rolling because I
 

727
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,680
the projects to get rolling because I
need a lot of iron a lot of wood and a

728
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:07,690
need a lot of iron a lot of wood and a
 

729
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,359
need a lot of iron a lot of wood and a
whole whole ton of planning and research

730
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:11,369
whole whole ton of planning and research
 

731
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:14,999
whole whole ton of planning and research
for it to turn out well is the thing so

732
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:15,009
for it to turn out well is the thing so
 

733
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:17,749
for it to turn out well is the thing so
we're doing a little bit today on that

734
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:17,759
we're doing a little bit today on that
 

735
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,159
we're doing a little bit today on that
we're gonna go to the end my bed is

736
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:20,169
we're gonna go to the end my bed is
 

737
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:25,850
we're gonna go to the end my bed is
right here is it nighttime let's sleep

738
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:25,860

 

739
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,930

okay and then I'm gonna break it

740
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:27,940
okay and then I'm gonna break it
 

741
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,470
okay and then I'm gonna break it
so my spawn gets reset so I'll put it

742
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:31,480
so my spawn gets reset so I'll put it
 

743
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,989
so my spawn gets reset so I'll put it
over there let's go up do the ends whoo

744
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:38,999
over there let's go up do the ends whoo
 

745
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:45,539
over there let's go up do the ends whoo
all right so the plan is to build the

746
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:45,549
all right so the plan is to build the
 

747
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,399
all right so the plan is to build the
Nexus around spawn by the way I put down

748
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:50,409
Nexus around spawn by the way I put down
 

749
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,129
Nexus around spawn by the way I put down
a whole bunch more snow golems in the

750
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:53,139
a whole bunch more snow golems in the
 

751
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:56,909
a whole bunch more snow golems in the
end here just so they cover the whole

752
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:56,919
end here just so they cover the whole
 

753
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:58,440
end here just so they cover the whole
place with snow I think once they do

754
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,450
place with snow I think once they do
 

755
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,169
place with snow I think once they do
that the Enderman are mostly gonna stop

756
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:01,179
that the Enderman are mostly gonna stop
 

757
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:03,419
that the Enderman are mostly gonna stop
spawning it's kind of like a chibi way

758
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:03,429
spawning it's kind of like a chibi way
 

759
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,720
spawning it's kind of like a chibi way
of of preventing Enderman from spawning

760
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:06,730
of of preventing Enderman from spawning
 

761
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,879
of of preventing Enderman from spawning
in the end is this put down a whole ton

762
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:08,889
in the end is this put down a whole ton
 

763
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:10,470
in the end is this put down a whole ton
of snow golems and let them do their

764
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
of snow golems and let them do their
 

765
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,730
of snow golems and let them do their
thing because they can spawn on the snow

766
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:14,740
thing because they can spawn on the snow
 

767
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,320
thing because they can spawn on the snow
slabs but only if there's air spaces

768
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,330
slabs but only if there's air spaces
 

769
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,340
slabs but only if there's air spaces
nearby so if it's all solid snow there's

770
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,350
nearby so if it's all solid snow there's
 

771
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,489
nearby so if it's all solid snow there's
a lot less Enderman spawning oh please

772
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:26,499
a lot less Enderman spawning oh please
 

773
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:28,630
a lot less Enderman spawning oh please
tell me I didn't look

774
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
tell me I didn't look
 

775
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,860
tell me I didn't look
I'm not ready to get my butt kicked here

776
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:32,870
I'm not ready to get my butt kicked here
 

777
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm not ready to get my butt kicked here
ah

778
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:36,930

 

779
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,190

I press shift instead of control because

780
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,200
I press shift instead of control because
 

781
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,870
I press shift instead of control because
I'm not used to this sneaky darn it

782
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm not used to this sneaky darn it
 

783
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,290
I'm not used to this sneaky darn it
I gotta go all the way back I'll be

784
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:51,300
I gotta go all the way back I'll be
 

785
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,350
I gotta go all the way back I'll be
right back

786
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
right back
 

787
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,710
right back
we're back that was an accident so I'm

788
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:57,720
we're back that was an accident so I'm
 

789
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,410
we're back that was an accident so I'm
still getting used to switching my my

790
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,420
still getting used to switching my my
 

791

00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,030
up all in one spot it looked like the
 

865
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,090
up all in one spot it looked like the
items keep their velocity when you throw

866
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,100
items keep their velocity when you throw
 

867
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,290
items keep their velocity when you throw
them to or throw them through to through

868
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:03,300
them to or throw them through to through
 

869
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,550
them to or throw them through to through

straight down so they didn't go off to
 

873
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,180
straight down so they didn't go off to
the side and it looks like they all end

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,190
the side and it looks like they all end
 

875
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,360

that's where the item should go through

950
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,470
that's where the item should go through
 

951
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,560
that's where the item should go through
picked it all up awesome even the stuff

952
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:11,570
picked it all up awesome even the stuff
 

953
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,530
picked it all up awesome even the stuff
I threw sideways so that's good so the

954
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:14,540
I threw sideways so that's good so the
 

955
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,090
I threw sideways so that's good so the
idea is we're gonna build the Nexus

956
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,100
idea is we're gonna build the Nexus
 

957
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,400
idea is we're gonna build the Nexus
somewhat near this area here any farms I

958
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,410
somewhat near this area here any farms I
 

959
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,380
somewhat near this area here any farms I
want to set up I can set up in the end

960
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,390
want to set up I can set up in the end
 

961
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,650
want to set up I can set up in the end
and just send items through right to the

962
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:26,660
and just send items through right to the
 

963
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:32,350
and just send items through right to the
storage room pretty easily and animals

964
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,360
storage room pretty easily and animals
 

965
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,790
storage room pretty easily and animals
and all kinds of stuff so that's that's

966
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:33,800
and all kinds of stuff so that's that's
 

967
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,780
and all kinds of stuff so that's that's
just one one thought I have well while

968
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:37,790
just one one thought I have well while
 

969
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,990
just one one thought I have well while
planning and building the Nexus kind of

970
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,000
planning and building the Nexus kind of
 

971
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,790
planning and building the Nexus kind of
linked it up with the end and also

972
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:42,800
linked it up with the end and also
 

973
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,040
linked it up with the end and also
probably gonna try to connect it up with

974
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,050
probably gonna try to connect it up with
 

975
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,140
probably gonna try to connect it up with
the nether through the portal network

976
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,150
the nether through the portal network
 

977
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:53,500
the nether through the portal network
somehow so good to see that works but

978
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,510
somehow so good to see that works but
 

979
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,560
somehow so good to see that works but
anyway it is that time again everyone so

980
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:56,570
anyway it is that time again everyone so
 

981
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,510
anyway it is that time again everyone so
here we go hey II thought I was

982
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:58,520
here we go hey II thought I was
 

983
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,630
here we go hey II thought I was
wondering if you had ever considered

984
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
wondering if you had ever considered
 

985
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,340
wondering if you had ever considered
making an entirely different series

986
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,350
making an entirely different series
 

987
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,680
making an entirely different series
purely about redstone and how your

988
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:05,690
purely about redstone and how your
 

989
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,260
purely about redstone and how your
devices work apart from your LP and

990
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,270
devices work apart from your LP and
 

991
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,900
devices work apart from your LP and
minecraft videos I know you do make some

992
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:10,910
minecraft videos I know you do make some
 

993
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,460
minecraft videos I know you do make some
videos about your redstone work such as

994
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:12,470
videos about your redstone work such as
 

995
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,740
videos about your redstone work such as
the blaze firm and hopper timers etc I

996
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:14,750
the blaze firm and hopper timers etc I
 

997
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,080
the blaze firm and hopper timers etc I
just think it would be cool if you made

998
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,090
just think it would be cool if you made
 

999
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,910
just think it would be cool if you made
a different series going more in depth

1000
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:18,920
a different series going more in depth
 

1001
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,970
a different series going more in depth
about how and why it works that being

1002
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:21,980
about how and why it works that being
 

1003
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,310
about how and why it works that being
redstone so a long time ago like maybe I

1004
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
redstone so a long time ago like maybe I
 

1005
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,780
redstone so a long time ago like maybe I
wasn't that long ago maybe half a year

1006
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:28,790
wasn't that long ago maybe half a year
 

1007
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,540
wasn't that long ago maybe half a year
to a year ago I tried recording a

1008
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:31,550
to a year ago I tried recording a
 

1009
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,060
to a year ago I tried recording a
redstone series like specifically like a

1010
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,070
redstone series like specifically like a
 

1011
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,180
redstone series like specifically like a
redstone tutorial series it's probably

1012
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,190
redstone tutorial series it's probably
 

1013
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,730
redstone tutorial series it's probably
gonna be about 5 10 episodes total if I

1014
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:39,740
gonna be about 5 10 episodes total if I
 

1015
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,020
gonna be about 5 10 episodes total if I
was the guess and it wasn't so much

1016
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,030
was the guess and it wasn't so much
 

1017
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,360
was the guess and it wasn't so much
about like how to build the T flip-flop

1018
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,370
about like how to build the T flip-flop
 

1019
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,920
about like how to build the T flip-flop
in this and that and you know how to

1020
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:50,930
in this and that and you know how to
 

1021
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,800
in this and that and you know how to
build a redstone door and that is more

1022
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:53,810
build a redstone door and that is more
 

1023
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,720
build a redstone door and that is more
like looking into how redstone works

1024
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:55,730
like looking into how redstone works
 

1025
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,150
like looking into how redstone works
specifically how it connects to the

1026
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,160
specifically how it connects to the
 

1027
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,060
specifically how it connects to the
different devices how how the timings

1028
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,070
different devices how how the timings
 

1029
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,040
different devices how how the timings
worked all that kind of stuff defend the

1030
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,050
worked all that kind of stuff defend the
 

1031
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,070
worked all that kind of stuff defend the
fundamentals of redstone

1032
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
fundamentals of redstone
 

1033
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,180
fundamentals of redstone
but I wasn't too happy with how the

1034
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,190
but I wasn't too happy with how the
 

1035
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,590
but I wasn't too happy with how the
video turned out so I just kind of

1036
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
video turned out so I just kind of
 

1037
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,530
video turned out so I just kind of
strapped it but maybe again in the

1038
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:12,540
strapped it but maybe again in the
 

1039
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,700
strapped it but maybe again in the
future I'll give it another shot because

1040
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:16,710
future I'll give it another shot because
 

1041
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,830
future I'll give it another shot because
with redstone it's not so much like

1042
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:18,840
with redstone it's not so much like
 

1043
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,020
with redstone it's not so much like
memorizing how to build stuff that is

1044
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,030
memorizing how to build stuff that is
 

1045
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,910
memorizing how to build stuff that is
important but it's also just knowing how

1046
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:22,920
important but it's also just knowing how
 

1047
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,010
important but it's also just knowing how
it works is crucial and and why like

1048
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,020
it works is crucial and and why like
 

1049
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,660
it works is crucial and and why like
people tend to get frustrated with

1050
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:29,670
people tend to get frustrated with
 

1051
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,130
people tend to get frustrated with
redstone because they don't understand

1052
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:31,140
redstone because they don't understand
 

1053
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,900
redstone because they don't understand
why it's not doing what they want it to

1054
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:32,910
why it's not doing what they want it to
 

1055
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,730
why it's not doing what they want it to
do so it's kind of important to

1056
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:34,740
do so it's kind of important to
 

1057
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,850
do so it's kind of important to
understand why it's not doing what they

1058
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:37,860
understand why it's not doing what they
 

1059
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,570
understand why it's not doing what they
want it to you know understand how it

1060
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:41,580
want it to you know understand how it
 

1061
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,000
want it to you know understand how it
powers stuff and and that kind of thing

1062
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,010
powers stuff and and that kind of thing
 

1063
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,140
powers stuff and and that kind of thing
so anyway I have considered it short

1064
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,150
so anyway I have considered it short
 

1065
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,100
so anyway I have considered it short
