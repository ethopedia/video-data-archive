well one main project and i think we'll
 

245
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,029
well one main project and i think we'll
probably start that right away

246
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039

about this one it's gonna be
 

255
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,710
about this one it's gonna be
i don't know if it's gonna be a lot of

256

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
okay actually on second thought here i
 

261
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,950
okay actually on second thought here i
think i've decided on

262

what design i'm gonna be using for this
and uh the one i've chosen

266
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
and uh the one i've chosen
 

267
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,990
and uh the one i've chosen
is gonna take a lot of materials and

268
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
is gonna take a lot of materials and
 

269
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,909
is gonna take a lot of materials and
we'll probably take a

270
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
we'll probably take a
 

271
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,870
we'll probably take a
long time to build as well but we can

272
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
long time to build as well but we can
 

273
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,909
long time to build as well but we can
get it started today i think

274
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
get it started today i think
 

275
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,950
get it started today i think
uh pretty quickly and uh

276
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
uh pretty quickly and uh
 

277
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,189
uh pretty quickly and uh
it will take a lot of materials i'm just

278
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
it will take a lot of materials i'm just
 

279
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,110
it will take a lot of materials i'm just

together so i can
 

291
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,189
together so i can
breed the color sheet

four stacks of pistons plus i had some

326
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
four stacks of pistons plus i had some
 

327
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,950
four stacks of pistons plus i had some
left

left
 

329
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,830
left
laying around here so each piston of

330
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
laying around here so each piston of
 

331
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,110
laying around here so each piston of
course is one iron and one redstone

332
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
course is one iron and one redstone
 

333
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,469
course is one iron and one redstone
and that has tanked my iron supply this

334
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
and that has tanked my iron supply this
 

335
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,070
and that has tanked my iron supply this
is all i have left

336

of black wool so that's that's two
 

359
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
of black wool so that's that's two
stacks total at the moment

360

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,670
stacks total at the moment
i'm going to save six there for sheep

362
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
i'm going to save six there for sheep
 

363
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,469
i'm going to save six there for sheep
which i'll probably have to

364
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
which i'll probably have to
 

365
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,189
which i'll probably have to
breed and and shear and everything to

366
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
breed and and shear and everything to
 

367
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,309
breed and and shear and everything to
get

368
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
get
 

369
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,510
get
the rest of the wool i need

370
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
the rest of the wool i need
 

371
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,749
the rest of the wool i need
so let's make our make our yellow here

372
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
so let's make our make our yellow here
 

373
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,430
so let's make our make our yellow here
and we'll probably have to make several

374
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
and we'll probably have to make several
 

375
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,350
and we'll probably have to make several
trips if you haven't figured it out

376
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
trips if you haven't figured it out
 

377
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,350
trips if you haven't figured it out
already we're heading to the end today

378
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360

 

379
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,629

and i will

380
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
and i will
 

381
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,309
and i will
i will see you guys at the stronghold i

382
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
i will see you guys at the stronghold i
 

383
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,550
i will see you guys at the stronghold i
guess

384
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560

 

385
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,110

okay we're at the stronghold uh i guess

386
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
okay we're at the stronghold uh i guess
 

387
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,869
okay we're at the stronghold uh i guess
it's only a three minute run with the

388
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
it's only a three minute run with the
 

389
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,909
it's only a three minute run with the
speed potion

390
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
speed potion
 

391
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,950
speed potion
from the base to here it's good to know

392
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
from the base to here it's good to know
 

393
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,790
from the base to here it's good to know
i got all the supplies here safe and

394
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
i got all the supplies here safe and
 

395
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,309
i got all the supplies here safe and
sound

396
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
sound
 

397
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,230
sound
gonna really need a lot more black wool

398
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
gonna really need a lot more black wool
 

399
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,629
gonna really need a lot more black wool
though

400
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639

 

401
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,230

so we might have to use a substitute

402
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
so we might have to use a substitute
 

403
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,830
so we might have to use a substitute
until we get more

404
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
until we get more
 

405
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,350
until we get more
um so let's first go into

406
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
um so let's first go into
 

407
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,110
um so let's first go into
the end here and i'll give you a rundown

408
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
the end here and i'll give you a rundown
 

409
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,869
the end here and i'll give you a rundown
of the

410
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
of the
 

411
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:38,829
of the
plan and everything

412
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
plan and everything
 

413
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,269
plan and everything
okay lots enderman around

414
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
okay lots enderman around
 

415
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,350
okay lots enderman around
that's for sure

416
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360

 

417
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,710

so this is what i've done i've made

418
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
so this is what i've done i've made
 

419
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,710
so this is what i've done i've made
i better get out of here before the

420
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
i better get out of here before the
 

421
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,230
i better get out of here before the
dragon finds me

422
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
dragon finds me
 

423
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,030
dragon finds me
he's still alive but i've made an

424
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
he's still alive but i've made an
 

425
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,910
he's still alive but i've made an
obsidian bridge out to nowhere

426
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
obsidian bridge out to nowhere
 

427
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,230
obsidian bridge out to nowhere
oh that's a bad time to push my

428
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
oh that's a bad time to push my
 

429
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,269
oh that's a bad time to push my
side key just about walked off

430
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279

 

431
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,269

and it goes quite a ways away um

432
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
and it goes quite a ways away um
 

433
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,350
and it goes quite a ways away um
it seems the easiest mob system to make

434
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
it seems the easiest mob system to make
 

435
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,030
it seems the easiest mob system to make
in the game is in the end

436
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
in the game is in the end
 

437
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,630
in the game is in the end
because once you get all the way out

438
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
because once you get all the way out
 

439
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,790
because once you get all the way out
here there's no land

440
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
here there's no land
 

441
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,710
here there's no land
so you can get highest efficiency

442
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
so you can get highest efficiency
 

443
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,829
so you can get highest efficiency
and you don't even have to kill the

444
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
and you don't even have to kill the
 

445
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,230
and you don't even have to kill the
dragon you just have to build out

446
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
dragon you just have to build out
 

447
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,509
dragon you just have to build out
into the void area and you are free to

448
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
into the void area and you are free to
 

449
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,670
into the void area and you are free to
do whatever you want

450
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
do whatever you want
 

451
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,670
do whatever you want
so for example if we run up ahead a

452
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
so for example if we run up ahead a
 

453
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,670
so for example if we run up ahead a
little bit

454
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
little bit
 

455
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,350
little bit
i'll just show you how effective

456
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
i'll just show you how effective
 

457
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,790
i'll just show you how effective
spawning rates are

458
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
spawning rates are
 

459
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,630
spawning rates are
in the end here it's going to remove a

460
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
in the end here it's going to remove a
 

461
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,910
in the end here it's going to remove a
couple torches

462
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920

 

463
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,350

okay so it's dark here endermen need

464
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
okay so it's dark here endermen need
 

465
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,710
okay so it's dark here endermen need
a light level

466
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720

 

467
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,070

below eight to spawn if i remember right

468
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
below eight to spawn if i remember right
 

469
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,870
below eight to spawn if i remember right
i think it's below eight and

470
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
i think it's below eight and
 

471
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,430
i think it's below eight and
i don't know if that's 24 blocks away i

472
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
i don't know if that's 24 blocks away i
 

473
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,430
i don't know if that's 24 blocks away i
think it is

474
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
think it is
 

475
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,949
think it is
so we're going to be making a mob trap

476
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
so we're going to be making a mob trap
 

477
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,030
so we're going to be making a mob trap
out here because we can get

478
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
out here because we can get
 

479
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,230
out here because we can get
super high efficiency for spawning rates

480
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
super high efficiency for spawning rates
 

481
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,430
super high efficiency for spawning rates
and if we have an enderman farm in the

482
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
and if we have an enderman farm in the
 

483
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,110
and if we have an enderman farm in the
end we don't have to worry about making

484
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
end we don't have to worry about making
 

485
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,790
end we don't have to worry about making
one

486
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
one
 

487
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,829
one
in the regular world which makes things

488
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
in the regular world which makes things
 

489
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,590
in the regular world which makes things
a lot simpler because these guys have

490
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
a lot simpler because these guys have
 

491
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,430
a lot simpler because these guys have
annoying properties

492
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
annoying properties
 

493
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,110
annoying properties
as you know they can't touch water

494
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
as you know they can't touch water
 

495
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,110
as you know they can't touch water
without teleporting so that makes

496
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
without teleporting so that makes
 

497
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,350
without teleporting so that makes
transporting them difficult

498
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360

 

499
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,030

they like to teleport around they're

500
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
they like to teleport around they're
 

501
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,870
they like to teleport around they're
super aggressive they're three blocks

502
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
super aggressive they're three blocks
 

503
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,350
super aggressive they're three blocks
high

504
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
high
 

505
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,750
high
while most other mobs are two

506
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760

 

507
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,350

so yeah this is going to be fun

508
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
so yeah this is going to be fun
 

509
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,389
so yeah this is going to be fun
my idea here is

510
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399

 

511
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,630

as long as we're 144 blocks away from

512
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
as long as we're 144 blocks away from
 

513
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,829
as long as we're 144 blocks away from
that mainland

514
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
that mainland
 

515
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,430
that mainland
they will spawn on anything i build out

516
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
they will spawn on anything i build out
 

517
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,310
they will spawn on anything i build out
here that

518
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
here that
 

519
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,030
here that
is dark and that's not a half slab or

520
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
is dark and that's not a half slab or
 

521
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,990
is dark and that's not a half slab or
glass or anything like

522
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
glass or anything like
 

523
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,550
glass or anything like
that

524
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560

 

525
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,350

okay so i've been thinking of a lot of

526
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
okay so i've been thinking of a lot of
 

527
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,509
okay so i've been thinking of a lot of
different

528
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
different
 

529
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,389
different
enderman farm designs and i came up with

530
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
enderman farm designs and i came up with
 

531
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,310
enderman farm designs and i came up with
my own one

532
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
my own one
 

533
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,470
my own one
um actually you know what we're gonna do

534
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
um actually you know what we're gonna do
 

535
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,630
um actually you know what we're gonna do
we're gonna head back to

536
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
we're gonna head back to
 

537
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,910
we're gonna head back to
stronghold

538
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920

 

539
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,990

whoo look at that score amazing

540
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
whoo look at that score amazing
 

541
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,550
whoo look at that score amazing
absolutely meaningless okay so

542
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
absolutely meaningless okay so
 

543
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,710
absolutely meaningless okay so
maybe we'll use dirt as a visual aid so

544
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
maybe we'll use dirt as a visual aid so
 

545
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,630
maybe we'll use dirt as a visual aid so
one farm idea

546
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
one farm idea
 

547
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,630
one farm idea
and i think i've seen someone do this is

548
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
and i think i've seen someone do this is
 

549
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,829
and i think i've seen someone do this is
to do like a funnel thing

550
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
to do like a funnel thing
 

551
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,670
to do like a funnel thing
because you can't move the enderman with

552
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
because you can't move the enderman with
 

553
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,949
because you can't move the enderman with
water so you

554
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
water so you
 

555
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,470
water so you
have to come up with other ways of

556
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
have to come up with other ways of
 

557
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,790
have to come up with other ways of
getting them to a central point

558
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
getting them to a central point
 

559
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,629
getting them to a central point
if that's what you want so

560
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
if that's what you want so
 

561
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,829
if that's what you want so
kind of like my blaze farm you just keep

562
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
kind of like my blaze farm you just keep
 

563
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,870
kind of like my blaze farm you just keep
doing like an inverted pyramid with

564
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
doing like an inverted pyramid with
 

565
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,430
doing like an inverted pyramid with
pistons and pressure plates

566
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
pistons and pressure plates
 

567
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,030
pistons and pressure plates
and

568
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040

 

569
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,069

enderman will spawn so if they spawn up

570
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
enderman will spawn so if they spawn up
 

571
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,670
enderman will spawn so if they spawn up
here they'll get pushed down

572
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
here they'll get pushed down
 

573
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,509
here they'll get pushed down
to the lower level and then another

574
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
to the lower level and then another
 

575
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,030
to the lower level and then another
piston will push them further and

576
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
piston will push them further and
 

577
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,310
piston will push them further and
eventually they all group to the center

578
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
eventually they all group to the center
 

579
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,110
eventually they all group to the center
that has a few benefits obviously you

580
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
that has a few benefits obviously you
 

581
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,389
that has a few benefits obviously you
can get all the enderman

582
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
can get all the enderman
 

583
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,430
can get all the enderman
together in the center has a high piston

584
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
together in the center has a high piston
 

585
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,829
together in the center has a high piston
cost

586
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
cost
 

587
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,670
cost
and they're likely to take

588
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680

 

589
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,590

take damage or have other problems from

590
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
take damage or have other problems from
 

591
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,030
take damage or have other problems from
the pistons when

592
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
the pistons when
 

593
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,110
the pistons when
when you do that and if you have one

594
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
when you do that and if you have one
 

595
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,389
when you do that and if you have one
intermittent you guys

596
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
intermittent you guys
 

597
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,829
intermittent you guys
why oh great

598
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839

 

599
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:51,350

no leave me alone

600
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360

 

601
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,710

get out of here you idiot i should just

602
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
get out of here you idiot i should just
 

603
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,990
get out of here you idiot i should just
break that spawner i don't think i'm

604
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
break that spawner i don't think i'm
 

605
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,470
break that spawner i don't think i'm
gonna do anything with it

606
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
gonna do anything with it
 

607
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,150
gonna do anything with it
i just can't bear to break spawners it's

608
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
i just can't bear to break spawners it's
 

609
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,790
i just can't bear to break spawners it's
it's against what i like to do

610
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
it's against what i like to do
 

611
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,509
it's against what i like to do
and we got lava flowing again great yeah

612
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
and we got lava flowing again great yeah
 

613
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,750
and we got lava flowing again great yeah
so if you have a funnel style

614
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
so if you have a funnel style
 

615
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,230
so if you have a funnel style
if this if say it goes in 10 blocks

616
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
if this if say it goes in 10 blocks
 

617
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,190
if this if say it goes in 10 blocks
uh if you have an enderman spawn at the

618
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
uh if you have an enderman spawn at the
 

619
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,190
uh if you have an enderman spawn at the
highest one the tenth one it has to go

620
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
highest one the tenth one it has to go
 

621
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,190
highest one the tenth one it has to go
through ten pistons to get to

622
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
through ten pistons to get to
 

623
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,710
through ten pistons to get to
the center so the bigger you make a farm

624
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
the center so the bigger you make a farm
 

625
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,269
the center so the bigger you make a farm
like that

626
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
like that
 

627
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,350
like that
the more piston action is going to

628
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
the more piston action is going to
 

629
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,310
the more piston action is going to
happen and the more lag you're gonna get

630
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
happen and the more lag you're gonna get
 

631
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,430
happen and the more lag you're gonna get
and possibly other problems so

632
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
and possibly other problems so
 

633
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,350
and possibly other problems so
not gonna do a funnel style even though

634
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
not gonna do a funnel style even though
 

635
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,670
not gonna do a funnel style even though
they're pretty cool

636
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
they're pretty cool
 

637
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,189
they're pretty cool
uh then there's uh i don't know if you

638
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
uh then there's uh i don't know if you
 

639
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,629
uh then there's uh i don't know if you
saw a dot damn

640
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
saw a dot damn
 

641
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,069
saw a dot damn
iron lung one where where the blocks

642
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
iron lung one where where the blocks
 

643
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,590
iron lung one where where the blocks
i'm doing a terrible job explaining this

644
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
i'm doing a terrible job explaining this
 

645
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,030
i'm doing a terrible job explaining this
i'm going to separate it i'm going to

646
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
i'm going to separate it i'm going to
 

647
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,870
i'm going to separate it i'm going to
set up a demonstration

648
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880

 

649
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,790

right so with the shifter style i got a

650
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
right so with the shifter style i got a
 

651
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,710
right so with the shifter style i got a
small example here

652
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
small example here
 

653
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,310
small example here
the idea is you would build it up in the

654
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
the idea is you would build it up in the
 

655
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,710
the idea is you would build it up in the
air

656
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720

 

657
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,509

that sounded really weird you'd build it

658
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
that sounded really weird you'd build it
 

659
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,629
that sounded really weird you'd build it
up in the air

660
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
up in the air
 

661
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,910
up in the air
enderman would spawn on the pad

662
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
enderman would spawn on the pad
 

663
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,030
enderman would spawn on the pad
then you would hook the two piston sides

664
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
then you would hook the two piston sides
 

665
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,509
then you would hook the two piston sides
up to some kind of a clock and what

666
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
up to some kind of a clock and what
 

667
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,750
up to some kind of a clock and what
would happen is

668
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
would happen is
 

669
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,990
would happen is
extend one side then after a certain

670
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
extend one side then after a certain
 

671
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,069
extend one side then after a certain
amount of time the clock would make

672
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
amount of time the clock would make
 

673
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,590
amount of time the clock would make
that side extend and then it would

674
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
that side extend and then it would
 

675
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,069
that side extend and then it would
repeat

676
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079

 

677
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,470

and that causes the blocks to shift so

678
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
and that causes the blocks to shift so
 

679
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,030
and that causes the blocks to shift so
that when the endermen spawn on it

680
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
that when the endermen spawn on it
 

681
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,030
that when the endermen spawn on it
uh they have a chance of falling through

682
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
uh they have a chance of falling through
 

683
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,310
uh they have a chance of falling through
like that

684
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
like that
 

685
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,069
like that
and then they would fall to their death

686
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
and then they would fall to their death
 

687
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,230
and then they would fall to their death
or fall to the point where they're low

688
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
or fall to the point where they're low
 

689
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,590
or fall to the point where they're low
on health so you can

690
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
on health so you can
 

691
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,310
on health so you can
kill them for xp that's the idea behind

692
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
kill them for xp that's the idea behind
 

693
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,590
kill them for xp that's the idea behind
it

694
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
it
 

695
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,949
it
and you could very nicely make it up to

696
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
and you could very nicely make it up to
 

697
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,430
and you could very nicely make it up to
maybe like a 12 by 12 area of blocks

698
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
maybe like a 12 by 12 area of blocks
 

699
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,790
maybe like a 12 by 12 area of blocks
because pistons can push up to 12 blocks

700
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
because pistons can push up to 12 blocks
 

701
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,550
because pistons can push up to 12 blocks
which would be 12 times 12 is 144 total

702
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
which would be 12 times 12 is 144 total
 

703
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,350
which would be 12 times 12 is 144 total
that's quite a bit of area uh from my

704
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
that's quite a bit of area uh from my
 

705
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,310
that's quite a bit of area uh from my
previous

706
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
previous
 

707
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,910
previous
okay my previous experiments

708
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
okay my previous experiments
 

709
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,230
okay my previous experiments
with uh remember the ice base

710
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
with uh remember the ice base
 

711
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,350
with uh remember the ice base
i found you need

712
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
i found you need
 

713
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,230
i found you need
probably a thousand blocks spawning

714
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
probably a thousand blocks spawning
 

715
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,350
probably a thousand blocks spawning
space minimum to utilize

716
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
space minimum to utilize
 

717
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,829
space minimum to utilize
a mob farm to the maximum at high

718
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
a mob farm to the maximum at high
 

719
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,150
a mob farm to the maximum at high
efficiency

720
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
efficiency
 

721
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,590
efficiency
so that's what i'm going to be aiming

722
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
so that's what i'm going to be aiming
 

723
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,350
so that's what i'm going to be aiming
for with this enderman farm about a

724
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
for with this enderman farm about a
 

725
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,189
for with this enderman farm about a
thousand blocks or so

726
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
thousand blocks or so
 

727
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,710
thousand blocks or so
and see how that goes uh the problem

728
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
and see how that goes uh the problem
 

729
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,230
and see how that goes uh the problem
with this shifter style

730
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
with this shifter style
 

731
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,350
with this shifter style
well nice thing about is it's pretty

732
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
well nice thing about is it's pretty
 

733
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,870
well nice thing about is it's pretty
simple to build

734
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
simple to build
 

735
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,710
simple to build
um 12 by 12 set of blocks you would need

736
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
um 12 by 12 set of blocks you would need
 

737
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,790
um 12 by 12 set of blocks you would need
24 pistons which isn't bad

738
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800

 

739
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,310

you would have to have a clock running

740
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
you would have to have a clock running
 

741
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,389
you would have to have a clock running
though which does cause lag

742
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
though which does cause lag
 

743
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,069
though which does cause lag
and when the blocks get moved that

744
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
and when the blocks get moved that
 

745
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,230
and when the blocks get moved that
causes quite a bit of lag too

746
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
causes quite a bit of lag too
 

747
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,550
causes quite a bit of lag too
so it is a bit of a laggy farm

748
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
so it is a bit of a laggy farm
 

749
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,150
so it is a bit of a laggy farm
especially if you

750
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
especially if you
 

751
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,310
especially if you
have like eight sets of 12 by 12

752
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
have like eight sets of 12 by 12
 

753
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,189
have like eight sets of 12 by 12
blocks that adds up quick and the lag

754
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
blocks that adds up quick and the lag
 

755
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:09,590
blocks that adds up quick and the lag
yet

756
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
yet
 

757
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,269
yet
adds up quick too when you do that so

758
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
adds up quick too when you do that so
 

759
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,069
adds up quick too when you do that so
i was really leaning towards this this

760
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
i was really leaning towards this this
 

761
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,870
i was really leaning towards this this
style but i

762
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
style but i
 

763
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,230
style but i
found that endermen will

764
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
found that endermen will
 

765
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,069
found that endermen will
take damage as they fall through that

766
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
take damage as they fall through that
 

767
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,670
take damage as they fall through that
they take a little bit of suffocation

768
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
they take a little bit of suffocation
 

769
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,430
they take a little bit of suffocation
damage so you can't

770
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
damage so you can't
 

771
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,670
damage so you can't
get an accurate amount of health on them

772
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
get an accurate amount of health on them
 

773
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,590
get an accurate amount of health on them
so that you can one hit kill them with

774
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
so that you can one hit kill them with
 

775
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,189
so that you can one hit kill them with
your fist

776
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
your fist
 

777
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,030
your fist
other thing about this style is you

778
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
other thing about this style is you
 

779
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,870
other thing about this style is you
don't get them collected to a central

780
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
don't get them collected to a central
 

781
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,829
don't get them collected to a central
point

782
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
point
 

783
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,870
point
which is something i won't be doing with

784
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
which is something i won't be doing with
 

785
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,150
which is something i won't be doing with
my farm either

786
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
my farm either
 

787
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,150
my farm either
just because it complicates it

788
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
just because it complicates it
 

789
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,310
just because it complicates it
i am aiming to make an xp style

790
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
i am aiming to make an xp style
 

791
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,829
i am aiming to make an xp style
and maybe i'll set up one more example

792
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
and maybe i'll set up one more example
 

793
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,590
and maybe i'll set up one more example
of another farm i was thinking of doing

794
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
of another farm i was thinking of doing
 

795
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,790
of another farm i was thinking of doing
another style but that i decided against

796
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800

 

797
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,870

oh yeah i forgot there's also one other

798
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
oh yeah i forgot there's also one other
 

799
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,629
oh yeah i forgot there's also one other
really major reason why i've

800
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
really major reason why i've
 

801
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,789
really major reason why i've
decided against using this style even

802
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
decided against using this style even
 

803
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,789
decided against using this style even
though i like it for its

804
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
though i like it for its
 

805
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,069
though i like it for its
relative simplicity there's an issue

806
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
relative simplicity there's an issue
 

807
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,549
relative simplicity there's an issue
with

808
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
with
 

809
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,230
with
sometimes mobs not falling through it

810
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
sometimes mobs not falling through it
 

811
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,669
sometimes mobs not falling through it
as you can see i'm not falling through

812
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
as you can see i'm not falling through
 

813
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,390
as you can see i'm not falling through
it right now that tends to happen if

814
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
it right now that tends to happen if
 

815
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,590
it right now that tends to happen if
they're standing between

816
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
they're standing between
 

817
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,750
they're standing between
two blocks you can see the blocks the

818
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
two blocks you can see the blocks the
 

819
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,710
two blocks you can see the blocks the
block line is right there

820
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
block line is right there
 

821
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,950
block line is right there
and i can't draw straight

822
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960

 

823
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,950

so sometimes they'll get stuck in there

824
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
so sometimes they'll get stuck in there
 

825
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,990
so sometimes they'll get stuck in there
for quite

826
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
for quite
 

827
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,110
for quite
a while if because uh

828
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
a while if because uh
 

829
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,750
a while if because uh
if they get in a place where they won't

830
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
if they get in a place where they won't
 

831
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,350
if they get in a place where they won't
fall through and then they stop moving

832
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
fall through and then they stop moving
 

833
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,990
fall through and then they stop moving
because of the

834
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
because of the
 

835
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,029
because of the
idle timer where their

836
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
idle timer where their
 

837
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,710
idle timer where their
mobs will stop moving if i think they're

838
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
mobs will stop moving if i think they're
 

839
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,230
mobs will stop moving if i think they're
32 blocks away from you

840
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
32 blocks away from you
 

841
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,990
32 blocks away from you
after a few seconds so if that happens

842
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
after a few seconds so if that happens
 

843
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,350
after a few seconds so if that happens
they might be stuck there until they

844
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
they might be stuck there until they
 

845
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,950
they might be stuck there until they
despawn that's an issue for sure

846
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
despawn that's an issue for sure
 

847
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,830
despawn that's an issue for sure
if i stand over here fall right through

848
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:58,840
if i stand over here fall right through
 

849
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,350
if i stand over here fall right through
so another thing to keep in mind i do

850
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
so another thing to keep in mind i do
 

851
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,669
so another thing to keep in mind i do
really like the style but

852
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
really like the style but
 

853
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,669
really like the style but
just a few issues with it

854
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679

 

855
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,789

now for a very different style of farm

856
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
now for a very different style of farm
 

857
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,310
now for a very different style of farm
i was thinking of doing something like

858
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
i was thinking of doing something like
 

859
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,990
i was thinking of doing something like
this just have rows of blocks

860
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
this just have rows of blocks
 

861
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,870
this just have rows of blocks
up in the sky for the enderman to spawn

862
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
up in the sky for the enderman to spawn
 

863
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,590
up in the sky for the enderman to spawn
on

864
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
on
 

865
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,950
on
and then in between these rows put signs

866
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
and then in between these rows put signs
 

867
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,470
and then in between these rows put signs
or fence gates

868
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
or fence gates
 

869
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,070
or fence gates
i would probably recommend signs just

870
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
i would probably recommend signs just
 

871
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,669
i would probably recommend signs just
because fence gates seem to have a few

872
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
because fence gates seem to have a few
 

873
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,669
because fence gates seem to have a few
issues at the moment

874
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
issues at the moment
 

875
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,190
issues at the moment
but to put signs in between for the mobs

876
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
but to put signs in between for the mobs
 

877
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,789
but to put signs in between for the mobs
to see as blocks so that

878
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
to see as blocks so that
 

879
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,870
to see as blocks so that
they will attempt to walk on the signs

880
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
they will attempt to walk on the signs
 

881
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,950
they will attempt to walk on the signs
and then they'll fall down

882
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
and then they'll fall down
 

883
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,150
and then they'll fall down
and no pistons no redstone

884
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
and no pistons no redstone
 

885
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,310
and no pistons no redstone
it would be pretty efficient the only

886
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
it would be pretty efficient the only
 

887
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,470
it would be pretty efficient the only
issue is uh

888
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
issue is uh
 

889
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,390
issue is uh
sometimes when mobs spawn they don't

890
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
sometimes when mobs spawn they don't
 

891
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,230
sometimes when mobs spawn they don't
start walking

892
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
start walking
 

893
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,990
start walking
right away it might take them a few

894
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
right away it might take them a few
 

895
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,630
right away it might take them a few
seconds and if it takes a few seconds

896
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
seconds and if it takes a few seconds
 

897
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,630
seconds and if it takes a few seconds
and they are long ways away from you up

898
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
and they are long ways away from you up
 

899
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,070
and they are long ways away from you up
in the sky

900
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
in the sky
 

901
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,110
in the sky
uh they're gonna get stuck there until

902
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
uh they're gonna get stuck there until
 

903
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,990
uh they're gonna get stuck there until
they despawn

904
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
they despawn
 

905
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,430
they despawn
so probably about half of them

906
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
so probably about half of them
 

907
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,270
so probably about half of them
maybe maybe a little bit more will fall

908
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
maybe maybe a little bit more will fall
 

909
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,789
maybe maybe a little bit more will fall
down and the other half will get stuck

910
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
down and the other half will get stuck
 

911
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,990
down and the other half will get stuck
on top here

912
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
on top here
 

913
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,510
on top here
and they'll eat up your mob spots

914
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
and they'll eat up your mob spots
 

915
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,270
and they'll eat up your mob spots
until they despawn so very simple but

916
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
until they despawn so very simple but
 

917
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,070
until they despawn so very simple but
somewhat inefficient

918
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080

 

919
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,110

all right i hope you're not getting

920
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
all right i hope you're not getting
 

921
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,350
all right i hope you're not getting
bored of this i have one more

922
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
bored of this i have one more
 

923
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,110
bored of this i have one more
farm design style i'm going to show you

924
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
farm design style i'm going to show you
 

925
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,669
farm design style i'm going to show you
that i that i rejected but

926
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
that i that i rejected but
 

927
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,870
that i that i rejected but
it also has a few benefits and along

928
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
it also has a few benefits and along
 

929
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,830
it also has a few benefits and along
with it a few negative things

930
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
with it a few negative things
 

931
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,510
with it a few negative things
again you would build this style up in

932
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
again you would build this style up in
 

933
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,510
again you would build this style up in
the air just imagine

934
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
the air just imagine
 

935
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,590
the air just imagine
this is repeated over here i don't have

936
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
this is repeated over here i don't have
 

937
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,750
this is repeated over here i don't have
enough resources here to demonstrate the

938
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
enough resources here to demonstrate the
 

939
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,150
enough resources here to demonstrate the
salt properly

940
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
salt properly
 

941
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,390
salt properly
but the idea is enderman would spawn

942
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
but the idea is enderman would spawn
 

943
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,990
but the idea is enderman would spawn
only on the pressure plates

944
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
only on the pressure plates
 

945
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,669
only on the pressure plates
and when they do that um

946
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
and when they do that um
 

947
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,590
and when they do that um
they get pushed off pretty much

948
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
they get pushed off pretty much
 

949
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,190
they get pushed off pretty much
instantly

950
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
instantly
 

951
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,430
instantly
so you would repeat it wire repeater

952
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
so you would repeat it wire repeater
 

953
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,390
so you would repeat it wire repeater
wire repeater

they get pushed to the middle so

958
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
they get pushed to the middle so
 

959
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,270
they get pushed to the middle so
it's a seven wide thing

960
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
it's a seven wide thing
 

961
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,310
it's a seven wide thing
and these are sticky pistons pressure

pushes the endermen down they'll fall

970
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
pushes the endermen down they'll fall
 

971
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,110
pushes the endermen down they'll fall
and depending on how you set it up

972
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
and depending on how you set it up
 

973
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,190

they'll either
fall to their deaths you guys where do

976
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
fall to their deaths you guys where do
 

977
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,870
fall to their deaths you guys where do
you keep coming from

978
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
you keep coming from
 

979
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,590
you keep coming from
it's the third one i've killed they'll

980
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
it's the third one i've killed they'll
 

981
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,950
it's the third one i've killed they'll
either fall to their death or they'll

982
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
either fall to their death or they'll
 

983
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,149
either fall to their death or they'll
fall just to the point

984
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,159
fall just to the point
 

985
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,190
fall just to the point
where the one hit will kill them

986
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
where the one hit will kill them
 

987
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,950
where the one hit will kill them
this farm design is nice for that

988
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
this farm design is nice for that
 

989
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,029
this farm design is nice for that
because you can accurately get them down

990
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
because you can accurately get them down
 

991
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,470
because you can accurately get them down
to

992
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
to
 

993
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,789
to
a fist hit to kill them

994
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799

 

995
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,669

this is probably the quickest design as

996
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
this is probably the quickest design as
 

997
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,470
this is probably the quickest design as
well

998
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
well
 

999
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,990
well
because as soon as they're on it they

1000
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
because as soon as they're on it they
 

1001
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,230
because as soon as they're on it they
get pushed off while the shifter style

1002
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
get pushed off while the shifter style
 

1003
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,590
get pushed off while the shifter style
for example

1004
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
for example
 

1005
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,909
for example
uh you got to wait for the clock and a

1006
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
uh you got to wait for the clock and a
 

1007
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,190
uh you got to wait for the clock and a
lot of the times when it shifts they

1008
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
lot of the times when it shifts they
 

1009
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,110
lot of the times when it shifts they
don't fall down

1010
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
don't fall down
 

1011
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,470
don't fall down
so this one's really good for that

1012
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
so this one's really good for that
 

1013
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,590
so this one's really good for that
negative thing about this um it's pretty

1014
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
negative thing about this um it's pretty
 

1015
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,149
negative thing about this um it's pretty
big

1016
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
big
 

1017
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,789
big
for the spawning space so if you had a

1018
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:11,799
for the spawning space so if you had a
 

1019
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,590
for the spawning space so if you had a
16x7 area

1020
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:13,600
16x7 area
 

1021
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,430
16x7 area
you would only have 32 spawning spaces

1022
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
you would only have 32 spawning spaces
 

1023
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,909
you would only have 32 spawning spaces
in that instead of let's see calculator

1024
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
in that instead of let's see calculator
 

1025
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,270
in that instead of let's see calculator
16 times 7 is a

1026
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:22,280
16 times 7 is a
 

1027
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,070
16 times 7 is a
112 so

1028
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080

 

1029
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,350

for 112 area you would only have 32

1030
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
for 112 area you would only have 32
 

1031
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,870
for 112 area you would only have 32
spawning spaces so it's

1032
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
spawning spaces so it's
 

1033
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,750
spawning spaces so it's
kind of inefficient it's also very

1034
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
kind of inefficient it's also very
 

1035
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,950
kind of inefficient it's also very
resource

1036
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
resource
 

1037
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,190
resource
intensive because you need sticky

1038
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
intensive because you need sticky
 

1039
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,230
intensive because you need sticky
pistons

1040
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
pistons
 

1041
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,310
pistons
for each spawning space you need one

1042
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
for each spawning space you need one
 

1043
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,909
for each spawning space you need one
sticky piston

1044
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
sticky piston
 

1045
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,870
sticky piston
and either redstone dust or redstone

1046
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
and either redstone dust or redstone
 

1047
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,390
and either redstone dust or redstone
repeater

1048
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
repeater
 

1049
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,510
repeater
averages out to i think three redstone

1050
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
averages out to i think three redstone
 

1051
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,830
averages out to i think three redstone
per spawning area kind of expensive

1052
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840

 

1053
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,549

and from this is what i came up with my

1054
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
and from this is what i came up with my
 

1055
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,510
and from this is what i came up with my
design from

1056
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
design from
 

1057
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,029
design from
it's very similar to this i'll show you

1058
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
it's very similar to this i'll show you
 

1059
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,789
it's very similar to this i'll show you
that now it's the last last

1060
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
that now it's the last last
 

1061
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,870
that now it's the last last
last one i'm going to show you

1062
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880

 

1063
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,789

just about blew up my chest

1064
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799

 

1065
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,630

jump blow up bed gotcha

1066
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
jump blow up bed gotcha
 

1067
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,390
jump blow up bed gotcha
sorry i was eating eminem's when he came

1068
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
sorry i was eating eminem's when he came
 

1069
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,350
sorry i was eating eminem's when he came
out

1070
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360

 

1071
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,190

so all those designs i've shown you so

1072
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
so all those designs i've shown you so
 

1073
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,350
so all those designs i've shown you so
far are all the ones i've rejected

1074
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
far are all the ones i've rejected
 

1075
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,909
far are all the ones i've rejected
uh it's not because they're bad designs

1076
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
uh it's not because they're bad designs
 

1077
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,669
uh it's not because they're bad designs
they're all good they all have their

1078
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
they're all good they all have their
 

1079
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,510
they're all good they all have their
pros they also all have their cons

1080
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
pros they also all have their cons
 

1081
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,549
pros they also all have their cons
it's a thing and i was having a hard

1082
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
it's a thing and i was having a hard
 

1083
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,390
it's a thing and i was having a hard
time choosing between them but until i

1084
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
time choosing between them but until i
 

1085
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,909
time choosing between them but until i
came up with my own design

1086
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
came up with my own design
 

1087
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,390
came up with my own design
here that i think is going to be pretty

1088
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
here that i think is going to be pretty
 

1089
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,669
here that i think is going to be pretty
good

1090
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
good
 

1091
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,510
good
basically i'm going to set up rows

1092
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
basically i'm going to set up rows
 

1093
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,070
basically i'm going to set up rows
that will make it three three wide our

1094
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
that will make it three three wide our
 

1095
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,950
that will make it three three wide our
demonstration

1096
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
demonstration
 

1097
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,870
demonstration
gonna set up rows you'll have torches

1098
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
gonna set up rows you'll have torches
 

1099
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,789
gonna set up rows you'll have torches
like this

1100
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:52,799
like this
 

1101
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,909
like this
so it's uh four blocks wide and then uh

1102
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
so it's uh four blocks wide and then uh
 

1103
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,470
so it's uh four blocks wide and then uh
above that it's gonna be black

1104
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480

 

1105
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,909

like this and on top of that

1106
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
like this and on top of that
 

1107
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,230
like this and on top of that
redstone torches finally at the very top

1108
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
redstone torches finally at the very top
 

1109
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,710
redstone torches finally at the very top
we have

1110
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
we have
 

1111
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,310
we have
pistons

1112
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320

 

1113
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,750

might be hard to build

1114
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760

 

1115
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,390

gotta get into a pattern stop let me

1116
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
gotta get into a pattern stop let me
 

1117
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,870
gotta get into a pattern stop let me
place my piston

1118
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880

 

1119
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,950

first one's going to be hard to start

1120
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960

 

1121
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,230

pistons will go directly above the

1122
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
pistons will go directly above the
 

1123
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,190
pistons will go directly above the
redstone torches

1124
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
redstone torches
 

1125
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,750
redstone torches
and this is tailored especially for uh

1126
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
and this is tailored especially for uh
 

1127
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,830
and this is tailored especially for uh
enderman

1128
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840

 

1129
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,470

takes advantage of their height

1130
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480

 

1131
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,390

so go like that and then i'll have stone

1132
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
so go like that and then i'll have stone
 

1133
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,830
so go like that and then i'll have stone
pressure plates all along the yellow

1134
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
pressure plates all along the yellow
 

1135
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,190
pressure plates all along the yellow
thing here

1136
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
thing here
 

1137
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,630
thing here
don't have any on me at the moment so

1138
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
don't have any on me at the moment so
 

1139
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,669
don't have any on me at the moment so
we'll just use wooden ones

1140
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
we'll just use wooden ones
 

1141
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,830
we'll just use wooden ones
like so

1142
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840

 

1143
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,750

there and then when the endermen spawn

1144
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
there and then when the endermen spawn
 

1145
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,190
there and then when the endermen spawn
on the pressure plates

1146
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
on the pressure plates
 

1147
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,510
on the pressure plates
the piston will extend and push them off

1148
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
the piston will extend and push them off
 

1149
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,909
the piston will extend and push them off
down they'll fall

1150
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
down they'll fall
 

1151
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,310
down they'll fall
uh i think i gotta drop them 43 blocks

1152
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
uh i think i gotta drop them 43 blocks
 

1153
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,230
uh i think i gotta drop them 43 blocks
if i remember right

1154
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
if i remember right
 

1155
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,190
if i remember right
to get them down to one or two half a

1156
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
to get them down to one or two half a
 

1157
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,590
to get them down to one or two half a
heart

1158
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
heart
 

1159
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,590
heart
health

1160
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600

 

1161
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,590

and that's all there is to it so it's

1162
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
and that's all there is to it so it's
 

1163
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,950
and that's all there is to it so it's
like the last one except

1164
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
like the last one except
 

1165
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,669
like the last one except
it's uh squished in a little bit more

1166
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
it's uh squished in a little bit more
 

1167
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,750
it's uh squished in a little bit more
the other one was basically three blocks

1168
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
the other one was basically three blocks
 

1169
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,070
the other one was basically three blocks
wide

1170
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
wide
 

1171
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,430
wide
and this one's two so

1172
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
and this one's two so
 

1173
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,149
and this one's two so
it's quite a bit more compact it is

1174
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
it's quite a bit more compact it is
 

1175
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,230
it's quite a bit more compact it is
still very resource intensive though it

1176
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
still very resource intensive though it
 

1177
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,350
still very resource intensive though it
takes

1178
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
takes
 

1179

probably put down a little bit of a work

1208
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
probably put down a little bit of a work
 

1209
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,310
probably put down a little bit of a work
area

1210
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
area
 

1211
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,310

at the end of that obsidian bridge thing
 

1213
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,590
at the end of that obsidian bridge thing
and once i have a work area then we will

1214
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
and once i have a work area then we will
 

1215
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,350
and once i have a work area then we will
start

1216
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
start
 

1217
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,590
start
building it finally

this out further
 

1227
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,390
this out further
as i find time to we are going to be

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
as i find time to we are going to be
 

1229
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,950
as i find time to we are going to be

our mob trap directly above here this is
 

1233
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,190
our mob trap directly above here this is
the center i've marked out

1234
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
the center i've marked out
 

1235
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,190
the center i've marked out
which is at x 320

which is at x 320
 

1237
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,470
which is at x 320
and zero so good spot it'll be easy to

1238
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
and zero so good spot it'll be easy to
 

1239
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,269
and zero so good spot it'll be easy to
figure out numbers if i need to

1240
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
figure out numbers if i need to
 

1241
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,470
figure out numbers if i need to
and you can just barely see

1242
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
and you can just barely see
 

1243
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,789
and you can just barely see
ender island over there so we're well

1244
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
ender island over there so we're well
 

1245
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,110
ender island over there so we're well
over 144 blocks away which is all that

1246
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
over 144 blocks away which is all that
 

1247
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,789
over 144 blocks away which is all that
matters so that

1248
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
matters so that
 

1249
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,110
matters so that
endermen won't spawn on the island

1250
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
endermen won't spawn on the island
 

1251
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,149
endermen won't spawn on the island
instead of our

1252
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
instead of our
 

1253
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,909
instead of our
mob trap i think it's actually 250

1254
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
mob trap i think it's actually 250
 

1255
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,350
mob trap i think it's actually 250
blocks or so away from me

blocks or so away from me
 

1257
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,710
blocks or so away from me
so got a little bit of uh buffer zone in

1258
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
so got a little bit of uh buffer zone in
 

1259
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,990
so got a little bit of uh buffer zone in
case i decide to build something further

1260
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
case i decide to build something further
 

1261
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,630
case i decide to build something further
like closer to the island too like if i

1262
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
like closer to the island too like if i
 

1263
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,149
like closer to the island too like if i
set up other farms and stuff i don't

1264
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
set up other farms and stuff i don't
 

1265

to go down one block so i just poured
 

1271
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,149
to go down one block so i just poured
water down and was able to build under

00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
water down and was able to build under
 

1273
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,269
water down and was able to build under
my bridge here

1274

my bridge here
 

1275
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,190
my bridge here
and i'm just going to keep it at 49 for

1276
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
and i'm just going to keep it at 49 for
 

1277
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,669
and i'm just going to keep it at 49 for
now and then when i get the farm set up

1278
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679
now and then when i get the farm set up
 

1279
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,269
now and then when i get the farm set up
then i might

1280
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
then i might
 

1281
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,430
then i might
make my floor two blocks thick and i'll

1282
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
make my floor two blocks thick and i'll
 

1283
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,710
make my floor two blocks thick and i'll
put stone bricks or something down here

1284
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
put stone bricks or something down here
 

1285
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,549
put stone bricks or something down here
to make it too thick just as an extra

1286

them
 

1297
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,190
them
upon hitting the floor because uh

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
upon hitting the floor because uh
 

1299
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,430
upon hitting the floor because uh
at level 50 they will stay alive but at

1300
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
at level 50 they will stay alive but at
 

1301
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,029
at level 50 they will stay alive but at
49 i think they'll die

1302
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
49 i think they'll die
 

1303
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,990
49 i think they'll die
so from level 50 we need to go up

1304
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,000
so from level 50 we need to go up
 

1305
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,070
so from level 50 we need to go up
um what was it 40 43 blocks

1306
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
um what was it 40 43 blocks
 

1307
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,070
um what was it 40 43 blocks
so all the way up to 93.

1308
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
so all the way up to 93.
 

1309

so all the way up to 93.
i'm gonna pillar up and then i'm going

1310
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
i'm gonna pillar up and then i'm going
 

1311
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,510
i'm gonna pillar up and then i'm going
to place my ladders

1312
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520

 

1313
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,350

i'll see you at the top

1314
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360

 

1315
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,789

okay we're at the height i want to be

1316
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
okay we're at the height i want to be
 

1317
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,990
okay we're at the height i want to be
here we're at y93

1318
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
here we're at y93
 

1319
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,110
here we're at y93
and now i think i'm gonna leave an eight

1320
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120
and now i think i'm gonna leave an eight
 

1321
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,830
and now i think i'm gonna leave an eight
by eight

1322
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
by eight
 

1323
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,190
by eight

elevator

1328
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
elevator
 

1329
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,149
elevator
maintenance elevator to get up here

1330
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159

 

1331
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,430

at the moment i'll probably just use

1332
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
at the moment i'll probably just use
 

1333
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,029
at the moment i'll probably just use
ladders while i'm building this

1334
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:57,039
ladders while i'm building this
 

1335
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,110
ladders while i'm building this
or until i decide what i want to do for

1336
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,120
or until i decide what i want to do for
 

1337
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,710
or until i decide what i want to do for
an elevator

1338
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
an elevator
 

1339
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,549
an elevator
so we're gonna make an eight by eight

1340
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
so we're gonna make an eight by eight
 

1341
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,630
so we're gonna make an eight by eight
square centered

1342
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:04,640
square centered
 

1343
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,029
square centered
over here so we need to go out four

1344
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
over here so we need to go out four
 

1345
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,710
over here so we need to go out four
marks

1346
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
marks
 

1347
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,830
marks
yeah four blocks and i'll highlight that

1348
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840
yeah four blocks and i'll highlight that
 

1349
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,789
yeah four blocks and i'll highlight that
out

1350
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799

 

1351
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,549

all right so this is the center the

1352
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
all right so this is the center the
 

1353
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,389
all right so this is the center the
eight by eight that i i'm going to leave

1354
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:18,399
eight by eight that i i'm going to leave
 

1355
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,750
eight by eight that i i'm going to leave
blank until i figure out what i want to

1356
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
blank until i figure out what i want to
 

1357
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,389
blank until i figure out what i want to
do with it

1358
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
do with it
 

1359
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,710
do with it
will probably be some kind of elevator

1360
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:22,720
will probably be some kind of elevator
 

1361
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,389
will probably be some kind of elevator
not sure exactly what kind

1362
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399
not sure exactly what kind
 

1363
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,669
not sure exactly what kind
one two three four five six seven eight

1364
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679

one two three four five six seven eight
 

1367
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,669
one two three four five six seven eight
okay and this is the very center right

1368
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
okay and this is the very center right
 

1369
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,430
okay and this is the very center right
here

1370
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
here
 

1371
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,029
here
this will give us something nice to

1372
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
this will give us something nice to
 

1373
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,029
this will give us something nice to
build off of two so i'm gonna go ahead

1374
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039
build off of two so i'm gonna go ahead
 

1375
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:39,750
build off of two so i'm gonna go ahead
now and

1376
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
now and
 

1377
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,669
now and
actually starts the farm this is the

1378
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
actually starts the farm this is the
 

1379
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,430
actually starts the farm this is the
first block

1380
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
first block
 

1381
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,990
first block
being placed for it and i think it's

1382
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
being placed for it and i think it's
 

1383
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,549
being placed for it and i think it's
going to look

1384
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
going to look
 

1385
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,630
going to look
really cool when it's done that's

1386
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
really cool when it's done that's
 

1387
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,110
really cool when it's done that's
another reason i really like this design

1388
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120

 

1389
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,190

and you will see so we're just we'll

1390
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
and you will see so we're just we'll
 

1391
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,110
and you will see so we're just we'll
probably just do one ring on it

1392
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
probably just do one ring on it
 

1393
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,430
probably just do one ring on it
today and i'll extend it out further

1394
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
today and i'll extend it out further
 

1395
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,710
today and i'll extend it out further
later

1396
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
later
 

1397
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,190
later
as i get the blocks and stuff blocks in

1398
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
as i get the blocks and stuff blocks in
 

1399
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,430
as i get the blocks and stuff blocks in
time

1400
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
time
 

1401
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,310
time
go all the way around i will have to

1402
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
go all the way around i will have to
 

1403
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,269
go all the way around i will have to
remove this cobble

1404
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279

 

1405
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,710

for the enderman to fall down

1406
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720

 

1407
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,310

should be void now that i think of it

1408
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320

 

1409
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,350

okay

1410
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360

 

1411
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,389

and now we're get

1412
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
and now we're get
 

1413
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,750
and now we're get
we're gonna space it two blocks here

1414
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760

 

1415
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,630

that and we will start our next strip

1416
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,640
that and we will start our next strip
 

1417
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,070
that and we will start our next strip
like this

1418
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,080

 

1419
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,230

and then in between we'll have the black

1420
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
and then in between we'll have the black
 

1421
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,110
and then in between we'll have the black
hole

1422
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
hole
 

1423
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,630
hole
at these corners i thought it would look

1424
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
at these corners i thought it would look
 

1425
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,110
at these corners i thought it would look
really cool to have watermelons

1426
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120

 

1427
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,830

and do something like this just have a

1428
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:53,840
and do something like this just have a
 

1429
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,710
and do something like this just have a
four by four

1430
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
four by four
 

1431
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,430
four by four
square to bounce out the look

1432
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
square to bounce out the look
 

1433
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,870
square to bounce out the look
but i'll have to be careful because

1434
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,880
but i'll have to be careful because
 

1435
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,350
but i'll have to be careful because
endermen can steal watermelon i'm hoping

1436
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
endermen can steal watermelon i'm hoping
 

1437
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,710
endermen can steal watermelon i'm hoping
i can

1438
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
i can
 

1439
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,549
i can
maybe put half slabs above this or

1440
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
maybe put half slabs above this or
 

1441
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,029
maybe put half slabs above this or
something to keep them from doing that

1442
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
something to keep them from doing that
 

1443
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,310
something to keep them from doing that
i'm not sure how it's going to work out

1444
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320
i'm not sure how it's going to work out
 

1445
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,870
i'm not sure how it's going to work out
i haven't tested this really

1446
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880

 

1447
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,909

um okay

1448
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:19,919

 

1449
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,830

so maybe i'll talk about some other

1450
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
so maybe i'll talk about some other
 

1451
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,389
so maybe i'll talk about some other
stuff

1452
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:23,399
stuff
 

1453
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,630
stuff

of fun playing with the goude and bw

1460
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
of fun playing with the goude and bw
 

1461
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,669
of fun playing with the goude and bw
and spellbound caves we're still not

1462
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
and spellbound caves we're still not
 

1463
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,350
and spellbound caves we're still not
done the map we're close

1464
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
done the map we're close
 

1465
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,350
done the map we're close
i think we're probably two thirds to

1466
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
i think we're probably two thirds to
 

1467
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,710
i think we're probably two thirds to
three quarters

1468
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:40,720
three quarters
 

1469
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,110
three quarters
done at the time i'm recording this

1470
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,120
done at the time i'm recording this
 

1471
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,590
done at the time i'm recording this
uh having a lot of fun with them

1472
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
uh having a lot of fun with them
 

1473
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,990
uh having a lot of fun with them
it's a really tough play in multiplayer

1474
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,000
it's a really tough play in multiplayer
 

1475
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,710
it's a really tough play in multiplayer
though

1476
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:54,720
though
 

1477
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,509
though
because the lag issues mobs don't really

1478
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:57,519
because the lag issues mobs don't really
 

1479
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,669
because the lag issues mobs don't really
behave properly

1480
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
behave properly
 

1481
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,509
behave properly
i'm thinking what i'll do since some

1482
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
i'm thinking what i'll do since some
 

1483
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,830
i'm thinking what i'll do since some
people seem to want me to do it single

1484

people seem to want me to do it single
 

1485
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,430
people seem to want me to do it single
player as well

is uh i might do a skill run of the map
 

1489
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,789
is uh i might do a skill run of the map
afterwards

1490
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799
afterwards
 

1491
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,269
afterwards
after we finish and try to see how quick

1492
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
after we finish and try to see how quick
 

1493
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,389
after we finish and try to see how quick
i can beat it

1504
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
you're almost like superman in that map
 

1505
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,029
you're almost like superman in that map
at times until you die and lose

1506
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
at times until you die and lose
 

1507
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,149
at times until you die and lose
everything

1508
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
everything
 

1509
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,830
everything
then you're just back to normal

1510
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840

 

1511
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,310

so the way that's going to work as well

1512
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,320
so the way that's going to work as well
 

1513
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,149
so the way that's going to work as well
i'm still going to be doing legendary

1514
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
i'm still going to be doing legendary
 

1515
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:34,870
i'm still going to be doing legendary
episodes

1516
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880
episodes
 

1517
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,149
episodes
uh i have about eight hours seven or

1518
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159

uh i have about eight hours seven or
eight hours of footage from ooge

1520
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
eight hours of footage from ooge
 

1521
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,110
eight hours of footage from ooge
already it's really easy to make

1522
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
already it's really easy to make
 

1523
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,110
already it's really easy to make
episodes for it so i just have to

1524
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
episodes for it so i just have to
 

1525
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,230
episodes for it so i just have to
basically load in my in my editor and

1526
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
basically load in my in my editor and
 

1527
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,549
basically load in my in my editor and
hit

1528
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
hit
 

1529
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,750
hit
convert and it's pretty close to done

1530
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
convert and it's pretty close to done
 

1531
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,029
convert and it's pretty close to done
so it's not

1532
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
so it's not
 

1533
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,269
so it's not
bad okay i gotta get down

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,389
everybody if i do it that way
i won't be doing oh dang we need

1582
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
i won't be doing oh dang we need
 

1583
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,549

enderman up there

1584
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:06,559
enderman up there
 

1585
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,310
enderman up there
i won't be doing a kill counter because

1586

i won't be doing a kill counter because
 

1587
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,470
i won't be doing a kill counter because
i edit with virtual dub and it's

1588
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
i edit with virtual dub and it's
 

1589
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,509
i edit with virtual dub and it's
extremely difficult if not impossible to

1590
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
extremely difficult if not impossible to
 

1591
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,549
extremely difficult if not impossible to
do it with that

1592
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
do it with that
 

1593
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,669
do it with that
so until i get better editing i'm very

1594
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:17,679
so until i get better editing i'm very
 

1595
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,549
so until i get better editing i'm very
limited to what i can actually do

1596
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
limited to what i can actually do
 

1597
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,230
limited to what i can actually do
i should have put torches up here

1598
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
i should have put torches up here
 

1599
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,389
i should have put torches up here
so here's evidence of the spawning rates

1600
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
so here's evidence of the spawning rates
 

1601
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,509
so here's evidence of the spawning rates
it's just crazy

1602
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
it's just crazy
 

1603
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,029
it's just crazy
even though it was pretty bright up here

1604
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,039
even though it was pretty bright up here
 

1605
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,789
even though it was pretty bright up here
from these torches

1606
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799

 

1607
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,190

these guys still managed to spawn really

1608
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
these guys still managed to spawn really
 

1609
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,750
these guys still managed to spawn really
quickly

1610
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760

 

1611
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,950

1616
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:43,519
i guess i didn't have any black wool

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,870

actually you know what i'll do i'm gonna

1674
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
actually you know what i'll do i'm gonna
 

1675
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,349
actually you know what i'll do i'm gonna
put

1676
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
put
 

1677
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,270
put
uh torches on just for looks mostly

1678
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,280
uh torches on just for looks mostly
 

1679
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,630
uh torches on just for looks mostly
do a clockwise spiral

1680
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640

 

1681
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,589

like that and i may try hook up some

1682
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
like that and i may try hook up some
 

1683
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,910
like that and i may try hook up some
pressure plates to these two

1684
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,920
pressure plates to these two
 

1685
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,829
pressure plates to these two
but i don't know how effective i can do

1686
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:25,839
but i don't know how effective i can do
 

1687
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,829
but i don't know how effective i can do
it i might be able to utilize two spots

1688
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:28,839
it i might be able to utilize two spots
 

1689
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,950
it i might be able to utilize two spots
here

1690
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
here
 

1691
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,069
here
two or three i don't know

1692
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079

 

1693
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,550

um yeah i'll wait putting those on

1694
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,560
um yeah i'll wait putting those on
 

1695
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,950
um yeah i'll wait putting those on
okay so i'm gonna go all along do that

1696
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
okay so i'm gonna go all along do that
 

1697
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,390
okay so i'm gonna go all along do that
for all these

1698
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
for all these
 

1699
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,589
for all these
and then i'll be back

1700
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
and then i'll be back
 

1701
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,069
and then i'll be back
i got that done and i uh i pushed the

1702
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
i got that done and i uh i pushed the
 

1703
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,990
i got that done and i uh i pushed the
enderman off there was one left up here

1704
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
enderman off there was one left up here
 

1705
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,190
enderman off there was one left up here
and it was weird he just

1706
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,200
and it was weird he just
 

1707
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,550
and it was weird he just
all of a sudden teleported and i see him

1708
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
all of a sudden teleported and i see him
 

1709
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,470
all of a sudden teleported and i see him
or i did see him down there holding a

1710
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,480
or i did see him down there holding a
 

1711
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,270
or i did see him down there holding a
soil block

1712
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
soil block
 

1713
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,109
soil block
i think you despond now i don't know

1714
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:01,119
i think you despond now i don't know
 

1715
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,630
i think you despond now i don't know
where he got the soil block from i don't

1716
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
where he got the soil block from i don't
 

1717
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,190
where he got the soil block from i don't
think any were missing up here

1718
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
think any were missing up here
 

1719
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,550
think any were missing up here
a little strange i don't think they'll

1720
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,560
a little strange i don't think they'll
 

1721
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,750
a little strange i don't think they'll
pick up these watermelons unless they

1722
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
pick up these watermelons unless they
 

1723
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,550
pick up these watermelons unless they
get pushed off and they're next to them

1724
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
get pushed off and they're next to them
 

1725
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,829
get pushed off and they're next to them
like as they're falling down i think

1726
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
like as they're falling down i think
 

1727
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,270
like as they're falling down i think
they can only grab them if they're

1728
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,280

 

1729
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,790

like they can't pick them up if they're

1730
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
like they can't pick them up if they're
 

1731
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,310
like they can't pick them up if they're
below them only if they're

1732
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,320
below them only if they're
 

1733
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,790
below them only if they're
beside them i think is the way it works

1734
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800

 

1735
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,470

but the next thing i'm going to do is

1736
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
but the next thing i'm going to do is
 

1737
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,910
but the next thing i'm going to do is
i'm going to go all along with the

1738
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
i'm going to go all along with the
 

1739
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,870
i'm going to go all along with the
pistons

1740
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:30,880

 

1741
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,109

like i showed you before do that

1742
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:37,119

 

1743
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,390

they are a little bit challenging to

1744
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
they are a little bit challenging to
 

1745
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,950
they are a little bit challenging to
place but not bad

1746
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960

 

1747
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,750

i make it look harder than it really is

1748
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,760

 

1749
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,950

okay and then the other side

1750
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
okay and then the other side
 

1751
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,910
okay and then the other side
and so one block over here they'll be

1752
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:53,920
and so one block over here they'll be
 

1753
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,870
and so one block over here they'll be
able to fall down

1754
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:54,880
able to fall down
 

1755
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,030
able to fall down
and where this cobble is will be air as

1756
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,040
and where this cobble is will be air as
 

1757
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,470
and where this cobble is will be air as
well and they'll be able to fall down

1758
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
well and they'll be able to fall down
 

1759
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,510
well and they'll be able to fall down
here

1760
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
here
 

1761
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,589
here
when they get pushed

1762
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:03,599

 

1763
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,829

so the only thing i'm missing now is the

1764
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:05,839
so the only thing i'm missing now is the
 

1765
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,150
so the only thing i'm missing now is the
pressure plates

1766
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,160

 

1767
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,109

so those will go all along nice thing is

1768
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
so those will go all along nice thing is
 

1769
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:13,990
so those will go all along nice thing is
since

1770
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
since
 

1771
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,430
since
the pistons are up higher i can walk on

1772
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
the pistons are up higher i can walk on
 

1773
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,990
the pistons are up higher i can walk on
this

1774
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
this
 

1775
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,349
this
on these pressure plates without them

1776
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:19,359
on these pressure plates without them
 

1777
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,550
on these pressure plates without them
pushing me off

1778
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560

 

1779
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,150

so this is getting pretty close to

1780
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,160
so this is getting pretty close to
 

1781
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,190
so this is getting pretty close to
operational

1782
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200

 

1783
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,069

it's one side i don't have enough stone

1784
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:34,079
it's one side i don't have enough stone
 

1785
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,109
it's one side i don't have enough stone
here to do

1786
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
here to do
 

1787
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,190
here to do
the whole thing i'll have to make

1788
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,200
the whole thing i'll have to make
 

1789
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,349
the whole thing i'll have to make
another trip

1790
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359
another trip
 

1791
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,550
another trip
but i'll finish up these other sides

1792
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:42,560
but i'll finish up these other sides
 

1793
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,150
but i'll finish up these other sides
with the pistons and

1794
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
with the pistons and
 

1795
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,550
with the pistons and
use up all my pressure plates here then

1796
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
use up all my pressure plates here then
 

1797
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,790
use up all my pressure plates here then
for these corners i think what i'm just

1798
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
for these corners i think what i'm just
 

1799
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,710
for these corners i think what i'm just
going to do for now i'll probably change

1800
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
going to do for now i'll probably change
 

1801
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,069
going to do for now i'll probably change
this later is i'll just

1802
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
this later is i'll just
 

1803
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,990
this later is i'll just
uh cover it like this so the endermen

1804
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,000
uh cover it like this so the endermen
 

1805
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,710
uh cover it like this so the endermen
can't walk

1806
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:58,720
can't walk
 

1807
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,550
can't walk
over here or spawn on them just for now

1808
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:02,560
over here or spawn on them just for now
 

1809
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,470
over here or spawn on them just for now
until i figure out what to do

1810
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480

 

1811
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,710

okay and the really cool thing about

1812
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:10,720
okay and the really cool thing about
 

1813
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,910
okay and the really cool thing about
this design as well

1814
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:13,920

 

1815
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,069

mobs can't spawn on pistons so i don't

1816
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
mobs can't spawn on pistons so i don't
 

1817
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,750
mobs can't spawn on pistons so i don't
have to worry about them spawning on top

1818
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
have to worry about them spawning on top
 

1819
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,190
have to worry about them spawning on top
here

1820
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
here
 

1821
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,870
here
and the only place they'll be able to

1822
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
and the only place they'll be able to
 

1823
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,790
and the only place they'll be able to
spawn is the pressure plates so that's

1824
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
spawn is the pressure plates so that's
 

1825
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,750
spawn is the pressure plates so that's
what we want

1826
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
what we want
 

1827
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,310
what we want
works out perfect can't spawn on half

1828
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
works out perfect can't spawn on half
 

1829
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,109
works out perfect can't spawn on half
slabs so this is fine too

1830
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:29,119
slabs so this is fine too
 

1831
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,630
slabs so this is fine too
they won't be able to spawn here because

1832
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
they won't be able to spawn here because
 

1833
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,990
they won't be able to spawn here because
they don't have a three block high

1834
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,000
they don't have a three block high
 

1835
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,349
they don't have a three block high
clearance so

1836
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
clearance so
 

1837
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,750
clearance so
this should work out so i'll give you

1838
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
this should work out so i'll give you
 

1839
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,190
this should work out so i'll give you
an update as i get a little bit more

1840
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,200
an update as i get a little bit more
 

1841
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,710
an update as i get a little bit more
done here

1842
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720

 

1843
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,470

well she's all done here we got the

1844
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
well she's all done here we got the
 

1845
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,150
well she's all done here we got the
first string complete

1846
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
first string complete
 

1847
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,430
first string complete
uh there's no more torches up here

1848
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
uh there's no more torches up here
 

1849
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,030
uh there's no more torches up here
it's all good we got the pressure plates

1850
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
it's all good we got the pressure plates
 

1851
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,910
it's all good we got the pressure plates
everywhere pistons everywhere

1852
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:53,920
everywhere pistons everywhere
 

1853
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,910
everywhere pistons everywhere
so we are ready to try it out and see

1854
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
so we are ready to try it out and see
 

1855
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,950
so we are ready to try it out and see
how it uh

1856
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:56,960
how it uh
 

1857
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,550
how it uh
performs it's exciting

1858
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:00,560
performs it's exciting
 

1859
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,510
performs it's exciting
very curious to see what happens uh this

1860
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
very curious to see what happens uh this
 

1861
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,430
very curious to see what happens uh this
uh

1862
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,440
uh
 

1863
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,670
uh
is by no means complete though this is

1864
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,680
is by no means complete though this is
 

1865
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,349
is by no means complete though this is
only the first string it's the smallest

1866
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
only the first string it's the smallest
 

1867
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,230
only the first string it's the smallest
ring

1868
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,240
ring
 

1869
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,670
ring
or square or whatever you want to call

1870
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:11,680
or square or whatever you want to call
 

1871
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,230
or square or whatever you want to call
it uh there's only actually uh

1872
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
it uh there's only actually uh
 

1873
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,710
it uh there's only actually uh
65 64. yeah 64 spawning spaces so that's

1874
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720
65 64. yeah 64 spawning spaces so that's
 

1875
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,829
65 64. yeah 64 spawning spaces so that's
pretty darn

1876
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
pretty darn
 

1877
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,349
pretty darn
small still at the bare minimum i'll be

1878
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
small still at the bare minimum i'll be
 

1879
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,790
small still at the bare minimum i'll be
doing three

1880
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
doing three
 

1881
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,870
doing three
rings or three squares

1882
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:28,880

 

1883
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,030

and what i found from looking below this

1884
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,040
and what i found from looking below this
 

1885
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,630
and what i found from looking below this
having a pillar all the way up in the

1886
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:34,640
having a pillar all the way up in the
 

1887
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,550
having a pillar all the way up in the
center looks pretty bad so

1888
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,560
center looks pretty bad so
 

1889
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,910
center looks pretty bad so
i'll probably do a water elevator or a

1890
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
i'll probably do a water elevator or a
 

1891
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,589
i'll probably do a water elevator or a
boat elevator

1892
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,599
boat elevator
 

1893
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,430
boat elevator
but for now i'm just going to get rid of

1894
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:43,440
but for now i'm just going to get rid of
 

1895
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,109
but for now i'm just going to get rid of
it completely

1896
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:45,119
it completely
 

1897
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,349
it completely
until i come back to add another ring

1898
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:49,359
until i come back to add another ring
 

1899
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,030
until i come back to add another ring
oh i missed the torch somewhere we got

1900
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,040
oh i missed the torch somewhere we got
 

1901
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,349
oh i missed the torch somewhere we got
enderman down there

1902
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:55,359

 

1903
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,270

so yeah here we go

1904
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280

 

1905
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,510

so they should oh we already got a pearl

1906
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,520
so they should oh we already got a pearl
 

1907
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,990
so they should oh we already got a pearl
i didn't see it fall though

1908
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,000

 

1909
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,430

that scared me ah

1910
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440

 

1911
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,349

stop jump they keep dropping right in

1912
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:15,359
stop jump they keep dropping right in
 

1913
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,109
stop jump they keep dropping right in
front of me it's freaking me out

1914
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119

 

1915
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,829

um did you fall

1916
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:22,839
um did you fall
 

1917
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,430
um did you fall
nope

1918
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
nope
 

1919
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,910
nope
one of these guys has full health it's

1920
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:27,920
one of these guys has full health it's
 

1921
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,950
one of these guys has full health it's
that one

1922
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
that one
 

1923
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,790
that one
let's kill this guy turn our volume down

1924
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
let's kill this guy turn our volume down
 

1925
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,829
let's kill this guy turn our volume down
too

1926
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:36,839

 

1927
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,710

so

1928
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
so
 

1929
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,790
so
the ones that land on the on the chest

1930
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
the ones that land on the on the chest
 

1931
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,550
the ones that land on the on the chest
here or whatever they uh

1932
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,560
here or whatever they uh
 

1933
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,829
here or whatever they uh
you can see they're surviving

1934
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
you can see they're surviving
 

1935
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,069
you can see they're surviving
um but they're one hit kill then so when

1936
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,079
um but they're one hit kill then so when
 

1937
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,270
um but they're one hit kill then so when
i raise this floor up

1938
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,280
i raise this floor up
 

1939
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,630
i raise this floor up
they'll all be a one-hit kill

1940
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
they'll all be a one-hit kill
 

1941
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,309
they'll all be a one-hit kill
or if i leave it down like this i can

1942
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:54,319
or if i leave it down like this i can
 

1943
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,790
or if i leave it down like this i can
just

1944
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:56,800

 

1945
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,109

have it auto harvest the ender pearls

1946
00:40:59,109 --> 00:40:59,119
have it auto harvest the ender pearls
 

1947
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,150
have it auto harvest the ender pearls
and i'll just have to run around

1948
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
and i'll just have to run around
 

1949
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,510
and i'll just have to run around
collecting them

1950
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:01,520
collecting them
 

1951
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,069
collecting them
but are you ready to see it it looks

1952
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
but are you ready to see it it looks
 

1953
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,670
but are you ready to see it it looks
really cool from below i like it

1954
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
really cool from below i like it
 

1955
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,030
really cool from below i like it
there it is and as uh

1956
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
there it is and as uh
 

1957
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,630
there it is and as uh
as the endermen step on the pressure

1958
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
as the endermen step on the pressure
 

1959
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,309
as the endermen step on the pressure
plates the lights

1960
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
plates the lights
 

1961
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,870
plates the lights
flicker which is really cool too

1962
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:18,880

 

1963
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,190

so as i add more rings

1964
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200
so as i add more rings
 

1965
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,470
so as i add more rings
um each ring will add 64

1966
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:26,480
um each ring will add 64
 

1967
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,670
um each ring will add 64
spawning spaces plus whatever the

1968
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,680
spawning spaces plus whatever the
 

1969
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,870
spawning spaces plus whatever the
previous ring had so this one was 64.

1970
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:32,880
previous ring had so this one was 64.
 

1971
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,390
previous ring had so this one was 64.
next one will be 128 and let me get my

1972
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,400
next one will be 128 and let me get my
 

1973
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,190
next one will be 128 and let me get my
calculator i think 192 comes next

1974
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,200

 

1975
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,270

at 192 and then you would have

1976
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
at 192 and then you would have
 

1977
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,870
at 192 and then you would have
well anyway yeah so it by the time i get

1978
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
well anyway yeah so it by the time i get
 

1979
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,550
well anyway yeah so it by the time i get
to three rings it'll be quite a bit of

1980
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560
to three rings it'll be quite a bit of
 

1981
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,510
to three rings it'll be quite a bit of
spawning space

1982
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
spawning space
 

1983
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,870
spawning space
um

1984
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880

 

1985
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,309

actually i'm gonna add it up just to

1986
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
actually i'm gonna add it up just to
 

1987
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,109
actually i'm gonna add it up just to
figure it out

1988
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:01,119

 

1989
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,910

all right so i added it up uh so the

1990
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
all right so i added it up uh so the
 

1991
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,550
all right so i added it up uh so the
first string

1992
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
first string
 

1993
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,990
first string
64 if we have two rings we'll have 192

1994
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,000
64 if we have two rings we'll have 192
 

1995
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,710
64 if we have two rings we'll have 192
spawning spaces three rings is 384

1996
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:12,720
spawning spaces three rings is 384
 

1997
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,150
spawning spaces three rings is 384
four rings is 640.

1998
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
four rings is 640.
 

1999
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,190
four rings is 640.
five rings is 960. so i think our

2000
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
five rings is 960. so i think our
 

2001
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,950
five rings is 960. so i think our
ultimate goal

2002
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:20,960
ultimate goal
 

2003
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,630
ultimate goal

54 up there or so

2510
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960

 

2511
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:39,510

it's pretty good still

2512
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,520

 

2513
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,349

2514
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,359
yeah not bad i bet you there is quite a
 

2515
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,750

few getting stuck up there though

2516
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
few getting stuck up there though

because of the idle timer so if a mob is

2518
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
because of the idle timer so if a mob is
 

2519
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,630
because of the idle timer so if a mob is
32 blocks away

2520
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,640
32 blocks away
 

2521
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,750
32 blocks away
i think it's 32 blocks then after a few

2522
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:51,760
i think it's 32 blocks then after a few
 

2523
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,589
i think it's 32 blocks then after a few
seconds they will just go idle and stop

2524
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:53,599
seconds they will just go idle and stop
 

2525
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,910
seconds they will just go idle and stop
moving

2526
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
moving
 

2527
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,230
moving

2528
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:00,240

 

2529
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,750

2531
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,270
the rates definitely aren't like they
used to be

2532
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
