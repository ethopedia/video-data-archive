the end from that kind of cool
so if you have a pre-existing world you

550
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
so if you have a pre-existing world you

so if you have a pre-existing world you
might get a

552
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079

you plant to get a new one you just put

700
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
you plant to get a new one you just put
 

701
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,790
you plant to get a new one you just put
it on the ground like that

702
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
it on the ground like that
 

703
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,189
it on the ground like that
and over time it'll start growing these

704
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
and over time it'll start growing these
 

705
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,350
and over time it'll start growing these
work off of block updates similar to how

706
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
work off of block updates similar to how
 

707
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,509
work off of block updates similar to how
reeds grow and and that kind of stuff

708
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
reeds grow and and that kind of stuff
 

709
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,550
reeds grow and and that kind of stuff
oh it grew already wow that was really

710
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
oh it grew already wow that was really
 

711
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,590
oh it grew already wow that was really
fast

712
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
fast
 

713
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,189
fast
and then when it's done growing this

714
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
and then when it's done growing this
 

715
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,629
and then when it's done growing this
flower turns dark

716
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
flower turns dark
 

717
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,829
flower turns dark
so right now it's kind of white um

718
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
so right now it's kind of white um
 

719
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,150
so right now it's kind of white um
eventually

720
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
eventually
 

721
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,509
eventually
it stops uh stops growing

722
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
it stops uh stops growing
 

723
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,629
it stops uh stops growing
can't put torches on it okay

724
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
can't put torches on it okay
 

725

727
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,069
i'm going to take this back with me i
want to see if it grows in the overworld

728
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
want to see if it grows in the overworld
 

729
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,150

we're going to engage lawnmower mode
 

733
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,670
we're going to engage lawnmower mode
here

734
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680

 

735
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,269

chop them all down they break so easily

736
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
chop them all down they break so easily
 

737
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,910
chop them all down they break so easily
it's so much fun

738
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
it's so much fun
 

739
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,750
it's so much fun
it would be really cool if you could

740
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
it would be really cool if you could
 

741
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,150
it would be really cool if you could
grab these like with silk touch

742
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
grab these like with silk touch
 

743
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,990
grab these like with silk touch
like this actual block and then place

744
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
like this actual block and then place
 

745
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,590
like this actual block and then place
them together

746
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
them together
 

747
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,590
them together
and then when you finally do break them

748
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
and then when you finally do break them
 

749
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,509
and then when you finally do break them
it breaks a whole strand of

750
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
it breaks a whole strand of
 

751
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,389
it breaks a whole strand of
of whatever you place you know what i

752
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
of whatever you place you know what i
 

753
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,990
of whatever you place you know what i
mean like you could

754
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
mean like you could
 

755
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,749
mean like you could
arrange them however you want and then

756
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
arrange them however you want and then
 

757
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,110
arrange them however you want and then
when you finally break it

758
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
when you finally break it
 

759
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,430
when you finally break it
the whole structure breaks in this

760
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
the whole structure breaks in this
 

761
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,310
the whole structure breaks in this
domino like fashion

762
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
domino like fashion
 

763
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,430
domino like fashion
because it's a really neat effect but

764
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
because it's a really neat effect but
 

765
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,350
because it's a really neat effect but
like if you could put water on top of it

766
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
like if you could put water on top of it
 

767
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,629
like if you could put water on top of it
and then break it all and the water

768
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
and then break it all and the water
 

769
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,990
and then break it all and the water
would all pour down at once

770
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
would all pour down at once
 

771
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,150
would all pour down at once
that would be kind of cool

772
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160

 

773
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,710

so with these plants you can do a few

774
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
so with these plants you can do a few
 

775
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,150
so with these plants you can do a few
things they're pretty important

776
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
things they're pretty important
 

777
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,350
things they're pretty important
you can not do that oh you know what i

778
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
you can not do that oh you know what i
 

779
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,590
you can not do that oh you know what i
think you gotta smelt them first

780
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
think you gotta smelt them first
 

781
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,230
think you gotta smelt them first
i think that's what the trick is uh

782
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
i think that's what the trick is uh
 

783
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,629
i think that's what the trick is uh
endstone also has a new block

784
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
endstone also has a new block
 

785
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,749
endstone also has a new block
that you can craft the end stone bricks

786
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
that you can craft the end stone bricks
 

787
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,230
that you can craft the end stone bricks
so you do a two by two looks like you

788
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
so you do a two by two looks like you
 

789
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,870
so you do a two by two looks like you
get four for that

790
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
get four for that
 

791
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,910
get four for that
and yeah they look pretty cool

792
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
and yeah they look pretty cool
 

793
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,829
and yeah they look pretty cool
i do like that that's a nice a pretty

794
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
i do like that that's a nice a pretty
 

795
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,590
i do like that that's a nice a pretty
nice texture to it oh they break fast

796
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
nice texture to it oh they break fast
 

797
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,870
nice texture to it oh they break fast
oh look at this

798
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
oh look at this
 

799
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,910
oh look at this
compared to that and break way faster

800
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
compared to that and break way faster
 

801
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,790
compared to that and break way faster
it's like normal stone i think

802
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800

 

803
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,110

you can almost instant mine it not quite

804
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120

 

805
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,470

oh maybe you can maybe you can huh

806
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
oh maybe you can maybe you can huh
 

807
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,269
oh maybe you can maybe you can huh
i'm not sure it seems like it stopped

808
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
i'm not sure it seems like it stopped
 

809
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:55,990
i'm not sure it seems like it stopped
there

810
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
there
 

811
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,150
there
one of the times but uh the other time

812
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
one of the times but uh the other time
 

813
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,790
one of the times but uh the other time
there it broke them all

814
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
there it broke them all
 

815
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,079
there it broke them all
all right so there's also

816
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,089
all right so there's also
 

817
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,750
all right so there's also
[Music]

818
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760

apparently fortresses that spawn in the
end now i'm looking around for one of

822
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
end now i'm looking around for one of
 

823
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,470
end now i'm looking around for one of
them right now

824
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
them right now
 

825
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,150
them right now
might have to hop to one of these other

826
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
might have to hop to one of these other
 

827
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,710
might have to hop to one of these other
islands

828
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720

 

829
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,110

i believe it's infinite now in the end

830
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
i believe it's infinite now in the end
 

831
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,990
i believe it's infinite now in the end
if we do an ender pearl throw what are

832
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
if we do an ender pearl throw what are
 

833
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,909
if we do an ender pearl throw what are
the chances it's gonna work

834
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
the chances it's gonna work
 

835
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,949
the chances it's gonna work
oh it was short let's get a little

836
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
oh it was short let's get a little
 

837
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,029
oh it was short let's get a little
closer

838
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
closer
 

839
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,230
closer
almost hit the island with that

840
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
almost hit the island with that
 

841
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,750
almost hit the island with that
there we go perfect oh

842
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
there we go perfect oh
 

843
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,190
there we go perfect oh
just about fell down there

844

nice reward i think that means beacons
 

1321
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,750
nice reward i think that means beacons
are infinite right like

1322
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
are infinite right like
 

1323
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,190
are infinite right like
i don't think there's a limit to these

1324
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
i don't think there's a limit to these
 

1325
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,909
i don't think there's a limit to these
fortresses you can just explore the end

1326
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
fortresses you can just explore the end
 

1327
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,430

wanted to try grow them
and just see if we can grow them in the

1364
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
and just see if we can grow them in the
 

1365
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,110
and just see if we can grow them in the
over world i don't think you would

1366
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
over world i don't think you would
 

1367
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,430
over world i don't think you would
really want to though because

1368
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
really want to though because
 

1369
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,789
really want to though because

if you want to farm them this is a place

1372
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:04,559
if you want to farm them this is a place
 

1373
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,789
if you want to farm them this is a place
to do it

1374
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
to do it
 

1375
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,630
to do it
all right so to get back i think we just

1376
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
all right so to get back i think we just
 

1377
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,230
all right so to get back i think we just
have to throw an ender pearl back

1378
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
have to throw an ender pearl back
 

1379
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,750
have to throw an ender pearl back
into this thing and they'll take us to

1380
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
into this thing and they'll take us to
 

1381
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,630
into this thing and they'll take us to
the island again with the ender dragon

1382
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
the island again with the ender dragon
 

1383
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,230
the island again with the ender dragon
i've only seen two of these

1384
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
i've only seen two of these
 

1385
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,750
i've only seen two of these
like looking around here i didn't see

1386
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
like looking around here i didn't see
 

1387
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,269
like looking around here i didn't see
any more of them so i think these are

1388
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
any more of them so i think these are
 

1389
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,310
any more of them so i think these are
the only two

1390
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,320
the only two
 

1391
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,430
the only two
you get and they basically let you

1392
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
you get and they basically let you
 

1393
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,870
you get and they basically let you
transport through your

1394
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
transport through your
 

1395
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,750
transport through your
your dragon islands the normal one and

1396
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
your dragon islands the normal one and
 

1397
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,950
your dragon islands the normal one and
then the infinite

1398
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
then the infinite
 

1399
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,870
then the infinite
islands we just saw there with the

1400
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,880
islands we just saw there with the
 

1401
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,510
islands we just saw there with the
fortresses on and stuff i think is that

1402
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
fortresses on and stuff i think is that
 

1403
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,430
fortresses on and stuff i think is that
the idea behind it

1404
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
the idea behind it
 

1405
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,710
the idea behind it
so we're going to head back to the

1406
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:40,720
so we're going to head back to the
 

1407
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,470
so we're going to head back to the
overworld and just wrap things up here

creams if you put a stair over top the
 

1685
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,670
creams if you put a stair over top the
ice and then have the item flow on the

1686
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:19,680
ice and then have the item flow on the
 

1687
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,790
ice and then have the item flow on the
the lower part of the stair it goes like

i can't remember what it was almost a
time and a half faster though

the only problem is in the nexus

1694
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
the only problem is in the nexus

the only problem is in the nexus
we have space limitations

1696

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640
we can't actually do that

for the the main bulk of the the nexus

1706
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000

here only like once we get to this point

1708
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:47,359
here only like once we get to this point
 

1709
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,870
here only like once we get to this point
could we

1710
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:48,880
could we
 

1711
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,630
could we
could we do something like that when it

1712
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
could we do something like that when it
 

1713
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,710
could we do something like that when it
falls down here

1714
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
falls down here
 

1715
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,670
falls down here
and then over here we could do it so

1716
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
and then over here we could do it so
 

1717
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,069
and then over here we could do it so
might

1718
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:56,079
might
 

1719
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,349
might
might do something like that if it's uh

1720
00:35:59,349 --> 00:35:59,359
might do something like that if it's uh
 

1721
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,790
might do something like that if it's uh
if it's going to speed things up it's

1722
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
if it's going to speed things up it's
 

1723
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,270
if it's going to speed things up it's
definitely a good thing to have because

the sooner we get the items the better

1726
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
the sooner we get the items the better
 

1727
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,430
the sooner we get the items the better
with our our setup here

1728
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
with our our setup here
 

1729
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,670
with our our setup here
so we're going to try optimize this uh

1730
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
so we're going to try optimize this uh
 

1731
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,870
so we're going to try optimize this uh
once we get

1732
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
once we get

the time to do that next episode it's

1734
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:13,599
the time to do that next episode it's
 

1735
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,190
the time to do that next episode it's
probably going to be a nexus episode i

1736
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,200
probably going to be a nexus episode i
 

1737
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,109
probably going to be a nexus episode i
want to work on this again

1738
