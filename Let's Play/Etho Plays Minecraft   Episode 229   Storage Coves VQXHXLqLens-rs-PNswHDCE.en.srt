171
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,830
exactly the torture i'm going through
uh no it's not too bad

172
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
uh no it's not too bad
 

173
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,869
uh no it's not too bad
it's just gotta be really careful with

174
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
it's just gotta be really careful with
 

175
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,550
it's just gotta be really careful with
the stair placement and all that

176
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560

 

177
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,470

so you use stairs so you can still open

178
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
so you use stairs so you can still open
 

179
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,630
so you use stairs so you can still open
the chest that's important

180
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
the chest that's important
 

181
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,470
the chest that's important
you gotta position them in a way though

182
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
you gotta position them in a way though
 

183
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,789
you gotta position them in a way though
that it looks like a solid block

184
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
that it looks like a solid block
 

185
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,110
that it looks like a solid block
uh from the outside there

186
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120

 

187
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,470

and that is a challenge

188
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
and that is a challenge
 

189
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,749
and that is a challenge
that okay then we do another three

190
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
that okay then we do another three
 

191
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,789
that okay then we do another three
i do really like this uh

192
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
i do really like this uh
 

193
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,710
i do really like this uh
storage idea though um

194
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
storage idea though um
 

195
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,629
storage idea though um
it looks pretty good like i really like

196
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
it looks pretty good like i really like
 

197
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,150
it looks pretty good like i really like
how it looks actually

198
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
how it looks actually
 

199
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,430
how it looks actually
and it's also very efficient

200
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440

 

201
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,830

actually no i can use solid blocks here

202
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840

 

203
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,070

and then to finish it off

204
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
and then to finish it off
 

205
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,790
and then to finish it off
do that that

206
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800

 

207
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,390

one over here

208
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400

 

209
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,189

a few more chests and i'm gonna go ahead

210
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
a few more chests and i'm gonna go ahead
 

211
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,390
a few more chests and i'm gonna go ahead
i'm gonna have to cut down some more

212
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
i'm gonna have to cut down some more
 

213
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,909
i'm gonna have to cut down some more
trees because i am just blowing through

214
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
trees because i am just blowing through
 

215
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,110
trees because i am just blowing through
this wood

216
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
this wood
 

217
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,749
this wood
the chest you know two logs each

218
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
the chest you know two logs each
 

219
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,790
the chest you know two logs each
and i'm making so many

220
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
and i'm making so many
 

221
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,350
and i'm making so many
all right so that's the general gist of

222
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
all right so that's the general gist of
 

223
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,230
all right so that's the general gist of
it

224
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
it
 

225
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,830
it
clean up the scrap in front

226
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
clean up the scrap in front
 

227
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,430
clean up the scrap in front
then i got this border going around the

228
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
then i got this border going around the
 

229
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,350
then i got this border going around the
top so to place that i go like this

230
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360

 

231
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,189

and then again this way

232
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
and then again this way
 

233
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,510
and then again this way
and that's about it the item frames go

234
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
and that's about it the item frames go
 

235
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,469
and that's about it the item frames go
here

236
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
here
 

237
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,150
here
you can still see the stone i'm going to

238
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
you can still see the stone i'm going to
 

239
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,749
you can still see the stone i'm going to
have to put wood

240
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
have to put wood
 

241
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,430
have to put wood
on the edges there so you can't see this

242
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
on the edges there so you can't see this
 

243
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,029
on the edges there so you can't see this
little bit

244
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
little bit
 

245
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,670
little bit
but other than that it's it's really

246
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
but other than that it's it's really
 

247
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,909
but other than that it's it's really
cool

248
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919

 

249
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:52,550

try it out it's good

250
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560

 

251
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,990

the spider tracker
 

259
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,510
the spider tracker
uh slimes make pretty good trackers too

260
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
uh slimes make pretty good trackers too
 

261
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,150
uh slimes make pretty good trackers too
i think they work from farther away

262
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160

 

263
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,230

slapped the slime chunk here
 

281
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,510
slapped the slime chunk here
part of the storage cove is in it now

282
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
part of the storage cove is in it now
 

283
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,790
part of the storage cove is in it now
though

284
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
though
 

285
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,589

00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
i'm just gonna put down half slabs for
 

289
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,830
i'm just gonna put down half slabs for
now to stop them from spawning on top

290
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
now to stop them from spawning on top
 

291
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,629
now to stop them from spawning on top
here

292
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639

 

293
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,870

good i think that's right

good i think that's right
 

295
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,909
good i think that's right
anyway yeah so the storage coves are

296
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
anyway yeah so the storage coves are
 

297
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,510
anyway yeah so the storage coves are
done there's 35

298
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
done there's 35
 

299
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,469
done there's 35
unique items per thing which is quite a

300
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
unique items per thing which is quite a
 

301
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,110
unique items per thing which is quite a
bit

302
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
bit
 

303
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,350
bit
uh each unique item gets a two double

304
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
uh each unique item gets a two double
 

305
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,150
uh each unique item gets a two double
chest so

306
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
chest so
 

307
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,230
chest so
in total see 35 times 3

308
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
in total see 35 times 3
 

309
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,749
in total see 35 times 3
is

310
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759

 

311
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,670

and 105. times four 420

312
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
and 105. times four 420
 

313
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,870
and 105. times four 420
chests of storage that's a lot i hope i

314
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
chests of storage that's a lot i hope i
 

315
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,150
chests of storage that's a lot i hope i
did that right otherwise i

316
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
did that right otherwise i
 

317
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,589
did that right otherwise i
just embarrassed myself um

318
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599

 

319
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,950

they look good though i like them

320
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960

 

321
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,270

so now i've been working out out here a

322
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
so now i've been working out out here a
 

323
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,070
so now i've been working out out here a
little bit

324
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
little bit
 

325
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,510
little bit
on the stairs i think i got this

326
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
on the stairs i think i got this
 

327
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,909
on the stairs i think i got this
pretty much figured out this is how i

328
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
pretty much figured out this is how i
 

329
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,029
pretty much figured out this is how i
have the stairs laid out

330
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
have the stairs laid out
 

331
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,869
have the stairs laid out
at the moment and i might keep it like

332
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
at the moment and i might keep it like
 

333
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,710
at the moment and i might keep it like
that

334
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
that
 

335
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,150
that
and then i think it'd be cool to have

336
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
and then i think it'd be cool to have
 

337
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,230
and then i think it'd be cool to have
like a column up here

338
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
like a column up here
 

339
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,390
like a column up here
like a decorative column

340
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400

 

341
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,749

and then on top i would like these

342
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
and then on top i would like these
 

343
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,550
and then on top i would like these
these uh the settings layer to connect

344
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
these uh the settings layer to connect
 

345
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,909
these uh the settings layer to connect
to each other somehow so

346
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
to each other somehow so
 

347
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,350
to each other somehow so
maybe i don't know one option i thought

348
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
maybe i don't know one option i thought
 

349
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,589
maybe i don't know one option i thought
is like doing a quarter circle from

350
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
is like doing a quarter circle from
 

351
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,390
is like doing a quarter circle from
from there that kind of comes around to

352
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
from there that kind of comes around to
 

353
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,150
from there that kind of comes around to
this

354
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
this
 

355
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,029
this
uh it might look a little weird from

356
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
uh it might look a little weird from
 

357
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,149
uh it might look a little weird from
below there though so

358
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
below there though so
 

359
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,350
below there though so
another idea is to make it go

360
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
another idea is to make it go
 

361
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,149
another idea is to make it go
this way and wrap around to that side

362
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
this way and wrap around to that side
 

363
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,469
this way and wrap around to that side
and make it like a three-quarter circle

364
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479

 

365
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,949

that could be cool or maybe even have it

366
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
that could be cool or maybe even have it
 

367
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,990
that could be cool or maybe even have it
go up

368
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
go up
 

369
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,190
go up
to a third story in a three-quarter

370
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
to a third story in a three-quarter
 

371
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,829
to a third story in a three-quarter
circle away

372
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
circle away
 

373
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,990
circle away
and like have stairs right here that go

374
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
and like have stairs right here that go
 

375
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,590
and like have stairs right here that go
up

376
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
up
 

377
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,710
up
but yeah pretty good

378
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
but yeah pretty good
 

379
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,550
but yeah pretty good
pretty good so i thought about it

380
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
pretty good so i thought about it
 

381
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,350
pretty good so i thought about it
i talked about maybe using ice or snow

382
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
i talked about maybe using ice or snow
 

383
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,910
i talked about maybe using ice or snow
snow

384
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
snow
 

385
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,030
snow
or you know what

386
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
or you know what
 

387
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,430
or you know what
the bat squeaking very annoying i love

388
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
the bat squeaking very annoying i love
 

389
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,710
the bat squeaking very annoying i love
the sound they make when you kill them

390
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
the sound they make when you kill them
 

391
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,630
the sound they make when you kill them
though

392
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
though
 

393
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,110
though
come on come on i don't want to hit that

394
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
come on come on i don't want to hit that
 

395
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,710
come on come on i don't want to hit that
item frames

396
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
item frames
 

397
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,870
item frames
that almost makes it worth the new sound

398
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
that almost makes it worth the new sound
 

399
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,790
that almost makes it worth the new sound
for the squeaking

400
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
for the squeaking
 

401
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,110
for the squeaking
i love that

402
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120

 

403
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,470

right so sorry i got distracted uh

404
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
right so sorry i got distracted uh
 

405
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,150
right so sorry i got distracted uh
ice sandstone or snow

406
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
ice sandstone or snow
 

407
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,670
ice sandstone or snow
i sort of talked about and i've decided

408
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
i sort of talked about and i've decided
 

409
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,269
i sort of talked about and i've decided
i'm going to get rid of the snow

410
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
i'm going to get rid of the snow
 

411
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,269
i'm going to get rid of the snow
uh it's a hard choice to make because a

412
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
uh it's a hard choice to make because a
 

413
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,350
uh it's a hard choice to make because a
lot of people did like it

414
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
lot of people did like it
 

415
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,509
lot of people did like it
i don't mind it too much but i don't

416
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
i don't mind it too much but i don't
 

417
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,269
i don't mind it too much but i don't
know it just seems out of place

418
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279

 

419
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,630

especially since we got all this wood

420
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
especially since we got all this wood
 

421
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,710
especially since we got all this wood
now and i like the wood

422
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
now and i like the wood
 

423
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,509
now and i like the wood
so i want to keep the wood uh so i'm

424
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
so i want to keep the wood uh so i'm
 

425
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,310
so i want to keep the wood uh so i'm
gonna do sandstone instead of the snow

426
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
gonna do sandstone instead of the snow
 

427
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,509
gonna do sandstone instead of the snow
so this will be sandstone this

428
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
so this will be sandstone this
 

429
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,190
so this will be sandstone this
over here the walls are going to be

430
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
over here the walls are going to be
 

431
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,389
over here the walls are going to be
sandstone

432
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399

 

433
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,910

these things in the middle will be

434
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
these things in the middle will be
 

435
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,829
these things in the middle will be
sandstone

436
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
sandstone
 

437
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,509
sandstone
and all in all i think that will look

438
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
and all in all i think that will look
 

439
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,350
and all in all i think that will look
better

440
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
better
 

441
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,110
better
to be honest

442
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120

 

443
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,630

yeah because it just it i don't know it

444
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
yeah because it just it i don't know it
 

445
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,509
yeah because it just it i don't know it
just doesn't seem to go with this

446
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
just doesn't seem to go with this
 

447
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,150
just doesn't seem to go with this
all that good it makes me think of hot

448
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
all that good it makes me think of hot
 

449
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,590
all that good it makes me think of hot
chocolate and marshmallows for some

450
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
chocolate and marshmallows for some
 

451
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,389
chocolate and marshmallows for some
reason

452
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399

 

453
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,829

which yeah that's what i'm going to work

454
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
which yeah that's what i'm going to work
 

455
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,389
which yeah that's what i'm going to work
on now i'm going to replace this ring of

456
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
on now i'm going to replace this ring of
 

457
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,910
on now i'm going to replace this ring of
snow with sandstone

458
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
snow with sandstone
 

459
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,990
snow with sandstone
i'm going to try change the walls with

460
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
i'm going to try change the walls with
 

461
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,150
i'm going to try change the walls with
sandstone and just mess with that for a

462
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
sandstone and just mess with that for a
 

463
00:10:46,160 --> 00:12:01,430
sandstone and just mess with that for a
little bit

464
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440

 

465
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,590

oh there we go guys i have finished the

466
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
oh there we go guys i have finished the
 

467
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,069
oh there we go guys i have finished the
transition over to sandstone

468
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
transition over to sandstone
 

469
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,829
transition over to sandstone
and you know what i think it looks a

470
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
and you know what i think it looks a
 

471
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,190
and you know what i think it looks a
whole lot better

472
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
whole lot better
 

473
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,110
whole lot better
personally personally i think it looks a

474
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
personally personally i think it looks a
 

475
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,430
personally personally i think it looks a
lot better

476
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
lot better
 

477
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,790
lot better
because it still has that same contrast

478
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
because it still has that same contrast
 

479
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,310
because it still has that same contrast
that the snow had still still a lot

480
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
that the snow had still still a lot
 

481
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,030
that the snow had still still a lot
brighter than

482
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
brighter than
 

483
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,310
brighter than
the wood but it it's more of an

484
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
the wood but it it's more of an
 

485
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,350
the wood but it it's more of an
earth tone so it matches better

486
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
earth tone so it matches better
 

487
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,550
earth tone so it matches better
and it's not as bright like i did this

488
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
and it's not as bright like i did this
 

489
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,910
and it's not as bright like i did this
wall here

490
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
wall here
 

491
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,590
wall here
looks pretty good as is i still want to

492
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
looks pretty good as is i still want to
 

493
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,430
looks pretty good as is i still want to
add some more detail to it but could you

494
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
add some more detail to it but could you
 

495
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,030
add some more detail to it but could you
imagine if that was snow like it would

496
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
imagine if that was snow like it would
 

497
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,470
imagine if that was snow like it would
just be pure white

498
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480

 

499
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,829

i don't think it would look very good

500
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839

 

501
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,629

so yeah these though i think they need a

502
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
so yeah these though i think they need a
 

503
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,150
so yeah these though i think they need a
little more character to them

504
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
little more character to them
 

505
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,990
little more character to them
so i'll be changing them up a bit

506
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
so i'll be changing them up a bit
 

507
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,990
so i'll be changing them up a bit
they're they're too plain

508
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
they're they're too plain
 

509
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,230
they're they're too plain
in my opinion and

510
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
in my opinion and
 

511
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,150
in my opinion and
something else is messing with over here

512
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
something else is messing with over here
 

513
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,430
something else is messing with over here
before this was all this regular wood

514

i you know what that'll work yeah i

524
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
i you know what that'll work yeah i
 

525
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,110
i you know what that'll work yeah i
think that'll work

526
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
think that'll work
 

527
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,110
think that'll work

forgot about that i'll have to change
 

531
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,069
forgot about that i'll have to change
this with a stair

532
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
this with a stair
 

533
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,590
this with a stair
if i want to do this

534
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600

 

535
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,190

see do i have any do it like

536
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
see do i have any do it like
 

537
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:43,430
see do i have any do it like
like that that'll work

538
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440

 

539
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,990

very cool so yeah we'll have ender

540
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
very cool so yeah we'll have ender
 

541
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,550
very cool so yeah we'll have ender
chests

542
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
chests
 

543
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,750
chests
just twos to bounce out the look another

544
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
just twos to bounce out the look another
 

545
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,750
just twos to bounce out the look another
option maybe is to use an anvil

546
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
option maybe is to use an anvil
 

547
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,629
option maybe is to use an anvil
have an anvil on one side i don't know

548
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
have an anvil on one side i don't know
 

549
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,150
have an anvil on one side i don't know
so we'll do that

550
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
so we'll do that
 

551
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,990
so we'll do that
then one thought i had with this little

552
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
then one thought i had with this little
 

553
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,069
then one thought i had with this little
gap here is to have a

554
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
gap here is to have a
 

555
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,990
gap here is to have a
very narrow staircase that goes down to

556
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
very narrow staircase that goes down to
 

557
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,629
very narrow staircase that goes down to
another level below this one with more

558
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
another level below this one with more
 

559
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,069
another level below this one with more
storage

560
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
storage
 

561
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,949
storage
it's one idea another idea maybe

562
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959

 

563
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,990

just have a row of

564
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
just have a row of
 

565
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,870
just have a row of
leaves like going oop going along here

566
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
leaves like going oop going along here
 

567
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,389
leaves like going oop going along here
that could be cool too because then

568
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
that could be cool too because then
 

569
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,350
that could be cool too because then
it'll look like this

570
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
it'll look like this
 

571
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,550
it'll look like this
over here

572
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560

 

573
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,069

30 30 frames per second very good

574
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
30 30 frames per second very good
 

575
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,430
30 30 frames per second very good
i don't know what it is i'm getting so

576
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
i don't know what it is i'm getting so
 

577
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,790
i don't know what it is i'm getting so
much like processor lag today

578
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
much like processor lag today
 

579
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,069
much like processor lag today
with my computer i think it needs a

580
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
with my computer i think it needs a
 

581
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,030
with my computer i think it needs a
reboot it's been almost

582
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
reboot it's been almost
 

583
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,350
reboot it's been almost
i don't reboot my computer very often so

584
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
i don't reboot my computer very often so
 

585
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,069
i don't reboot my computer very often so
i think it's

586
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
i think it's
 

587
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,189
i think it's
probably been about six months or so not

588
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
probably been about six months or so not
 

589
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:51,750
probably been about six months or so not
that it

590
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
that it
 

591
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,870
that it
necessarily helps but maybe

592
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
necessarily helps but maybe
 

593
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,710
necessarily helps but maybe
um but yeah with these corners i think i

594
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
um but yeah with these corners i think i
 

595
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,069
um but yeah with these corners i think i
should try to

596
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
should try to
 

597
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,910
should try to
join these two together somehow like

598
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
join these two together somehow like
 

599
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,910
join these two together somehow like
make an arch

600
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
make an arch
 

601
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,189
make an arch
of sorts and also this line this really

602
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
of sorts and also this line this really
 

603
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,870
of sorts and also this line this really
sharp line here i don't want that

604
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
sharp line here i don't want that
 

605
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,829
sharp line here i don't want that
so i'll have to try to get rid of that

606
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
so i'll have to try to get rid of that
 

607
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,069
so i'll have to try to get rid of that
too

608
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
too
 

609
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,949
too
and yeah i was going to mess around with

610
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
and yeah i was going to mess around with
 

611
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,150
and yeah i was going to mess around with
railings up here

612
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
railings up here
 

613
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,110
railings up here
and because i'm not overly happy with

614
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
and because i'm not overly happy with
 

615
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,710
and because i'm not overly happy with
the stair thing where you can just walk

616
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
the stair thing where you can just walk
 

617
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,030
the stair thing where you can just walk
off

618
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
off
 

619
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,069
off
and it's all one color

620
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
and it's all one color
 

621
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,269
and it's all one color
but maybe another date for now let's

622
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
but maybe another date for now let's
 

623
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,949
but maybe another date for now let's
change this up a little bit

624
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
change this up a little bit
 

625
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,949
change this up a little bit
where we've done a lot of building today

626
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
where we've done a lot of building today
 

627
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,030
where we've done a lot of building today
i want to

628
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
i want to
 

629
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,230
i want to
i want to mess with this for a bit so

630
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
i want to mess with this for a bit so
 

631
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,350
i want to mess with this for a bit so
there's um

632
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360

 

633
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,110

aft streams are really the big thing now

634
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
aft streams are really the big thing now
 

635
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,310
aft streams are really the big thing now
um where you

636
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
um where you
 

637
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,509
um where you
get mob drops to go either

638
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
get mob drops to go either
 

639
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,110
get mob drops to go either
you get mob drops to go to unloaded

640
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
you get mob drops to go to unloaded
 

641
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,189
you get mob drops to go to unloaded
chunks basically so either

642
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
chunks basically so either
 

643
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,310
chunks basically so either
make them go far away from you

644
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
make them go far away from you
 

645
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,910
make them go far away from you
like 144 plus blocks away from you

646
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
like 144 plus blocks away from you
 

647
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,430
like 144 plus blocks away from you
so that's the item entity still stays in

648
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
so that's the item entity still stays in
 

649
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,949
so that's the item entity still stays in
game but

650
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
game but
 

651
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,870
game but
it won't despawn because it's an

652
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
it won't despawn because it's an
 

653
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,790
it won't despawn because it's an
unloaded chunk

654
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
unloaded chunk
 

655
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,870
unloaded chunk
um another way of doing it now is to

656
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
um another way of doing it now is to
 

657
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,150
um another way of doing it now is to
make or

658
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
make or
 

659
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,710
make or
it's to send stuff to the nether through

660
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
it's to send stuff to the nether through
 

661
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,829
it's to send stuff to the nether through
portals

662
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
portals
 

663
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,949
portals
but i have this kind of unique situation

664
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
but i have this kind of unique situation
 

665
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,590
but i have this kind of unique situation
where i have an

666
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
where i have an
 

667
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,670
where i have an
end portal right here so i want to try

668
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
end portal right here so i want to try
 

669
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,910
end portal right here so i want to try
make use of that

670
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
make use of that
 

671
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,269
make use of that
and to do that

672
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
and to do that
 

673
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,430
and to do that
we're just going to set up a quick test

674
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
we're just going to set up a quick test
 

675
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,110
we're just going to set up a quick test
here

676
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
here
 

677
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,269
here
and if this works out well i'll do a

678
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
and if this works out well i'll do a
 

679
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,629
and if this works out well i'll do a
proper setup later

680
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
proper setup later
 

681
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,550
proper setup later
um see

682
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
um see
 

683
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,629
um see
yeah i'm just gonna make a tube goes

684
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
yeah i'm just gonna make a tube goes
 

685
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,470
yeah i'm just gonna make a tube goes
right to it

686
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
right to it
 

687
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,470
right to it
i think i counted and it's nine blocks

688
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
i think i counted and it's nine blocks
 

689
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,310
i think i counted and it's nine blocks
long

690
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
long
 

691
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:58,550
long
so i'll have to break it some somehow

692
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560

 

693
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,749

and

694
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759

 

695
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,270

yeah because if this works i'll be able

696
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
yeah because if this works i'll be able
 

697
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,150
yeah because if this works i'll be able
to just collect gunpowder all the time

698
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,160
to just collect gunpowder all the time
 

699
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,829
to just collect gunpowder all the time
um and i'm pretty sure you can get it to

700
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
um and i'm pretty sure you can get it to
 

701
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,270
um and i'm pretty sure you can get it to
stack

702
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
stack
 

703
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,510
stack
so i won't have like thousands of

704
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
so i won't have like thousands of
 

705
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,590
so i won't have like thousands of
entities in my end here which will just

706
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
entities in my end here which will just
 

707
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,429
entities in my end here which will just
crash my game when i go into it

708
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
crash my game when i go into it
 

709
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,909
crash my game when i go into it
i think but that's one thing we gotta

710
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
i think but that's one thing we gotta
 

711
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,350
i think but that's one thing we gotta
check out

712
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
check out
 

713
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,909
check out
with this that's no good if it crashes

714
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
with this that's no good if it crashes
 

715
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,750
with this that's no good if it crashes
the game okay that'll do

716
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
the game okay that'll do
 

717
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,070
the game okay that'll do
just for a quick test let me put that

718
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
just for a quick test let me put that
 

719
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,510
just for a quick test let me put that
there

720
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
there
 

721
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,990
there
and um

722
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
and um
 

723
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,350
and um
i'm really scared of doing this oh

724
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
i'm really scared of doing this oh
 

725
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,070
i'm really scared of doing this oh
boy breaking ice with all his wiring

726
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080

 

727
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,430

oh and i missed oh

728
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440

732
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440

 

733
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,430

um what's the quick way we can fix this

734
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
um what's the quick way we can fix this
 

735
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,310
um what's the quick way we can fix this
i guess there isn't

736
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
i guess there isn't
 

737
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,230
i guess there isn't
any is there

738
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240

 

739
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,390

um i'm gonna make this look really ugly

740
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
um i'm gonna make this look really ugly
 

741
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,270
um i'm gonna make this look really ugly
just because i'm oh i almost did it it's

742
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
just because i'm oh i almost did it it's
 

743
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,029
just because i'm oh i almost did it it's
because i'm lazy to get blocks right now

744
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
because i'm lazy to get blocks right now
 

745
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,830
because i'm lazy to get blocks right now
and there and

746
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840

 

747
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,470

okay so that'll work for for testing

748
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
okay so that'll work for for testing
 

749
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,750
okay so that'll work for for testing
anyway

750
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
anyway
 

751
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,110
anyway
and we'll take out this trap door

752
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
and we'll take out this trap door
 

753
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,070
and we'll take out this trap door
so we're going to go above break that

754
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
so we're going to go above break that
 

755
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,830
so we're going to go above break that
lights

756
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
lights
 

757
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,350
lights
and kind of curious

758
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360

 

759
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,190

if they will die when they hit the water

760
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
if they will die when they hit the water
 

761
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,470
if they will die when they hit the water
because if if it's positioned right

762
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
because if if it's positioned right
 

763
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,430
because if if it's positioned right
the mobs will actually die even though

764
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
the mobs will actually die even though
 

765
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,470
the mobs will actually die even though
they landed

766
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
they landed
 

767
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,190
they landed
in water

768
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200

 

769
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,630

and i think i need to sleep because

770
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
and i think i need to sleep because
 

771
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,270
and i think i need to sleep because
there's not really any mob spawning

772
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280

 

773
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,510

very good so any moments now

774
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520

 

775
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,950

the other option is to put a fence above

776
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
the other option is to put a fence above
 

777
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,549
the other option is to put a fence above
and water on top that

778
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559

 

779
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,590

which is probably what we're going to

780
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
which is probably what we're going to
 

781
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,510
which is probably what we're going to
have to end up doing

782
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520

 

783
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,710

but i kind of want to see one of these

784
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:36,720
but i kind of want to see one of these
 

785
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,110
but i kind of want to see one of these
guys fall down

786
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120

 

787
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,430

any any moment now would be perfect

788
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440

 

789
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,310

come on guys where are you

790
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320

 

791
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,990

nope they're not cooperating so i'm

792
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
nope they're not cooperating so i'm
 

793
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,710
nope they're not cooperating so i'm
gonna cut it one sec

794
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720

 

795
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,630

okay so i got a few of them coming down

796
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
okay so i got a few of them coming down
 

797
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,070
okay so i got a few of them coming down
now

798
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
now
 

799
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,510
now
and some of them are dying some of them

800
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
and some of them are dying some of them
 

801
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,190
and some of them are dying some of them
are not so

802
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
are not so
 

803
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,270
are not so
i can't remember if i had vines

804
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
i can't remember if i had vines
 

805
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,549
i can't remember if i had vines
resetting their drop

806
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
resetting their drop
 

807
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,669
resetting their drop
height i thought i did

808
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679

 

809
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,669

i think i need two vines for that

810
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
i think i need two vines for that
 

811
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,390
i think i need two vines for that
um

812
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400

 

813
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,110

oh no i never did put vines okay so that

814
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
oh no i never did put vines okay so that
 

815
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,310
oh no i never did put vines okay so that
would explain why they're

816
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
would explain why they're
 

817
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,070
would explain why they're
some of them are dying and some are not

818
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
some of them are dying and some are not
 

819
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,590
some of them are dying and some are not
so i'll have to add that

820
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600

 

821
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,710

uh but anyway

822
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720

 

823
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,390

let's get a few guys going through here

824
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
let's get a few guys going through here
 

825
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,909
let's get a few guys going through here
and see what happens

826
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919

 

827
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,470

okay i didn't see him fall through um

828
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
okay i didn't see him fall through um
 

829
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,830
okay i didn't see him fall through um
i'll actually have to really watch out

830
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
i'll actually have to really watch out
 

831
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,350
i'll actually have to really watch out
for that because they could jam things

832
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
for that because they could jam things
 

833
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,590
for that because they could jam things
up i think

834
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600

 

835
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,669

xp orbs don't fall through the fence

836
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
xp orbs don't fall through the fence
 

837
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:09,669
xp orbs don't fall through the fence
that's interesting

838
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679

 

839
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,270

okay so next

840
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
okay so next
 

841
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,950
okay so next
uh we're gonna do this thing again where

842
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
uh we're gonna do this thing again where
 

843
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,870
uh we're gonna do this thing again where
i fill up my inventory and just see

i fill up my inventory and just see
what's going on on the other end here

846
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
what's going on on the other end here
 

847
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,270
what's going on on the other end here

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
okay i think that's good let's go check
 

857
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,630
okay i think that's good let's go check
it out what's going on

858
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640

 

859
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,750

see if it stacks

860
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760

 

861
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,870

okay it's not stacking

862
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
okay it's not stacking
 

863
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,549
okay it's not stacking
wow the leg

864
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559

 

865
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,350

yeah it's not stacking

866
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360

 

867
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,549

so i wonder

868
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
so i wonder
 

869
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,149
so i wonder
what should i do about that i'm pretty

870
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
what should i do about that i'm pretty
 

871
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,750
what should i do about that i'm pretty
sure anything i build here is going to

872
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
sure anything i build here is going to
 

873
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,510
sure anything i build here is going to
get destroyed which is a tough part of

874
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
get destroyed which is a tough part of
 

875
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,190
get destroyed which is a tough part of
this

876
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
this
 

877
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,870
this
um maybe

878
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880

 

879
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,510

um i have an idea

880
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
um i have an idea
 

881
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,110
um i have an idea
or at least something else i want to try

882
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
or at least something else i want to try
 

883
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,789
or at least something else i want to try
here

884
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
here
 

885
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,870
here
if we have water

886
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880

 

887
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,909

i'm not too sure how this all works yet

888
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
i'm not too sure how this all works yet
 

889
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,750
i'm not too sure how this all works yet
um we're going to place a few blocks see

890
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
um we're going to place a few blocks see
 

891
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,950
um we're going to place a few blocks see
if they disappear we're going to try

892
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
if they disappear we're going to try
 

893
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,789
if they disappear we're going to try
uh have ice or no water we'll have water

894
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
uh have ice or no water we'll have water
 

895
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,230
uh have ice or no water we'll have water
see if that disappears and also

896
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
see if that disappears and also
 

897
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,830
see if that disappears and also
we'll have the source block away from

898
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
we'll have the source block away from
 

899
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,590
we'll have the source block away from
the obsidian

900
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
the obsidian
 

901
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,430
the obsidian
but we'll have it flowing to it and see

902
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
but we'll have it flowing to it and see
 

903
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,350
but we'll have it flowing to it and see
if

904
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
if
 

905
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,070
if
see what happens with that too

906
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
see what happens with that too
 

907
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,230
see what happens with that too
okay

908
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240

 

909
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,990

all right we're gonna re-enter and just

910
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
all right we're gonna re-enter and just
 

911
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,470
all right we're gonna re-enter and just
see what all gets destroyed here

912
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480

 

913
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,110

major lag again

914
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
major lag again
 

915
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,230
major lag again
okay so the water stream got destroyed

916
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
okay so the water stream got destroyed
 

917
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,029
okay so the water stream got destroyed
and it did not update

918
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039

 

919
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,830

darn that would have been nice if it

920
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
darn that would have been nice if it
 

921
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,029
darn that would have been nice if it
updated

922
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
updated
 

923
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,950
updated
hmm

924
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960

 

925
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,950

yeah i'm not sure if we can make them

926
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
yeah i'm not sure if we can make them
 

927
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,110
yeah i'm not sure if we can make them
stack anyway

928
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
stack anyway
 

929
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,350
stack anyway
unless we do it before they enter but

930
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
unless we do it before they enter but
 

931
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,310
unless we do it before they enter but
ideally you'd like it to do it in here

932
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320

 

933
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,350

um

934
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360

 

935
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,390

all right

936
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400

 

937
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,750

so this isn't something i've tried

938
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
so this isn't something i've tried
 

939
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,590
so this isn't something i've tried
before but i i broke a block

940
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
before but i i broke a block
 

941
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,830
before but i i broke a block
in the platform and i replaced the

942
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
in the platform and i replaced the
 

943
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,990
in the platform and i replaced the
middle with a fence

944
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
middle with a fence
 

945
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,350
middle with a fence
and i'm going to go through and just see

946
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,360
and i'm going to go through and just see
 

947
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,630
and i'm going to go through and just see
what happens

948
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640

 

949
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,789

hmm is the platform going to get moved

950
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
hmm is the platform going to get moved
 

951
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,630
hmm is the platform going to get moved
is the fence going to be destroyed

952
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,640
is the fence going to be destroyed
 

953
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,070
is the fence going to be destroyed
what's going to happen

954
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
what's going to happen
 

955
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,470
what's going to happen
it's going to get replaced okay

956
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480

 

957
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,990

what if we place a boat on the platform

958
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000

 

959
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,549

if we do that the boat will

960
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
if we do that the boat will
 

961
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,669
if we do that the boat will
stay

962
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679

 

963
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,789

that is interesting okay

964
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
that is interesting okay
 

965
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,470
that is interesting okay
so the cool thing about a boat

966
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
so the cool thing about a boat
 

967
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,430
so the cool thing about a boat
is it will raise items up enough where

968
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
is it will raise items up enough where
 

969
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,149
is it will raise items up enough where
they should

970
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
they should
 

971
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,990
they should
stack possibly depends if they're

972
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
stack possibly depends if they're
 

973
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,029
stack possibly depends if they're
getting snap to position

974
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
getting snap to position
 

975
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,549
getting snap to position
um they probably won't stack but if

976
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
um they probably won't stack but if
 

977
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,390
um they probably won't stack but if
they're moving at all and it's

978
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
they're moving at all and it's
 

979
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,830
they're moving at all and it's
it's attempting to stack them they will

980
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
it's attempting to stack them they will
 

981
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,710
it's attempting to stack them they will
i'm pretty sure so and try this again

982
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
i'm pretty sure so and try this again
 

983
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,549
i'm pretty sure so and try this again
put the boat right in the middle

984
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
put the boat right in the middle
 

985
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,750
put the boat right in the middle
throw a bunch of items through the

986
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
throw a bunch of items through the
 

987
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,350
throw a bunch of items through the
portal and see if they will stack then

988
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360

 

989
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,350

okay here it is i've thrown about 50

990
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
okay here it is i've thrown about 50
 

991
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,990
okay here it is i've thrown about 50
zombie flesh in

992
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
zombie flesh in
 

993
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,909
zombie flesh in
and i've also moved around my cursor as

994
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
and i've also moved around my cursor as
 

995
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,789
and i've also moved around my cursor as
i was doing it

996
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:08,799

 

997
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,470

make sure we can't pick them up we'll go

998
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
make sure we can't pick them up we'll go
 

999
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,190
make sure we can't pick them up we'll go
through and just see

1000
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
through and just see
 

1001
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,230
through and just see
they did not stack okay so it's not

1002
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
they did not stack okay so it's not
 

1003
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,590
they did not stack okay so it's not
it's not checking to see if they

1004
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
it's not checking to see if they
 

1005
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,510
it's not checking to see if they
need to

1006
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520

 

1007
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:34,789

pretty sure pretty sure

1008
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799

 

1009
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,029

not the best place to test that um

1010
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
not the best place to test that um
 

1011
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,789
not the best place to test that um
well it doesn't matter either way we

1012
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799
well it doesn't matter either way we
 

1013
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,029
well it doesn't matter either way we
can't do it

1014
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
can't do it
 

1015
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,830
can't do it
hmm yeah so if i want to stack them i

1016
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
hmm yeah so if i want to stack them i
 

1017
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,470
hmm yeah so if i want to stack them i
gotta do it before they enter the portal

1018
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480

 

1019
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,909

well i've thought about it and i'm going

1020
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
well i've thought about it and i'm going
 

1021
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,830
well i've thought about it and i'm going
to do this afk stream

1022
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
to do this afk stream
 

1023
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,710
to do this afk stream
anyway just because i don't think it'll

1024
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
anyway just because i don't think it'll
 

1025
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,590
anyway just because i don't think it'll
be a problem

1026
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
be a problem
 

1027
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,390
be a problem
i would need to have lots of and lots of

1028

1064
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
let's see well actually there's not even
 

1065
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,750
let's see well actually there's not even
that many silverfish maybe that was

1066

that many silverfish maybe that was
 

1067
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,390
that many silverfish maybe that was
something else

1068
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400

 

1069
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,470

there we go

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480

 

1071
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,549

but it's being caused by the sound

1072
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559
but it's being caused by the sound
 

1073
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,870
but it's being caused by the sound
engine if i turn the sound off

1074
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
engine if i turn the sound off
 

1075
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,510
engine if i turn the sound off
the game runs so much smoother like

1077
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,149
the game runs so much smoother like
there's some serious problems with it

1078
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:00,159

 

1079
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,110

oh isn't that much nicer you can run

1080
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
oh isn't that much nicer you can run
 

1081
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,830
oh isn't that much nicer you can run
around and

1082
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
around and
 

1083
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,310

1089
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,870
so hopefully they re re write the sound
engine or something sometime

1090
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880

a little bit better over here
 

1099
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,950
a little bit better over here
because the range of the sound is 16

1100
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
because the range of the sound is 16
 

1101

1172
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
from i'm not really sure why they're
 

1173
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,510
from i'm not really sure why they're
changing it exactly i

1174
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,520
changing it exactly i
 

1175
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,190
changing it exactly i
i think it's because they want to make

1176
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
i think it's because they want to make
 

1177
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,669
i think it's because they want to make
it more user friendly

complicated once you understand and have
 

1209
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,310
complicated once you understand and have
a little experience with it it's not too

it's not really unpredictable once you
 

1221
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,350
it's not really unpredictable once you
have some experience with it

1222

1231
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,149

like the bud switch that was an

which would really suck because they're
 

1247
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,510
which would really suck because they're
so awesome
