11
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,990
probably know
uh lately we've been using a ton of

12
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
uh lately we've been using a ton of
 

13
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,430
uh lately we've been using a ton of
black stone

14
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
black stone
 

15
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,070
black stone
on our nether tunnels oh they take so

16
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
on our nether tunnels oh they take so
 

17
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,349
on our nether tunnels oh they take so
much it's insane

18
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
much it's insane
 

19
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,830
much it's insane
so we can get a bunch of blackstone just

20
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
so we can get a bunch of blackstone just
 

21
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,830
so we can get a bunch of blackstone just
by trading with the piglens bartering

22
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
by trading with the piglens bartering
 

23
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,550
by trading with the piglens bartering
with them

24
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
with them
 

25
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,390
with them
and we've been doing that but i find i'm

26
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
and we've been doing that but i find i'm
 

27
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,390
and we've been doing that but i find i'm
using it even faster than i'm getting it

28
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
using it even faster than i'm getting it
 

29
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,950
using it even faster than i'm getting it
that way

30
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
that way
 

31
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,389
that way
so i've decided just to go to the nether

32
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
so i've decided just to go to the nether
 

33
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,470
so i've decided just to go to the nether
here and tear down one of these bastions

34
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
here and tear down one of these bastions
 

35
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,670
here and tear down one of these bastions
they are

36
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
they are
 

37
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,830
they are
absolutely loaded with the stuff the top

38
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
absolutely loaded with the stuff the top
 

39
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,950
absolutely loaded with the stuff the top
half of the bastion

40
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
half of the bastion
 

41
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,150
half of the bastion
is the blackstone bricks up over there

42
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
is the blackstone bricks up over there
 

43
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,950
is the blackstone bricks up over there
but if you go

44
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
but if you go
 

45
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,190
but if you go
down a little bit you'll get to the the

46
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
down a little bit you'll get to the the
 

47
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,389
down a little bit you'll get to the the
foundation

48
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
foundation
 

49
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,470
foundation
and this is like the regular black stone

50
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
and this is like the regular black stone
 

51
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,670
and this is like the regular black stone
solid pretty much

52
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
solid pretty much
 

53
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,310
solid pretty much
all the way down to the lava level and

54
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
all the way down to the lava level and
 

55
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,470
all the way down to the lava level and
there is so much in there

56
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
there is so much in there
 

57
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,630
there is so much in there
we can get a a good stockpile of this

58
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
we can get a a good stockpile of this
 

59
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,750
we can get a a good stockpile of this
stuff and that's what we're gonna do

60
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
stuff and that's what we're gonna do
 

61
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,389
stuff and that's what we're gonna do
here

62
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
here
 

63
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,229
here
and also this is a great way of getting

64
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
and also this is a great way of getting
 

65
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,590
and also this is a great way of getting
the

66
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
the
 

67

don't have fire resistance
 

73
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,630
don't have fire resistance
kind of an oversight on the way here um

74
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640

 

75
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,350

perfectly fine guys
tons of yielded blackstone that you

80
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
tons of yielded blackstone that you
 

81
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,270
tons of yielded blackstone that you
would never find otherwise because it's

82
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
would never find otherwise because it's
 

83

like hidden
 

85
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,870
like hidden
within the foundation not on the surface

86
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
within the foundation not on the surface
 

87
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,230
within the foundation not on the surface
level so you got to like mine the whole

88

and also there's like tons of just like
 

93
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,789
and also there's like tons of just like
gold blocks throughout the thing too

94
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
gold blocks throughout the thing too
 

95
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,749
gold blocks throughout the thing too
which is kind of nice

96
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759

 

97
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,310

00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
awesome so back over at our nether hub
 

103
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,030
awesome so back over at our nether hub
here we have another

104
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
here we have another
 

105
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,590
here we have another
tunnel uh reworked this is the very

106
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
tunnel uh reworked this is the very
 

107
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,270
tunnel uh reworked this is the very
first tunnel we ever built the stone

108
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
first tunnel we ever built the stone
 

109
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,030
first tunnel we ever built the stone
brick and iron bar one here

110
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
brick and iron bar one here
 

111
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,950
brick and iron bar one here
that goes down to the stronghold and our

112
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
that goes down to the stronghold and our
 

113
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,230
that goes down to the stronghold and our
dual blaze farm

114
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
dual blaze farm
 

115
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,749
dual blaze farm
you can see now we got some blue ice

116
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
you can see now we got some blue ice
 

117
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,670
you can see now we got some blue ice
down the center and some black stone

118
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
down the center and some black stone
 

119
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,190
down the center and some black stone
slabs and basalt on the side

120
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
slabs and basalt on the side
 

121
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,830
slabs and basalt on the side
but i did leave most of the tunnel

122
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
but i did leave most of the tunnel
 

123
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,830
but i did leave most of the tunnel
intact and then uh beyond here we got

124
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
intact and then uh beyond here we got
 

125
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,670
intact and then uh beyond here we got
the blackstone design again

126
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
the blackstone design again
 

127
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,190
the blackstone design again
left a little opening there so we can

128
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
left a little opening there so we can
 

129
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,510
left a little opening there so we can
still see the frog when we go through

130
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
still see the frog when we go through
 

131
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,910
still see the frog when we go through
and this leads down to our wither

132
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
and this leads down to our wither
 

133
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,869
and this leads down to our wither
skeleton farm the gas blaster 3000

134
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
skeleton farm the gas blaster 3000
 

135
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,830
skeleton farm the gas blaster 3000
and the goon farm and i think there's

136
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
and the goon farm and i think there's
 

137
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,510
and the goon farm and i think there's
one more thing over here

138
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
one more thing over here
 

139
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,910
one more thing over here
but it's a little bit of a shorter one

140
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
but it's a little bit of a shorter one
 

141
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,910
but it's a little bit of a shorter one
in the comments i saw some people asking

142
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
in the comments i saw some people asking
 

143
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,990
in the comments i saw some people asking
about the silverfish farm if i was gonna

144
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
about the silverfish farm if i was gonna
 

145
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,990
about the silverfish farm if i was gonna
fix it before the world tour so i

146
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
fix it before the world tour so i
 

147
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,030
fix it before the world tour so i
decided to

148
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
decided to
 

149
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,030
decided to
take a look at it here and i think it

150
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
take a look at it here and i think it
 

151
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,750
take a look at it here and i think it
actually works just fine

152
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
actually works just fine
 

153
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,990
actually works just fine

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
except i think the piston tapes broke
 

155
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,670
except i think the piston tapes broke
somehow

fish block that's weird
 

165
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,830
fish block that's weird
okay um let's go down here

166

what happens that also was a stone block
 

171
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,190
what happens that also was a stone block
not a silver fin block okay

172
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
not a silver fin block okay
 

173
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,630
not a silver fin block okay
let him through oh i hear it running

174
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
let him through oh i hear it running
 

175
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,869
let him through oh i hear it running
that's a good sign

176
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879

 

177
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,710

yeah i think uh i think it is jam

178
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
yeah i think uh i think it is jam
 

179
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,390
yeah i think uh i think it is jam
somehow there's some regular stone

180
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
somehow there's some regular stone
 

181
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,949
somehow there's some regular stone
blocks

182
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
blocks
 

183
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,470
blocks
mixed in there instead of silverfish

184
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
mixed in there instead of silverfish
 

185
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,869
mixed in there instead of silverfish
ones but you can see they entered the

186
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
ones but you can see they entered the
 

187
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,750
ones but you can see they entered the
stone block

188
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
stone block
 

189
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,869
stone block
it comes from a stone generator

190
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
it comes from a stone generator
 

191
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,949
it comes from a stone generator
and then when they enter it it updates

192
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
and then when they enter it it updates
 

193
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,390
and then when they enter it it updates
there's like a block update detector

194
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
there's like a block update detector
 

195
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,070
there's like a block update detector
there and then it pushes it over

196
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
there and then it pushes it over
 

197
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,550
there and then it pushes it over
and it all goes up into a big slab of

198
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
and it all goes up into a big slab of
 

199
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,470
and it all goes up into a big slab of
silverfish blocks in this uh

200
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
silverfish blocks in this uh
 

201
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,550
silverfish blocks in this uh
this big clump here all right so it's

202
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
this big clump here all right so it's
 

203
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,550
this big clump here all right so it's
looking like we used up our last beacon

204
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
looking like we used up our last beacon
 

205
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,710
looking like we used up our last beacon
on that bastion and i left it out there

206
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
on that bastion and i left it out there
 

207
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,190
on that bastion and i left it out there
so

208
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
so
 

209
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,789
so
it's probably a good idea to farm up a

210
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
it's probably a good idea to farm up a
 

211
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,630
it's probably a good idea to farm up a
few more withers here we have enough

212
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
few more withers here we have enough
 

213
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,869
few more withers here we have enough
skulls to spawn in nine more at the

214
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
skulls to spawn in nine more at the
 

215
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,430
skulls to spawn in nine more at the
moment

216
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
moment
 

217
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,110
moment
and i thought we would try automated a

218
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
and i thought we would try automated a
 

219
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,670
and i thought we would try automated a
little bit so we got to

220
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
little bit so we got to
 

221
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,190
little bit so we got to
carved pumpkins in here we got a bunch

222
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
carved pumpkins in here we got a bunch
 

223
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,949
carved pumpkins in here we got a bunch
of iron golems set up

224
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959

 

225
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,990

it didn't work oh no

226
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
it didn't work oh no
 

227
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,270
it didn't work oh no
move one over here just test this oh now

228
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
move one over here just test this oh now
 

229
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,710
move one over here just test this oh now
it works okay it's trying to be all

230
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
it works okay it's trying to be all
 

231
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,910
it works okay it's trying to be all
fancy here you know all

232
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
fancy here you know all
 

233
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,550
fancy here you know all
all automated and stuff

234
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560

 

235
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,670

oh i did not want to do that

236
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680

 

237
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,149

oh this is not going well let's let's

238
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
oh this is not going well let's let's
 

239
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,869
oh this is not going well let's let's
head back

240
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
head back
 

241
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,390
head back
i guess we'll just have to spawn them in

242
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
i guess we'll just have to spawn them in
 

243
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,710
i guess we'll just have to spawn them in
manually all right so we got five iron

244
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
manually all right so we got five iron
 

245
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,390
manually all right so we got five iron
golems in there let's try this out so

246
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
golems in there let's try this out so
 

247
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,069
golems in there let's try this out so
the idea is they're gonna surround the

248
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
the idea is they're gonna surround the
 

249
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,030
the idea is they're gonna surround the
wither

250
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
wither
 

251
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,710
wither
we got this loaded in so all we gotta do

252
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
we got this loaded in so all we gotta do
 

253
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,469
we got this loaded in so all we gotta do
is hit the button

254
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
is hit the button
 

255
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,430
is hit the button
hopefully he won't fly away so there's

256
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
hopefully he won't fly away so there's
 

257
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,710
hopefully he won't fly away so there's
two good ways of doing this we can

258
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
two good ways of doing this we can
 

259
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,469
two good ways of doing this we can
either kill the withers with suffocation

260
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
either kill the withers with suffocation
 

261
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,670
either kill the withers with suffocation
that's good if you're doing a lot of

262
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
that's good if you're doing a lot of
 

263
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,230
that's good if you're doing a lot of
them

264
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
them
 

265
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,830
them
uh but if you're just doing a few the

266
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
uh but if you're just doing a few the
 

267
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,909
uh but if you're just doing a few the
iron golems were pretty good

268
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
iron golems were pretty good
 

269
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,390
iron golems were pretty good
they do a ton of damage quickly the only

270
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
they do a ton of damage quickly the only
 

271
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,070
they do a ton of damage quickly the only
downside is you got to repair them every

272
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
downside is you got to repair them every
 

273
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,990
downside is you got to repair them every
so often

274
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
so often
 

275
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,270
so often
and as long as you got enough iron

276
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
and as long as you got enough iron
 

277
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,189
and as long as you got enough iron
golems they should auto kill it too

278
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
golems they should auto kill it too
 

279
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,070
golems they should auto kill it too
yeah so we got the another star there

280
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
yeah so we got the another star there
 

281
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,950
yeah so we got the another star there
great

282
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
great
 

283
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,590
great
and then uh since we got them sitting in

284
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
and then uh since we got them sitting in
 

285
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,950
and then uh since we got them sitting in
here they can't walk

286
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
here they can't walk
 

287
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,430
here they can't walk
in the way there so we just reset and

288
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
in the way there so we just reset and
 

289
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,629
in the way there so we just reset and
yeah if they take a little bit of damage

290
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
yeah if they take a little bit of damage
 

291
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,590
yeah if they take a little bit of damage
you can just repair them with iron

292
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
you can just repair them with iron
 

293
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,670
you can just repair them with iron
cool so i am really excited about what

294
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
cool so i am really excited about what
 

295
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,029
cool so i am really excited about what
we're going to be doing next here i

296
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
we're going to be doing next here i
 

297
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,870
we're going to be doing next here i
asked you guys last episode

298
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
asked you guys last episode
 

299
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,790
asked you guys last episode
if we should focus on finishing projects

300
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
if we should focus on finishing projects
 

301
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,710
if we should focus on finishing projects
this episode or if we should just have

302
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
this episode or if we should just have
 

303
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,749
this episode or if we should just have
fun and

304
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
fun and
 

305
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,550
fun and
do the end reporter thing it sounds like

306
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
do the end reporter thing it sounds like
 

307
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,749
do the end reporter thing it sounds like
most of you guys want to see the end

308
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
most of you guys want to see the end
 

309
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,110
most of you guys want to see the end
reporter so that is what we're going to

310
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
reporter so that is what we're going to
 

311
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,830
reporter so that is what we're going to
be

312
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
be
 

313
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,230
be
messing around with today oh this is

314
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
messing around with today oh this is
 

315
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,830
messing around with today oh this is
going to be cool so

316
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
going to be cool so
 

317
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,629
going to be cool so
there is actually a lot of uh a lot of

318
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
there is actually a lot of uh a lot of
 

319
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,990
there is actually a lot of uh a lot of
different ways we could go around doing

320
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
different ways we could go around doing
 

321
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,110
different ways we could go around doing
this i thought we would kind of look at

322
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
this i thought we would kind of look at
 

323
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,590
this i thought we would kind of look at
a few options and then i'll pick one

324
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
a few options and then i'll pick one
 

325
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,469
a few options and then i'll pick one
and uh see see how it goes i guess so

326
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
and uh see see how it goes i guess so
 

327
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,070
and uh see see how it goes i guess so
first off

328
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
first off
 

329
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,270
first off
how are we going to load the ender

330
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
how are we going to load the ender
 

331
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,029
how are we going to load the ender
porters is a big one i kind of like the

332
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
porters is a big one i kind of like the
 

333
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,310
porters is a big one i kind of like the
idea of always loading it

334
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
idea of always loading it
 

335
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,070
idea of always loading it
while facing down like this just throw

336
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
while facing down like this just throw
 

337
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,510
while facing down like this just throw
it down

338
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
it down
 

339
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,629
it down
set in place nice and easy so to do that

340
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
set in place nice and easy so to do that
 

341
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,150
set in place nice and easy so to do that
it's looking like we're gonna need at

342
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
it's looking like we're gonna need at
 

343
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,150
it's looking like we're gonna need at
least six blocks of water

344
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
least six blocks of water
 

345
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,070
least six blocks of water
in the bubble column here so with just

346
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
in the bubble column here so with just
 

347
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,830
in the bubble column here so with just
five water blocks in the bubble column

348
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
five water blocks in the bubble column
 

349
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,270
five water blocks in the bubble column
when we throw it

350
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
when we throw it
 

351
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,870
when we throw it
we always hit the soul sand it's not

352
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
we always hit the soul sand it's not
 

353
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,469
we always hit the soul sand it's not
enough to slow it down

354
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
enough to slow it down
 

355
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,469
enough to slow it down
so we want to go with at least six but i

356
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
so we want to go with at least six but i
 

357
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,390
so we want to go with at least six but i
have noticed rarely

358
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
have noticed rarely
 

359
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,070
have noticed rarely
it will hit the soul sand still so we'll

360
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
it will hit the soul sand still so we'll
 

361
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,430
it will hit the soul sand still so we'll
go with seven

362
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
go with seven
 

363
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,909
go with seven
as a safety another really important

364
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
as a safety another really important
 

365
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,670
as a safety another really important
design question we need to answer is how

366
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
design question we need to answer is how
 

367
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,990
design question we need to answer is how
many

368
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
many
 

369
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,230
many
ender pearls do we want at each ender

370
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
ender pearls do we want at each ender
 

371
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,309
ender pearls do we want at each ender
porter because every time we use it

372
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
porter because every time we use it
 

373
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,990
porter because every time we use it
we're going to use up an ender pearl and

374
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
we're going to use up an ender pearl and
 

375
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,830
we're going to use up an ender pearl and
that we have to replace that somehow so

376
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
that we have to replace that somehow so
 

377
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,029
that we have to replace that somehow so
do we want to

378
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
do we want to
 

379
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,029
do we want to
maybe just every once in a while load 10

380
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
maybe just every once in a while load 10
 

381
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,189
maybe just every once in a while load 10
or 20 ender pearls into the ender porter

382
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
or 20 ender pearls into the ender porter
 

383
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,469
or 20 ender pearls into the ender porter
or just have

384
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
or just have
 

385
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,390
or just have
one at any given time i just want to

386
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
one at any given time i just want to
 

387
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,469
one at any given time i just want to
have one ender pearl

388
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
have one ender pearl
 

389
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,830
have one ender pearl
and every time we use it we have to

390
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
and every time we use it we have to
 

391
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,590
and every time we use it we have to
reload it i think that's the simple way

392
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
reload it i think that's the simple way
 

393
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,230
reload it i think that's the simple way
of doing it

394
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
of doing it
 

395
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,790
of doing it
and uh when we get lots of moving

396
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
and uh when we get lots of moving
 

397
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,230
and uh when we get lots of moving
objects like this in the game

398
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
objects like this in the game
 

399
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,070
objects like this in the game
it can cause lag as well so it's better

400
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
it can cause lag as well so it's better
 

401
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,909
it can cause lag as well so it's better
have to have fewer and because we're

402
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
have to have fewer and because we're
 

403
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,670
have to have fewer and because we're
gonna need to replace that ender pearl

404
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
gonna need to replace that ender pearl
 

405
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,909
gonna need to replace that ender pearl
every time we teleport it makes sense to

406
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
every time we teleport it makes sense to
 

407
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,670
every time we teleport it makes sense to
have a dropper loaded up with ender

408
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
have a dropper loaded up with ender
 

409
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,550
have a dropper loaded up with ender
pearls

410
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
pearls
 

411
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,350
pearls
that way we get one after each teleport

412
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
that way we get one after each teleport
 

413
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,870
that way we get one after each teleport
to replace the one we use

414
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
to replace the one we use
 

415
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,950
to replace the one we use
yeah we got it okay so we're at six we

416
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
yeah we got it okay so we're at six we
 

417
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,950
yeah we got it okay so we're at six we
throw it we're at five

418
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960

 

419
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,110

and we're at six now we're at five so

420
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
and we're at six now we're at five so
 

421
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,870
and we're at six now we're at five so
that way we can teleport many times and

422
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
that way we can teleport many times and
 

423
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,309
that way we can teleport many times and
not worry about running out of end of

424
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
not worry about running out of end of
 

425
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,430
not worry about running out of end of
pearls

426
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
pearls
 

427
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,390
pearls
and uh yeah i'll just be convenient now

428
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
and uh yeah i'll just be convenient now
 

429
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,909
and uh yeah i'll just be convenient now
another thing you'll notice here is when

430
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
another thing you'll notice here is when
 

431
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,870
another thing you'll notice here is when
i teleport

432
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
i teleport
 

433
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,189
i teleport
i'm not above the water that's actually

434
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
i'm not above the water that's actually
 

435
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,629
i'm not above the water that's actually
a big problem because if i want to

436
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
a big problem because if i want to
 

437
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,150
a big problem because if i want to
quickly

438
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
quickly
 

439
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,909
quickly
replace that and i throw it it's going

440
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
replace that and i throw it it's going
 

441
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,510
replace that and i throw it it's going
to hit the ground i want to be over here

442
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
to hit the ground i want to be over here
 

443
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,710
to hit the ground i want to be over here
after the teleports

444
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
after the teleports
 

445
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,390
after the teleports
so i tried out a few different ways of

446
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
so i tried out a few different ways of
 

447
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,830
so i tried out a few different ways of
controlling that for example

448
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
controlling that for example
 

449
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,990
controlling that for example
one idea was to maybe put a cobblestone

450
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
one idea was to maybe put a cobblestone
 

451
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,990
one idea was to maybe put a cobblestone
wall here and then that space between

452
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
wall here and then that space between
 

453
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,110
wall here and then that space between
the wall

454
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
the wall
 

455
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,950
the wall
and the edge of the block isn't very big

456
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
and the edge of the block isn't very big
 

457
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,230
and the edge of the block isn't very big
i thought it would align us

458
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
i thought it would align us
 

459
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,790
i thought it would align us
over the water a bit um but what

460
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
over the water a bit um but what
 

461
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,749
over the water a bit um but what
actually happens

462
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
actually happens
 

463
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,430
actually happens
is oh that time it's

464
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
is oh that time it's
 

465
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,950
is oh that time it's
grabbed us it doesn't always do that

466
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
grabbed us it doesn't always do that
 

467
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,230
grabbed us it doesn't always do that
it's uh inconsistent too

468
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
it's uh inconsistent too
 

469
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,469
it's uh inconsistent too
yeah a lot of times it does this and you

470
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
yeah a lot of times it does this and you
 

471
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,070
yeah a lot of times it does this and you
can see we're still over the land even

472
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
can see we're still over the land even
 

473
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,749
can see we're still over the land even
though there wasn't enough space because

474
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
though there wasn't enough space because
 

475
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,070
though there wasn't enough space because
it

476
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
it
 

477
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,270
it
uh teleports us into the wall

478
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
uh teleports us into the wall
 

479
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,350
uh teleports us into the wall
which uh that's no good so what i

480
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
which uh that's no good so what i
 

481
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,150
which uh that's no good so what i
actually found works pretty good is uh

482
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
actually found works pretty good is uh
 

483
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,990
actually found works pretty good is uh
if we use trapdoors actually so we just

484
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
if we use trapdoors actually so we just
 

485
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,749
if we use trapdoors actually so we just
have a trap door over here

486
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
have a trap door over here
 

487
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,029
have a trap door over here
and like a redstone torch to keep it

488
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
and like a redstone torch to keep it
 

489
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,469
and like a redstone torch to keep it
open and then we just got to control

490
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
open and then we just got to control
 

491
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,390
open and then we just got to control
that redstone torch

492
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
that redstone torch
 

493
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,390
that redstone torch
and flip it down when we want to

494
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
and flip it down when we want to
 

495
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,990
and flip it down when we want to
activate the ender pearl yeah so check

496
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
activate the ender pearl yeah so check
 

497
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,830
activate the ender pearl yeah so check
it out we load the ender pearl like so

498
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
it out we load the ender pearl like so
 

499
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,550
it out we load the ender pearl like so
and then when we

500
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
and then when we
 

501
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,749
and then when we
activate it

502
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759

 

503
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,430

we are over top the water and we can

504
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
we are over top the water and we can
 

505
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,950
we are over top the water and we can
just throw another one easy

506
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
just throw another one easy
 

507
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,430
just throw another one easy
easy to reset the other thing though is

508
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
easy to reset the other thing though is
 

509
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,950
easy to reset the other thing though is
you can see the trap doors closed for a

510
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
you can see the trap doors closed for a
 

511
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,390
you can see the trap doors closed for a
while ideally we want to be able to

512
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
while ideally we want to be able to
 

513
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,270
while ideally we want to be able to
throw it as soon as we teleport aha so a

514
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
throw it as soon as we teleport aha so a
 

515
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,350
throw it as soon as we teleport aha so a
stone button powers redstone for one

516
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
stone button powers redstone for one
 

517
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,029
stone button powers redstone for one
second we want to shorten that that's

518
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
second we want to shorten that that's
 

519
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,749
second we want to shorten that that's
too long

520
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
too long
 

521
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,829
too long
so we use a monostable circuit just the

522
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
so we use a monostable circuit just the
 

523
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,909
so we use a monostable circuit just the
sticky piston facing up

524
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
sticky piston facing up
 

525
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,990
sticky piston facing up
and then from that we set this repeater

526
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
and then from that we set this repeater
 

527
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
and then from that we set this repeater
let's try two

528
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
let's try two
 

529
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,509
let's try two
to see see how that works we're gonna

530
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
to see see how that works we're gonna
 

531
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,430
to see see how that works we're gonna
have to fine tune this a bit

532
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
have to fine tune this a bit
 

533
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,990
have to fine tune this a bit
figure out the sweet spot that might be

534
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
figure out the sweet spot that might be
 

535
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,030
figure out the sweet spot that might be
too fast

536
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040

 

537
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,710

all right that was good if it's too

538
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
all right that was good if it's too
 

539
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,710
all right that was good if it's too
quick it might not allow the ender pearl

540
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
quick it might not allow the ender pearl
 

541
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,509
quick it might not allow the ender pearl
to land on it in time

542
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
to land on it in time
 

543
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,870
to land on it in time
so let's just do a few tests

544
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
so let's just do a few tests
 

545
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,269
so let's just do a few tests
oh yeah you see it didn't trigger so we

546
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
oh yeah you see it didn't trigger so we
 

547
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,110
oh yeah you see it didn't trigger so we
gotta make this a little bit longer then

548
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
gotta make this a little bit longer then
 

549
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,870
gotta make this a little bit longer then
okay so a setting of four seems to be

550
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
okay so a setting of four seems to be
 

551
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,710
okay so a setting of four seems to be
what we want any shorter than that and

552
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
what we want any shorter than that and
 

553
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,310
what we want any shorter than that and
the ender pearl isn't guaranteed

554
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
the ender pearl isn't guaranteed
 

555
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,190
the ender pearl isn't guaranteed
to land on the trap door and any longer

556
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
to land on the trap door and any longer
 

557
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,509
to land on the trap door and any longer
than that and we're just wasting time

558
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
than that and we're just wasting time
 

559
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,150
than that and we're just wasting time
so yeah it's good easy to reset awesome

560
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
so yeah it's good easy to reset awesome
 

561
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,910
so yeah it's good easy to reset awesome
so i think we got the basic mechanism

562
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
so i think we got the basic mechanism
 

563
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,350
so i think we got the basic mechanism
figured out for triggering it

564
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
figured out for triggering it
 

565
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,509
figured out for triggering it
now let's talk about the ender porter

566
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
now let's talk about the ender porter
 

567
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,829
now let's talk about the ender porter
network because that's important as well

568
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
network because that's important as well
 

569
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,110
network because that's important as well
so the idea is we're going to have end

570
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
so the idea is we're going to have end
 

571
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,590
so the idea is we're going to have end
reporters spread throughout the world

572
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
reporters spread throughout the world
 

573
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,509
reporters spread throughout the world
lots of them so ideally we want them

574
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
lots of them so ideally we want them
 

575
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,790
lots of them so ideally we want them
pretty simple to make as well because

576
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
pretty simple to make as well because
 

577
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,829
pretty simple to make as well because
we're going to be building

578
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
we're going to be building
 

579
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,110
we're going to be building
many interporters but how do we teleport

580
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
many interporters but how do we teleport
 

581
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,870
many interporters but how do we teleport
between them and how do we set them up

582
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
between them and how do we set them up
 

583
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,470
between them and how do we set them up
is a big question like we could do a

584
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
is a big question like we could do a
 

585
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,550
is a big question like we could do a
grid style maybe every 100 blocks of

586
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
grid style maybe every 100 blocks of
 

587
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,269
grid style maybe every 100 blocks of
parts

588
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
parts
 

589
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,630
parts
pretend these are end reporters by the

590
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
pretend these are end reporters by the
 

591
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,790
pretend these are end reporters by the
way the cobblestone blocks

592
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
way the cobblestone blocks
 

593
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,030
way the cobblestone blocks
maybe we equally space them between each

594
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
maybe we equally space them between each
 

595
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,269
maybe we equally space them between each
other you know and like every 100 blocks

596
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
other you know and like every 100 blocks
 

597
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,710
other you know and like every 100 blocks
have one um but the problem is let's say

598
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
have one um but the problem is let's say
 

599
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,389
have one um but the problem is let's say
my super smelter is right over here i'm

600
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
my super smelter is right over here i'm
 

601
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,070
my super smelter is right over here i'm
gonna have to teleport to an end

602
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
gonna have to teleport to an end
 

603
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,750
gonna have to teleport to an end
reporter and then walk like 40 blocks

604
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
reporter and then walk like 40 blocks
 

605
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,990
reporter and then walk like 40 blocks
in my super smelter yeah so i don't

606
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
in my super smelter yeah so i don't
 

607
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,269
in my super smelter yeah so i don't
really like the idea of doing a grid

608
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
really like the idea of doing a grid
 

609
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,630
really like the idea of doing a grid
style network because it's not going to

610
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
style network because it's not going to
 

611
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,110
style network because it's not going to
take us

612
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
take us
 

613
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,630
take us
exactly where we want to go we want to

614
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
exactly where we want to go we want to
 

615
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,389
exactly where we want to go we want to
put the end reporters right at our

616
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
put the end reporters right at our
 

617
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,910
put the end reporters right at our
important locations like our super

618
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
important locations like our super
 

619
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,509
important locations like our super
smelter our end portal

620
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
smelter our end portal
 

621
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,389
smelter our end portal
our guardian farm etc but another

622
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
our guardian farm etc but another
 

623
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,269
our guardian farm etc but another
network design

624
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
network design
 

625
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,829
network design
is a hub style so maybe you have a bunch

626
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
is a hub style so maybe you have a bunch
 

627
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,030
is a hub style so maybe you have a bunch
of end reporters and then

628
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
of end reporters and then
 

629
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,430
of end reporters and then
one key one in the center of the mall

630
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
one key one in the center of the mall
 

631
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,230
one key one in the center of the mall
and it's like

632
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
and it's like
 

633
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
and it's like
we gotta teleport from this end reporter

634
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
we gotta teleport from this end reporter
 

635
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,910
we gotta teleport from this end reporter
to the hub and then to

636
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
to the hub and then to
 

637
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,630
to the hub and then to
the next location or from here to here

638
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
the next location or from here to here
 

639
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,670
the next location or from here to here
to there

640
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
to there
 

641
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,509
to there
um but the problem with doing a hub

642
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
um but the problem with doing a hub
 

643
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,670
um but the problem with doing a hub
style

644
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
style
 

645
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,350
style
is like if we want to go from here to

646
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
is like if we want to go from here to
 

647
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,030
is like if we want to go from here to
here we can't just do that we have to go

648
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
here we can't just do that we have to go
 

649
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,269
here we can't just do that we have to go
to the center and then there the

650
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
to the center and then there the
 

651
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,870
to the center and then there the
advantage is we could make a really

652
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
advantage is we could make a really
 

653
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,949
advantage is we could make a really
fancy hub and have it look cool

654
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
fancy hub and have it look cool
 

655
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,630
fancy hub and have it look cool
the network style we're actually going

656
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
the network style we're actually going
 

657
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,630
the network style we're actually going
to go with is more like

658
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
to go with is more like
 

659
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,550
to go with is more like
synapses in the brain i would say like

660
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
synapses in the brain i would say like
 

661
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,949
synapses in the brain i would say like
where anything within rendered distance

662
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
where anything within rendered distance
 

663
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,310
where anything within rendered distance
of an end reporter we would want to

664
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
of an end reporter we would want to
 

665
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,150
of an end reporter we would want to
connect to so maybe we could

666
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
connect to so maybe we could
 

667
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,670
connect to so maybe we could
from this one connect to that one that

668
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
from this one connect to that one that
 

669
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,350
from this one connect to that one that
one and that one while those ones might

670
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
one and that one while those ones might
 

671
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,949
one and that one while those ones might
be a bit too far away

672
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
be a bit too far away
 

673
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,389
be a bit too far away
and then when we get to this one we

674
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
and then when we get to this one we
 

675
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,150
and then when we get to this one we
might be able to connect to this one and

676
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
might be able to connect to this one and
 

677
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,829
might be able to connect to this one and
this one and this one

678
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
this one and this one
 

679
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,949
this one and this one
and each one will probably connect to

680
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
and each one will probably connect to
 

681
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,750
and each one will probably connect to
between one and four um and that way

682
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
between one and four um and that way
 

683
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,030
between one and four um and that way
there'll be several different ways of

684
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
there'll be several different ways of
 

685
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,030
there'll be several different ways of
traveling through the network

686
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
traveling through the network
 

687
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,750
traveling through the network
and should be pretty efficient one other

688
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
and should be pretty efficient one other
 

689
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,509
and should be pretty efficient one other
key thing we got to decide is how we're

690
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
key thing we got to decide is how we're
 

691
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,150
key thing we got to decide is how we're
going to handle

692
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
going to handle
 

693
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,150
going to handle
traveling long distances like if we want

694
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
traveling long distances like if we want
 

695
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,069
traveling long distances like if we want
to go a thousand blocks we can't just go

696
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
to go a thousand blocks we can't just go
 

697
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,949
to go a thousand blocks we can't just go
from here

698
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
from here
 

699
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,750
from here
to here um because the wire is going to

700
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
to here um because the wire is going to
 

701
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,430
to here um because the wire is going to
pass through unloaded chunks

702
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
pass through unloaded chunks
 

703
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,269
pass through unloaded chunks
and then stop so i have decided i don't

704
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
and then stop so i have decided i don't
 

705
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,269
and then stop so i have decided i don't
want to do any chunk loading systems i

706
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
want to do any chunk loading systems i
 

707
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:31,910
want to do any chunk loading systems i
don't think

708
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
don't think
 

709
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,350
don't think
it's going to complicate things a lot

710
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
it's going to complicate things a lot
 

711
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,269
it's going to complicate things a lot
and also they're more likely to break in

712
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
and also they're more likely to break in
 

713
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,710
and also they're more likely to break in
future patches

714
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
future patches
 

715
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,949
future patches
so we're going to stick to just what's

716
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
so we're going to stick to just what's
 

717
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,710
so we're going to stick to just what's
within render distance i think so if we

718
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
within render distance i think so if we
 

719
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,509
within render distance i think so if we
go to

720
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
go to
 

721
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,670
go to
video settings i usually play around 17

722
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
video settings i usually play around 17
 

723
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,110
video settings i usually play around 17
chunks loaded

724
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
chunks loaded
 

725
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,870
chunks loaded
i think on servers a lot of times it's

726
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
i think on servers a lot of times it's
 

727
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,829
i think on servers a lot of times it's
10 that's 160 blocks

728
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
10 that's 160 blocks
 

729
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,829
10 that's 160 blocks
radius um or 12 which is 192. so that's

730
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
radius um or 12 which is 192. so that's
 

731
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,389
radius um or 12 which is 192. so that's
a pretty good distance still um

732
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
a pretty good distance still um
 

733
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,389
a pretty good distance still um
so we'll kind of plan with that in mind

734
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
so we'll kind of plan with that in mind
 

735
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,389
so we'll kind of plan with that in mind
like between each of the stations

736
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
like between each of the stations
 

737
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,230
like between each of the stations
and then there's one more complicated

738
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
and then there's one more complicated
 

739
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,670
and then there's one more complicated
thing to figure out how do we handle

740
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
thing to figure out how do we handle
 

741
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,110
thing to figure out how do we handle
going from here to here because we're

742
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
going from here to here because we're
 

743
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,310
going from here to here because we're
going to have to pass through these

744
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
going to have to pass through these
 

745
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,590
going to have to pass through these
other stations

746
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
other stations
 

747
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,150
other stations
do we somehow tell them in advance that

748
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
do we somehow tell them in advance that
 

749
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,230
do we somehow tell them in advance that
like when we get here we want to go here

750
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
like when we get here we want to go here
 

751
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,389
like when we get here we want to go here
and when we get here we want to go here

752
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
and when we get here we want to go here
 

753
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,670
and when we get here we want to go here
or do we

754
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
or do we
 

755
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,110
or do we
do we go from here to here and then

756
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
do we go from here to here and then
 

757
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,030
do we go from here to here and then
manually say i want to go here

758
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
manually say i want to go here
 

759
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,629
manually say i want to go here
and then manually say i want to go here

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
and then manually say i want to go here
 

761
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,990
and then manually say i want to go here
that'll take a little bit longer

762
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
that'll take a little bit longer
 

763
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,030
that'll take a little bit longer
probably

764
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
probably
 

765
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,350
probably
but it'll be much simpler ideally we

766
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
but it'll be much simpler ideally we
 

767
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,509
but it'll be much simpler ideally we
want to be able to send the signals

768
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
want to be able to send the signals
 

769
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,990
want to be able to send the signals
pretty quickly with standard redstone

770
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
pretty quickly with standard redstone
 

771
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,829
pretty quickly with standard redstone
you can go 15 blocks and then you need a

772
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
you can go 15 blocks and then you need a
 

773
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,710
you can go 15 blocks and then you need a
repeater

774
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
repeater
 

775
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,230
repeater
so this adds a tenth of a second delay

776
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
so this adds a tenth of a second delay
 

777
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,629
so this adds a tenth of a second delay
between each of these things so if we

778
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
between each of these things so if we
 

779
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,670
between each of these things so if we
want to go

780
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
want to go
 

781
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,430
want to go
160 blocks that's one second of delay

782
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
160 blocks that's one second of delay
 

783
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,750
160 blocks that's one second of delay
and if we go a thousand and 600 blocks

784
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
and if we go a thousand and 600 blocks
 

785
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,590
and if we go a thousand and 600 blocks
that's 10 seconds so it does start to

786
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
that's 10 seconds so it does start to
 

787
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,470
that's 10 seconds so it does start to
add up

788
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
add up
 

789
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,790
add up
over long distances and we'll probably

790
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
over long distances and we'll probably
 

791
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,310
over long distances and we'll probably
be putting down quite a bit of wire

792
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
be putting down quite a bit of wire
 

793
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,069
be putting down quite a bit of wire
between our ender porters to get them

794
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
between our ender porters to get them
 

795
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,350
between our ender porters to get them
connected together

796
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
connected together
 

797
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,269
connected together
and that got me thinking maybe i should

798
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
and that got me thinking maybe i should
 

799
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,470
and that got me thinking maybe i should
try to figure out something

800
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
try to figure out something
 

801
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,110
try to figure out something
better or something faster and kind of

802
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
better or something faster and kind of
 

803
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,069
better or something faster and kind of
got to thinking

804
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
got to thinking
 

805
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,389
got to thinking
tripwires might be the answer so a

806
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
tripwires might be the answer so a
 

807
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,269
tripwires might be the answer so a
tripwire

808
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
tripwire
 

809
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,470
tripwire
can go 40 blocks the string

810
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
can go 40 blocks the string
 

811
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,550
can go 40 blocks the string
plus there's two blocks for the tripwire

812
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
plus there's two blocks for the tripwire
 

813
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,150
plus there's two blocks for the tripwire
hooks themselves and then

814
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
hooks themselves and then
 

815
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,910
hooks themselves and then
another two blocks for the blocks they

816
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
another two blocks for the blocks they
 

817
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,350
another two blocks for the blocks they
connect to so it's like

818
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
connect to so it's like
 

819
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,949
connect to so it's like
44 blocks of instant wire and then

820
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
44 blocks of instant wire and then
 

821
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,790
44 blocks of instant wire and then
you can also attach redstone to that

822
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
you can also attach redstone to that
 

823
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,110
you can also attach redstone to that
after so we'll probably do a mix

824
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
after so we'll probably do a mix
 

825
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,470
after so we'll probably do a mix
that's like 60 blocks of instant wire

826
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
that's like 60 blocks of instant wire
 

827
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,550
that's like 60 blocks of instant wire
and then i also figured out a way to

828
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
and then i also figured out a way to
 

829
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,750
and then i also figured out a way to
extend it further

830
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
extend it further
 

831
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,590
extend it further
so to connect the redstone up to another

832
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
so to connect the redstone up to another
 

833
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,110
so to connect the redstone up to another
set of trip wires

834
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
set of trip wires
 

835
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,030
set of trip wires
and then we go redstone tripwires

836
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
and then we go redstone tripwires
 

837
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,550
and then we go redstone tripwires
redstone tripwires we can go as far as

838
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
redstone tripwires we can go as far as
 

839
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,230
redstone tripwires we can go as far as
we want basically

840
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
we want basically
 

841
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,629
we want basically
um we can't just activate the string

842
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
um we can't just activate the string
 

843
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,710
um we can't just activate the string
with redstone we need to

844
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
with redstone we need to
 

845
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,550
with redstone we need to
push an entity into it so i was thinking

846
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
push an entity into it so i was thinking
 

847
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,710
push an entity into it so i was thinking
we put a minecart in a dispenser

848
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
we put a minecart in a dispenser
 

849
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,949
we put a minecart in a dispenser
and then on a slant right below the

850
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
and then on a slant right below the
 

851
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,069
and then on a slant right below the
string

852
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
string
 

853
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,750
string
and that way right when it spawns it'll

854
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
and that way right when it spawns it'll
 

855
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,189
and that way right when it spawns it'll
be in the string and

856
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
be in the string and
 

857
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,030
be in the string and
keep it going so it should be close to

858
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
keep it going so it should be close to
 

859
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,310
keep it going so it should be close to
instant if not

860
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
instant if not
 

861
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,150
instant if not
instant and

862
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160

 

863
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,230

yeah just like that we'll have to run

864
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
yeah just like that we'll have to run
 

865
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,990
yeah just like that we'll have to run
the minecart into a cactus or something

866
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
the minecart into a cactus or something
 

867
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,550
the minecart into a cactus or something
though to

868
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
though to
 

869
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,110
though to
get it back in here after that so so we

870
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
get it back in here after that so so we
 

871
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,710
get it back in here after that so so we
want it self-contained

872
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
want it self-contained
 

873
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,389
want it self-contained
um but yeah let's just do a quick little

874
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
um but yeah let's just do a quick little
 

875
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,069
um but yeah let's just do a quick little
test here kind of get an idea of the

876
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
test here kind of get an idea of the
 

877
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,189
test here kind of get an idea of the
speed

878
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
speed
 

879
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,310
speed
so just uh again this can run another 40

880
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
so just uh again this can run another 40
 

881
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,910
so just uh again this can run another 40
blocks i just have a short distance

882
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
blocks i just have a short distance
 

883
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,710
blocks i just have a short distance
there

884
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
there
 

885
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,350
there
just because i don't have space but yeah

886
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
just because i don't have space but yeah
 

887
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,269
just because i don't have space but yeah
we can go all the way down here and

888
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
we can go all the way down here and
 

889
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,590
we can go all the way down here and
basically get it instantly triggered

890
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600

 

891
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,910

like so that's pretty cool all right

892
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
like so that's pretty cool all right
 

893
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,509
like so that's pretty cool all right
well i could talk about it all day but

894
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
well i could talk about it all day but
 

895
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,189
well i could talk about it all day but
talk is cheap right we gotta actually

896
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
talk is cheap right we gotta actually
 

897
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:33,829
talk is cheap right we gotta actually
get to

898
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
get to
 

899
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,430
get to
building the end reporters now but i

900
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
building the end reporters now but i
 

901
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,870
building the end reporters now but i
think we covered the concepts pretty

902
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
think we covered the concepts pretty
 

903
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,430
think we covered the concepts pretty
good there

904
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
good there
 

905
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,350
good there
and uh some different ways we could do

906
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
and uh some different ways we could do
 

907
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,509
and uh some different ways we could do
it uh i've decided

908
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
it uh i've decided
 

909
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,150
it uh i've decided
roughly how i want to do ours uh-huh so

910
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
roughly how i want to do ours uh-huh so
 

911
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,829
roughly how i want to do ours uh-huh so
we got two ender porters built at the

912
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
we got two ender porters built at the
 

913
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,590
we got two ender porters built at the
moment one of them is at our guardian

914
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
moment one of them is at our guardian
 

915
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,110
moment one of them is at our guardian
farm and the other one is at

916
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
farm and the other one is at
 

917
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,189
farm and the other one is at
our end portal and we can go back and

918
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
our end portal and we can go back and
 

919
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,189
our end portal and we can go back and
forth between them to test this out and

920
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
forth between them to test this out and
 

921
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:53,670
forth between them to test this out and
give it

922
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
give it
 

923
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,550
give it
uh a trial get a feel for how it's gonna

924
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
uh a trial get a feel for how it's gonna
 

925
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,430
uh a trial get a feel for how it's gonna
work

926
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
work
 

927
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,350
work
um and i discovered a few interesting

928
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
um and i discovered a few interesting
 

929
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,710
um and i discovered a few interesting
things while building this but i guess

930
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
things while building this but i guess
 

931
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,790
things while building this but i guess
first let's just go for a test run here

932
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
first let's just go for a test run here
 

933
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,750
first let's just go for a test run here
so

934
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
so
 

935
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,189
so
the way i'm doing it at the moment i got

936
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
the way i'm doing it at the moment i got
 

937
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,949
the way i'm doing it at the moment i got
buttons on the ground

938
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
buttons on the ground
 

939
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,470
buttons on the ground
this one's not hooked up to anything

940
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
this one's not hooked up to anything
 

941
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,990
this one's not hooked up to anything
it's just this one it's just the end

942
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
it's just this one it's just the end
 

943
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,509
it's just this one it's just the end
portal

944
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
portal
 

945
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,870
portal
there we go teleport review sets by

946
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
there we go teleport review sets by
 

947
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,990
there we go teleport review sets by
throwing another

948
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
throwing another
 

949
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,790
throwing another
ender pearl and it's good to go so we

950
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
ender pearl and it's good to go so we
 

951
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,310
ender pearl and it's good to go so we
can go through then portal or if we want

952
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
can go through then portal or if we want
 

953
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,550
can go through then portal or if we want
to go back we got another button

954
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
to go back we got another button
 

955
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,150
to go back we got another button
i haven't found a proper position for it

956
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
i haven't found a proper position for it
 

957
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,430
i haven't found a proper position for it
yet but it'll take us back to the

958
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
yet but it'll take us back to the
 

959
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,550
yet but it'll take us back to the
guardian farm

960
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
guardian farm
 

961
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,949
guardian farm
so our end portal is at about minus 450

962
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
so our end portal is at about minus 450
 

963
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,550
so our end portal is at about minus 450
x and 850

964
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
x and 850
 

965
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,030
x and 850
zed and i'll try to give you an idea of

966
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
zed and i'll try to give you an idea of
 

967
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,430
zed and i'll try to give you an idea of
how far we're actually teleporting

968
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
how far we're actually teleporting
 

969
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,910
how far we're actually teleporting
go up the ladder and we're going

970
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
go up the ladder and we're going
 

971
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,870
go up the ladder and we're going
diagonal

972
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
diagonal
 

973
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,470
diagonal
so in total it's about 370 blocks of

974
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
so in total it's about 370 blocks of
 

975
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,269
so in total it's about 370 blocks of
wiring i ran back and forth down there

976
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
wiring i ran back and forth down there
 

977
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,509
wiring i ran back and forth down there
to get to our guardian farm all the way

978
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
to get to our guardian farm all the way
 

979
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,470
to get to our guardian farm all the way
over here

980
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480

 

981
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,069

here we go so this is at negative 240

982
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
here we go so this is at negative 240
 

983
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,189
here we go so this is at negative 240
and about 710 or so

984
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
and about 710 or so
 

985
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,269
and about 710 or so
and yeah one one of the big problems i

986
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
and yeah one one of the big problems i
 

987
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,430
and yeah one one of the big problems i
discovered while building this is slimes

988
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
discovered while building this is slimes
 

989
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,310
discovered while building this is slimes
slimes are actually a big issue because

990
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
slimes are actually a big issue because
 

991
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,870
slimes are actually a big issue because
we're using tripwires

992
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
we're using tripwires
 

993
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,590
we're using tripwires
and uh yeah they can spawn and then they

994
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
and uh yeah they can spawn and then they
 

995
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,030
and uh yeah they can spawn and then they
they jump in the tripwires and

996
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
they jump in the tripwires and
 

997
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,470
they jump in the tripwires and
activate the ender pearls when you don't

998
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
activate the ender pearls when you don't
 

999
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,470
activate the ender pearls when you don't
want them to so

1000
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
want them to so
 

1001
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,030
want them to so
i had to slab everything that was

1002
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
i had to slab everything that was
 

1003
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,990
i had to slab everything that was
spawnable

1004
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
spawnable
 

1005
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,829
spawnable
to stop the slimes from spawning it's

1006
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
to stop the slimes from spawning it's
 

1007
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,829
to stop the slimes from spawning it's
not enough just to torch it up and light

1008
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
not enough just to torch it up and light
 

1009
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,310
not enough just to torch it up and light
it up

1010
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
it up
 

1011
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,470
it up
to stop hostile mobs you gotta stop the

1012
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
to stop hostile mobs you gotta stop the
 

1013
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,310
to stop hostile mobs you gotta stop the
slimes because

1014
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
slimes because
 

1015
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,829
slimes because
you're pretty much guaranteed to run

1016
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
you're pretty much guaranteed to run
 

1017
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,189
you're pretty much guaranteed to run
through a slime chunk if you're going

1018
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
through a slime chunk if you're going
 

1019
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,790
through a slime chunk if you're going
underground like this

1020
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
underground like this
 

1021
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,350
underground like this
so we got two wires one of them to go

1022
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
so we got two wires one of them to go
 

1023
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,230
so we got two wires one of them to go
one way one to go the other way and then

1024
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
one way one to go the other way and then
 

1025
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,670
one way one to go the other way and then
we got a space in the middle so we can

1026
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
we got a space in the middle so we can
 

1027
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,949
we got a space in the middle so we can
walk down here without

1028
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
walk down here without
 

1029
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,670
walk down here without
activating them and you can see i did

1030
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
activating them and you can see i did
 

1031
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,269
activating them and you can see i did
figure out how i was going to do the

1032
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
figure out how i was going to do the
 

1033
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,790
figure out how i was going to do the
minecart thing

1034
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
minecart thing
 

1035
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,470
minecart thing
so we got the minecart it goes out goes

1036
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
so we got the minecart it goes out goes
 

1037
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,470
so we got the minecart it goes out goes
around rams into a cactus and then the

1038
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
around rams into a cactus and then the
 

1039
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,990
around rams into a cactus and then the
hopper picks it up and puts it back in

1040
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
hopper picks it up and puts it back in
 

1041
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,749
hopper picks it up and puts it back in
there so it seems to

1042
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
there so it seems to
 

1043
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,910
there so it seems to
work pretty fine actually and then

1044
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
work pretty fine actually and then
 

1045
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,069
work pretty fine actually and then
there's also our mortal enemy to worry

1046
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
there's also our mortal enemy to worry
 

1047
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,269
there's also our mortal enemy to worry
about

1048
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279

 

1049
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,590

you hear that the bats if we have a

1050
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
you hear that the bats if we have a
 

1051
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,590
you hear that the bats if we have a
location where bats can spawn

1052
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
location where bats can spawn
 

1053
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,429
location where bats can spawn
like a dark spot then they can fly into

1054
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
like a dark spot then they can fly into
 

1055
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,750
like a dark spot then they can fly into
our tripwires as well so we got a

1056
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
our tripwires as well so we got a
 

1057
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,069
our tripwires as well so we got a
lot of things to worry about oh and by

1058
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
lot of things to worry about oh and by
 

1059
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,829
lot of things to worry about oh and by
the way i think i came up with a better

1060
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
the way i think i came up with a better
 

1061
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,829
the way i think i came up with a better
way of activating the trap door than

1062
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
way of activating the trap door than
 

1063
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,189
way of activating the trap door than
what we had before

1064
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
what we had before
 

1065
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,870
what we had before
so the other way we were doing it we had

1066
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
so the other way we were doing it we had
 

1067
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,710
so the other way we were doing it we had
like four ticks of

1068
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
like four ticks of
 

1069
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,390
like four ticks of
on the repeater and then it ran through

1070
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
on the repeater and then it ran through
 

1071
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,990
on the repeater and then it ran through
the torch and then to the trap door

1072
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
the torch and then to the trap door
 

1073
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,150
the torch and then to the trap door
that's like .6 seconds

1074
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
that's like .6 seconds
 

1075
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,990
that's like .6 seconds
um the new way we're doing it it comes

1076
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
um the new way we're doing it it comes
 

1077
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,590
um the new way we're doing it it comes
up here

1078
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
up here
 

1079
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,909
up here
there's a sticky piston there um we just

1080
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
there's a sticky piston there um we just
 

1081
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,750
there's a sticky piston there um we just
have one tick on the repeater and then

1082
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
have one tick on the repeater and then
 

1083
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,909
have one tick on the repeater and then
the redstone torch so that's 0.3 seconds

1084
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
the redstone torch so that's 0.3 seconds
 

1085
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,590
the redstone torch so that's 0.3 seconds
it's like half the speed

1086
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
it's like half the speed
 

1087
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,350
it's like half the speed
and then after it goes through here it

1088
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
and then after it goes through here it
 

1089
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,350
and then after it goes through here it
cuts off the redstone signal

1090
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
cuts off the redstone signal
 

1091
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,830
cuts off the redstone signal
this extends and then this can't power

1092
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
this extends and then this can't power
 

1093
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,029
this extends and then this can't power
this anymore

1094
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
this anymore
 

1095
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,270
this anymore
and that just activates us a little bit

1096
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
and that just activates us a little bit
 

1097
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,230
and that just activates us a little bit
quicker and

1098
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
quicker and
 

1099
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,390
quicker and
actually with the wacky trip wires and

1100
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
actually with the wacky trip wires and
 

1101
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,070
actually with the wacky trip wires and
minecart thing we got going on there

1102
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
minecart thing we got going on there
 

1103
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,830
minecart thing we got going on there
it is pretty much instant as far as i

1104
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
it is pretty much instant as far as i
 

1105
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,909
it is pretty much instant as far as i
can tell and that saves us about a

1106
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
can tell and that saves us about a
 

1107
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,470
can tell and that saves us about a
second or two every time we teleport

1108
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
second or two every time we teleport
 

1109
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,070
second or two every time we teleport
which is important because like if it's

1110
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
which is important because like if it's
 

1111
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,830
which is important because like if it's
not fast and convenient and wonderful

1112
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
not fast and convenient and wonderful
 

1113
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,990
not fast and convenient and wonderful
we're just going to use rockets

1114
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
we're just going to use rockets
 

1115
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,909
we're just going to use rockets
and this will be pointless right so we

1116
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
and this will be pointless right so we
 

1117
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,150
and this will be pointless right so we
wanna we want it to be good

1118
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
wanna we want it to be good
 

1119
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,590
wanna we want it to be good
and as far as i can tell it is pretty

1120
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
and as far as i can tell it is pretty
 

1121
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,590
and as far as i can tell it is pretty
good right now i'm happy with that

1122
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
good right now i'm happy with that
 

1123
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,350
good right now i'm happy with that
all right so good stuff so i thought

1124
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
all right so good stuff so i thought
 

1125
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,630
all right so good stuff so i thought
we'd take a break from that

1126
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
we'd take a break from that
 

1127
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,549
we'd take a break from that
and do a bit of building today after all

1128
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
and do a bit of building today after all
 

1129
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,669
and do a bit of building today after all
so

1130
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
so
 

1131
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,510
so
i've been in the area here and i stopped

1132
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
i've been in the area here and i stopped
 

1133
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,909
i've been in the area here and i stopped
by the blaze farm is like oh

1134
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
by the blaze farm is like oh
 

1135
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,909
by the blaze farm is like oh
maybe we should try uh get that done

1136
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
maybe we should try uh get that done
 

1137
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,830
maybe we should try uh get that done
today actually so it's very close to

1138
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
today actually so it's very close to
 

1139
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,750
today actually so it's very close to
done we got the style all figured out we

1140
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
done we got the style all figured out we
 

1141
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,070
done we got the style all figured out we
got

1142
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
got
 

1143
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,750
got
the important stuff all put together

1144
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
the important stuff all put together
 

1145
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,990
the important stuff all put together
here and i do like the look of this

1146
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
here and i do like the look of this
 

1147
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,510
here and i do like the look of this
place actually

1148
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
place actually
 

1149
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,029
place actually
i know a lot of people don't like uh

1150
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
i know a lot of people don't like uh
 

1151
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,950
i know a lot of people don't like uh
purple and sandstone and stuff but

1152

this was all netherrack before we had to

1300
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
this was all netherrack before we had to
 

1301
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,710
this was all netherrack before we had to
do something with this

1302
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
do something with this
 

1303
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,430
do something with this
and um you can see a little bit of

1304

and um you can see a little bit of
 

1305
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,029
and um you can see a little bit of
another act back here but only from this

1306
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
another act back here but only from this

let's see this was all netherrack all

1312
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
let's see this was all netherrack all
 

1313
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,190
let's see this was all netherrack all
over here

1314
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
over here
 

1315

this was actually generated before

1572
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
this was actually generated before
 

1573
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,350

1622
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
uh like 80 or 90 of you i'd say don't
 

1623

want one
 

1625
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,830
want one
i think last time i asked that it was

1626
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:53,840
i think last time i asked that it was
 

1627
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,750
i think last time i asked that it was
more like 50 50.

1628
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
more like 50 50.
 

1629
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,990
more like 50 50.
so it's good to see it's skewed more

1630
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
so it's good to see it's skewed more
 

1631
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,830
so it's good to see it's skewed more
more the way i want it to be

1632
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
more the way i want it to be
 

1633
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,070
more the way i want it to be
uh but yeah i think that's gonna do it

1634
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
uh but yeah i think that's gonna do it
 

1635
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,669
uh but yeah i think that's gonna do it
for this episode

1636
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
