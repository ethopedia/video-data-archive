location i showed you last episode will
be where my main storage room is i think

68
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
be where my main storage room is i think
 

69
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,109
be where my main storage room is i think
but it would be good to have like some

70
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
but it would be good to have like some
 

71
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,429
but it would be good to have like some
supplies over here too since it's

72
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
supplies over here too since it's
 

73
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,030
supplies over here too since it's
a few hundred blocks away that other

74
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
a few hundred blocks away that other
 

75
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,429
a few hundred blocks away that other
place

76
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439

 

77
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,030

i still haven't moved the mushroom farm
but i do have the path figured out here

80
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
but i do have the path figured out here
 

81
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,109
but i do have the path figured out here
now

82
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
now
 

83
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,429
now
and what else i added trapdoors on the

84
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
and what else i added trapdoors on the
 

85
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,510
and what else i added trapdoors on the
clothes stone for our spider

86
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
clothes stone for our spider
 

87
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,870
clothes stone for our spider
staircase here i have

88
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
staircase here i have
 

89
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,109
staircase here i have
added this thing this is an infinite

90
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
added this thing this is an infinite
 

91
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,550
added this thing this is an infinite
water spring

92
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
water spring
 

93
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,109
water spring
so there's water on the left and the

94
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
so there's water on the left and the
 

95
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,709
so there's water on the left and the
right and when they join in the middle

96
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
right and when they join in the middle
 

97
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,030
right and when they join in the middle
they create water blocks

98
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040

 

99
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,070

which is good it's good it's good to

100
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
which is good it's good it's good to
 

101
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,910
which is good it's good it's good to
always have a few infinite water springs

102
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
always have a few infinite water springs
 

103
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,470
always have a few infinite water springs
around

104
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
around
 

105
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,190
around
crafting benches are nice to have around

106
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200

one will be moved

112
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
one will be moved
 

113
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,470
one will be moved
uh i'll probably change

114
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
uh i'll probably change
 

115
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,710
uh i'll probably change
the block type with this thing though i

116
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
the block type with this thing though i
 

117
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,070
the block type with this thing though i
think i should have went with wooden

118
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
think i should have went with wooden
 

119
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,589
think i should have went with wooden
planks

120
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
planks
 

121
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,350
planks
uh it has a nice low profile to it

122
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
uh it has a nice low profile to it
 

123
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,110
uh it has a nice low profile to it
because i used half slabs on top and

124
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
because i used half slabs on top and
 

125
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,869
because i used half slabs on top and
stairs in places so

126
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
stairs in places so
 

127
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,309
stairs in places so
that's kind of cool but

128
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
that's kind of cool but
 

129
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,670
that's kind of cool but
yeah i'll probably do a wooden texture

130
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
yeah i'll probably do a wooden texture
 

131
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,710
yeah i'll probably do a wooden texture
to it just to make it a little warmer

132
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
to it just to make it a little warmer
 

133
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,589
to it just to make it a little warmer

so they connect nicely to our stairs

142
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
so they connect nicely to our stairs
 

143
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,949
so they connect nicely to our stairs
as well and we now have two sets of

144
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
as well and we now have two sets of
 

145
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,589
as well and we now have two sets of
stairs so

146
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
stairs so
 

147
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,830
stairs so
exact copies of each other i have stuck

148
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
exact copies of each other i have stuck
 

149
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,149
exact copies of each other i have stuck
with the lighter wood

150
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
with the lighter wood
 

151
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,470
with the lighter wood
again it was like a 50 50 thing with

152
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
again it was like a 50 50 thing with
 

153
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,390
again it was like a 50 50 thing with
people

154
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
people
 

155
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,270
people
um choosing between the dark wood and

156
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
um choosing between the dark wood and
 

157
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,190
um choosing between the dark wood and
the light wood here

158
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
the light wood here
 

159
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,990
the light wood here
i really i don't know what type which

160
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
i really i don't know what type which
 

161
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,910
i really i don't know what type which
one i prefer

162
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920

 

163
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,589

i'm so bad at deciding things like that

164
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
i'm so bad at deciding things like that
 

165
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,630
i'm so bad at deciding things like that
let's see

166
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
let's see
 

167
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,149
let's see
i don't know the lighter wood blends in

168
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
i don't know the lighter wood blends in
 

169
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,390
i don't know the lighter wood blends in
better

170
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
better
 

171
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,550
better
and the darker wood has a high contrast

oh there we go okay maybe i didn't give
 

315
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,390
oh there we go okay maybe i didn't give
signs long enough

316
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
signs long enough
 

317
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,070
signs long enough
yeah i guess it's just certain blocks it

318
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
yeah i guess it's just certain blocks it
 

319
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,990

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
we should probably try ladders too
 

325
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,309

327
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,270
does take a long time to get going there

like wood paneling or something you you
like it at first it's the greatest thing

372
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
like it at first it's the greatest thing
 

373
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,510
like it at first it's the greatest thing
but after you see it for a while it

374
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
but after you see it for a while it
 

375
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,670
but after you see it for a while it
really uh

376
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
really uh
 

377
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,909
really uh
you start to hate it and i i started to

378
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
you start to hate it and i i started to
 

379
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,670
you start to hate it and i i started to
hate it after a while so

380
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
hate it after a while so
 

381
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,710
hate it after a while so
back to the stone stairs and i

382
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
back to the stone stairs and i
 

383
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,070
back to the stone stairs and i
another reason i wanted to change it

384
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
another reason i wanted to change it
 

385
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,550
another reason i wanted to change it
because over here

386
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
because over here
 

387
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,469
because over here
everything the important stuff becomes

388
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
everything the important stuff becomes
 

389
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,950
everything the important stuff becomes
four blocks tall

390
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
four blocks tall
 

391
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,150
four blocks tall
while over here the wood panel

392
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
while over here the wood panel
 

393
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,749
while over here the wood panel
or the wooden stripe kind of worked

394
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
or the wooden stripe kind of worked
 

395
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,589
or the wooden stripe kind of worked
because everything important was only

396
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
because everything important was only
 

397
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,709
because everything important was only
three blocks tall

398
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
three blocks tall
 

399
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,029
three blocks tall
so we had one extra block to do

400
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
so we had one extra block to do
 

401
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,110
so we had one extra block to do
something with

402
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
something with
 

403
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,469
something with
um so it's this uh better this way i

404
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
um so it's this uh better this way i
 

405
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,350
um so it's this uh better this way i
think

406
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
think
 

407
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,790
think
and i started putting some of this

408
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
and i started putting some of this
 

409
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,949
and i started putting some of this
trimming around the top but i didn't do

410
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
trimming around the top but i didn't do
 

411
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,550
trimming around the top but i didn't do
over the door yet because i

412
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
over the door yet because i
 

413
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,509
over the door yet because i
might try uh raise this up one block

414
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
might try uh raise this up one block
 

415
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,470
might try uh raise this up one block
when i

416
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
when i
 

417
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,310
when i
do some adjustments here yet um

418
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
do some adjustments here yet um
 

419
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,030
do some adjustments here yet um

for the door i think that has a nice
look to it

426
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
look to it
 

427
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,590
look to it
need to get it more lighting around

428
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
need to get it more lighting around
 

429
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,350
need to get it more lighting around
that's why i have this here

430
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
that's why i have this here
 

431
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,710
that's why i have this here
that little stone

432
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720

 

433
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,150

to figure
 

439
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,470
to figure
something some other alternate

440
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
something some other alternate
 

441
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,110
something some other alternate
way i can sneak lighting in over on this

442
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
way i can sneak lighting in over on this
 

443
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,870
way i can sneak lighting in over on this
side yet

444
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
side yet
 

445
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,550
side yet
but overall we pretty much have no

446
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560

that's what i was aiming for i do have

452
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
that's what i was aiming for i do have
 

453
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,110
that's what i was aiming for i do have
one problem

454
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
one problem
 

455
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,150
one problem
yet with this with these trap doors

456
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
yet with this with these trap doors
 

457
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,070
yet with this with these trap doors
uh they open when i open this door so i

458
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
uh they open when i open this door so i
 

459
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,829
uh they open when i open this door so i
have to move some wiring around so that

460
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
have to move some wiring around so that
 

461
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,030
have to move some wiring around so that
doesn't uh

462
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
doesn't uh
 

463
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,150
doesn't uh
mess up and i'm not exactly sure why

464
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
mess up and i'm not exactly sure why
 

465
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,110
mess up and i'm not exactly sure why
it's working because i

466
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
it's working because i
 

467
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,350
it's working because i
kind of thought glowstone doesn't uh

468
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
kind of thought glowstone doesn't uh
 

469
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,509
kind of thought glowstone doesn't uh
transmits uh redstone signals i should

470
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
transmits uh redstone signals i should
 

471
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,509
transmits uh redstone signals i should
try that

472
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
try that
 

473
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,750
try that
yes glowstone stuff's really confusing

474
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
yes glowstone stuff's really confusing
 

475
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,070
yes glowstone stuff's really confusing
me because

476
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
me because
 

477
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,030
me because
you still can't put redstone on it

478
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040

 

479
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,550

it's like you couldn't do stuff to it

480
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
it's like you couldn't do stuff to it
 

481
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,069
it's like you couldn't do stuff to it
then you could and then you couldn't and

482
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
then you could and then you couldn't and
 

483
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:06,870
then you could and then you couldn't and
then

484
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
then
 

485
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,990
then
just keep switching back and forth so we

486
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
just keep switching back and forth so we
 

487
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,590
just keep switching back and forth so we
still have that update glitch with the

488
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
still have that update glitch with the
 

489
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,030
still have that update glitch with the
trapdoor

490
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040

 

491
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,190

yeah doesn't transmit power i guess this

492
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
yeah doesn't transmit power i guess this
 

493
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,190
yeah doesn't transmit power i guess this
is the update glitch that's making it

494
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
is the update glitch that's making it
 

495
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,069
is the update glitch that's making it
open

496
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
open
 

497
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,790
open
when i open my potion door so maybe i

498
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
when i open my potion door so maybe i
 

499
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,990
when i open my potion door so maybe i
don't have to worry about it and it'll

500
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
don't have to worry about it and it'll
 

501
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,550
don't have to worry about it and it'll
be fixed

502
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
be fixed
 

503
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,829
be fixed

and i got some stuff in the nether but

680
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
and i got some stuff in the nether but
 

681
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,189
and i got some stuff in the nether but
not a whole lot

682
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
not a whole lot
 

683
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,629
not a whole lot
and my statistics are all messed up

684
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
and my statistics are all messed up
 

685
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,790
and my statistics are all messed up
unfortunately because i keep switching

686
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
unfortunately because i keep switching
 

687
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,150
unfortunately because i keep switching
my version number like when we were

688
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
my version number like when we were
 

689
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,910
my version number like when we were
doing race for wall i had to switch to

690
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
doing race for wall i had to switch to
 

691
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,350
doing race for wall i had to switch to
1.0

692
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
1.0
 

693
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,550
1.0
when i play legendary i switched to 1.73

694
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
when i play legendary i switched to 1.73
 

695
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,350
when i play legendary i switched to 1.73
and the way i do that my statistics

696
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
and the way i do that my statistics
 

697
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,550
and the way i do that my statistics
always get messed up when i

698
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
always get messed up when i
 

699
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,829
always get messed up when i
when i switch so

700
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
when i switch so
 

701
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,550
when i switch so
that's everything guys that's the

702
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
that's everything guys that's the
 

703
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,509
that's everything guys that's the
updates

704
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519

 

705
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,590

i'm thinking for today's project we're

706
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
i'm thinking for today's project we're
 

707
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,990
i'm thinking for today's project we're
going to build a piston elevator

708
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
going to build a piston elevator
 

709
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,189
going to build a piston elevator
right here to go to the surface

710
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
right here to go to the surface
 

711
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,629
right here to go to the surface
because uh something i wanted for a long

712
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
because uh something i wanted for a long
 

713
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,470
because uh something i wanted for a long
time if i ever have to go

714
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
time if i ever have to go
 

715
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,990
time if i ever have to go
up to the surface i need to uh

716
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
up to the surface i need to uh
 

717
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,470
up to the surface i need to uh
like go over here and parkour my way

718
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
like go over here and parkour my way
 

719
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,829
like go over here and parkour my way
around this garbage

720
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
around this garbage
 

721
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,350
around this garbage
climb up my broken ladders and it's just

722
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
climb up my broken ladders and it's just
 

723
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,750
climb up my broken ladders and it's just
it takes a good minute every time it's a

724
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
it takes a good minute every time it's a
 

725
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,790
it takes a good minute every time it's a
real pain

726
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
real pain
 

727
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,829
real pain
so i want to quicker way up

728
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
so i want to quicker way up
 

729
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,350
so i want to quicker way up
it's easy to make a way down but getting

730
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
it's easy to make a way down but getting
 

731
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,790
it's easy to make a way down but getting
up is the tough part

732
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800

 

733
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,069

another one coming so

734
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
another one coming so
 

735
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,430
another one coming so
yeah we'll build it right at the end

736
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
yeah we'll build it right at the end
 

737
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,069
yeah we'll build it right at the end
here it's only

738
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
here it's only
 

739
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,550
here it's only
it's only gonna be like 15 to 20 blocks

740
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
it's only gonna be like 15 to 20 blocks
 

741
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,910
it's only gonna be like 15 to 20 blocks
to the surface i think

742
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920

 

743
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,030

medium all right

744
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
medium all right
 

745
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,069
medium all right
and i think i'll build it out of uh

746
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
and i think i'll build it out of uh
 

747
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,350
and i think i'll build it out of uh
wood blocks probably so it's been a

748
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
wood blocks probably so it's been a
 

749
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,829
wood blocks probably so it's been a
while

750
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
while
 

751
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,269
while
since i last made one of these but i

752
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
since i last made one of these but i
 

753
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,389
since i last made one of these but i
think what you do is you go in one block

754
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
think what you do is you go in one block
 

755
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,590
think what you do is you go in one block
and we'll set up a temporary frame here

756
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
and we'll set up a temporary frame here
 

757
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,110
and we'll set up a temporary frame here
yes door frame just to help us visualize

758
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
yes door frame just to help us visualize
 

759
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,530
yes door frame just to help us visualize
it

760
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:41,540
it
 

761
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,710
it
[Applause]

762
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
[Applause]
 

763
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,230
[Applause]
go in one block and then dig four

764
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240

 

765
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,150

then on both sides dig out the four

766
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
then on both sides dig out the four
 

767
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,670
then on both sides dig out the four
this side too

768
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680

 

769
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,350

that gives us a 4x3 area we need a 4x4

770
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
that gives us a 4x3 area we need a 4x4
 

771
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,550
that gives us a 4x3 area we need a 4x4
to build the elevator

772
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560

 

773
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,310

wow they're just pouring in i shut off

774
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
wow they're just pouring in i shut off
 

775
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,150
wow they're just pouring in i shut off
the old slime farm now

776
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
the old slime farm now
 

777
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,230
the old slime farm now
so this is this one's getting faster

778
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
so this is this one's getting faster
 

779
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,389
so this is this one's getting faster
got another one coming and oh man

okay there we go last one
 

785
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,710
okay there we go last one
yeah so if i wanted to go clockwise i

786
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
yeah so if i wanted to go clockwise i
 

787
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,230
yeah so if i wanted to go clockwise i
need to go

788
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
need to go
 

789
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,749
need to go
one block to the right yet if i want it

790
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
one block to the right yet if i want it
 

791
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,509
one block to the right yet if i want it
counterclockwise i go one block to the

792
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
counterclockwise i go one block to the
 

793
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,150
counterclockwise i go one block to the
left

794
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
left
 

795
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,670
left
and i prefer clockwise

796
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
and i prefer clockwise
 

797
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,509
and i prefer clockwise
but since we might do something with the

798
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
but since we might do something with the
 

799
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,590
but since we might do something with the
big slimes here i'm gonna

800
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
big slimes here i'm gonna
 

801
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,550
big slimes here i'm gonna
try save an extra block space here so

802
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
try save an extra block space here so
 

803
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,670
try save an extra block space here so
we'll go

804
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
we'll go
 

805
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,310
we'll go
counter-clockwise on this one so we've

806
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
counter-clockwise on this one so we've
 

807
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,990
counter-clockwise on this one so we've
got a four by four area here and i'm

808
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
got a four by four area here and i'm
 

809
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,350
got a four by four area here and i'm
going to dig it all the way up to the

810
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
going to dig it all the way up to the
 

811
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,790
going to dig it all the way up to the
surface

812
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
surface
 

813
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,269
surface
and then makes it really easy to build

814
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
and then makes it really easy to build
 

815
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:20,069
and then makes it really easy to build
the elevator

816
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079

 

817
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:33,220

[Applause]

818
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,230

[Applause]

820
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840

 

821
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,230

okay we're just about done here uh it's

822
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
okay we're just about done here uh it's
 

823
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,110
okay we're just about done here uh it's
going

824
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
going
 

825
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,990
going
going pretty good it works i was worried

826
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
going pretty good it works i was worried
 

827
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,789
going pretty good it works i was worried
about that

828
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
about that
 

829
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,310
about that
a lot of people told me it doesn't work

830
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
a lot of people told me it doesn't work
 

831
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,270
a lot of people told me it doesn't work
in the recent patches but

832
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
in the recent patches but
 

833
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,870
in the recent patches but
you just got to make sure you go all the

834
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
you just got to make sure you go all the
 

835
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,870
you just got to make sure you go all the
way in otherwise you will get clipped

836
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
way in otherwise you will get clipped
 

837
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,430
way in otherwise you will get clipped
against the block and stop

838
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
against the block and stop
 

839
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,390
against the block and stop
so that's all there is to it and of

840
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
so that's all there is to it and of
 

841
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,710
so that's all there is to it and of
course set your first repeater to 4 or

842
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
course set your first repeater to 4 or
 

843
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,830
course set your first repeater to 4 or
so just give you extra time to get into

844
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
so just give you extra time to get into
 

845
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,310
so just give you extra time to get into
position

846
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
position
 

847
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,430
position
and the wire comes down and

848
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
and the wire comes down and
 

849
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,470
and the wire comes down and
goes next to the pressure plate there

850
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
goes next to the pressure plate there
 

851
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,909
goes next to the pressure plate there
so it's pretty easy took about an hour

852
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
so it's pretty easy took about an hour
 

853
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,830
so it's pretty easy took about an hour
to do so far

i was wondering why that was doing that

1000
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960

 

1001
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,990

there we go perfect that

1002
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
there we go perfect that
 

1003
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,029
there we go perfect that
is the problem so all the repeaters have

1004
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
is the problem so all the repeaters have
 

1005
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,909
is the problem so all the repeaters have
to be set at

1006
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
to be set at
 

1007
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,950
to be set at
two i i've heard if you

1008
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
two i i've heard if you
 

1009
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,870
two i i've heard if you
you can set them at one if you hold

1010
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
you can set them at one if you hold
 

1011
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,830
you can set them at one if you hold
shift as you ride it but

1012
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,840
shift as you ride it but
 

1013
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,350
shift as you ride it but
that seems like a pain but i think you

1014
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
that seems like a pain but i think you
 

1015
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,269
that seems like a pain but i think you
can get a faster elevator if you hold

1016
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
can get a faster elevator if you hold
 

1017
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,190
can get a faster elevator if you hold
shift as you ride it

1018
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
shift as you ride it
 

1019
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,830
shift as you ride it
or at least that's the way it used to be

1020
