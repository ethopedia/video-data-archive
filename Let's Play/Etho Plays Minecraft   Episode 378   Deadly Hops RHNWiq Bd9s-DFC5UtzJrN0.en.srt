the desert where i have been getting
 

39
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,910
the desert where i have been getting
sand from i realized it's actually

40
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
sand from i realized it's actually
 

41
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,110
sand from i realized it's actually
kind of connected to the desert

42
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
kind of connected to the desert
 

43
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,590
kind of connected to the desert
right by our man cave so if i keep

44
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
right by our man cave so if i keep
 

45
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,990
right by our man cave so if i keep
taking sand from there

46
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
taking sand from there
 

47
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,790
taking sand from there
eventually we're gonna have a giant hole

48
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
eventually we're gonna have a giant hole
 

49
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,990
eventually we're gonna have a giant hole
right next to

50
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
right next to
 

51
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,030
right next to
where we live we gotta do it

52
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
where we live we gotta do it
 

53
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,750
where we live we gotta do it
gotta do it so i decided rather than

54
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
gotta do it so i decided rather than
 

55
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,429
gotta do it so i decided rather than
like keep taking sand from there we we

56
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
like keep taking sand from there we we
 

57
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,109
like keep taking sand from there we we
gotta find a new spot um

58
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
gotta find a new spot um
 

59
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,469
gotta find a new spot um
i think i gotta place it there come on

60
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
i think i gotta place it there come on
 

61
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,590
i think i gotta place it there come on
come on yeah

62
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
come on yeah
 

63
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,109
come on yeah
oh man so this is our new spot amplified

64
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
oh man so this is our new spot amplified
 

65
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,350
oh man so this is our new spot amplified
terrain area it's pretty cool um

66
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
terrain area it's pretty cool um
 

67
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,109
terrain area it's pretty cool um
you know when i first converted my world

68
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
you know when i first converted my world
 

69
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,950
you know when i first converted my world
to amplified i thought

70
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
to amplified i thought
 

71
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,390
to amplified i thought
maybe we would have sand that's like

72
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
maybe we would have sand that's like
 

73
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,390
maybe we would have sand that's like
over 10 blocks thick in places like

74
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
over 10 blocks thick in places like
 

75
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,830
over 10 blocks thick in places like
maybe 20 blocks or 30 blocks thick

76
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840
maybe 20 blocks or 30 blocks thick
 

77
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,030
maybe 20 blocks or 30 blocks thick
because like what are these tall

78
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
because like what are these tall
 

79
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,310
because like what are these tall
mountains made out of

80
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
mountains made out of
 

81
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,350
mountains made out of
um unfortunately no it's just like a

82
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
um unfortunately no it's just like a
 

83
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,030
um unfortunately no it's just like a
normal deserts that you can't do like

84
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
normal deserts that you can't do like
 

85
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,389
normal deserts that you can't do like
the torch trick and get

86
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
the torch trick and get
 

87
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,109
the torch trick and get
crazy amounts of sand all really easy

88
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
crazy amounts of sand all really easy
 

89
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,950
crazy amounts of sand all really easy
because the majority of the mountains

90
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
because the majority of the mountains
 

91
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,830
because the majority of the mountains
actually sand

92
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
actually sand
 

93
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,030
actually sand
stone not sand like it's

94
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
stone not sand like it's
 

95
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,109
stone not sand like it's
very very thick sandstone in a lot of

96
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
very very thick sandstone in a lot of
 

97
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,069
very very thick sandstone in a lot of
places

98
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079

 

99
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,550

but yeah just thought i would show you

100
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
but yeah just thought i would show you
 

101
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,310
but yeah just thought i would show you
guys do we have any more sand to drop i

102
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
guys do we have any more sand to drop i
 

103
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,589
guys do we have any more sand to drop i
guess there's that up there if we want

104
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
guess there's that up there if we want
 

105
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,350
guess there's that up there if we want
okay this might be a pretty good one

106
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
okay this might be a pretty good one
 

107
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,430
okay this might be a pretty good one
here let's try it out

108
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
here let's try it out
 

109
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,869
here let's try it out
oh yay that was pathetic

110
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
oh yay that was pathetic
 

111
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,710
oh yay that was pathetic
here let's try a little further it looks

112
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
here let's try a little further it looks
 

113
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,229
here let's try a little further it looks
like there's a bunch connected though if

114
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
like there's a bunch connected though if
 

115
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:20,630
like there's a bunch connected though if
we

116
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
we
 

117
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,830
we
do here no it's

118
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
do here no it's
 

119
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,910
do here no it's
it's not happening guys it's not

120
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
it's not happening guys it's not
 

121
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,430
it's not happening guys it's not
happening

122
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
happening
 

123
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,589
happening
huh there we go i didn't get that though

124
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
huh there we go i didn't get that though
 

125
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,790
huh there we go i didn't get that though
darren i thought it was gonna do a whole

126
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
darren i thought it was gonna do a whole
 

127
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,869
darren i thought it was gonna do a whole
chain around the the lip here

128
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
chain around the the lip here
 

129
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,710
chain around the the lip here
guess not yeah most these overhangs

130
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
guess not yeah most these overhangs
 

131
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,710
guess not yeah most these overhangs
won't fall because there's sandstone

132
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
won't fall because there's sandstone
 

133
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,350
won't fall because there's sandstone
underneath

134
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
underneath
 

135
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,710
underneath
but i just had an idea but we'll have to

136
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
but i just had an idea but we'll have to
 

137
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,070
but i just had an idea but we'll have to
make a backup for this so

138
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
make a backup for this so
 

139
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,630
make a backup for this so
here we go okay so here we are

140
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
here we go okay so here we are
 

141
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,910
here we go okay so here we are
this is a backup and i

142
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
this is a backup and i
 

143
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,390
this is a backup and i
i removed all the stone and all the

144
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
i removed all the stone and all the
 

145
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,309
i removed all the stone and all the
sandstone in this mountain so that we

146
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
sandstone in this mountain so that we
 

147
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,149
sandstone in this mountain so that we
could do this one thing

148
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
could do this one thing
 

149
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,710
could do this one thing
because we have to do it we just have to

150
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
because we have to do it we just have to
 

151
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,710
because we have to do it we just have to
it's going to be amazing

152
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
it's going to be amazing
 

153
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,110
it's going to be amazing
all right here we go and

154
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
all right here we go and
 

155
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,949
all right here we go and
no that's not the right spot no that

156
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
no that's not the right spot no that
 

157
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,470
no that's not the right spot no that
won't do it

158
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
won't do it
 

159
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,390
won't do it
we should start low so it'll climb its

160
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
we should start low so it'll climb its
 

161
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,750
we should start low so it'll climb its
way up maybe let's

162
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
way up maybe let's
 

163
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,949
way up maybe let's
try this looks like it

164
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
try this looks like it
 

165
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,390
try this looks like it
might work

166
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400

 

167
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,750

let's do it here okay here we go

168
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760

 

169
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,589

oh man it's starting it's happening

170

00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
so we could we could blow a bunch of it
 

247
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,710
so we could we could blow a bunch of it
on something fun

248
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720

but anyways guys i have made my way over
 

251
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,710
but anyways guys i have made my way over
to the amplified terrain

252
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
to the amplified terrain
 

253
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,790
to the amplified terrain
area again we're gonna do some building

254
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
area again we're gonna do some building
 

255
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,990
area again we're gonna do some building
here

256
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
here
 

257
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,629
here
i have decided on a path style so let's

258
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
i have decided on a path style so let's
 

259
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,990
i have decided on a path style so let's
try this out

260
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
try this out
 

261
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,430
try this out
well we're going to work on this area

262
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
well we're going to work on this area
 

263
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,909
well we're going to work on this area
particularly so i think

264
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
particularly so i think
 

265
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,870
particularly so i think
it's going to be like a worn down path

266
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
it's going to be like a worn down path
 

267
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,230
it's going to be like a worn down path
style

268
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
style
 

269
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,430
style
in the middle it's going to be these

270
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
in the middle it's going to be these
 

271
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,629
in the middle it's going to be these
slabs mostly

272
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639

 

273
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,710

we'll make them too tall and then

274
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
we'll make them too tall and then
 

275
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,150
we'll make them too tall and then
kind of next to these we're gonna

276
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
kind of next to these we're gonna
 

277
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,909
kind of next to these we're gonna
scatter different types of stone

278
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
scatter different types of stone
 

279
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,390
scatter different types of stone
and grass and stuff so it'll be like

280
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
and grass and stuff so it'll be like
 

281
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,909
and grass and stuff so it'll be like
let's see let's get some of this stuff

282
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
let's see let's get some of this stuff
 

283
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,550
let's see let's get some of this stuff
like we'll have

284
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
like we'll have
 

285
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,950
like we'll have
thawed piece of cobblestone every so

286
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
thawed piece of cobblestone every so
 

287
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,790
thawed piece of cobblestone every so
often mixed in

288
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
often mixed in
 

289
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,830
often mixed in
let's see how this is going to look

290
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
let's see how this is going to look
 

291
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,469
let's see how this is going to look
then maybe some of this cracked stone

292
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479

 

293
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,070

and regular stone just just a bunch of

294
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
and regular stone just just a bunch of
 

295
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,469
and regular stone just just a bunch of
random stuff let's see what else should

296
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
random stuff let's see what else should
 

297
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,430
random stuff let's see what else should
we try

298
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
we try
 

299
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,189
we try
i was going to put grass for sure so

300
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
i was going to put grass for sure so
 

301
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,430
i was going to put grass for sure so
we'll have

302
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
we'll have
 

303
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,469
we'll have
just little pieces of grass and i think

304
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
just little pieces of grass and i think
 

305
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,029
just little pieces of grass and i think
if we

306
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
if we
 

307
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,469
if we
do this on a large scale it's going to

308
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
do this on a large scale it's going to
 

309
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,510
do this on a large scale it's going to
look pretty decent

310
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520

 

311
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,110

uh-huh that looks pretty bad

312
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
uh-huh that looks pretty bad
 

313
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,870
uh-huh that looks pretty bad
it's going to take some practice to get

314
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
it's going to take some practice to get
 

315
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,230
it's going to take some practice to get
it looking good i think

316
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
it looking good i think
 

317
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,710
it looking good i think
let me try it out here though i'm sure

318
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
let me try it out here though i'm sure
 

319
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,550
let me try it out here though i'm sure
if i get the proportions right

320
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
if i get the proportions right
 

321
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,230
if i get the proportions right
and mix it properly it'll look pretty

322
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
and mix it properly it'll look pretty
 

323
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,710

usually

508
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
usually
 

509
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,230
usually
don't go for these really tall buildings

510
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
don't go for these really tall buildings
 

511
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,470
don't go for these really tall buildings
or

512
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
or
 

513
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,750
or
tall tunnels or anything like that

514
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
tall tunnels or anything like that
 

515
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,190
tall tunnels or anything like that
i think i should get into that more

516
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
i think i should get into that more
 

517
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,710
i think i should get into that more
because it makes things look a little

518
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
because it makes things look a little
 

519
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,150
because it makes things look a little
bit more

520
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
bit more
 

521
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,430
bit more
epic you know and

522
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
epic you know and
 

523
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,150
epic you know and
tada there we go so it's it's not super

524
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
tada there we go so it's it's not super
 

525
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,670
tada there we go so it's it's not super
tall but it is a little bit taller but

526
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
tall but it is a little bit taller but
 

527
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,430
tall but it is a little bit taller but
like four or five blocks just makes it

528
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
like four or five blocks just makes it
 

529
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,310
like four or five blocks just makes it
feel

530
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
feel
 

531
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,470
feel
a bit more spacious a bit more open i

532
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
a bit more spacious a bit more open i
 

533
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,590
a bit more spacious a bit more open i
like it

534
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
like it
 

535
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,269
like it
so maybe one more thing we will do

536
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
so maybe one more thing we will do
 

537
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,670
so maybe one more thing we will do
i'm thinking about adding a staircase

538
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
i'm thinking about adding a staircase
 

539
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,470
i'm thinking about adding a staircase
here so we'll go

540
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
here so we'll go
 

541
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,910
here so we'll go
up a little ways and then maybe switch

542
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
up a little ways and then maybe switch
 

543
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,230
up a little ways and then maybe switch
back i wonder we should maybe think

544
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
back i wonder we should maybe think
 

545
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,069
back i wonder we should maybe think
about switching back already

546
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
about switching back already
 

547
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,990
about switching back already
so maybe it's kind of hard to see

548
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
so maybe it's kind of hard to see
 

549
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,310
so maybe it's kind of hard to see
how much higher is it to the top of the

550
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
how much higher is it to the top of the
 

551
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,750
how much higher is it to the top of the
mountain here

552
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
mountain here
 

553
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,710
mountain here
not not very tall one two three four

554
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
not not very tall one two three four
 

555
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,350
not not very tall one two three four
five

556
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
five
 

557
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,190
five
six seven eight nine or so blocks i

558
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
six seven eight nine or so blocks i
 

559
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,230
six seven eight nine or so blocks i
think that's

560
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
think that's
 

561
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,069
think that's
probably a good spot for a platformer

562
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
probably a good spot for a platformer
 

563
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,590
probably a good spot for a platformer
over here

564
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
over here
 

565
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,630
over here
then we'll go in a bit and then we'll

566
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
then we'll go in a bit and then we'll
 

567
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,509
then we'll go in a bit and then we'll
start going up

568
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
start going up
 

569
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,630
start going up
this way

570
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
this way
 

571
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,910
this way
yeah let's go over um

572
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
yeah let's go over um
 

573
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,509
yeah let's go over um
actually we probably gotta go a little

574
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
actually we probably gotta go a little
 

575
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,269
actually we probably gotta go a little
bit higher

576
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
bit higher
 

577
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,750
bit higher
whoops let's go a little bit higher

578
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760

 

579
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,069

okay maybe here and then we will go

580
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
okay maybe here and then we will go
 

581
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,670
okay maybe here and then we will go
and make a platform at this level

582
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
and make a platform at this level
 

583
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,790
and make a platform at this level
okay and then

584
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
okay and then
 

585
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,509
okay and then
go in a couple blocks this way like two

586
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
go in a couple blocks this way like two
 

587
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,190
go in a couple blocks this way like two
or three and then starts

588
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
or three and then starts
 

589
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,750
or three and then starts
our next staircase going up so like over

590
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
our next staircase going up so like over
 

591
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,870
our next staircase going up so like over
here

592
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
here
 

593
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,069
here
and let's just see where this takes us

594
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
and let's just see where this takes us
 

595
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,710
and let's just see where this takes us
um then after this yeah we might do some

596
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
um then after this yeah we might do some
 

597
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,389
um then after this yeah we might do some
slime block stuff around here

598
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399

 

599
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,470

oh this is right underneath that boat

600
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
oh this is right underneath that boat
 

601
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,710
oh this is right underneath that boat
thing i made

602
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
thing i made
 

603
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,990
thing i made
that's fine i think we're gonna take

604
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
that's fine i think we're gonna take
 

605
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,949
that's fine i think we're gonna take
that out anyway

606
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959

 

607
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,550

all right and yeah

608
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560

 

609
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,790

yeah i think that'll work

610
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800

 

611
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,710

awesome so we got quite a bit done here

612
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
awesome so we got quite a bit done here
 

613
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,710
awesome so we got quite a bit done here
today guys i'm happy with this

614
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
today guys i'm happy with this
 

615
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,190
today guys i'm happy with this
um there's a staircase here still needs

616
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
um there's a staircase here still needs
 

617
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,829
um there's a staircase here still needs
some work

618
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
some work
 

619
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,790
some work
though quite a bit of work but just i

620
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
though quite a bit of work but just i
 

621
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,550
though quite a bit of work but just i
just wanted some basic way of getting up

622
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
just wanted some basic way of getting up
 

623
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,310
just wanted some basic way of getting up
on this mountain because i

624
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
on this mountain because i
 

625
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,310
on this mountain because i
i have to ender pearl every time i want

626
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
i have to ender pearl every time i want
 

627
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,670
i have to ender pearl every time i want
to come back up to the

628
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
to come back up to the
 

629
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,509
to come back up to the
these chests or to my bed or to the

630
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
these chests or to my bed or to the
 

631
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,509
these chests or to my bed or to the
portal so just

632
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
portal so just
 

633
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,110
portal so just
get something a little more permanent

634
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
get something a little more permanent
 

635
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,790
get something a little more permanent
set up would be nice

636
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
set up would be nice
 

637
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,790
set up would be nice
and the reason we're doing the path like

638
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
and the reason we're doing the path like
 

639
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,230
and the reason we're doing the path like
this or at least

640
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
this or at least
 

641
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,990
this or at least
possibly doing the path like this is

642
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
possibly doing the path like this is
 

643
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
possibly doing the path like this is
because the buildings are going to be

644
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
because the buildings are going to be
 

645
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,949
because the buildings are going to be
mostly

646
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
mostly
 

647
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,910
mostly
spruce wood so if i did the path like

648
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
spruce wood so if i did the path like
 

649
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,710
spruce wood so if i did the path like
what we had

650
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
what we had
 

651
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,150
what we had
here and then the buildings are spruced

652
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
here and then the buildings are spruced
 

653
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,590
here and then the buildings are spruced
everything's going to be brown

654
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
everything's going to be brown
 

655
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,350
everything's going to be brown
that's that's probably not going to look

656
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
that's that's probably not going to look
 

657
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,910
that's that's probably not going to look
too good so just to add more contrast to

658
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
too good so just to add more contrast to
 

659
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,230
too good so just to add more contrast to
our buildings around here

660
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
our buildings around here
 

661
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,750
our buildings around here
i figured we should pick a different

662
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
i figured we should pick a different
 

663
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,750
i figured we should pick a different
path type so let me know what you think

664
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
path type so let me know what you think
 

665
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:05,990
path type so let me know what you think
about

666
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
about
 

667
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,790
about
that we're gonna go set up some slime

668
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
that we're gonna go set up some slime
 

669
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,509
that we're gonna go set up some slime
block stuff

670
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
block stuff
 

671
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,710
block stuff
now and even though we have the

672
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
now and even though we have the
 

673
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,710
now and even though we have the
staircase i still will probably jump off

674
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
staircase i still will probably jump off
 

675
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,310
staircase i still will probably jump off
of here every time

676
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
of here every time
 

677
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,230
of here every time
because this is way more convenient

678
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
because this is way more convenient
 

679
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,430
because this is way more convenient
isn't it

680
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
isn't it
 

681
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,550
isn't it
all right where do we gotta go whoa

682
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
all right where do we gotta go whoa
 

683
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,269
all right where do we gotta go whoa
we're fine we're good two hearts didn't

684
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
we're fine we're good two hearts didn't
 

685
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,910
we're fine we're good two hearts didn't
hurt

686
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
hurt
 

687
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,670
hurt
okay well that's guilt in there it's

688
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
okay well that's guilt in there it's
 

689
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,710
okay well that's guilt in there it's
kind of scaring me

690
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720

 

691
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,150

okay he doesn't see us we gotta make a

692
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
okay he doesn't see us we gotta make a
 

693
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,829
okay he doesn't see us we gotta make a
slime block thing to launch us

694
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
slime block thing to launch us
 

695
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,870
slime block thing to launch us
from here to this side of the path

696
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
from here to this side of the path
 

697
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,350
from here to this side of the path
so let's experiment with this

698
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
so let's experiment with this
 

699
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,470
so let's experiment with this
uh maybe we will put it

700
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
uh maybe we will put it
 

701
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,150
uh maybe we will put it
i guess to line it up we would want it

702
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
i guess to line it up we would want it
 

703
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,829
i guess to line it up we would want it
about here right

704
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
about here right
 

705
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,550
about here right
so let's try that out we will plan to

706
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
so let's try that out we will plan to
 

707
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,990
so let's try that out we will plan to
put a piston

708
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
put a piston
 

709
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,430
put a piston
down here slime block on top

710
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440

 

711
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,030

all right and in order for it to not

712
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
all right and in order for it to not
 

713
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,389
all right and in order for it to not
stick we got to use

714
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
stick we got to use
 

715
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,230
stick we got to use
furnaces

716
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240

 

717
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,189

okay very good and i'll put the pressure

718
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
okay very good and i'll put the pressure
 

719
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,990
okay very good and i'll put the pressure
plate

720
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
plate
 

721
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,110
plate
to activate it in the front this one

722
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
to activate it in the front this one
 

723
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,150
to activate it in the front this one
here

724
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
here
 

725
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,389
here
so you would walk up like this and it

726
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
so you would walk up like this and it
 

727
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,389
so you would walk up like this and it
should launch us that way

728
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
should launch us that way
 

729
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,150
should launch us that way
and to do that we will have to go down

730
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160

 

731
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,110

see the pressure plates there so we have

732
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
see the pressure plates there so we have
 

733
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,870
see the pressure plates there so we have
to put a piece of redstone underneath

734
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
to put a piece of redstone underneath
 

735
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,030
to put a piece of redstone underneath
here and i'll do it i will do it don't

736
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
here and i'll do it i will do it don't
 

737
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,310
here and i'll do it i will do it don't
you worry

738
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
you worry
 

739
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,150
you worry
i got in trouble for something i can't

740
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
i got in trouble for something i can't
 

741
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,910
i got in trouble for something i can't
remember what it was but i did not put

742
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
remember what it was but i did not put
 

743
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,189
remember what it was but i did not put
redstone on stone brick one day or in

744
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
redstone on stone brick one day or in
 

745
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,069
redstone on stone brick one day or in
one one

746
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
one one
 

747
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,750
one one
episode of something and people caught

748
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
episode of something and people caught
 

749
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,629
episode of something and people caught
me for it so i gotta make sure i do that

750
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
me for it so i gotta make sure i do that
 

751
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,870
me for it so i gotta make sure i do that
uh because it's one of my rules i do

752
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
uh because it's one of my rules i do
 

753
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,949
uh because it's one of my rules i do
just so i know what blocks have redstone

754
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
just so i know what blocks have redstone
 

755
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,030
just so i know what blocks have redstone
on if i'm ever digging around and see it

756
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
on if i'm ever digging around and see it
 

757
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,069
on if i'm ever digging around and see it
from

758
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
from
 

759
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,110
from
the the underside or whatever i know not

760
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
the the underside or whatever i know not
 

761
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,509
the the underside or whatever i know not
to

762
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
to
 

763
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,110
to
not to break that block okay now we

764
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
not to break that block okay now we
 

765
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,670
not to break that block okay now we
gotta go

766
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
gotta go
 

767
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,470
gotta go
up we're gonna have another piston over

768
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
up we're gonna have another piston over
 

769
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,269
up we're gonna have another piston over
here

770
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279

 

771
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,629

steepest in okay slime block there

772
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
steepest in okay slime block there
 

773
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,470
steepest in okay slime block there
so this one will shoot us up this one

774
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
so this one will shoot us up this one
 

775
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,629
so this one will shoot us up this one
will shoot us sideways

776
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
will shoot us sideways
 

777
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,110
will shoot us sideways
i wonder how much of this land we're

778
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
i wonder how much of this land we're
 

779
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,550
i wonder how much of this land we're
gonna have to clear for that to work

780
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
gonna have to clear for that to work
 

781
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,949
gonna have to clear for that to work
though

782
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959

 

783
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,310

all right anyway let's not worry about

784
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
all right anyway let's not worry about
 

785
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,069
all right anyway let's not worry about
that too too much let's just get this

786
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
that too too much let's just get this
 

787
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,389
that too too much let's just get this
working

788
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
working
 

789
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,189
working
and i will i'll turn these around later

790
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
and i will i'll turn these around later
 

791
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,189
and i will i'll turn these around later
let's just get them there for right now

792
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
let's just get them there for right now
 

793
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,829
let's just get them there for right now
so we gotta get run the wire up to there

794
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
so we gotta get run the wire up to there
 

795
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,189
so we gotta get run the wire up to there
and again stone brick

796
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
and again stone brick
 

797
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,749
and again stone brick
get a repeater going this probably won't

798
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
get a repeater going this probably won't
 

799
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,069
get a repeater going this probably won't
work for you on a server if you

800
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
work for you on a server if you
 

801
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,150
work for you on a server if you
attempt this so if you ever do something

802
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
attempt this so if you ever do something
 

803
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,629
attempt this so if you ever do something
with more than one

804
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
with more than one
 

805
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,030
with more than one
uh piston you're gonna have trouble with

806
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
uh piston you're gonna have trouble with
 

807
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,389
uh piston you're gonna have trouble with
latency so

808
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
latency so
 

809
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,509
latency so
any of these double slime block piston

810
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
any of these double slime block piston
 

811
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,470
any of these double slime block piston
things

812
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
things
 

813
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,389
things
don't really work too well on servers i

814
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
don't really work too well on servers i
 

815
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,670
don't really work too well on servers i
have found

816
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680

 

817
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,829

all right we'll put a block there and

818
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
all right we'll put a block there and
 

819
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,310
all right we'll put a block there and
redstone there

820
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
redstone there
 

821
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,910
redstone there
actually let's move this to the other

822
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
actually let's move this to the other
 

823
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,990
actually let's move this to the other
side

824
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
side
 

825
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,749
side
we're just doing a staircase up

826
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
we're just doing a staircase up
 

827
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,310
we're just doing a staircase up
basically

828
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320

 

829
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,749

okay good

830
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
okay good
 

831
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,829
okay good
like that and that should work

832
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
like that and that should work
 

833
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,310
like that and that should work
and i did not fully heal even so get

834
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
and i did not fully heal even so get
 

835
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,990
and i did not fully heal even so get
ready for a splat

836
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
ready for a splat
 

837
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,150
ready for a splat
let's try clear some more land just to

838
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
let's try clear some more land just to
 

839
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,910
let's try clear some more land just to
make it less likely

840
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920

 

841
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,350

all right i was having trouble with it i

842
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
all right i was having trouble with it i
 

843
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,110

think i see why now you probably noticed

844
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
think i see why now you probably noticed
 

845
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,590
think i see why now you probably noticed
this

846
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
this
 

847
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,430
this
i did not break the block above the

848
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
i did not break the block above the
 

849
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,790
i did not break the block above the
redstone here so it wasn't actually

850
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
redstone here so it wasn't actually
 

851
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,269
redstone here so it wasn't actually
staircasing up

852
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
staircasing up
 

853
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,829
staircasing up
this one right here okay now let's try

854
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
this one right here okay now let's try
 

855
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,470
this one right here okay now let's try
it

856
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
it
 

857
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,310

no okay
 

859
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,790
no okay
it might not be powerful enough let's

860
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
it might not be powerful enough let's
 

861
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,430
it might not be powerful enough let's
try it again

862
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
try it again
 

863
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,069
try it again
this time i'm gonna actually like run

864
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
this time i'm gonna actually like run
 

865
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,029
this time i'm gonna actually like run
and and change my looking direction and

866

918
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
eight block gap here plus like the one
 

919
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,430

five six yeah that's
 

923
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,590
five six yeah that's
that's like almost 15 blocks so that's

924
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
that's like almost 15 blocks so that's
 

925
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,310
that's like almost 15 blocks so that's
pretty cool

926
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
pretty cool
 

927
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,350
pretty cool
let's try again seems fairly consistent

928
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360

 

929
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,510

i say that and it fails you gotta hit it

930
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
i say that and it fails you gotta hit it
 

931
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,710
i say that and it fails you gotta hit it
just right though you gotta be right

932
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
just right though you gotta be right
 

933
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,430
just right though you gotta be right
between the

934
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440

 

935
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,590

yeah right between there we go

936
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
yeah right between there we go
 

937
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,230
yeah right between there we go
when it works it works but you gotta get

938
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
when it works it works but you gotta get
 

939
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,029
when it works it works but you gotta get
the right positioning

940
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
the right positioning
 

941
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,870
the right positioning
oh oh no

942
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
oh oh no
 

943
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,150
oh oh no
oh no oh i think i let go forward

944
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
oh no oh i think i let go forward
 

945
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,150
oh no oh i think i let go forward
i think that's why i fell i didn't have

946
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
i think that's why i fell i didn't have
 

947
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,029
i think that's why i fell i didn't have
as much momentum

948
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
as much momentum
 

949
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,510
as much momentum
oh no okay i gotta try it a few more

950
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
oh no okay i gotta try it a few more
 

951
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,070
oh no okay i gotta try it a few more
times

952
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
times
 

953
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,590
times
i can't have it failing like that

954
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
i can't have it failing like that
 

955
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,310
i can't have it failing like that
um let me get my stuff again

956
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
um let me get my stuff again
 

957
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,230
um let me get my stuff again
yeah it's super consistent guys never

958
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
yeah it's super consistent guys never
 

959
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,590
yeah it's super consistent guys never
fails never

960
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
fails never
 

961
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,510
fails never
never fails okay maybe we'll just try it

962
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
never fails okay maybe we'll just try it
 

963
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,110
never fails okay maybe we'll just try it
a couple more times try a few different

964
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120
a couple more times try a few different
 

965
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,549
a couple more times try a few different
things to understand it better

966
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
things to understand it better
 

967
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,070
things to understand it better
so i'm going to do it once without

968
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
so i'm going to do it once without
 

969
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,669
so i'm going to do it once without
sprinting

970
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
sprinting
 

971
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,070
sprinting
and without holding forward

972
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
and without holding forward
 

973
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,470
and without holding forward
wow okay that makes a huge whoa i almost

974
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
wow okay that makes a huge whoa i almost
 

975
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,070
wow okay that makes a huge whoa i almost
died again

976
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
died again
 

977
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,789
died again
that made a huge difference you gotta

978
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
that made a huge difference you gotta
 

979
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,990
that made a huge difference you gotta
sprint you gotta hold forward

980
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
sprint you gotta hold forward
 

981
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,830
sprint you gotta hold forward
all right i i didn't just die or

982
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
all right i i didn't just die or
 

983
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,270
all right i i didn't just die or
anything that's not why my levels are

984
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
anything that's not why my levels are
 

985
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,950
anything that's not why my levels are
lower

986
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
lower
 

987
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,510
lower
it's not what happened okay we'll try it

988
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
it's not what happened okay we'll try it
 

989
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,710
it's not what happened okay we'll try it
again here

990
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
again here
 

991
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,470
again here
um it seems like holding

992
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
um it seems like holding
 

993
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,110
um it seems like holding
just forward isn't enough either but

994
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
just forward isn't enough either but
 

995
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,870
just forward isn't enough either but
just for the video i'll do it again

996
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
just for the video i'll do it again
 

997
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,150
just for the video i'll do it again
it's close it's very close but i think i

998
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
it's close it's very close but i think i
 

999
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,950
it's close it's very close but i think i

got a sprint as well
 

1001
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,870
got a sprint as well
we'll try it now with the sprinting and

1002
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
we'll try it now with the sprinting and
 

1003
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,789
we'll try it now with the sprinting and
holding forward

1004
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
holding forward
 

1005
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,830

1011
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,190

i think it's because i'm turning

1012
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200

 

1013
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,230

there we go yeah if i turn too soon

1014
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
there we go yeah if i turn too soon
 

1015
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,909
there we go yeah if i turn too soon
it doesn't work and that's why it keeps

1016
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:19,919
it doesn't work and that's why it keeps
 

1017
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,510
it doesn't work and that's why it keeps
failing

1018
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
failing
 

1019
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,430
failing
so let's try that again i just got to

1020
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
so let's try that again i just got to
 

1021
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,510
so let's try that again i just got to
get used to it

1022
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
get used to it
 

1023
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,270
get used to it
oh i would have made that if i was

1024
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
oh i would have made that if i was
 

1025
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,190
oh i would have made that if i was
positioned better i think i

1026
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
positioned better i think i
 

1027
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,590
positioned better i think i
stuck on the wall too long it it's it's

1028
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
stuck on the wall too long it it's it's
 

1029
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,870
stuck on the wall too long it it's it's
tricky

1030
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
tricky
 

1031
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,549
tricky
it's definitely tricky oh

1032
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
it's definitely tricky oh
 

1033
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,110
it's definitely tricky oh
crazy slime block okay one more time

1034
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120

 

1035
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,830

don't shoot me

1036
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:46,840

 

1037

1039
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,830

so maybe i'll make it

1040
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
so maybe i'll make it
 

1041
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,350
so maybe i'll make it
one block of a short one block shorter

1042
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
one block of a short one block shorter
 

1043
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,350
one block of a short one block shorter
so that there's no risk because it's i'm

1044
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
so that there's no risk because it's i'm
 

1045
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,029
so that there's no risk because it's i'm
only off by one block if i

1046
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
only off by one block if i
 

1047
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,230
only off by one block if i
am that's what keeps stealing me

last guy to try out let's let's see what
 

1179
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,830
last guy to try out let's let's see what
the brown guy can do

1180
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840
the brown guy can do
 

1181
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,269
the brown guy can do
come on oh he's fast

1182
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:17,279
come on oh he's fast
 

1183

come on oh he's fast
compared to other guys anyway but

1184
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
compared to other guys anyway but
 

1185
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,350
compared to other guys anyway but
on jumping heights he kind of stinks

1186
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
on jumping heights he kind of stinks
 

1187
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,149
on jumping heights he kind of stinks

okay
 

1189
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,430
okay
so that's it we got one improvement

1190
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
so that's it we got one improvement
 

1191
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,830
so that's it we got one improvement
uh let's take him to the jump height

1192
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:30,840
uh let's take him to the jump height
 

1193
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,549
uh let's take him to the jump height
checker

1194
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
checker
 

1195
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,470
checker
okay let's try this guy out and see what

1196
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
okay let's try this guy out and see what
 

1197
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,430
okay let's try this guy out and see what
he actually can do can you do 4.25

1198
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
he actually can do can you do 4.25
 

1199
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,630
he actually can do can you do 4.25
yep no problem let's go one more step

1200
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
yep no problem let's go one more step
 

1201
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,269
yep no problem let's go one more step
up yeah no problem can you do 4.5 that

1202
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
up yeah no problem can you do 4.5 that
 

1203
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,269
up yeah no problem can you do 4.5 that
is the big question

1204
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
is the big question
 

1205
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,430
is the big question
that's what i want to see uh-oh

1206
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
that's what i want to see uh-oh
 

1207
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,950
that's what i want to see uh-oh
uh oh no i don't think so

1208
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
uh oh no i don't think so
 

1209
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,990
uh oh no i don't think so
no you can't darn it

1210
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
no you can't darn it
 

1211
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,990
no you can't darn it
so the two horses i was using for

1212
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
so the two horses i was using for
 

1213
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,549
so the two horses i was using for
breeding one of them was a 4.25

1214
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
breeding one of them was a 4.25
 

1215
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,230
breeding one of them was a 4.25
one of them is a 4.375 so

1216
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
one of them is a 4.375 so
 

1217
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,070
one of them is a 4.375 so
now we'll have two two parents that are

1218
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,080
now we'll have two two parents that are
 

1219
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,590
now we'll have two two parents that are
4.375 so it's like half a step

1220
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
4.375 so it's like half a step
 

1221
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,190
4.375 so it's like half a step
improvements

1222
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200
improvements
 

1223
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,870
improvements
