anyway we're going to start building I

30
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640

 

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,669

suppose

32
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:44,679
suppose
 

33
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,130
suppose
I'm gonna shut mobs off just so that you

34
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,140
I'm gonna shut mobs off just so that you
 

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:57,580

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:57,590
don't have all the noise J we're going
 

37
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:09,369
don't have all the noise J we're going
to need redstone and don't need

38
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:09,379
to need redstone and don't need
 

39
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,630
to need redstone and don't need
repeaters any torches and if you'll

40
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:13,640
repeaters any torches and if you'll
 

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,740
repeaters any torches and if you'll
notice I got rid of all the lava finally

42
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:16,750
notice I got rid of all the lava finally
 

43
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,470
notice I got rid of all the lava finally
so no more random fires just have

44
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
so no more random fires just have
 

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,250
so no more random fires just have
torches here all the way around not

46
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,260
torches here all the way around not
 

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:31,300
torches here all the way around not
quite as bright but it's a lot safer and

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,310
quite as bright but it's a lot safer and
 

49
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,750
quite as bright but it's a lot safer and
I think um

139
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,160
over a little bit oh don't fall down the
hole actually know what let's find that

140
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,170

00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:43,980

 

147
00:08:43,980 --> 00:09:00,510

the wire is I had it open there I have a

148
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:00,520
the wire is I had it open there I have a
 

149
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,200
the wire is I had it open there I have a
feeling I'm going to mess this up again

150
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,210
feeling I'm going to mess this up again
 

151
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:10,500
feeling I'm going to mess this up again
place a torch there

152
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,510

 

153
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:18,370

block we want until the doors over here

157
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,060

think it works if you just branch

158
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,070
think it works if you just branch
 

159
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:44,950
think it works if you just branch

corner from the direction replace it
 

169
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:31,010
corner from the direction replace it
just like that

170
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,020

 

171
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:44,240

this is actually kind of high ah

172
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,250

 

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,720

alright I'm going to fix it one second

174
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:47,730
alright I'm going to fix it one second
 

175
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,780
alright I'm going to fix it one second
and this is take number three okay so

176
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:51,790
and this is take number three okay so
 

177
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,060
and this is take number three okay so
this is a good example of the do's and

178
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,070
this is a good example of the do's and
 

179
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,050
this is a good example of the do's and
don'ts in building I built the wire

180
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,060
don'ts in building I built the wire
 

181
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,960
don'ts in building I built the wire
first building the wires the easy parts

182
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:00,970
first building the wires the easy parts
 

183
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,490
first building the wires the easy parts
and because of that my door was out of

184
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:05,500
and because of that my door was out of
 

185
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,910
and because of that my door was out of
position so since building the minecart

186
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:08,920
position so since building the minecart
 

187
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,070
position so since building the minecart
gates and getting it the position right

188
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,080
gates and getting it the position right
 

189
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,530
gates and getting it the position right
is the hard part I should have done that

190
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:13,540
is the hard part I should have done that
 

191
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,220
is the hard part I should have done that
first and now I have that's exactly

192
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,230
first and now I have that's exactly
 

193
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,730
first and now I have that's exactly
where I want the door to be and so I

194
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:20,740
where I want the door to be and so I
 

195
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:31,650
where I want the door to be and so I
need to run a wire to it now and it's

196
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:31,660
need to run a wire to it now and it's
 

197
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,750
need to run a wire to it now and it's
easy to change the path of wire takes

198
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:38,760

 

199
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,730

but it's not easy to change where the my

200
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:41,740
but it's not easy to change where the my
 

201
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:54,199
but it's not easy to change where the my
card where the minecart deke goes so

202
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:54,209

 

203
00:11:54,209 --> 00:12:00,809

going to I still want it the wire away

204
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:00,819
going to I still want it the wire away
 

205
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:08,910
going to I still want it the wire away
from this glass so because I might place

206
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:08,920
from this glass so because I might place
 

207
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,600
from this glass so because I might place
wood up so you can't see the wire just

208
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,610
wood up so you can't see the wire just
 

209
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,040
wood up so you can't see the wire just
to make it look better I'm gonna have it

210
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,050
to make it look better I'm gonna have it
 

211
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:26,059
to make it look better I'm gonna have it
spaced one away from the glass at least

212
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:26,069

 

213
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,530

and we're going to build the wire from

214
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:28,540
and we're going to build the wire from
 

215
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:41,759
and we're going to build the wire from
the top down which is kind of weird but

216
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:41,769
the top down which is kind of weird but
 

217
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:52,199
the top down which is kind of weird but
it works better this light well worked

218
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:52,209
it works better this light well worked
 

219
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,530
it works better this light well worked
out pretty good and then we run the wire

220
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:55,540
out pretty good and then we run the wire
 

221
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,819
out pretty good and then we run the wire
to it we can walk through here that's

222
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:02,829
to it we can walk through here that's
 

223
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:07,559
to it we can walk through here that's
good and we should be able to control it

224
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:07,569
good and we should be able to control it
 

225
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:16,639
good and we should be able to control it
with this lever now yep perfect

226
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:16,649

 

227
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,569

all right let's get back up there finish

228
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:21,579
all right let's get back up there finish
 

229
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:31,650
all right let's get back up there finish
building the sheets and just place

230
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:31,660
building the sheets and just place
 

231
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:41,530
building the sheets and just place
cobblestoned around here and then

232
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:41,540

 

233
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,460

let's see here

234
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:43,470
let's see here
 

235
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:50,810
let's see here
more there and then we'll place class so

236
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:50,820
more there and then we'll place class so
 

237
00:13:50,820 --> 00:14:02,920
more there and then we'll place class so
that we can keep an eye on the boat

238
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:02,930

 

239
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,460

there much better okay so we place a

240
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,470
there much better okay so we place a
 

241
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:14,800
there much better okay so we place a
sign over top of the hole and we need

242
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:14,810
sign over top of the hole and we need
 

243
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,490
sign over top of the hole and we need
lock open

244
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:16,500
lock open
 

245
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,520
lock open
there actually we do that later first we

246
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:19,530
there actually we do that later first we
 

247
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:25,250
there actually we do that later first we
place the boat can't place it inside you

248
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:25,260
place the boat can't place it inside you
 

249
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:34,640
place the boat can't place it inside you
got to place it and then push it in okay

250
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:34,650
got to place it and then push it in okay
 

251
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,130
got to place it and then push it in okay
and actually know what I'm just going to

252
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,140
and actually know what I'm just going to
 

253
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,480
and actually know what I'm just going to
cover it with with glass

254
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,490
cover it with with glass
 

255
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:59,260
cover it with with glass
I forget which way to place the water

256
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,270

 

257
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:11,230

maybe it doesn't matter no it matters

258
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:11,240
maybe it doesn't matter no it matters
 

259
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:22,670
maybe it doesn't matter no it matters
the other weight is right there let's go

260
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:22,680
the other weight is right there let's go
 

261
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,010
the other weight is right there let's go
test it out we're going to pretend that

262
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,020
test it out we're going to pretend that
 

263
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:32,320
test it out we're going to pretend that
a bunch of creepers drop their gunpowder

264
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,330

 

265
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,190

pull right now we have it set so that

266
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,200
pull right now we have it set so that
 

267
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,130
pull right now we have it set so that
their drops don't fall down here now

268
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,140
their drops don't fall down here now
 

269
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:49,460
their drops don't fall down here now
we're going to flip the lever and really

270
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:49,470
we're going to flip the lever and really
 

271
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:57,500
we're going to flip the lever and really
come awesome they're eight that worked

272
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:57,510
come awesome they're eight that worked
 

273
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:09,950
come awesome they're eight that worked
out pretty good this one's going to be a

274
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:09,960
out pretty good this one's going to be a
 

275
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:18,559
out pretty good this one's going to be a
little bit different

276
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:18,569

 

277
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,499

one second

278
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:21,509
one second
 

279
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:24,419
one second
okay so I moved our second wire over so

280
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:24,429
okay so I moved our second wire over so
 

281
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,290
okay so I moved our second wire over so
it matches the same as our first one

282
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:27,300
it matches the same as our first one
 

283
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,919
it matches the same as our first one
same pattern

284
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:28,929
same pattern
 

285
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:32,039
same pattern
I had to run a wire over the feather

286
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,049
I had to run a wire over the feather
 

287
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:37,470
I had to run a wire over the feather
dispenser unfortunately so every time

288
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:37,480
dispenser unfortunately so every time
 

289
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,210
dispenser unfortunately so every time
you flip this a feather is going to

290
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,220
you flip this a feather is going to
 

291
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,309
you flip this a feather is going to
shoot out - not a big deal that was

292
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:44,319
shoot out - not a big deal that was
 

293
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:50,309
shoot out - not a big deal that was
doing that before anyway okay so this

294
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:50,319
doing that before anyway okay so this
 

295
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,470
doing that before anyway okay so this
one goes up to level two the hostile

296
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
one goes up to level two the hostile
 

297
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,199
one goes up to level two the hostile
mobs this one's going to control a

298
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:55,209
mobs this one's going to control a
 

299
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:58,859
mobs this one's going to control a
minecart eight on level three for the

300
00:16:58,859 --> 00:16:58,869
minecart eight on level three for the
 

301
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:08,630
minecart eight on level three for the
farm ops let's finish this one up first

302
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640

 

303
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,269

cover this up so nothing can interfere

304
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:12,279
cover this up so nothing can interfere
 

305
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:20,220
cover this up so nothing can interfere
with the boat the boats actually pretty

306
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,230
with the boat the boats actually pretty
 

307
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:27,809
with the boat the boats actually pretty
stable okay so now we just need to run

308
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:27,819
stable okay so now we just need to run
 

309
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,740
stable okay so now we just need to run
now water streams with our items to this

310
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:31,750
now water streams with our items to this
 

311
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,529
now water streams with our items to this
hole here and let's find the wire from

312
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:37,539
hole here and let's find the wire from
 

313
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:56,700
hole here and let's find the wire from
our second one right over there good

314
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:56,710

 

315
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,870

yeah so this thing's definitely in the

316
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
yeah so this thing's definitely in the
 

317
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,560
yeah so this thing's definitely in the
way um so we're not going to do that day

318
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:05,570
way um so we're not going to do that day
 

319
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,779
way um so we're not going to do that day
I do want to set up the slider separator

320
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:10,789
I do want to set up the slider separator
 

321
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:18,970
I do want to set up the slider separator
thing that should be pretty easy I think

322
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:18,980
thing that should be pretty easy I think
 

323
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:45,509
thing that should be pretty easy I think
I hope I make this go up one more I

324
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:45,519
I hope I make this go up one more I
 

325
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,970
I hope I make this go up one more I
think and we're going to place some

326
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:48,980
think and we're going to place some
 

327
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:55,090
think and we're going to place some
signs in there really wish signs are

328
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,100
signs in there really wish signs are
 

329
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:10,869
signs in there really wish signs are
stackable now use them a lot and

330
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:10,879
stackable now use them a lot and
 

331
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:25,120
stackable now use them a lot and
everything yes good ah

332
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,130

 

333
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:37,399

do the same for the other side fill that

334
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:37,409
do the same for the other side fill that
 

335
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:58,100
do the same for the other side fill that
up with water so we definitely want to

336
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,110
up with water so we definitely want to
 

337
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,960
up with water so we definitely want to
separate spiders here no matter what

338
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:02,970
separate spiders here no matter what
 

339
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,200
separate spiders here no matter what
options we have in our system that's one

340
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,210
options we have in our system that's one
 

341
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:15,190
options we have in our system that's one
thing we're going to be doing for sure

342
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200

 

343
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,720

so we're going to make a hole here that

344
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:17,730
so we're going to make a hole here that
 

345
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:24,920
so we're going to make a hole here that
they can fit through

346
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:24,930

 

347
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:36,440

and let's see those are covering in

348
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,450
and let's see those are covering in
 

349
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:45,250
and let's see those are covering in
front so that water doesn't spill out

350
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:45,260

 

351
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:53,120

place a stream of water here I guess and

352
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,130
place a stream of water here I guess and
 

353
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,530
place a stream of water here I guess and
it doesn't go quite far enough what's

354
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:57,540
it doesn't go quite far enough what's
 

355
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,270
it doesn't go quite far enough what's
the trick for that in place another one

356
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,280
the trick for that in place another one
 

357
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:11,350
the trick for that in place another one
I think place one there and remove it

358
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360

 

359
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,980

yeah good enough okay so the tall mobs

360
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:15,990
yeah good enough okay so the tall mobs
 

361
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,420
yeah good enough okay so the tall mobs
won't be able to fit through there

362
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:17,430
won't be able to fit through there
 

363
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:23,750
won't be able to fit through there
but the spiders will stream goes to this

364
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
but the spiders will stream goes to this
 

365
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,310
but the spiders will stream goes to this
block here so we're going to make a

366
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
block here so we're going to make a
 

367
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,290
block here so we're going to make a
little opening for the tall mobs to fit

368
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:30,300
little opening for the tall mobs to fit
 

369
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,640
little opening for the tall mobs to fit
through and at the same time the spiders

370
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:34,650
through and at the same time the spiders
 

371
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,320
through and at the same time the spiders
won't be able to swim up any higher

372
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,330
won't be able to swim up any higher
 

373
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,030
won't be able to swim up any higher
because they'll hit their head on this

374
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,040
because they'll hit their head on this
 

375
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:48,540
because they'll hit their head on this
glass block here and here

376
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:48,550

 

377
00:21:48,550 --> 00:22:10,030

pretty simple place another sign and

378
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,040
pretty simple place another sign and
 

379
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:29,910
pretty simple place another sign and
water okay I think that's all we need

380
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:29,920

 

381
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,270

all right I'm going to run a test all

382
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,280
all right I'm going to run a test all
 

383
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,370
all right I'm going to run a test all
right here they come first ones haven't

384
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:36,380
right here they come first ones haven't
 

385
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:43,470
right here they come first ones haven't
seen it yet pushed over good up and

386
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:43,480
seen it yet pushed over good up and
 

387
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,300
seen it yet pushed over good up and
they're ready to kill me already

388
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,310

 

389
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,430

fighters hey I should have thought that

390
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:54,440
fighters hey I should have thought that
 

391
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:08,110
fighters hey I should have thought that
test up their algorithm spiders

392
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,120

 

393
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:36,080

this is incredibly babies what do you

394
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,090
this is incredibly babies what do you
 

395
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:45,649
this is incredibly babies what do you
reckon oh you blew up right here no

396
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:45,659
reckon oh you blew up right here no
 

397
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:52,789
reckon oh you blew up right here no
biggie oh all right well I'm going to be

398
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
biggie oh all right well I'm going to be
 

399
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,190
biggie oh all right well I'm going to be
modifying this a bit but that's it for

400
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
modifying this a bit but that's it for
 

401
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,990
modifying this a bit but that's it for
today for that we're going to do one

402
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,000
today for that we're going to do one
 

403
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,970
today for that we're going to do one
more test yet all right one last quick

404
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:01,980
more test yet all right one last quick
 

405
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,909
more test yet all right one last quick
test here I caught myself a sheep I one

406
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
test here I caught myself a sheep I one
 

407
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,060
test here I caught myself a sheep I one
of the features of the level 3 is we're

408
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,070
of the features of the level 3 is we're
 

409
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,950
of the features of the level 3 is we're
going to have a system this year the

410
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
going to have a system this year the
 

411
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,240
going to have a system this year the
wool off sheep automatically and I want

412
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,250
wool off sheep automatically and I want
 

413
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,490
wool off sheep automatically and I want
to see if this works

414
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:18,500
to see if this works
 

415
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,190
to see if this works
placing arrows and the dispenser

416
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
placing arrows and the dispenser
 

417
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
placing arrows and the dispenser
shooting the Sheep with it I kinda don't

418
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:23,610
shooting the Sheep with it I kinda don't
 

419
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,080
shooting the Sheep with it I kinda don't
think it does but I've heard conflicting

420
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,090
think it does but I've heard conflicting
 

421
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,470
think it does but I've heard conflicting
things so we're drying it out here just

422
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
things so we're drying it out here just
 

423
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:38,889
things so we're drying it out here just
to make sure

424
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:38,899

 

425
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:45,049

no okay that kind of sucks but I have

426
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:45,059
no okay that kind of sucks but I have
 

427
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,220
no okay that kind of sucks but I have
another method I'm going to be using

428
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,230
another method I'm going to be using
 

429
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,750
another method I'm going to be using
instead and it'll work too but we're

430
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:50,760
instead and it'll work too but we're
 

431
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,370
instead and it'll work too but we're
going to wrap it up here thanks for

432
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,380
going to wrap it up here thanks for
 

433
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,809
going to wrap it up here thanks for
watching I'll see you next time
