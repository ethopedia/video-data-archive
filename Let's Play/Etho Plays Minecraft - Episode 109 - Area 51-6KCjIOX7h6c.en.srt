diligently on our wheat farm here let's

28
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
diligently on our wheat farm here let's
 

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,060
diligently on our wheat farm here let's
turn out pretty good I got stone bricks

30
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,070
turn out pretty good I got stone bricks
 

31
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,189
turn out pretty good I got stone bricks
along the bottom two blocks I don't know

32
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
along the bottom two blocks I don't know
 

33
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,270
along the bottom two blocks I don't know
what I'm gonna do about the walls I

34
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,280
what I'm gonna do about the walls I
 

35
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,820
what I'm gonna do about the walls I
don't want it all stone bricks but it

36
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:04,830
don't want it all stone bricks but it
 

37
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,039
don't want it all stone bricks but it
should be something it's got to be

38
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:07,049
should be something it's got to be
 

39
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,070
should be something it's got to be
something right otherwise it won't exist

40
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080

 

41
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,149

so you got to figure that out

42
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
so you got to figure that out
 

43
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,520
so you got to figure that out
I added lava lighting on the sides here

44
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:16,530
I added lava lighting on the sides here
 

45
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,330
I added lava lighting on the sides here
I guess that's the front yeah that's the

46
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,340
I guess that's the front yeah that's the
 

47
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,490
I guess that's the front yeah that's the
front that's the back so I'll have a

48
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:22,500
front that's the back so I'll have a
 

49
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,890
front that's the back so I'll have a
lighting on the front and back we got

50
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:24,900
lighting on the front and back we got
 

51
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,410
lighting on the front and back we got
the lab behind the pistons and I also

52
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:27,420
the lab behind the pistons and I also
 

53
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,990
the lab behind the pistons and I also
did the pumpkin thing place them under

54
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
did the pumpkin thing place them under
 

55
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,140
did the pumpkin thing place them under
the water so pumpkins are light level 15

56
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,150
the water so pumpkins are light level 15
 

57
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,620
the water so pumpkins are light level 15
at the water it's 13 because water

58
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:36,630
at the water it's 13 because water
 

59
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,609
at the water it's 13 because water
reduces light by two instead of just one

60
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:39,619
reduces light by two instead of just one
 

61
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:48,050
reduces light by two instead of just one
so 15 13 12 with the fence 11 10 9 and

62
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,060
so 15 13 12 with the fence 11 10 9 and
 

63
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,179
so 15 13 12 with the fence 11 10 9 and
you need light level 9 or higher to grow

64
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:50,189
you need light level 9 or higher to grow
 

65
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,539
you need light level 9 or higher to grow
wheat so it worked out perfect because

66
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:52,549
wheat so it worked out perfect because
 

67
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,520
wheat so it worked out perfect because
the libel behind the Pistons lights up

68
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,530
the libel behind the Pistons lights up
 

69
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,889
the libel behind the Pistons lights up
everything within these three blocks

70
00:01:59,889 --> 00:01:59,899

 

71
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,719

mm-hmm so everything is lit and

the piston arms here open it yet a

90
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,060
the piston arms here open it yet a
 

91
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,870
the piston arms here open it yet a
little bit of leg from it but it's

92
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:35,880
little bit of leg from it but it's
 

93
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,229
little bit of leg from it but it's
temporary and it'll flood everything all

94
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
temporary and it'll flood everything all

need a hole up to the surface so we may
 

127
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,620
need a hole up to the surface so we may
as well put it here I guess oh I hit

128

center here and there'll be a hole below
 

179
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,840
center here and there'll be a hole below
so we just need to lure them to this one

180
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:10,850
so we just need to lure them to this one
 

181
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,580
so we just need to lure them to this one
of these water streams that's all we

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:12,590
of these water streams that's all we
 

183
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,530
of these water streams that's all we
have to do and they'll fall down to our

184
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:14,540
have to do and they'll fall down to our
 

185
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,800

I know wheat does grow at different
 

195
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,980
I know wheat does grow at different
rates depending on how it's placed and I

196
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:35,990
rates depending on how it's placed and I
 

197
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,630

does grow still trying to avoid putting
 

201
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,190
does grow still trying to avoid putting
lights above the wheat farm and you'll

202
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,200
lights above the wheat farm and you'll
 

203
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,170
lights above the wheat farm and you'll
see why in a little while but I might

break okay and then they will either go
 

233
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,480
break okay and then they will either go
left or right here into their pen and

left or right here into their pen and
 

235
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,409
left or right here into their pen and
then they'll be stuck down here and

236
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:43,419
then they'll be stuck down here and
 

237
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,870
then they'll be stuck down here and
we'll have to pretty it up later

238
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:48,880
