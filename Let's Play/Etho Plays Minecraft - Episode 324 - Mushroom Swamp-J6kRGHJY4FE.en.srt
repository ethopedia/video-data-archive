00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,949
think that would be a lot of fun all
right

162
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
right
 

163
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,830
right
anyway did that this chick Wilson one

164
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
anyway did that this chick Wilson one
 

165
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,890
anyway did that this chick Wilson one
more time uh-oh its weight went back

166
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:27,900
more time uh-oh its weight went back
 

167
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,680
more time uh-oh its weight went back
down let me give a mistake even though

168
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:30,690
down let me give a mistake even though
 

169
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,440
down let me give a mistake even though
he's not hungry this thing is not down

170
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,450
he's not hungry this thing is not down
 

171
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,390
he's not hungry this thing is not down
straight right now I can't get his

172
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,400
straight right now I can't get his
 

173
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,080
straight right now I can't get his
weight to stay up which it should be

174
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,090
weight to stay up which it should be
 

175
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,000
weight to stay up which it should be
easy to beat to do that so with this I

176
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,010
easy to beat to do that so with this I
 

177
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,550
easy to beat to do that so with this I
think what I'm gonna do I put half slabs

178
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
think what I'm gonna do I put half slabs
 

179
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
think what I'm gonna do I put half slabs
down in this mushroom farm and I've

180
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,570
down in this mushroom farm and I've
 

181
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,150
down in this mushroom farm and I've
talked about ripping this thing out but

182
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
talked about ripping this thing out but
 

183
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,950
talked about ripping this thing out but
I think what I'll do instead is just rip

184
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:51,960
I think what I'll do instead is just rip
 

185
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,320
I think what I'll do instead is just rip
out maybe up to here like everything

186
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,330
out maybe up to here like everything
 

187
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,400
out maybe up to here like everything
from here to the right this way take

188
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,410
from here to the right this way take
 

189
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,560
from here to the right this way take
that out and that should give us plenty

190
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,570
that out and that should give us plenty
 

191
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,840
that out and that should give us plenty
of space here to do to do more stuff

192
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:05,850
of space here to do to do more stuff
 

193
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,460
of space here to do to do more stuff
around here and this mushroom farm does

194
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:07,470
around here and this mushroom farm does
 

195
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,400
around here and this mushroom farm does
not need to be this big so I think

196
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,410
not need to be this big so I think
 

197
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,610
not need to be this big so I think
that's a good move and then we'll still

198
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620
that's a good move and then we'll still
 

199
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,170
that's a good move and then we'll still
have it rather than ripping the whole

200
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,180
have it rather than ripping the whole
 

201
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,390
have it rather than ripping the whole
thing out oh this guy then he got sick

202
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
thing out oh this guy then he got sick
 

203
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,340
thing out oh this guy then he got sick
again like right away Wilson you have to

204
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,350
again like right away Wilson you have to
 

205
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,280
again like right away Wilson you have to
get better get plenty of sleep okay okay

206
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,290
get better get plenty of sleep okay okay
 

207
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,390
get better get plenty of sleep okay okay
I fixed the sensor too now so oh look at

208
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
I fixed the sensor too now so oh look at
 

209
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,680
I fixed the sensor too now so oh look at
that guy he's super happy

210
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:36,690
that guy he's super happy
 

211
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,540
that guy he's super happy
I fixed the sensor so his happiness can

212
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:38,550
I fixed the sensor so his happiness can
 

213
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,850
I fixed the sensor so his happiness can
go back up again all right I'm gonna

214
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:40,860
go back up again all right I'm gonna
 

215
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,340
go back up again all right I'm gonna
give him one more steak excellent okay

216
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,350
give him one more steak excellent okay
 

217
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,000
give him one more steak excellent okay
so destruction construction is a lot of

218
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,010
so destruction construction is a lot of
 

219
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,940
so destruction construction is a lot of
fun let's do some destruction although

220
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:52,950
fun let's do some destruction although
 

221
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,760
fun let's do some destruction although
these half slabs probably will block

222
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:55,770
these half slabs probably will block
 

223
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,340
these half slabs probably will block
most of it

224
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,350
most of it
 

225
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,380
most of it
but yeah although I don't really want

226
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,390
but yeah although I don't really want
 

227
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,350
but yeah although I don't really want
that to break either man maybe TNT is

228
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,360
that to break either man maybe TNT is
 

229
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
that to break either man maybe TNT is
not the best way of doing this because I

230
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,130
not the best way of doing this because I
 

231
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,290
not the best way of doing this because I
got redstone nearby but we'll try it out

232
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:11,300
got redstone nearby but we'll try it out
 

233
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,390
got redstone nearby but we'll try it out
let's do a little bit good perfect

234
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,400
let's do a little bit good perfect
 

235
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,110
let's do a little bit good perfect
look at that okay he's back up to 2 but

236
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,120
look at that okay he's back up to 2 but
 

237
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,460
look at that okay he's back up to 2 but
I don't know if he'll make it all the

238
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:25,470
I don't know if he'll make it all the
 

239
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,920
I don't know if he'll make it all the
way guys he's getting sick so often he

240
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:27,930
way guys he's getting sick so often he
 

241
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,050
way guys he's getting sick so often he
got sick twice since I showed that last

242
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,060
got sick twice since I showed that last
 

243
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,770
got sick twice since I showed that last
clip I have to like check on him every 5

244
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:33,780
clip I have to like check on him every 5
 

245
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,470
clip I have to like check on him every 5
or 10 minutes otherwise he's he's gonna

246
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:36,480
or 10 minutes otherwise he's he's gonna
 

247
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,690
or 10 minutes otherwise he's he's gonna
die for sure I have to pretty much baby

248
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:38,700
die for sure I have to pretty much baby
 

249
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,450
die for sure I have to pretty much baby
him at this point this looks a lot

250
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:41,460
him at this point this looks a lot
 

251
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,390
him at this point this looks a lot
different though doesn't it's very open

252
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,400
different though doesn't it's very open
 

253
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,720
different though doesn't it's very open
to open in fact it it needs to be this

254
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,730
to open in fact it it needs to be this
 

255
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,330
to open in fact it it needs to be this
needs to be closed up somehow so we

256
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,340
needs to be closed up somehow so we
 

257
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,370
needs to be closed up somehow so we
should put like an entrance here I think

258
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:54,380
should put like an entrance here I think
 

259
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,200
should put like an entrance here I think
to the mushroom farm and make it so you

260
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,210
to the mushroom farm and make it so you
 

261
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,680
to the mushroom farm and make it so you
can't see into it because it just feels

262
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:02,690
can't see into it because it just feels
 

263
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,540
can't see into it because it just feels
feels like in situ much like it with it

264
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,550
feels like in situ much like it with it
 

265
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,430
feels like in situ much like it with it
like that there should be a wall here at

266
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
like that there should be a wall here at
 

267
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,470
like that there should be a wall here at
least then maybe some stuff in front of

268
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:09,480
least then maybe some stuff in front of
 

269
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,070
least then maybe some stuff in front of
this um let's see but yeah I got some

270
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
this um let's see but yeah I got some
 

271
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,980
this um let's see but yeah I got some
mushrooms I wonder if we could get a

272
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:18,990
mushrooms I wonder if we could get a
 

273
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,810
mushrooms I wonder if we could get a
mushroom to grow here think about

274
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:20,820
mushroom to grow here think about
 

275
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,460
mushroom to grow here think about
mushrooms you need so much space for

276
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,470
mushrooms you need so much space for
 

277
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,920
mushrooms you need so much space for
them they're kind of a pain ah I would

278
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:27,930
them they're kind of a pain ah I would
 

279
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,380
them they're kind of a pain ah I would
like to have like 2 or 3 mushrooms in

280
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,390
like to have like 2 or 3 mushrooms in
 

281
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,270
like to have like 2 or 3 mushrooms in
front of the mushroom farm but let's see

282
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
front of the mushroom farm but let's see
 

283
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,160
front of the mushroom farm but let's see
we need a 7x7 no we don't have it I

284
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,170
we need a 7x7 no we don't have it I
 

285
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,540
we need a 7x7 no we don't have it I
don't know I don't think we can do it

286
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:46,550
don't know I don't think we can do it
 

287
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,090
don't know I don't think we can do it
7x7 oh it's because of this shouldn't

288
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,100
7x7 oh it's because of this shouldn't
 

289
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,320
7x7 oh it's because of this shouldn't
have put this down let's go get some

290
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,330
have put this down let's go get some
 

291
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,650
have put this down let's go get some
more bone meal and I think I have some

292
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:02,660
more bone meal and I think I have some
 

293
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,200
more bone meal and I think I have some
how we can grab some from here go ahead

294
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,210
how we can grab some from here go ahead
 

295
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,440
how we can grab some from here go ahead
and do that oh yeah

296
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,450

 

297
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,000

this seems to have stopped burning by

298
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,010
this seems to have stopped burning by
 

299
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,020
this seems to have stopped burning by
the way in the latest snapshots the lava

300
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,030
the way in the latest snapshots the lava
 

301
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,030
the way in the latest snapshots the lava
has been fixed don't have the fires

302
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,040
has been fixed don't have the fires
 

303
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,620
has been fixed don't have the fires
going out of control anymore which is

304
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:19,630
going out of control anymore which is
 

305
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,220
going out of control anymore which is
good

306
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,230
good
 

307
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,640
good
Wilson you're still fine very good okay

308
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:23,650
Wilson you're still fine very good okay
 

309
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:31,400
Wilson you're still fine very good okay
so let's try this again

310
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,410

 

311
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,420

yay let's see I was kind of hoping for a

312
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:36,430
yay let's see I was kind of hoping for a
 

313
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,770
yay let's see I was kind of hoping for a
taller one maybe we should try get a

314
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:37,780
taller one maybe we should try get a
 

315
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,870
taller one maybe we should try get a
taller one that's like a really really

316
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:39,880
taller one that's like a really really
 

317
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,130
taller one that's like a really really

thing not really appear though but
 

373
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,120

that's sort of that sort of walkway
 

375
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,240
that's sort of that sort of walkway
connecting it all this together so we'll

376
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,250
connecting it all this together so we'll
 

377
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,840
connecting it all this together so we'll
have it go here I just believe that

378
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:39,850
have it go here I just believe that
 

379
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:46,880
have it go here I just believe that
three wide all the way up to here and

380
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:46,890

 

381
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:54,090

then it will connect to they're

382
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,100
then it will connect to they're
 

383
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,460
then it will connect to they're
connected this oh and I'm out of planks

384
00:10:59,460 --> 00:10:59,470
connected this oh and I'm out of planks
 

385
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,460
connected this oh and I'm out of planks
so basically anywhere I have grass here

386
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,470
so basically anywhere I have grass here
 

387
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,290
so basically anywhere I have grass here
well almost anywhere like we'll have the

388
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,300
well almost anywhere like we'll have the
 

389
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,140
well almost anywhere like we'll have the
water H out like this

390
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,150
water H out like this
 

391
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:13,670
water H out like this
and maybe like this and like maybe here

392
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
and maybe like this and like maybe here
 

393
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,450
and maybe like this and like maybe here
take this all down at least two blocks

394
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:18,460
take this all down at least two blocks
 

395
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,270
take this all down at least two blocks
and then have water all over the place

396
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,280
and then have water all over the place
 

397
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,590
and then have water all over the place
here and I think that'll look pretty

here and I think that'll look pretty
 

399
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,750
here and I think that'll look pretty
cool mm-hmm so something like this this

400
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760

401
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,460
cool mm-hmm so something like this this
is what I had in mind I think this is

402
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,470
is what I had in mind I think this is
 

403

489
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:49,850

that before the stereo audio for that
 

497
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,019

speaker walk to the right here in the
 

505
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,519

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:13,529
left very very interesting and then
 

507
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,429
left very very interesting and then

we'll flood it hey I got the walls done
and ice is in place ready to to flood

518
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,129
and ice is in place ready to to flood
 

519
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:40,160
and ice is in place ready to to flood
down here I got rid of the mossy brick

520
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,170
down here I got rid of the mossy brick
 

521
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,160
down here I got rid of the mossy brick
because it was a little too crazy even

522
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,170
because it was a little too crazy even
 

523
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,360
because it was a little too crazy even
still I think it might be a bit too

524
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,370
still I think it might be a bit too
 

525
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,299
still I think it might be a bit too
crazy but you won't really see down here

526
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:47,309
crazy but you won't really see down here
 

527
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:50,030
crazy but you won't really see down here
anyway I've put a lining

528
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,040
anyway I've put a lining
 

529
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,860
anyway I've put a lining
cobblestone slabs over here to make it

530
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:51,870
cobblestone slabs over here to make it
 

531
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,720
cobblestone slabs over here to make it
look like it's holding up the the dirt

532
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:55,730

 

533
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,950

which is a little weird but it it kind

534
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:00,960
which is a little weird but it it kind
 

535
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,990
which is a little weird but it it kind
of makes sense I guess I don't know I

536
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,000
of makes sense I guess I don't know I
 

537
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
of makes sense I guess I don't know I
like the way water looks when it goes

538
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,010
like the way water looks when it goes
 

539
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,640
like the way water looks when it goes
underneath the block site when it goes

540
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:07,650
underneath the block site when it goes
 

541
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,070
underneath the block site when it goes
in at least one so that's why I did it

542
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,080
in at least one so that's why I did it
 

543
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,980
in at least one so that's why I did it
this way all right beautiful let's see

544
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:15,990
this way all right beautiful let's see
 

545
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,740
this way all right beautiful let's see
what this looks like from up here now

546
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:17,750
what this looks like from up here now
 

547
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,230
what this looks like from up here now
hopefully it adds a nice level of depth

548
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,240
hopefully it adds a nice level of depth
 

549
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,290
hopefully it adds a nice level of depth
oh yeah that's pretty cool it might be

550
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:27,300
oh yeah that's pretty cool it might be
 

551
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,770
oh yeah that's pretty cool it might be
too deep though hmm I wonder if I should

552
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:33,780
too deep though hmm I wonder if I should
 

553
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,410
too deep though hmm I wonder if I should
bring the water up one more block here

554
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:38,420

 

555
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,520

yeah because I didn't account to the

556
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:40,530
yeah because I didn't account to the
 

557
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,590
yeah because I didn't account to the
fact that the half slabs are half a

558
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,600
fact that the half slabs are half a
 

559
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,480
fact that the half slabs are half a
block let's let's bring it up one more

560
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,490
block let's let's bring it up one more
 

561
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,900
block let's let's bring it up one more
I'll get rid of this junk yeah I think

562
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:47,910
I'll get rid of this junk yeah I think
 

563
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,640
I'll get rid of this junk yeah I think
that's a good plan oh yeah I like that a

564
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:52,650
that's a good plan oh yeah I like that a
 

565
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,470
that's a good plan oh yeah I like that a
lot more with the water raised up of

566
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
lot more with the water raised up of
 

567
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,380
lot more with the water raised up of
bits very nice very cool okay there's

568
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,390
bits very nice very cool okay there's
 

569
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,600
bits very nice very cool okay there's
not enough water I find though so I

570
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,610
not enough water I find though so I
 

571
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,880
not enough water I find though so I
think what we'll do is we'll try to make

572
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:07,890
think what we'll do is we'll try to make
 

573
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,520
think what we'll do is we'll try to make
the water come out this way as well and

574
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:12,530
the water come out this way as well and
 

575
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:18,350
the water come out this way as well and
have like a walkway here on the edge

576
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:18,360
have like a walkway here on the edge
 

577
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,830
have like a walkway here on the edge
with maybe some fences now maybe I won't

578
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:21,840
with maybe some fences now maybe I won't
 

579
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,110
with maybe some fences now maybe I won't
do the fences yeah we'll have the water

580
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,120
do the fences yeah we'll have the water
 

581
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,260
do the fences yeah we'll have the water
come out this way maybe go down here and

582
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,270
come out this way maybe go down here and
 

583
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,900
come out this way maybe go down here and
have like a cool waterfall going over

584
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:29,910
have like a cool waterfall going over
 

585
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,700
have like a cool waterfall going over
there I also feel we need the water to

586
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:34,710
there I also feel we need the water to
 

587
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,120
there I also feel we need the water to
come from somewhere over here so let's

588
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,130
come from somewhere over here so let's
 

589
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,100
come from somewhere over here so let's
that's a really nasty looking wall over

590
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,110
that's a really nasty looking wall over
 

591
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,260
that's a really nasty looking wall over
there isn't it so let's let's try to do

592
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,270
there isn't it so let's let's try to do
 

593
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,840
there isn't it so let's let's try to do
something with that

594
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:43,850
something with that
 

595
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,250
something with that
try build it up into a waterfall sort of

596
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,260
try build it up into a waterfall sort of
 

597
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,800
try build it up into a waterfall sort of
thing if we can because this is like a

598
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:54,810
thing if we can because this is like a
 

599
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,570
thing if we can because this is like a
main thing you see when you're coming

600
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:56,580
main thing you see when you're coming
 

601
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,530
main thing you see when you're coming
towards here you see this so it'd be

602
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:00,540
towards here you see this so it'd be
 

603
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,990
towards here you see this so it'd be
cool if it looks nice

604
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,000
cool if it looks nice
 

605
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,309
cool if it looks nice
let's build it up with dirt I think

606
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:07,319
let's build it up with dirt I think
 

607
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,500
let's build it up with dirt I think
maybe try get the water to fall here

608
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:11,510
maybe try get the water to fall here
 

609
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,770
maybe try get the water to fall here
where are those slimes I think they're

610
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:15,780
where are those slimes I think they're
 

611
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,090
where are those slimes I think they're
they might be under here I've gotten a

612
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,100
they might be under here I've gotten a
 

613
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,949
they might be under here I've gotten a
lot less slime since I have slapped that

614
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
lot less slime since I have slapped that
 

615
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,820
lot less slime since I have slapped that
thing it's so much better all right yes

616
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:27,830
thing it's so much better all right yes
 

617
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,529
thing it's so much better all right yes
water will come down here we kind of

618
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:30,539
water will come down here we kind of
 

619
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:33,470
water will come down here we kind of
want it to cascade down but we want it

620
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:33,480
want it to cascade down but we want it
 

621
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,680
want it to cascade down but we want it
to flow down to two here we don't want

622
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:36,690
to flow down to two here we don't want
 

623
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,440
to flow down to two here we don't want
it to spread all over the place either

624
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,450
it to spread all over the place either
 

625
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:49,990
it to spread all over the place either
let's build this up maybe like that yeah

626
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
let's build this up maybe like that yeah
 

627
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,230
let's build this up maybe like that yeah
build it up building it up mmm okay we

628
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
build it up building it up mmm okay we
 

629
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,510
build it up building it up mmm okay we
can try this here I'm gonna protect the

630
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,520
can try this here I'm gonna protect the
 

631
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,820
can try this here I'm gonna protect the
wiring here before I do anything oh yeah

632
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:07,830
wiring here before I do anything oh yeah
 

633

643
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,440
change over here alright let's see what
this looks like let's get a water stream

644
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,450
this looks like let's get a water stream
 

645
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,970
this looks like let's get a water stream

nicely oh that doesn't work do I have a
 

655
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,159
nicely oh that doesn't work do I have a
bucket no I don't how can I break this I

656
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:51,169
bucket no I don't how can I break this I
 

657
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:54,919
bucket no I don't how can I break this I
guess we'll do it this way this is a bit

658
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:54,929
guess we'll do it this way this is a bit
 

659
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:59,390
guess we'll do it this way this is a bit
tricky today we're gonna break it and

660
00:18:59,390 --> 00:18:59,400
tricky today we're gonna break it and
 

661
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,890
tricky today we're gonna break it and
then place a block come on can't even

662
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:03,900
then place a block come on can't even
 

663
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,490
then place a block come on can't even
reach it

664
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:04,500
reach it
 

665
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,380

669
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,909

hey let's let it settle then we'll break

670
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
hey let's let it settle then we'll break
 

671
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:24,460

it again oh that spread a lot didn't it

672
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,470
it again oh that spread a lot didn't it
 

673
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,049
it again oh that spread a lot didn't it
I wonder if that's too much I kinda

674
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:29,059
I wonder if that's too much I kinda
 

675
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,789
I wonder if that's too much I kinda
didn't want it to get right next to the

676
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
didn't want it to get right next to the
 

677
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,860
didn't want it to get right next to the
door here maybe I can just manually fix

678
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:32,870
door here maybe I can just manually fix
 

679
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:45,700
door here maybe I can just manually fix
it yeah yeah that looks weird I don't

know about that
alright anyway the other idea is I think

684
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:50,600
alright anyway the other idea is I think
 

685
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,360
alright anyway the other idea is I think
I want to stream just coming out of the

686

ceiling over here
 

689
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,860
ceiling over here
let's get another water block we'll put

690
00:19:59,860 --> 00:19:59,870
let's get another water block we'll put
 

691
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:05,340
let's get another water block we'll put
it right above here yeah okay

692
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,350
it right above here yeah okay
 

693
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,070
it right above here yeah okay

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:42,740
started to bring the water out this way
 

713
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,950
started to bring the water out this way
we're gonna we're gonna end up to here

714
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
we're gonna we're gonna end up to here
 

715
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,980
we're gonna we're gonna end up to here
today I think is what we'll do so the

716
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:47,990
today I think is what we'll do so the
 

717
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,080
today I think is what we'll do so the
ice is in place let's break it's get the

718
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,090
ice is in place let's break it's get the
 

719
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:56,289
ice is in place let's break it's get the
water going very cool oh you know what I

720
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:56,299
water going very cool oh you know what I
 

721
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,620
water going very cool oh you know what I
got put get the ice all the way over

722
00:20:59,620 --> 00:20:59,630
got put get the ice all the way over
 

723
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,080
got put get the ice all the way over
here to do that and it'll need another

724
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,090
here to do that and it'll need another
 

725
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,070
here to do that and it'll need another
one over here

726
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
one over here
 

727
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,320
one over here
perfect okay so let's join the two

728
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,330
perfect okay so let's join the two
 

729
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,590
perfect okay so let's join the two
together the two sides I only made the

730
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:14,600
together the two sides I only made the
 

731
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,419
together the two sides I only made the
water one deep over here because I think

732
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:16,429
water one deep over here because I think
 

733
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:18,340
water one deep over here because I think
that's it I think that's all it needs

734
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,350
that's it I think that's all it needs
 

735
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,670
that's it I think that's all it needs
really okay hop on up

736
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:22,680
really okay hop on up
 

737
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,390
really okay hop on up
and I wonder that maybe I'll just leave

738
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
and I wonder that maybe I'll just leave
 

739
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,820
and I wonder that maybe I'll just leave
it like that for right now how does this

740
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:28,830
it like that for right now how does this
 

741
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,720
it like that for right now how does this
feel this is good I almost wish I had

742
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:35,730
feel this is good I almost wish I had
 

743
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,880
feel this is good I almost wish I had
one more block like this way where I

744
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:37,890
one more block like this way where I
 

745
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,680
one more block like this way where I
could have water I feel like it needs it

746
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:39,690
could have water I feel like it needs it
 

747
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,900
could have water I feel like it needs it
it needs a little bit more water over

748
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:41,910
it needs a little bit more water over
 

749
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,250
it needs a little bit more water over
here but I'm liking that I think that's

750
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,260
here but I'm liking that I think that's
 

751
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,680
here but I'm liking that I think that's
a much much better improvement to what

752
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:48,690
a much much better improvement to what
 

753
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,620
a much much better improvement to what
we had before it's kind of different to

754
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:51,630
we had before it's kind of different to
 

755
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,510
we had before it's kind of different to
it it adds a lot of color to this area

756
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:56,520
it it adds a lot of color to this area
 

757
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,780
it it adds a lot of color to this area
compared to the the nasty grass we had

758
00:21:59,780 --> 00:21:59,790
compared to the the nasty grass we had
 

759
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,390
compared to the the nasty grass we had
here so we're also gonna be doing of

760
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
here so we're also gonna be doing of
 

761
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,440
here so we're also gonna be doing of
course like some some like greeneries

762
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,450
course like some some like greeneries
 

763
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,230
course like some some like greeneries
kind of stuff might try grow some trees

764
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,240
kind of stuff might try grow some trees
 

765
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,070
kind of stuff might try grow some trees

00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,880
I left him for I think ten minutes at
one point and he must have got sick

794
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:55,890

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:22,650
all the way to the end because it was
 

815
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,350
all the way to the end because it was
challenging keeping him alive

816
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,360
