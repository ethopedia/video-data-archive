00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
near here
 

169
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,470
near here
now i should probably mention this as

170
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
now i should probably mention this as
 

171
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,550
now i should probably mention this as
well last episode i teased the idea of

172
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
well last episode i teased the idea of
 

173
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,430
well last episode i teased the idea of
doing some kind of teleportation system

174
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
doing some kind of teleportation system
 

175
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,430
doing some kind of teleportation system
um it looks like it's been patched out

176
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
um it looks like it's been patched out
 

177
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,949
um it looks like it's been patched out
of the game now it was in the game for

178
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
of the game now it was in the game for
 

179
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,790
of the game now it was in the game for
many years but it doesn't seem to work

180
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
many years but it doesn't seem to work
 

181
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,309
many years but it doesn't seem to work
anymore you used to be able to throw an

182
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
anymore you used to be able to throw an
 

183
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,990
anymore you used to be able to throw an
ender pearl through

184
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
ender pearl through
 

185
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,550
ender pearl through
a nether portal it would go through and

186
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
a nether portal it would go through and
 

187
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,350
a nether portal it would go through and
land

188
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
land
 

189
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,270
land
in the overworld it would like actually

190
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
in the overworld it would like actually
 

191
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,710
in the overworld it would like actually
load the chunks

192
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
load the chunks
 

193
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,309
load the chunks
and land and then you would teleport

194
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
and land and then you would teleport
 

195
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,309
and land and then you would teleport
um the coordinates in the over world

196
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
um the coordinates in the over world
 

197
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,589
um the coordinates in the over world
like if you're in the nether

198
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
like if you're in the nether
 

199
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,350
like if you're in the nether
that would multiply your coordinates by

200
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
that would multiply your coordinates by
 

201
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,110
that would multiply your coordinates by
eight times basically or if you did it

202
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
eight times basically or if you did it
 

203
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,990
eight times basically or if you did it
the other way over

204
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
the other way over
 

205
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,229
the other way over
world to nether it would divide them by

206
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
world to nether it would divide them by
 

207
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,750
world to nether it would divide them by
eight and you could get back to spawn

208
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
eight and you could get back to spawn
 

209
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,869
eight and you could get back to spawn
quickly that way

210
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
quickly that way
 

211
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,630
quickly that way
and so i was hoping to set up a system

212
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
and so i was hoping to set up a system
 

213
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,070
and so i was hoping to set up a system
to precisely control

214
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
to precisely control
 

215
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,910
to precisely control
where the ender pearls would go but it

216
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
where the ender pearls would go but it
 

217
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,589
where the ender pearls would go but it
looks like it's not going to be possible

218
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
looks like it's not going to be possible
 

219
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,830
looks like it's not going to be possible
now

220
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
now
 

221
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,350
now
unfortunately

222
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360

little worried they're not going to fix

226
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
little worried they're not going to fix
 

227
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,630
little worried they're not going to fix
this bug before

228
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
this bug before
 

229
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,110
this bug before
they're done with the update you know so

230
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
they're done with the update you know so
 

231
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,470
they're done with the update you know so
lately i've been going through some of

232
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
lately i've been going through some of
 

233
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,229
lately i've been going through some of
our older projects and just figuring out

234
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
our older projects and just figuring out
 

235
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,670
our older projects and just figuring out
what works and what doesn't

236
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
what works and what doesn't
 

237
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,070
what works and what doesn't
what needs to be fixed um and i found

238
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
what needs to be fixed um and i found
 

239
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,789
what needs to be fixed um and i found
out

240
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
out
 

241
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,869
out
surprisingly this very first gold farm

242
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
surprisingly this very first gold farm
 

243
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,070
surprisingly this very first gold farm
we did

244
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
we did
 

245
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,789
we did
actually still works the the one that

246
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
actually still works the the one that
 

247
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,149
actually still works the the one that
sends them through the nether portal to

248
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
sends them through the nether portal to
 

249
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,309
sends them through the nether portal to
here and then we got the crusher

250
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
here and then we got the crusher
 

251
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,990
here and then we got the crusher
and stuff and then we got the trader guy

252
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
and stuff and then we got the trader guy
 

253
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,990
and stuff and then we got the trader guy
over here it's a little bit hard to

254
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
over here it's a little bit hard to
 

255
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,509
over here it's a little bit hard to
set it up so that they go through the

256
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
set it up so that they go through the
 

257
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,190
set it up so that they go through the
portal though because we got to disable

258
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
portal though because we got to disable
 

259
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,710
portal though because we got to disable
all the other portals

260
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
all the other portals
 

261
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,830
all the other portals
uh in our world basically uh but yeah it

262
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
uh in our world basically uh but yeah it
 

263
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,470
uh in our world basically uh but yeah it
does work

264
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
does work
 

265
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,470
does work
actually so that's kind of cool um

266
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
actually so that's kind of cool um
 

267
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,870
actually so that's kind of cool um

infinitely um i found out

288
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
infinitely um i found out
 

289
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,270
infinitely um i found out
you can't trade redstone infinitely with

290
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
you can't trade redstone infinitely with
 

291
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,749
you can't trade redstone infinitely with
him

292
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
him
 

293
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,749
him
now that he's restocked like it was

294
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
now that he's restocked like it was
 

295
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,430
now that he's restocked like it was
great out there you saw that

296
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
great out there you saw that
 

297
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,189
great out there you saw that
originally but now that he's restocked

298
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
originally but now that he's restocked
 

299
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,749
originally but now that he's restocked
it seems to be infinite

300
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
it seems to be infinite
 

301
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,430
it seems to be infinite
which is the first guy i found able to

302
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
which is the first guy i found able to
 

303
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,950
which is the first guy i found able to
do that in my world here

304
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
do that in my world here
 

305
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,189
do that in my world here
so can i use that

306
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
so can i use that
 

307
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,550
so can i use that
i don't know like redstone's one of

308
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
i don't know like redstone's one of
 

309
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,790
i don't know like redstone's one of
those items i always struggle to get and

projects in mind for this episode and

320
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
projects in mind for this episode and
 

321
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,990
projects in mind for this episode and
hopefully we can get to all of them

322
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
hopefully we can get to all of them
 

323
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,469
hopefully we can get to all of them
so by the nexus here this is an area we

324
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
so by the nexus here this is an area we
 

325
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,070
so by the nexus here this is an area we
frequent quite a bit

326
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
frequent quite a bit
 

327
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,150
frequent quite a bit
uh something we don't see as often

328
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
uh something we don't see as often
 

329
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,550
uh something we don't see as often
though is the guardian farms just right

over here i see it
 

333
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,350
over here i see it

this looks super boring and plain so i

344
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
this looks super boring and plain so i
 

345
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,990
this looks super boring and plain so i
think today we're gonna focus on

346
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
think today we're gonna focus on
 

347
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,070
think today we're gonna focus on
making this a bit nicer we have some

348
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
making this a bit nicer we have some
 

349
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,550
making this a bit nicer we have some
creeper blasts here that i never fixed

350
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
creeper blasts here that i never fixed
 

351
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,110
creeper blasts here that i never fixed
then there's a there's a lot of work to

352
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
then there's a there's a lot of work to
 

353
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,550
then there's a there's a lot of work to
do here

354
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
do here
 

355
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,189
do here
also if you cover guardian farms like

356
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
also if you cover guardian farms like
 

357
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,550
also if you cover guardian farms like
the water

358
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
the water
 

359
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,950
the water
it increases the spawn rate i thought it

360
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
it increases the spawn rate i thought it
 

361
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,310
it increases the spawn rate i thought it
was just a little bit but i checked the

362
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
was just a little bit but i checked the
 

363
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,510
was just a little bit but i checked the
wiki page

364
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
wiki page
 

365
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,029
wiki page
apparently it's 95 more efficient

366
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
apparently it's 95 more efficient
 

367
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,870
apparently it's 95 more efficient
uh it doesn't mean we're going to get 95

368
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
uh it doesn't mean we're going to get 95
 

369
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,270
uh it doesn't mean we're going to get 95
more guardians because like

370
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
more guardians because like
 

371
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,270
more guardians because like
um there's no mobs spawning in caves

372
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
um there's no mobs spawning in caves
 

373
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,469
um there's no mobs spawning in caves
near here so

374
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
near here so
 

375
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,070
near here so
it's it's just going to fail a little

376
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
it's it's just going to fail a little
 

377
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,230
it's it's just going to fail a little
bit less so it'll help out a bit

378
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
bit less so it'll help out a bit
 

379
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,070
bit less so it'll help out a bit
okay so here's the deal we built this a

380
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
okay so here's the deal we built this a
 

381
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,670
okay so here's the deal we built this a
long time ago and

382
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
long time ago and
 

383
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,590
long time ago and
i didn't plan stuff out super well back

384
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
i didn't plan stuff out super well back
 

385
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,510
i didn't plan stuff out super well back
then or choose block

386
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
then or choose block
 

387
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,830
then or choose block
pellets or anything back then really so

388
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
pellets or anything back then really so
 

389
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,189
pellets or anything back then really so
everything is built out of light blue

390
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
everything is built out of light blue
 

391
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,469
everything is built out of light blue
glass the floor

392
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
glass the floor
 

393
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,110
glass the floor
the walls everything light blue glass

394
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
the walls everything light blue glass
 

395
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,629
the walls everything light blue glass
and we're not going to be removing this

396
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
and we're not going to be removing this
 

397
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,270
and we're not going to be removing this
because it's

398
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
because it's
 

399
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,350
because it's
very difficult to remove glass in this

400
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
very difficult to remove glass in this
 

401
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,909
very difficult to remove glass in this
game very time consuming so instead

402
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
game very time consuming so instead
 

403
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,430
game very time consuming so instead
we're going to pick colors that work

404
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
we're going to pick colors that work
 

405
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,070
we're going to pick colors that work
well with

406
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
well with
 

407
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,469
well with
it um so i'm thinking we're gonna go for

408
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
it um so i'm thinking we're gonna go for
 

409
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,950
it um so i'm thinking we're gonna go for
the new warped wood

410
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
the new warped wood
 

411
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,510
the new warped wood
might be cool like the strip kind

412
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520

 

413
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,670

and then probably shroom lights for

414
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
and then probably shroom lights for
 

415
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,510
and then probably shroom lights for
orange as a contrasting color

416
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
orange as a contrasting color
 

417
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,029
orange as a contrasting color
kind of like the guardian color scheme

418
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
kind of like the guardian color scheme
 

419
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,710
kind of like the guardian color scheme
right they got the blue and the orange

420
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
right they got the blue and the orange
 

421
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,110
right they got the blue and the orange
on

422
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120

 

423
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,790

all right there was a system here for

424
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
all right there was a system here for
 

425
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,710
all right there was a system here for
picking up uh

426
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
picking up uh
 

427
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,189
picking up uh
ink drops from squid but squid don't

428
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
ink drops from squid but squid don't
 

429
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,629
ink drops from squid but squid don't
spawn in this farm anymore so we're just

430
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
spawn in this farm anymore so we're just
 

431
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,749
spawn in this farm anymore so we're just
going to remove that

432
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
going to remove that
 

433
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,510
going to remove that
yup yup this workbook looks pretty good

434
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
yup yup this workbook looks pretty good
 

435
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,790
yup yup this workbook looks pretty good
i think so we're going to be using that

436
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
i think so we're going to be using that
 

437
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,909
i think so we're going to be using that
for sure

438
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
for sure
 

439
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,670
for sure
and probably we'll mix prismarine with

440
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
and probably we'll mix prismarine with
 

441
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,430
and probably we'll mix prismarine with
it as well now here's the thing

442
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
it as well now here's the thing
 

443
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,550
it as well now here's the thing
we don't have to worry about mobs

444
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
we don't have to worry about mobs
 

445
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,150
we don't have to worry about mobs
spawning on this glass here but even

446
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
spawning on this glass here but even
 

447
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,510
spawning on this glass here but even
during the day time we're gonna get

448
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
during the day time we're gonna get
 

449
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,909
during the day time we're gonna get
slime

450
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
slime
 

451
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,510
slime
spawning down here this passes through

452
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
spawning down here this passes through
 

453
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,110
spawning down here this passes through
some slime chunks

454
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
some slime chunks
 

455
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,469
some slime chunks
so we gotta stop stuff from spawning

456
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
so we gotta stop stuff from spawning
 

457
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:22,950
so we gotta stop stuff from spawning
here

458
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
here
 

459
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,189
here
so we're gonna slab over this and i

460
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
so we're gonna slab over this and i
 

461
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,390
so we're gonna slab over this and i
think this is where our prismarine is

462
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
think this is where our prismarine is
 

463
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,430
think this is where our prismarine is
gonna come in

464
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
gonna come in
 

465
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,189
gonna come in
so i was thinking we'll go up a slab

466
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
so i was thinking we'll go up a slab
 

467
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,230
so i was thinking we'll go up a slab
and then we'll have the workbook it's a

468
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
and then we'll have the workbook it's a
 

469
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,150
and then we'll have the workbook it's a
little bit lighter i think

470
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
little bit lighter i think
 

471
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,749
little bit lighter i think
and then we'll go we'll kind of

472
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
and then we'll go we'll kind of
 

473
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,749
and then we'll go we'll kind of
transition we'll go

474
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
transition we'll go
 

475
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,469
transition we'll go
this and then we'll go a row of this and

476
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
this and then we'll go a row of this and
 

477
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,070
this and then we'll go a row of this and
then another row of this and then

478
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
then another row of this and then
 

479
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,270
then another row of this and then
another row of this

480
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
another row of this
 

481
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,550
another row of this
and then maybe we'll go back to dark

482
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
and then maybe we'll go back to dark
 

483
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,510
and then maybe we'll go back to dark
over here and then super dark and then

484
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
over here and then super dark and then
 

485
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,070
over here and then super dark and then
lighter dark and then back to this

486
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
lighter dark and then back to this
 

487
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,830
lighter dark and then back to this
and just do a bunch of rings around here

488
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
and just do a bunch of rings around here
 

489
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,749
and just do a bunch of rings around here
yeah i don't know about this one guys i

490
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
yeah i don't know about this one guys i
 

491
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,350
yeah i don't know about this one guys i
don't know like sometimes when i'm

492
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
don't know like sometimes when i'm
 

493
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,350
don't know like sometimes when i'm
building i'm super confident in what i'm

494
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
building i'm super confident in what i'm
 

495
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,150
building i'm super confident in what i'm
doing and this time it's like

496
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
doing and this time it's like
 

497
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,670
doing and this time it's like
well might be okay

498
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680

 

499
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,950

all right everybody so i think it's

500
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
all right everybody so i think it's
 

501
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,710
all right everybody so i think it's
about time we get started on our

502
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
about time we get started on our
 

503
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,029
about time we get started on our
second project of this episode we're

504
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
second project of this episode we're
 

505
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,110
second project of this episode we're
gonna be making a farm for the worked

506
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
gonna be making a farm for the worked
 

507
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,390
gonna be making a farm for the worked
wood and the crimson wood

508
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
wood and the crimson wood
 

509
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,710
wood and the crimson wood
shroom lights that kind of stuff we

510
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
shroom lights that kind of stuff we
 

511
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,830
shroom lights that kind of stuff we
haven't done that yet

512
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
haven't done that yet
 

513
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,670
haven't done that yet
and i am tired of farming that stuff

514
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
and i am tired of farming that stuff
 

515
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,510
and i am tired of farming that stuff
manually now i know there's ways of

516
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
manually now i know there's ways of
 

517
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,189
manually now i know there's ways of
making totally automated

518
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
making totally automated
 

519
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,589
making totally automated
versions of these farms they usually

520
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
versions of these farms they usually
 

521
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,110
versions of these farms they usually
require quite a bit of redstone and i

522
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
require quite a bit of redstone and i
 

523
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,790
require quite a bit of redstone and i
thought it might be nice to do a simple

524
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
thought it might be nice to do a simple
 

525
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,230
thought it might be nice to do a simple
one to get us started

526
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
one to get us started
 

527
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,790
one to get us started
like a simple effective one especially

528
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
like a simple effective one especially
 

529
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,149
like a simple effective one especially
for those of you that don't

530
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
for those of you that don't
 

531
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,350
for those of you that don't
like doing redstone projects um

532
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
like doing redstone projects um
 

533
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,550
like doing redstone projects um
so here's what we're gonna be doing

534
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
so here's what we're gonna be doing
 

535
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,470
so here's what we're gonna be doing
we're gonna have a space of seven

536
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
we're gonna have a space of seven
 

537
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,150
we're gonna have a space of seven
between the two sides here

538
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
between the two sides here
 

539
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,350
between the two sides here
and then just have two rows of

540
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
and then just have two rows of
 

541
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,350
and then just have two rows of
netherrack then we're gonna take our

542
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
netherrack then we're gonna take our
 

543
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,110
netherrack then we're gonna take our
bone meal and use it to start spreading

544
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
bone meal and use it to start spreading
 

545
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,870
bone meal and use it to start spreading
this nylon down the rows

546
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
this nylon down the rows
 

547
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,030
this nylon down the rows
so that we can plant the fungi on top of

548
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
so that we can plant the fungi on top of
 

549
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,949
so that we can plant the fungi on top of
it for growing the trees these things

550
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
it for growing the trees these things
 

551
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,750
it for growing the trees these things
here

552
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
here
 

553
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,310
here
um down the middle we're going to place

554
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
um down the middle we're going to place
 

555
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,590
um down the middle we're going to place
obsidian

556
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
obsidian
 

557
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,110
obsidian
one block above the netherrack and every

558
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
one block above the netherrack and every
 

559
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,269
one block above the netherrack and every
five blocks so a four block space

560
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
five blocks so a four block space
 

561
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,990
five blocks so a four block space
between the two this is what the tnt is

562
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
between the two this is what the tnt is
 

563
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,509
between the two this is what the tnt is
going to land on to blow up the trees

564
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
going to land on to blow up the trees
 

565
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,110
going to land on to blow up the trees
and harvest them

566
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
and harvest them
 

567
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,030
and harvest them
so this first layer of obsidian that the

568
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
so this first layer of obsidian that the
 

569
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,550
so this first layer of obsidian that the
tnt lands on will get

570
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
tnt lands on will get
 

571
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,389
tnt lands on will get
most of the wood from the trees but

572
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
most of the wood from the trees but
 

573
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,990
most of the wood from the trees but
shroom lights tend to spawn a little bit

574
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
shroom lights tend to spawn a little bit
 

575
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,350
shroom lights tend to spawn a little bit
higher up so we probably want to go at

576
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
higher up so we probably want to go at
 

577
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,550
higher up so we probably want to go at
least two layers

578
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
least two layers
 

579
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,790
least two layers
up with the obsidian so we're gonna have

580
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
up with the obsidian so we're gonna have
 

581
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,310
up with the obsidian so we're gonna have
a three block space and then at the

582
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
a three block space and then at the
 

583
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,470
a three block space and then at the
fourth block here

584
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
fourth block here
 

585
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,910
fourth block here
is where we're gonna do our next thing

586
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
is where we're gonna do our next thing
 

587
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,389
is where we're gonna do our next thing
of obsidian and that's gonna be placed

588
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
of obsidian and that's gonna be placed
 

589
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,470
of obsidian and that's gonna be placed
somewhere in between the two

590
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
somewhere in between the two
 

591
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,990
somewhere in between the two
all right and then we're gonna start a

592
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
all right and then we're gonna start a
 

593
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,590
all right and then we're gonna start a
third row with the netherrack

594
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
third row with the netherrack
 

595
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,269
third row with the netherrack
and i'm using the dirt there just the

596
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
and i'm using the dirt there just the
 

597
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,870
and i'm using the dirt there just the
scaffolding uh

598
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
scaffolding uh
 

599
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,790
scaffolding uh
but you can see all the spaces in the

600
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
but you can see all the spaces in the
 

601
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,470
but you can see all the spaces in the
netherrack line up with the obsidian

602
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
netherrack line up with the obsidian
 

603
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,509
netherrack line up with the obsidian
below

604
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
below
 

605
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,870
below
right so we do that and then uh we want

606
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
right so we do that and then uh we want
 

607
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,870
right so we do that and then uh we want
enough space between the netherrack and

608
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
enough space between the netherrack and
 

609
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,990
enough space between the netherrack and
the obsidian that's

610
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
the obsidian that's
 

611
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,350
the obsidian that's
the tnt is not going to blow up our

612
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
the tnt is not going to blow up our
 

613
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,070
the tnt is not going to blow up our
dispensers so

614
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
dispensers so
 

615
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,509
dispensers so
i'm hoping this is enough we got one two

616
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
i'm hoping this is enough we got one two
 

617
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,670
i'm hoping this is enough we got one two
three four five six seven eight nine

618
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
three four five six seven eight nine
 

619
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,110
three four five six seven eight nine
at the tenth block here is where i got

620
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
at the tenth block here is where i got
 

621
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,389
at the tenth block here is where i got
the netherrack we'll see if that works

622
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
the netherrack we'll see if that works
 

623
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,190
the netherrack we'll see if that works
or not

624
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
or not
 

625
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,910
or not
but i'm gonna go underneath now and

626
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
but i'm gonna go underneath now and
 

627
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,750
but i'm gonna go underneath now and
start placing our dispensers facing down

628
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
start placing our dispensers facing down
 

629
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,829
start placing our dispensers facing down
this is where the tnt is gonna go in

630
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
this is where the tnt is gonna go in
 

631
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,829
this is where the tnt is gonna go in
okay so i got a fair bit of tnt on hand

632
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
okay so i got a fair bit of tnt on hand
 

633
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,590
okay so i got a fair bit of tnt on hand
so i'll probably put a full stack of tnt

634
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
so i'll probably put a full stack of tnt
 

635
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,670
so i'll probably put a full stack of tnt
in each of these as we go along

636
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
in each of these as we go along
 

637
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,509
in each of these as we go along
uh now the important thing is when they

638
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
uh now the important thing is when they
 

639
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,430
uh now the important thing is when they
shoot out of the dispenser they don't go

640
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
shoot out of the dispenser they don't go
 

641
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,269
shoot out of the dispenser they don't go
perfectly straight down they'll go a

642
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
perfectly straight down they'll go a
 

643
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,949
perfectly straight down they'll go a
little bit to the left or the right or

644
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
little bit to the left or the right or
 

645
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,110
little bit to the left or the right or
forward or back and they might not land

646
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
forward or back and they might not land
 

647
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,990
forward or back and they might not land
on the obsidian

648
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
on the obsidian
 

649
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,389
on the obsidian
properly if that happens so we put

650
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
properly if that happens so we put
 

651
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,230
properly if that happens so we put
blocks around

652
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
blocks around
 

653
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,110
blocks around
the dispensers one block below here just

654
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
the dispensers one block below here just
 

655
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,829
the dispensers one block below here just
to make sure

656
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
to make sure
 

657
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,190
to make sure
it's going to hit one of the edges of

658
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
it's going to hit one of the edges of
 

659
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,030
it's going to hit one of the edges of
these blocks and align perfectly

660
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
these blocks and align perfectly
 

661
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,790
these blocks and align perfectly
straight

662
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
if we want to get a little bit more
 

665
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,990
if we want to get a little bit more
fancy with this farm we can also add

666
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
fancy with this farm we can also add
 

667
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,509
fancy with this farm we can also add
water down the middle and then

668
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
water down the middle and then
 

669
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,230
water down the middle and then

blocks
 

673
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,630
blocks
on both sides and then we'll have a drop

674
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
on both sides and then we'll have a drop
 

675
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,750
on both sides and then we'll have a drop
down

676
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
down
 

677
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,670
down
and i'm gonna go along here with our our

678
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
and i'm gonna go along here with our our
 

679
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,430
and i'm gonna go along here with our our
pick and break and all

680

pick and break and all
 

681
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,509
pick and break and all
that'll function as a very simple item

682
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
that'll function as a very simple item
 

683
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,190
that'll function as a very simple item
collection system to our farm

684
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
collection system to our farm
 

685
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,030
collection system to our farm
and now i think we're ready to get it

686
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
and now i think we're ready to get it
 

687
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,630
and now i think we're ready to get it
going here so let's go along and start

688
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
going here so let's go along and start
 

689
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,670
going here so let's go along and start

our first batch of trees and we'll find

692
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
our first batch of trees and we'll find
 

693
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,829
our first batch of trees and we'll find
out how much of this i messed up

694
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
out how much of this i messed up
 

695
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,509
out how much of this i messed up
very good very good so we got our first

696
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
very good very good so we got our first
 

697
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,350
very good very good so we got our first
batch of trees grown here and this is

698
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
batch of trees grown here and this is
 

699
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,110
batch of trees grown here and this is
what it ended up looking like and you

700
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
what it ended up looking like and you
 

701
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,190
what it ended up looking like and you
can see some of the trees get very tall

702
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
can see some of the trees get very tall
 

703
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,110
can see some of the trees get very tall
actually but most of them are about at

704
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
actually but most of them are about at
 

705
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,910
actually but most of them are about at
this level

706
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
this level
 

707
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,190
this level
here that's like the average um

708
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
here that's like the average um
 

709
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,389
here that's like the average um
unfortunately it does

710
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
unfortunately it does
 

711
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,470
unfortunately it does
kill all the nilium under underneath if

712
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
kill all the nilium under underneath if
 

713
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,190
kill all the nilium under underneath if
you have blocks above so

714
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
you have blocks above so
 

715
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,630
you have blocks above so
the slower we go here the more of it

716
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
the slower we go here the more of it
 

717
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,550
the slower we go here the more of it
will die but i

718
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
will die but i
 

719
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,990
will die but i
i just want to show you some stuff

720
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
i just want to show you some stuff
 

721
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,750
i just want to show you some stuff
before we start blasting

722
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
before we start blasting
 

723
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,990
before we start blasting
so you can see some of it will reach up

724
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
so you can see some of it will reach up
 

725
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,350
so you can see some of it will reach up
to this block

726
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
to this block
 

727
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,350
to this block
uh but none of it seems to get to the

728
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
uh but none of it seems to get to the
 

729
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,110
uh but none of it seems to get to the
very middle here so that seven block

730
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
very middle here so that seven block
 

731
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,269
very middle here so that seven block
space in between is very important

732
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
space in between is very important
 

733
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,630
space in between is very important
because if that netherwart spawned

734
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
because if that netherwart spawned
 

735
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,949
because if that netherwart spawned
underneath the dispensers then the tnt

736
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
underneath the dispensers then the tnt
 

737
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,310
underneath the dispensers then the tnt
will land right on it

738
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
will land right on it
 

739
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,030
will land right on it
and then blow up our platform up there

740
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
and then blow up our platform up there
 

741
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,509
and then blow up our platform up there
and

742
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
and
 

743
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,110
and
i think the way we're gonna activate

744
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
i think the way we're gonna activate
 

745
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,949
i think the way we're gonna activate
this like we could set up some redstone

746
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
this like we could set up some redstone
 

747
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,110
this like we could set up some redstone
but i think the idea with this farm

748
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
but i think the idea with this farm
 

749
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,269
but i think the idea with this farm
is to keep it as simple as possible for

750
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
is to keep it as simple as possible for
 

751
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,389
is to keep it as simple as possible for
you guys

752
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
you guys
 

753
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,590
you guys
so this is what we're gonna do it's very

754
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
so this is what we're gonna do it's very
 

755
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,870
so this is what we're gonna do it's very
low tech but we're gonna be using

756
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
low tech but we're gonna be using
 

757
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,990
low tech but we're gonna be using
pressure plates to activate

758
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
pressure plates to activate
 

759
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,310
pressure plates to activate
the dispensers and ourselves as the

760
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
the dispensers and ourselves as the
 

761
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,069
the dispensers and ourselves as the
timer for this farm

762
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
timer for this farm
 

763
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,150
timer for this farm
why do we need a timer what is going on

764
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
why do we need a timer what is going on
 

765
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,350
why do we need a timer what is going on
here let me tell you

766
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
here let me tell you
 

767
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,670
here let me tell you
one other thing about this so let's say

768
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
one other thing about this so let's say
 

769
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,069
one other thing about this so let's say
tnt lands on this obsidian and then tnt

770
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
tnt lands on this obsidian and then tnt
 

771
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,990
tnt lands on this obsidian and then tnt
lands on this one and this one blows up

772
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
lands on this one and this one blows up
 

773
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,829
lands on this one and this one blows up
first uh it's gonna push the tnt on this

774
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
first uh it's gonna push the tnt on this
 

775
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,230
first uh it's gonna push the tnt on this
one

776
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
one
 

777
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,590
one
over away from this one and that might

778
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
over away from this one and that might
 

779
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,629
over away from this one and that might
cause it to

780
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
cause it to
 

781
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,110
cause it to
fall off of here or just move over a

782
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
fall off of here or just move over a
 

783
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,790
fall off of here or just move over a
little bit and start blowing up stuff we

784
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
little bit and start blowing up stuff we
 

785
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,790
little bit and start blowing up stuff we
don't want it to like this netherrack

786
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
don't want it to like this netherrack
 

787
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,350
don't want it to like this netherrack
so we got to kind of control when this

788
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
so we got to kind of control when this
 

789
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,110
so we got to kind of control when this
stuff gets released

790
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
stuff gets released
 

791
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,629
stuff gets released
and we're going to use ourselves to do

792
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
and we're going to use ourselves to do
 

793
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,389
and we're going to use ourselves to do
that so the trick is we're actually just

794
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
that so the trick is we're actually just
 

795
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,990
that so the trick is we're actually just
going to hold shift to slow ourselves

796
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
going to hold shift to slow ourselves
 

797
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,829
going to hold shift to slow ourselves
down and by the time we go from this

798
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
down and by the time we go from this
 

799
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,870
down and by the time we go from this
pressure plate to the next one over

800
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
pressure plate to the next one over
 

801
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,710
pressure plate to the next one over
uh this tnt is going to be exploded

802
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
uh this tnt is going to be exploded
 

803
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,829
uh this tnt is going to be exploded
hopefully

804
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839

 

805
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,590

we can kind of just go unfortunately we

806
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
we can kind of just go unfortunately we
 

807
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,389
we can kind of just go unfortunately we
can't see the farm working though

808
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
can't see the farm working though
 

809
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,790
can't see the farm working though
just gonna look back and make

810
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:03,800
just gonna look back and make
 

811
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,509
just gonna look back and make

yeah this sure not blowing up so i think

814
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
yeah this sure not blowing up so i think
 

815
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,230
yeah this sure not blowing up so i think
we have enough space in between that's

816
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
we have enough space in between that's
 

817
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,949
we have enough space in between that's
good

818
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
good
 

819
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:18,829
good
let's keep going here all the way to the

820
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839

 

821
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,310

end

822
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
end
 

823
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,550
end
okay here we go we made it to the very

824
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
okay here we go we made it to the very
 

825
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,710
okay here we go we made it to the very
end let's go see the damage down there

826
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720

 

827
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,470

yeah see the stuff falling in the water

828
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
yeah see the stuff falling in the water
 

829
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,230
yeah see the stuff falling in the water
going over the edges

830
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
going over the edges
 

831
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,430
going over the edges
cool cool and you can see we took out a

832
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
cool cool and you can see we took out a
 

833
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,870
cool cool and you can see we took out a
pretty good chunk of the

834
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
pretty good chunk of the
 

835
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,389
pretty good chunk of the
the wood and the nether wharton stuff

836
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
the wood and the nether wharton stuff
 

837
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,990
the wood and the nether wharton stuff
none of the netherrack got exploded

838
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
none of the netherrack got exploded
 

839
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,110
none of the netherrack got exploded
that's great

840
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
that's great
 

841
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,949
that's great
some of it's going to land on the

842
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
some of it's going to land on the
 

843
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,030
some of it's going to land on the
netherrack there

844
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
netherrack there
 

845
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,509
netherrack there
uh it'll fall down if we grow another

846
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
uh it'll fall down if we grow another
 

847
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,710
uh it'll fall down if we grow another
tree though

848
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
tree though
 

849
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,590
tree though
and i did a really crummy collection

850
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
and i did a really crummy collection
 

851
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,310
and i did a really crummy collection
system

852
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
system
 

853
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,990
system
looks like some of it's getting stuck so

854
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
looks like some of it's getting stuck so
 

855
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,110
looks like some of it's getting stuck so
probably gonna make something a bit

856
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
probably gonna make something a bit
 

857
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,629
probably gonna make something a bit
fancier

858
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
fancier
 

859
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,069
fancier
okay there was none on this other side

860
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
okay there was none on this other side
 

861
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,910
okay there was none on this other side
so it's it's not too bad

862
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
so it's it's not too bad
 

863
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,829
so it's it's not too bad
all right so then all of our drops got

864
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
all right so then all of our drops got
 

865
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,590
all right so then all of our drops got
collected together over here and let's

866
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
collected together over here and let's
 

867
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,870
collected together over here and let's
see the grand total from one harvest

868
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
see the grand total from one harvest
 

869
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,829
see the grand total from one harvest
okay lots of netherwart blocks and

870
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839

 

871
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,430

not as much as i would have expected

872
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
not as much as i would have expected
 

873
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,509
not as much as i would have expected
honestly three

874
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
honestly three
 

875
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,990
honestly three
okay okay and 27 shroom lights

876
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
okay okay and 27 shroom lights
 

877
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,150
okay okay and 27 shroom lights
i wonder if much of it got exploded i

878
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
i wonder if much of it got exploded i
 

879
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,150
i wonder if much of it got exploded i
hope not

880
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
hope not
 

881
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,829
hope not
it might be worth just going across here

882
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
it might be worth just going across here
 

883
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,350
it might be worth just going across here
and picking it up too then because i'm

884
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
and picking it up too then because i'm
 

885
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,550
and picking it up too then because i'm
sure there's a bit here

886
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
sure there's a bit here
 

887
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,269
sure there's a bit here
okay wait a sec did i take it out of

888
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
okay wait a sec did i take it out of
 

889
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:31,750
okay wait a sec did i take it out of
here

890
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
here
 

891
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,590
here
no that that was still in there so there

892
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
no that that was still in there so there
 

893
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,430
no that that was still in there so there
was a lot on the nether rack actually

894
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
was a lot on the nether rack actually
 

895
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,550
was a lot on the nether rack actually
there was one two three

896
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
there was one two three
 

897
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,269
there was one two three
just about four stacks of wood all right

898
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
just about four stacks of wood all right
 

899
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,189
just about four stacks of wood all right
good stuff so i did a few harvests there

900
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
good stuff so i did a few harvests there
 

901
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,590
good stuff so i did a few harvests there
and we got a bunch of warp stems to work

902
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
and we got a bunch of warp stems to work
 

903
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,230
and we got a bunch of warp stems to work
with

904
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
with
 

905
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,829
with
so we're back at the guardian farm again

906
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
so we're back at the guardian farm again
 

907
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,430
so we're back at the guardian farm again
now we got the materials to

908
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
now we got the materials to
 

909
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,750
now we got the materials to
to work on this um i think i was getting

910
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
to work on this um i think i was getting
 

911
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,629
to work on this um i think i was getting
like 3.5 wood per tree which isn't bad

912
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
like 3.5 wood per tree which isn't bad
 

913
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,990
like 3.5 wood per tree which isn't bad
but we weren't getting a whole lot of

914
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
but we weren't getting a whole lot of
 

915
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,870
but we weren't getting a whole lot of
shroom lights i was a little

916
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
shroom lights i was a little
 

917
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,189
shroom lights i was a little
disappointed with that honestly

918
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
disappointed with that honestly
 

919
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,389
disappointed with that honestly
so yeah it's it's not going to be like a

920
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
so yeah it's it's not going to be like a
 

921
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,389
so yeah it's it's not going to be like a
long-term solution for sure

922
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
long-term solution for sure
 

923
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,430
long-term solution for sure
um we can convert that over to like an

924
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
um we can convert that over to like an
 

925
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,189
um we can convert that over to like an
acacia farm or something though like if

926
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
acacia farm or something though like if
 

927
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,710
acacia farm or something though like if
we replace the netherrack with

928
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
we replace the netherrack with
 

929
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,350
we replace the netherrack with
soil and grow like birch trees acacia

930
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
soil and grow like birch trees acacia
 

931
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,629
soil and grow like birch trees acacia
trees oak trees

932
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
trees oak trees
 

933
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,990
trees oak trees
and then when we get to the top here

934
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
and then when we get to the top here
 

935
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,269
and then when we get to the top here
what are we gonna do i think we're gonna

936
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
what are we gonna do i think we're gonna
 

937
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,269
what are we gonna do i think we're gonna
go down the center let's get our silk

938
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
go down the center let's get our silk
 

939
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,030
go down the center let's get our silk
touch

940
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
touch
 

941
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,389
touch
then we're gonna build this back up to

942
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
then we're gonna build this back up to
 

943
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,910
then we're gonna build this back up to
the top with shroom lights down the

944
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
the top with shroom lights down the
 

945
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,430
the top with shroom lights down the
center of the column

946
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
center of the column
 

947
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,189
center of the column
and yeah check it out so that gives us a

948
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
and yeah check it out so that gives us a
 

949
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,790
and yeah check it out so that gives us a
very simple column here but

950
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
very simple column here but
 

951
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,269
very simple column here but
i think it's what we're gonna go with

952
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
i think it's what we're gonna go with
 

953
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,470
i think it's what we're gonna go with
simple is good though because we're

954
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
simple is good though because we're
 

955
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,310
simple is good though because we're
going large scale with this so

956
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
going large scale with this so
 

957
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,910
going large scale with this so
um we want something that's easy to

958
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
um we want something that's easy to
 

959
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,350
um we want something that's easy to
produce

960
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
produce
 

961
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,189
produce
and it's got a bit of 3d depth to it i

962
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
and it's got a bit of 3d depth to it i
 

963
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,269
and it's got a bit of 3d depth to it i
like that it gives off light

964
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
like that it gives off light
 

965
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,870
like that it gives off light
it's another plus to it so i think

966
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
it's another plus to it so i think
 

967
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,470
it's another plus to it so i think
that's the style we're going to go for

968
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
that's the style we're going to go for
 

969
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,069
that's the style we're going to go for
so that's going to go up

970
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
so that's going to go up
 

971
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,509
so that's going to go up
it's going to go around each of these

972
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
it's going to go around each of these
 

973
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,670
it's going to go around each of these
edges all the way over here and we're

974
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
edges all the way over here and we're
 

975
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,269
edges all the way over here and we're
going to make like a cube out of it

976
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
going to make like a cube out of it
 

977
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,550
going to make like a cube out of it
and then probably we'll do it on this

978
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
and then probably we'll do it on this
 

979
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,949
and then probably we'll do it on this
side as well but let's just do this

980
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
side as well but let's just do this
 

981
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,790
side as well but let's just do this
interior part first

982
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
interior part first
 

983
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,870
interior part first
oh and also uh we're gonna use it to

984
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
oh and also uh we're gonna use it to
 

985
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,550
oh and also uh we're gonna use it to
make like a border

986
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
make like a border
 

987
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,269
make like a border
um like over here i think

988
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279

 

989
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,870

yeah and it'll connect like at the

990
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
yeah and it'll connect like at the
 

991
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,870
yeah and it'll connect like at the

here we got to replace this glass with

1030
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
here we got to replace this glass with
 

1031
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,749
here we got to replace this glass with
shroom lights

1032
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
shroom lights
 

1033
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,150
shroom lights
all the way down and then we'll have

1034
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
all the way down and then we'll have
 

1035
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,990
all the way down and then we'll have
another beam going across the water

1036
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
another beam going across the water
 

1037
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,949
another beam going across the water
question mark yeah and then we'll have

1038
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
question mark yeah and then we'll have
 

1039
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,110
question mark yeah and then we'll have
to fill this in with something

1040
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
to fill this in with something
 

1041
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,029
to fill this in with something
all this poor llama that guy pushed him

1042
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
all this poor llama that guy pushed him
 

1043
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,630
all this poor llama that guy pushed him
off like 10 minutes ago and he's still

1044
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
off like 10 minutes ago and he's still
 

1045
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,069
off like 10 minutes ago and he's still
bouncing around

1046
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
bouncing around
 

1047
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,829
bouncing around
it is a bit on the plane side still but

1048
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
it is a bit on the plane side still but
 

1049
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,150
it is a bit on the plane side still but
i think we can add a bit more to it

1050
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
i think we can add a bit more to it
 

1051
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,470
i think we can add a bit more to it
over time i i think it does look a lot

1052
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
over time i i think it does look a lot
 

1053
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,069
over time i i think it does look a lot
better than what we had originally here

1054
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
better than what we had originally here
 

1055
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,150
better than what we had originally here
though with just the glass uh

1056
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
though with just the glass uh
 

1057
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,069
though with just the glass uh
still not quite finished with our design

1058
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
still not quite finished with our design
 

1059
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,829
still not quite finished with our design
down here i think the thing that's kind

1060
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
down here i think the thing that's kind
 

1061
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,110
down here i think the thing that's kind
of

1062
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
of
 

1063
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,549
of
making me wonder about is maybe i should

1064

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,630
guardian farm down here
this is where we actually go to get our

1082
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
this is where we actually go to get our

stuff um
 

1085
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,750
stuff um
but we were totally out of prison marine

1086
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
but we were totally out of prison marine
 

1087
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,870
but we were totally out of prison marine
for a long time here and let's see

1088
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
for a long time here and let's see
 

1089
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,390
for a long time here and let's see
okay so while building that we got like

1090
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
okay so while building that we got like
 

1091
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,630
okay so while building that we got like
a double chest pool

1092
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
a double chest pool
 

1093
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,990
a double chest pool
cool cool all right that should be

1094
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
cool cool all right that should be
 

1095
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,669
cool cool all right that should be
enough to do a bit more here

1096
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
enough to do a bit more here
 

1097
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,110
enough to do a bit more here
yeah so i think next up here we're going

1098
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
yeah so i think next up here we're going
 

1099
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,669
yeah so i think next up here we're going
to try add in some prismarine walls for

1100
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
to try add in some prismarine walls for
 

1101
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,230
to try add in some prismarine walls for
a bit

1102
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
a bit
 

1103
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,870
a bit
a bit more detail to it i feel like they

1104
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
a bit more detail to it i feel like they
 

1105
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,630
a bit more detail to it i feel like they
would look cool if we added them all

1106
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
would look cool if we added them all
 

1107
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,590
would look cool if we added them all
along

1108
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
along
 

1109
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,270
along
the sides it's pretty close in color

1110
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
the sides it's pretty close in color
 

1111
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,909
the sides it's pretty close in color
and then maybe we do some kind of at the

1112
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
and then maybe we do some kind of at the
 

1113
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,830
and then maybe we do some kind of at the
top there

1114
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840

 

1115
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,310

no aha so check it out we got a woohoo

1116
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
no aha so check it out we got a woohoo
 

1117
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,830
no aha so check it out we got a woohoo
so i don't want to cover up too much of

1118
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
so i don't want to cover up too much of
 

1119
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,270
so i don't want to cover up too much of
the glass because again the point is we

1120
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
the glass because again the point is we
 

1121
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,630
the glass because again the point is we
want to be able to see the guardians in

1122
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
want to be able to see the guardians in
 

1123
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,310
want to be able to see the guardians in
the farm right but i think having just a

1124
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
the farm right but i think having just a
 

1125
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,909
the farm right but i think having just a
little down the top there's fine

1126
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919

 

1127
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,830

so i mentioned we used to get squid

1128
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
so i mentioned we used to get squid
 

1129
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,669
so i mentioned we used to get squid
spawning in our guardian farm and we

1130
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
spawning in our guardian farm and we
 

1131
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,669
spawning in our guardian farm and we
don't anymore and i just checked we're

1132
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
don't anymore and i just checked we're
 

1133
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,990
don't anymore and i just checked we're
down to our final like chest of ink

1134
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
down to our final like chest of ink
 

1135
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,870
down to our final like chest of ink
sacks

1136
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
sacks
 

1137
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,669
sacks
so we're gonna run out pretty soon in

1138
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
so we're gonna run out pretty soon in
 

1139
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,549
so we're gonna run out pretty soon in
our world here

1140
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
our world here
 

1141
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,830
our world here
we're gonna have to add that to our list

1142
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
we're gonna have to add that to our list
 

1143
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,430
we're gonna have to add that to our list
of things to do we need a either a

1144
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
of things to do we need a either a
 

1145
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,669
of things to do we need a either a
wither rose farm or another squid farm

1146
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
wither rose farm or another squid farm
 

1147
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,870
wither rose farm or another squid farm

more building here and used up all that

1152
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
more building here and used up all that
 

1153
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,230
more building here and used up all that
warped wood we harvested and all the

1154
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
warped wood we harvested and all the
 

1155
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,110
warped wood we harvested and all the
shroom lights

1156
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
shroom lights
 

1157
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,950
shroom lights
um it's probably a good stopping point

1158
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
um it's probably a good stopping point
 

1159
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,310
um it's probably a good stopping point
for this project today because there's

1160
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
for this project today because there's
 

1161
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,710
for this project today because there's
many more hours left to go on it

1162
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
many more hours left to go on it
 

1163
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,870
many more hours left to go on it
but uh yeah i think we got the center

1164
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
but uh yeah i think we got the center
 

1165
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,310
but uh yeah i think we got the center
thing completely done

1166
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
thing completely done
 

1167
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,789
thing completely done
unless we want to add more details to

1168
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
unless we want to add more details to
 

1169
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,750
unless we want to add more details to
the

1170
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
the
 

1171
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,430
the
columns or something but yeah i think

1172
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
columns or something but yeah i think
 

1173
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,830
columns or something but yeah i think
it's good did the prismarine on all four

1174
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
it's good did the prismarine on all four
 

1175
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,950
it's good did the prismarine on all four
sides

1176
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
sides
 

1177
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,669
sides
um got the shroom lights all in we

1178
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
um got the shroom lights all in we
 

1179
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,430
um got the shroom lights all in we
finished up the rug

1180
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
finished up the rug
 

1181
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,789
finished up the rug
down here and even filled in the little

1182
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
down here and even filled in the little
 

1183
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,430
down here and even filled in the little
space we have there was all stone before

1184
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
space we have there was all stone before
 

1185
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,230
space we have there was all stone before
uh

1186
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
uh
 

1187
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,470
uh
and then on the top we did cover that up

1188
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
and then on the top we did cover that up
 

1189
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,390
and then on the top we did cover that up
too just made like a

1190
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
too just made like a
 

1191
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,990
too just made like a
giant target kind of kind of strange

1192
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
giant target kind of kind of strange
 

1193
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,590
giant target kind of kind of strange
and then we got started on one of the

1194
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
and then we got started on one of the
 

1195
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,110
and then we got started on one of the
sides here still

1196
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
sides here still
 

1197
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,630
sides here still
trying to figure out what we're gonna do

1198
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
trying to figure out what we're gonna do
 

1199
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,630
trying to figure out what we're gonna do
exactly i feel like

1200
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
exactly i feel like
 

1201
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,070
exactly i feel like
like i tried doing one of these columns

1202
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
like i tried doing one of these columns
 

1203
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,669
like i tried doing one of these columns
i feel like this needs to be

1204
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
i feel like this needs to be
 

1205
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,750
i feel like this needs to be
wider like maybe instead of a three

1206
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
wider like maybe instead of a three
 

1207
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,590
wider like maybe instead of a three
block like a three by three maybe a five

1208
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
block like a three by three maybe a five
 

1209
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,470
block like a three by three maybe a five
by five would be

1210
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
by five would be
 

1211
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,590
by five would be
better since the sides longer as far as

1212
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
better since the sides longer as far as
 

1213
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,190
better since the sides longer as far as
what we're gonna do on the four sides

1214
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
what we're gonna do on the four sides
 

1215
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,150
what we're gonna do on the four sides
here i'm not

1216
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
here i'm not
 

1217
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,310
here i'm not
quite sure i'm open to suggestions but i

1218
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
quite sure i'm open to suggestions but i
 

1219
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,909
quite sure i'm open to suggestions but i
was thinking maybe

1220
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
was thinking maybe
 

1221
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,110
was thinking maybe
we do some enormous kelp farm like if we

1222
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
we do some enormous kelp farm like if we
 

1223
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,710
we do some enormous kelp farm like if we
fill this up all the way i think each

1224
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
fill this up all the way i think each
 

1225
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,230
fill this up all the way i think each
side's 64 blocks

1226
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
side's 64 blocks
 

1227
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,270
side's 64 blocks
long so that would be like 256 kelp

1228
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
long so that would be like 256 kelp
 

1229
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,950
long so that would be like 256 kelp
plants we could squeeze into here if we

1230
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
plants we could squeeze into here if we
 

1231
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,830
plants we could squeeze into here if we
wanted

1232
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
wanted
 

1233
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,669
wanted
and then it would kind of mirror like

1234
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
and then it would kind of mirror like
 

1235
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,029
and then it would kind of mirror like
what we have on this side we'd have the

1236
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
what we have on this side we'd have the
 

1237
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,190
what we have on this side we'd have the
glass in the water on this side as well

1238
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
glass in the water on this side as well
 

1239
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,190
glass in the water on this side as well
also i'm not sure should we add more

1240
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
also i'm not sure should we add more
 

1241
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,590
also i'm not sure should we add more
columns like part way down here or do

1242
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
columns like part way down here or do
 

1243
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,070
columns like part way down here or do
you think

1244
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
you think
 

1245
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,590
you think
just two in the corners is enough to

1246
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
just two in the corners is enough to
 

1247
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,669
just two in the corners is enough to
support it and probably the most

1248
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
support it and probably the most
 

1249
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,430
support it and probably the most
important view here is a distance view

1250
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
important view here is a distance view
 

1251
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,390
important view here is a distance view
because most of the time we're just

1252
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
because most of the time we're just
 

1253
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,070
because most of the time we're just
gonna fly by this thing it's very rare

1254
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
gonna fly by this thing it's very rare
 

1255
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,470
gonna fly by this thing it's very rare
we're actually gonna go down

1256
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
we're actually gonna go down
 

1257
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,270
we're actually gonna go down
um down there to check it out

1258
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
um down there to check it out
 

1259
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,590
um down there to check it out
okay so next up here we got a bit of an

1260
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
okay so next up here we got a bit of an
 

1261
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,149
okay so next up here we got a bit of an
errand to run we gotta get some fuel for

1262
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
errand to run we gotta get some fuel for
 

1263
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,029
errand to run we gotta get some fuel for
a couple of our smelting things so stop

1264
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
a couple of our smelting things so stop
 

1265
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,029
a couple of our smelting things so stop
by the bamboozler let's get this thing

1266
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
by the bamboozler let's get this thing
 

1267
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,070
by the bamboozler let's get this thing
fired up

1268

fired up
and just see how long it takes we got to

1270
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
and just see how long it takes we got to
 

1271
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,070
and just see how long it takes we got to
fill up three shockers of bamboo

1272
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
fill up three shockers of bamboo
 

1273

over here i
 

1291
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,390
over here i
i realized it was out of coal and uh

it's been backing up so that's not good

1294
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
it's been backing up so that's not good
 

1295

you get the bamboo in here i guess it's
 

1297
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,230
you get the bamboo in here i guess it's
only a single chest i thought it was a

1298
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
only a single chest i thought it was a
 

1299
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,669
only a single chest i thought it was a
double chest here

1300
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
double chest here
 

1301
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,789
double chest here
uh-oh um and it was uh between 30 and 35

1302
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
uh-oh um and it was uh between 30 and 35
 

1303

seconds per shulker i just to fill up

1304
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
seconds per shulker i just to fill up
 

1305
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,870
seconds per shulker i just to fill up
at the bamboozler all right let's make

1306
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
at the bamboozler all right let's make
 

1307
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,310
at the bamboozler all right let's make
it a double chest the other thing we

1308
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
it a double chest the other thing we
 

1309
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,990
it a double chest the other thing we
gotta refill here is over at our gold

1310
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
gotta refill here is over at our gold
 

1311
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,390
gotta refill here is over at our gold

a couple other things also changed with

1386
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
a couple other things also changed with
 

1387
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,310
a couple other things also changed with
the bartering they added water bottles

1388
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
the bartering they added water bottles
 

1389
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,669
the bartering they added water bottles
as one of the trade items

1390
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
as one of the trade items
 

1391
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,950
as one of the trade items
along with fire resistant potions i like

1392
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
along with fire resistant potions i like
 

1393
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,630
along with fire resistant potions i like
the water bottle edition but i feel like

1394
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
the water bottle edition but i feel like
 

1395
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,909
the water bottle edition but i feel like
they should get rid of the fire

1396
00:22:59,909 --> 00:22:59,919
they should get rid of the fire
 

1397
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,789
they should get rid of the fire
resistance

1398
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
resistance
 

1399
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,430
resistance
so that's like if you sort the potions

1400
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,440
so that's like if you sort the potions
 

1401
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,590
so that's like if you sort the potions
you'll end up with just water bottles

1402
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
you'll end up with just water bottles
 

1403
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,029
you'll end up with just water bottles
this way you'll get them both mixed

1404
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
this way you'll get them both mixed
 

1405
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,110
this way you'll get them both mixed
together and i don't really like that

1406
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
together and i don't really like that
 

1407
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,750
together and i don't really like that
personally and they also greatly reduce

1408
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
personally and they also greatly reduce
 

1409
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,190
personally and they also greatly reduce
the amount of items you get

1410
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
the amount of items you get
 

1411
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,870
the amount of items you get
with the bartering which i think is good

1412
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
with the bartering which i think is good
 

1413
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,510
with the bartering which i think is good
because it would seem pretty overpowered

1414
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
because it would seem pretty overpowered
 

1415
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,070
because it would seem pretty overpowered
they cut a lot of things in half uh-huh

1416
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
they cut a lot of things in half uh-huh
 

1417
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,070
they cut a lot of things in half uh-huh
so overall i would say i do

1418
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
so overall i would say i do
 

1419
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,510
so overall i would say i do

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
use in the game before it was pretty
 

1431
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,430
use in the game before it was pretty
much just for power rails and

1432

and food but now it actually
 

1435
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,710

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
is something pretty useful now i've
 

1437
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,990

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
heard a lot of people say
 

1439
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,470

but i feel like it's a good bounce
 

1445

but i feel like it's a good bounce
for most things um if you compare it to

that will take away from other aspects
 

1531
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,789
that will take away from other aspects
of the game and i feel like this removes

1532
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
of the game and i feel like this removes
 

1533
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,549
of the game and i feel like this removes
the need to make cow farms

1534

the need to make cow farms
 

1535
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,110
the need to make cow farms
in the game cows are pretty much only

1536
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
in the game cows are pretty much only
 

1537
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,669

pearls because that kind of removes the

1588
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
pearls because that kind of removes the
 

1589
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,070
pearls because that kind of removes the
need for enderman farm but

1590
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
need for enderman farm but
 

1591
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,269
need for enderman farm but
it's also more of a convenience thing um

1592
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
it's also more of a convenience thing um
 

1593
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,710
it's also more of a convenience thing um
and you'll still probably make enderman

1594
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
and you'll still probably make enderman
 

1595
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,430
and you'll still probably make enderman
farms for

1596
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
farms for
 

1597
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,789
farms for
xp uh same with the nuggets you know

1598
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
xp uh same with the nuggets you know
 

1599
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,470
xp uh same with the nuggets you know
that might remove the need for

1600
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
that might remove the need for
 

1601
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,390
that might remove the need for
iron golem farms but not actually

1602
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
iron golem farms but not actually
 

1603
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,549
iron golem farms but not actually
because you won't get enough iron this

1604
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
because you won't get enough iron this
 

1605
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,830
because you won't get enough iron this
way i don't think

1606
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
way i don't think
 

1607
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,909
way i don't think
uh string it kind of removes the need

1608
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
uh string it kind of removes the need
 

1609
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,510
uh string it kind of removes the need
for cave spiders but

1610
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
for cave spiders but
 

1611
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,470
for cave spiders but
you know you always need string for wool

1612
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
you know you always need string for wool
 

1613
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,430

by spawning in the end platform
breaking it and respawning it in so that

1622
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
breaking it and respawning it in so that
 

1623
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,070
breaking it and respawning it in so that
kind of removes the need to make those

1624
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
kind of removes the need to make those
 

1625
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,870
