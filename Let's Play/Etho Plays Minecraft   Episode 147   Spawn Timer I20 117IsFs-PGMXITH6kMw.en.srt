but it's done

172
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360

 

173
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,350

pretty cool when you're up here you can

174
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
pretty cool when you're up here you can
 

175
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,949
pretty cool when you're up here you can
see them spawning in the back there the

176
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
see them spawning in the back there the
 

177
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,070
see them spawning in the back there the
lights will turn on

178
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
lights will turn on
 

179
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,350
lights will turn on
like there and they fall down i still

180
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
like there and they fall down i still
 

181
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,429
like there and they fall down i still
have to extend the platform below

182
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
have to extend the platform below
 

183
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,949
have to extend the platform below
because they're just falling into the

184
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
because they're just falling into the
 

185
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,350
because they're just falling into the
void these ones on the outer edge

186
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
void these ones on the outer edge
 

187
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,750
void these ones on the outer edge
uh it's actually more than 120 blocks

188
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
uh it's actually more than 120 blocks
 

189
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,390
uh it's actually more than 120 blocks
too

190
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
too
 

191
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,509
too
i forgot to count the air space that i

192
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
i forgot to count the air space that i
 

193
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,390
i forgot to count the air space that i
leave between the rings so it's

194
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
leave between the rings so it's
 

195
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,509
leave between the rings so it's
an extra what is it 4

196
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519

 

197
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,830

4 8 16 128 plus 16

144. okay so
down we go

204
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880

 

205
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,510

all right we're down below here and uh

206
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
all right we're down below here and uh
 

207
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,510

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
been watching this for a while
 

213
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,310
been watching this for a while
this is the from below view

this is the from below view
 

215
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,990
this is the from below view
slowly but surely they're stealing the

216
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
slowly but surely they're stealing the
 

217
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,590
slowly but surely they're stealing the
watermelon so i have to use something

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
watermelon so i have to use something
 

219
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,550
watermelon so i have to use something
else

00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
else
 

221
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,510
else
i'll probably try maybe green wool or

222
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
i'll probably try maybe green wool or
 

223
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,990
i'll probably try maybe green wool or
something

224
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
something
 

225
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,510
something
they're just for looks really uh

226
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
they're just for looks really uh
 

227
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,189
they're just for looks really uh
but yeah there's a lot to see now

228
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199

 

229
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,990

yep so i really want to kill the dragon

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
yep so i really want to kill the dragon
 

231
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,390
yep so i really want to kill the dragon
now just so i can get these uh

232
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
now just so i can get these uh
 

233
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,310
now just so i can get these uh
pearls out because they're awesome for

234
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
pearls out because they're awesome for
 

235
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,150
pearls out because they're awesome for
transportation

236
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
transportation
 

237
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,590
transportation
like i would just love to have

238
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
like i would just love to have
 

239
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,749
like i would just love to have
i plan on setting up like stations in my

240
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
i plan on setting up like stations in my
 

241
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,710
i plan on setting up like stations in my
world

242
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
world
 

243
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,749
world
every every like 100 blocks apart from

244
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
every every like 100 blocks apart from
 

245
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:23,990
every every like 100 blocks apart from
each

246
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
each
 

247
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,110
each
other that will have ender pearls in and

248
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
other that will have ender pearls in and
 

249
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,390
other that will have ender pearls in and
speed potions and food and everything so

250
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
speed potions and food and everything so
 

251
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,990
speed potions and food and everything so
that uh if i run out of pearls i can

252
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
that uh if i run out of pearls i can
 

253
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,430
that uh if i run out of pearls i can
just go up to one of the stations get

254
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
just go up to one of the stations get
 

255
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,150
just go up to one of the stations get
refilled and

256
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
refilled and
 

257
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,150
refilled and
take off again but uh

258
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
take off again but uh
 

259
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,110
take off again but uh
that'll be something for another day

260
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
that'll be something for another day
 

261
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,270
that'll be something for another day
i've been thinking

262
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
i've been thinking
 

263
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,830
i've been thinking
uh i'm gonna try raise the floor up

264
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
uh i'm gonna try raise the floor up
 

265
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,950
uh i'm gonna try raise the floor up
below

266
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
below
 

267
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,790
below
this first air space in the ring

268
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
this first air space in the ring
 

269
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,390
this first air space in the ring
so that they won't die and just see how

270
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
so that they won't die and just see how
 

271
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,150
so that they won't die and just see how
that works out how they fill up the

272
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
that works out how they fill up the
 

273
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,629
that works out how they fill up the
floor and stuff

274
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
floor and stuff
 

275
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,670
floor and stuff
some people have suggested i should make

276
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
some people have suggested i should make
 

277
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,950
some people have suggested i should make
the floor retractable

278
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
the floor retractable
 

279
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,670
the floor retractable
with pistons so i can control whether or

280
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
with pistons so i can control whether or
 

281
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,550
with pistons so i can control whether or
not it's an xp

282
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
not it's an xp
 

283
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,749
not it's an xp
farm or just a pearl

284
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
farm or just a pearl
 

285
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,350
farm or just a pearl
it's a good idea but it's going to cost

286
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
it's a good idea but it's going to cost
 

287
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,870
it's a good idea but it's going to cost
a lot so i'll do that

288
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
a lot so i'll do that
 

289
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,510
a lot so i'll do that
towards the end of this project

290
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
towards the end of this project
 

291
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,189
towards the end of this project
what's my volume at that's okay

292
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
what's my volume at that's okay
 

293
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,110
what's my volume at that's okay
all right so i'll try to raise the floor

294
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
all right so i'll try to raise the floor
 

295
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,189
all right so i'll try to raise the floor
and we'll see how they fill up the place

296
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
and we'll see how they fill up the place
 

297
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,029
and we'll see how they fill up the place
here

298
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039

 

299
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,710

okay yeah it's pretty scary having them

300
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
okay yeah it's pretty scary having them
 

301
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,790
okay yeah it's pretty scary having them
wandering around for you like this uh

302
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
wandering around for you like this uh
 

303
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,070
wandering around for you like this uh
so that's one thing i might do i might

304
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
so that's one thing i might do i might
 

305
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,990
so that's one thing i might do i might
try to make the pistons push

306
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
try to make the pistons push
 

307
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,909
try to make the pistons push
the ground up like that another option

308
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
the ground up like that another option
 

309
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,110
the ground up like that another option
would be to do uh

310
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
would be to do uh
 

311
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,150
would be to do uh
fence gates in the rings like that

312
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
fence gates in the rings like that
 

313
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,550
fence gates in the rings like that
and i could probably easily just open

314
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
and i could probably easily just open
 

315
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,150
and i could probably easily just open
and close them all with redstone

316
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
and close them all with redstone
 

317
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,710
and close them all with redstone
be a lot cheaper than using pistons i

318
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
be a lot cheaper than using pistons i
 

319
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,790
be a lot cheaper than using pistons i
think

320
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800

 

321
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,510

so i think i got no armor on right now

322
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
so i think i got no armor on right now
 

323
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,870
so i think i got no armor on right now
we'll see how this goes let's see if

324
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
we'll see how this goes let's see if
 

325
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,390
we'll see how this goes let's see if
they kill me

326
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
they kill me
 

327
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,390
they kill me
it's me just casually hunting them

328
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400

 

329
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,230

yeah this is dangerous

330
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
yeah this is dangerous
 

331
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,909
yeah this is dangerous
so i'll have to think of something

332
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
so i'll have to think of something
 

333
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,430
so i'll have to think of something
better

334
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
better
 

335
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,550
better
i might set up like a tower like

336
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
i might set up like a tower like
 

337
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,150
i might set up like a tower like
in the middle or something just look at

338
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
in the middle or something just look at
 

339
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,390
in the middle or something just look at
them all have them teleport to me but

340
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
them all have them teleport to me but
 

341
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,790
them all have them teleport to me but
they won't be able to

342
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
they won't be able to
 

343
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,270
they won't be able to
uh hurt me and that way i won't have to

344
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
uh hurt me and that way i won't have to
 

345
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,110
uh hurt me and that way i won't have to
run around the place either

346
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
run around the place either
 

347
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,710
run around the place either
we'll see how that goes

348
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720

 

349
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,909

here's like a side view of the thing

350
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
here's like a side view of the thing
 

351
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,150
here's like a side view of the thing
i'm gonna go over there get my stuff and

352
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
i'm gonna go over there get my stuff and
 

353
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,469
i'm gonna go over there get my stuff and
we'll try a tower approach to this

354
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
we'll try a tower approach to this
 

355
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,830
we'll try a tower approach to this
see how it goes uh it would probably be

356
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
see how it goes uh it would probably be
 

357
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,749
see how it goes uh it would probably be
a lot quicker if i just get them a row

358
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
a lot quicker if i just get them a row
 

359
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,350
a lot quicker if i just get them a row
at me

360
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
at me
 

361
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,510
at me
we'll see

362
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520

 

363
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,710

okay so i should probably get rid of

364
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
okay so i should probably get rid of
 

365
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,469
okay so i should probably get rid of
this so they have nothing to stand on

366
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
this so they have nothing to stand on
 

367
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,710
this so they have nothing to stand on
and we will put ladders there i found

368
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
and we will put ladders there i found
 

369
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,309
and we will put ladders there i found
out something interesting about this too

370
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
out something interesting about this too
 

371
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,670
out something interesting about this too
if uh if you have ladders on them

372
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
if uh if you have ladders on them
 

373
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,270
if uh if you have ladders on them
like on a soil block they can take the

374
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
like on a soil block they can take the
 

375
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,270
like on a soil block they can take the
soil block and the ladder will pop off

376
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
soil block and the ladder will pop off
 

377
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,869
soil block and the ladder will pop off
so even if you have a block they can

378
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
so even if you have a block they can
 

379
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,309
so even if you have a block they can
take covered with something they can

380
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
take covered with something they can
 

381
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,510
take covered with something they can
still take

382
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
still take
 

383
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,270
still take
pick the block away okay

384
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
pick the block away okay
 

385
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,430
pick the block away okay
let's try this out

386
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440

 

387
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,510

okay he can't get me up here this is

388
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
okay he can't get me up here this is
 

389
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,750
okay he can't get me up here this is
three blocks up

390
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760

 

391
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,509

i wonder if there's a trick to make them

392
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
i wonder if there's a trick to make them
 

393
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,870
i wonder if there's a trick to make them
get mad at you because sometimes

394
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
get mad at you because sometimes
 

395
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,350
get mad at you because sometimes
oh okay you gotta look uh kind of the

396
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
oh okay you gotta look uh kind of the
 

397
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,710
oh okay you gotta look uh kind of the
crotch

398
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
crotch
 

399
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,310
crotch
i guess that's the that's the sweet spot

400
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320

 

401
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,509

weird

402
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519

 

403
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,110

yeah if you look at their head

404
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
yeah if you look at their head
 

405
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,949
yeah if you look at their head
they don't seem to get mad this is

406
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
they don't seem to get mad this is
 

407
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:08,230
they don't seem to get mad this is
really scary oh dang it

408
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240

 

409
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,670

so if i do it that way i need a safety

410
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
so if i do it that way i need a safety
 

411
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,509
so if i do it that way i need a safety
on it too so that i can't fall down like

412
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
on it too so that i can't fall down like
 

413
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,030
on it too so that i can't fall down like
that

414
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040

 

415
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,630

yeah it really starts to fill up down

416
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
yeah it really starts to fill up down
 

417
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,949
yeah it really starts to fill up down
here after a few minutes

418
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
here after a few minutes
 

419
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,190
here after a few minutes
the rates slow down though as they uh

420
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
the rates slow down though as they uh
 

421
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,150
the rates slow down though as they uh
populated at the bottom here

422
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
populated at the bottom here
 

423
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,110
populated at the bottom here
uh another idea we could try out

424
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
uh another idea we could try out
 

425
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,150
uh another idea we could try out
something

426
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
something
 

427
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,910
something
that always gets suggested to me when i

428
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
that always gets suggested to me when i
 

429
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,710
that always gets suggested to me when i
go to the end is the pumpkin approach

430
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
go to the end is the pumpkin approach
 

431
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,430
go to the end is the pumpkin approach
and now i can look look at them with no

432
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
and now i can look look at them with no
 

433
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,230
and now i can look look at them with no
problems

434
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
problems
 

435
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,470
problems
and we could probably casually hunt them

436
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
and we could probably casually hunt them
 

437
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,630
and we could probably casually hunt them
this way

438
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640

 

439
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,590

yeah that works pretty good you can get

440
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
yeah that works pretty good you can get
 

441
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,070
yeah that works pretty good you can get
xp

442
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
xp
 

443
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,190
xp
this way uh if we have a looting sword

444
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
this way uh if we have a looting sword
 

445
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,430
this way uh if we have a looting sword
we could get tons of pearls

446
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
we could get tons of pearls
 

447
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,470
we could get tons of pearls
not that i think we would need them

448
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480

 

449
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,949

these guys very rarely drop pearl so

450
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
these guys very rarely drop pearl so
 

451
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,389
these guys very rarely drop pearl so
even though there's tons on the ground

452
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
even though there's tons on the ground
 

453
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,430
even though there's tons on the ground
here

454
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
here
 

455
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,030
here
a whole lot more endermen have been

456
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
a whole lot more endermen have been
 

457
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,230
a whole lot more endermen have been
killed

458
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240

 

459
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,630

yeah that works pretty good too that's

460
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
yeah that works pretty good too that's
 

461
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,069
yeah that works pretty good too that's
one idea

462
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079

 

463
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,230

um something else i want to try is uh

464
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
um something else i want to try is uh
 

465
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,350
um something else i want to try is uh
with messing around with water

466
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
with messing around with water
 

467
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,389
with messing around with water
i hope i have some i only got one bucket

468
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
i hope i have some i only got one bucket
 

469
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,910
i hope i have some i only got one bucket
there

470
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
there
 

471
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,509
there
uh i'm gonna kill myself and grab

472
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
uh i'm gonna kill myself and grab
 

473
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,829
uh i'm gonna kill myself and grab
another one i guess

474
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
another one i guess
 

475
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,670
another one i guess
and we'll try something here

476
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680

 

477
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,030

okay so this is what i've done with the

478
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
okay so this is what i've done with the
 

479
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,190
okay so this is what i've done with the
water i'm just curious

480
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
water i'm just curious
 

481
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,990
water i'm just curious
to see what happens when i get the mad

482
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
to see what happens when i get the mad
 

483
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,670
to see what happens when i get the mad
at me when i'm up here now

484
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
at me when i'm up here now
 

485
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,790
at me when i'm up here now
i don't know if the water will kill them

486
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
i don't know if the water will kill them
 

487
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,269
i don't know if the water will kill them
should be pretty close to them yeah as

488
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
should be pretty close to them yeah as
 

489
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,150
should be pretty close to them yeah as
soon as they touch it

490
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160

 

491
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,990

they try to teleport away the last

492
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
they try to teleport away the last
 

493
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,430
they try to teleport away the last
interesting that's another idea of

494
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
interesting that's another idea of
 

495
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,870
interesting that's another idea of
something i could do

496
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880

 

497
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,190

to get the pearls like all grouped

498
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
to get the pearls like all grouped
 

499
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,790
to get the pearls like all grouped
together in the center here instead of

500
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
together in the center here instead of
 

501
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,430
together in the center here instead of
uh

502
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
uh
 

503
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,710
uh
all over the place but then i would have

504
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
all over the place but then i would have
 

505
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,670
all over the place but then i would have
to get the mad at me

506
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680

 

507
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,790

which i guess doesn't uh take too long

508
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
which i guess doesn't uh take too long
 

509
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,710
which i guess doesn't uh take too long

because if you have 100 or 200 spiders
 

581
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,389
because if you have 100 or 200 spiders

all at once creates hundreds of new
entities which

586

really lags the game out but that's not
what uh

590
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
what uh
 

591
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,069

waited around a while for my frame rate

596
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
waited around a while for my frame rate
 

597
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,710
waited around a while for my frame rate
to go up

598
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
to go up
 

599
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,030

and it was everything was going good i
 

601
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,269
and it was everything was going good i
think my frame rate was up to about

602
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
think my frame rate was up to about
 

603
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,269
think my frame rate was up to about
10 or 15 and i decided i wanted to start

604
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
10 or 15 and i decided i wanted to start
 

605
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,310
10 or 15 and i decided i wanted to start
recording again so i could

606
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
recording again so i could
 

607
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,269
recording again so i could
capture the xp orbs going into my guy

608
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
capture the xp orbs going into my guy
 

609
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,150
capture the xp orbs going into my guy
because that

610
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
because that
 

611
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,829
because that
looks and sounds cool but the thing was

612
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839

looks and sounds cool but the thing was
i had no game sounds for whatever reason

614
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480

i had no game sounds for whatever reason
that happens to me

616
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
that happens to me
 

617
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,509
that happens to me
quite often in minecraft so i wanted to

618
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
quite often in minecraft so i wanted to
 

619
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,509
quite often in minecraft so i wanted to
restart my game to get the sounds

620
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
restart my game to get the sounds
 

621
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,030
restart my game to get the sounds
so you get the noise you know

622
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
so you get the noise you know
 

623
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,629
so you get the noise you know
when xp orbs going to you

624
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639

 

625
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,230

but when i logged out and logged back

626
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
but when i logged out and logged back
 

627
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,990
but when i logged out and logged back
into my world that is what messed

628
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
into my world that is what messed
 

629
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,030
into my world that is what messed
it up that's what corrupted the world

630
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
it up that's what corrupted the world
 

631
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,790
it up that's what corrupted the world
so if you if you have a lot of entities

632
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
so if you if you have a lot of entities
 

633
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,470
so if you if you have a lot of entities
in your world don't log out and log

634
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
in your world don't log out and log
 

635
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,470
in your world don't log out and log
in because i think that's what it can't

636
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
in because i think that's what it can't
 

637
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,030
in because i think that's what it can't
handle that's what crashed it

638
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
handle that's what crashed it
 

639
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,550
handle that's what crashed it
okay uh some people suggested you know

640
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
okay uh some people suggested you know
 

641
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,790
okay uh some people suggested you know
just using mcedit to remove the entities

642
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
just using mcedit to remove the entities
 

643
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,870
just using mcedit to remove the entities
yeah i thought about that i figured it

644
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
yeah i thought about that i figured it
 

645
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,030
yeah i thought about that i figured it
would just be better to load the backup

646
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
would just be better to load the backup
 

647
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,509
would just be better to load the backup
i had because it wasn't that old and so

648
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
i had because it wasn't that old and so
 

649
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,389
i had because it wasn't that old and so
far this world

650
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
far this world
 

651
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,470
far this world
has not been touched by mcedit so i'd

652
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
has not been touched by mcedit so i'd
 

653
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,389
has not been touched by mcedit so i'd
like to keep it that way for

654
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
like to keep it that way for
 

655
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,629
like to keep it that way for
as long as possible even when uh

656
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
as long as possible even when uh
 

657
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,310
as long as possible even when uh
the jungle biomes come out i don't think

658
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
the jungle biomes come out i don't think
 

659
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,389
the jungle biomes come out i don't think
i'm going to cheat to get them

660
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
i'm going to cheat to get them
 

661
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,150
i'm going to cheat to get them
because that'll mess up the other biomes

662
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
because that'll mess up the other biomes
 

663
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,030
because that'll mess up the other biomes
and stuff too

677
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,310
yeah
that's the background so moving on our

678
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
that's the background so moving on our
 

679
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,430
that's the background so moving on our
project for today is the delay timer

680
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
project for today is the delay timer
 

681
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,710
project for today is the delay timer
that we talked about let's go up i'm

682
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
that we talked about let's go up i'm
 

683
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,310
that we talked about let's go up i'm
going to build a prototype of it because

684
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
going to build a prototype of it because
 

685
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,710
going to build a prototype of it because
we have a lot of things to figure out

686
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
we have a lot of things to figure out
 

687
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,670
we have a lot of things to figure out
for it we'll probably be working just

688
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
for it we'll probably be working just
 

689
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,389
for it we'll probably be working just
outside the cave

690
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
outside the cave
 

691
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,710
outside the cave
and i'll get set up set up here

692
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720

 

693
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,870

all right so we got a nice work area

694
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
all right so we got a nice work area
 

695
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,990
all right so we got a nice work area
here just outside our

696
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
here just outside our
 

697
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,550
here just outside our
cave a nice flat spot let's get started

698
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
cave a nice flat spot let's get started
 

699
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,829
cave a nice flat spot let's get started
so the goal is to make a long

700
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
so the goal is to make a long
 

701
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,189
so the goal is to make a long
timer like many minutes maybe maybe like

702
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
timer like many minutes maybe maybe like
 

703
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,670
timer like many minutes maybe maybe like
an hour so it'd probably be good

704
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
an hour so it'd probably be good
 

705
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,710
an hour so it'd probably be good
and the idea is after that hour goes by

706
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
and the idea is after that hour goes by
 

707
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,710
and the idea is after that hour goes by
it'll shut off the cave spider spawner

708
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
it'll shut off the cave spider spawner
 

709
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,990
it'll shut off the cave spider spawner
or any uh

710
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
or any uh
 

711
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,710
or any uh
any mob system i have i want to be able

712
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
any mob system i have i want to be able
 

713
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,829
any mob system i have i want to be able
to

714
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
to
 

715
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,150
to
control how long it's on for if in case

716
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
control how long it's on for if in case
 

717
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,110
control how long it's on for if in case
i go

718
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
i go
 

719
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,430
i go
afk near it i don't want them to keep

720
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
afk near it i don't want them to keep
 

721
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,150
afk near it i don't want them to keep
spawning

722
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
spawning
 

723
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,310
spawning
to the point where it might crash my

724
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
to the point where it might crash my
 

725
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,230
to the point where it might crash my
game or

726
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
game or
 

727
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,990
game or
you know it just gets annoying when it's

728
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
you know it just gets annoying when it's
 

729
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,590
you know it just gets annoying when it's
the game slows down you

730
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
the game slows down you
 

731
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,189
the game slows down you
pretty much can't even kill them it gets

732
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
pretty much can't even kill them it gets
 

733
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,189
pretty much can't even kill them it gets
so leggy sometimes so

734
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
so leggy sometimes so
 

735
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,350
so leggy sometimes so
that's what we're trying to create here

736
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
that's what we're trying to create here
 

737
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,269
that's what we're trying to create here
something to prevent that

738
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
something to prevent that
 

739
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,710
something to prevent that
and i'm guessing a lot of you had this

740
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
and i'm guessing a lot of you had this
 

741
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,389
and i'm guessing a lot of you had this
idea this is the first thing that came

742
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
idea this is the first thing that came
 

743
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,069
idea this is the first thing that came
to my mind because i

744
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
to my mind because i
 

745
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,990
to my mind because i
i've messed with this before in the past

746
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
i've messed with this before in the past
 

747
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,269
i've messed with this before in the past
just use dispensers for the timer

748
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
just use dispensers for the timer
 

749
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,350
just use dispensers for the timer
and have them shoot out a junk cut a

750
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
and have them shoot out a junk cut a
 

751
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,590
and have them shoot out a junk cut a
junk item like spider eyes

752
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
junk item like spider eyes
 

753
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,150
junk item like spider eyes
i have lots and lots of spider eyes to

754
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
i have lots and lots of spider eyes to
 

755
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,030
i have lots and lots of spider eyes to
throw away

756
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040

 

757
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,829

and the idea is you would have like a

758
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
and the idea is you would have like a
 

759
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:21,990
and the idea is you would have like a
button

760
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
button
 

761
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,150
button
over here this is what you would press

762
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
over here this is what you would press
 

763
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,269
over here this is what you would press
to start the timer

764
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279

 

765
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,389

cause the spencer to shoot out an item

766
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399

 

767
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,230

onto a pressure plate and maybe i think

768
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
onto a pressure plate and maybe i think
 

769
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,829
onto a pressure plate and maybe i think
it'll work if we do it like this if we

770
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
it'll work if we do it like this if we
 

771
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,470
it'll work if we do it like this if we
have

772
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480

 

773
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,710

torch over here right below the

774
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
torch over here right below the
 

775
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,069
torch over here right below the
dispenser you got to be careful with

776
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
dispenser you got to be careful with
 

777
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,509
dispenser you got to be careful with
dispensers they have an annoying thing

778
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
dispensers they have an annoying thing
 

779
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,150
dispensers they have an annoying thing
where if they're being powered pretty

780
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
where if they're being powered pretty
 

781
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,189
where if they're being powered pretty
much any

782
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:51,199
much any
 

783
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,430
much any
redstone update next to them will cause

784
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
redstone update next to them will cause
 

785
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,230
redstone update next to them will cause
them to

786
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
them to
 

787
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,590
them to
shoot out items

788
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600

 

789
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,629

like when i destroyed that shot on item

790
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
like when i destroyed that shot on item
 

791
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,670
like when i destroyed that shot on item
so

792
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680

 

793
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,949

if you place it right next to it it

794
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
if you place it right next to it it
 

795
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,510
if you place it right next to it it
shoots on an item so you just got to be

796
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
shoots on an item so you just got to be
 

797
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,230
shoots on an item so you just got to be
careful that when dealing with them

798
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
careful that when dealing with them
 

799
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,390
careful that when dealing with them
but i think this method works if the

800
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
but i think this method works if the
 

801
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,789
but i think this method works if the
torch is down low like this

802
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
torch is down low like this
 

803
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,230
torch is down low like this
it's out of range yeah so you'd have a

804
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
it's out of range yeah so you'd have a
 

805
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,470
it's out of range yeah so you'd have a
a chain of dispensers like this maybe

806
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
a chain of dispensers like this maybe
 

807
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,710
a chain of dispensers like this maybe
we'll do

808
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
we'll do
 

809
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,230
we'll do
we'll do four so just to visualize it

810
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240

 

811
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:40,549

something like this we're at three

812
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559

 

813
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,950

yeah i better go to sleep here it's mobs

814
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
yeah i better go to sleep here it's mobs
 

815
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,950
yeah i better go to sleep here it's mobs
are gonna start spawning

816
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
are gonna start spawning
 

817
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,270
are gonna start spawning
so we have a row of dispensers like that

818
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
so we have a row of dispensers like that
 

819
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,270
so we have a row of dispensers like that
everyone will add five minutes because

820
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
everyone will add five minutes because
 

821
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,190
everyone will add five minutes because
it'll shoot on an item

822
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
it'll shoot on an item
 

823
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,270
it'll shoot on an item
items despawn in five minutes and the

824
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
items despawn in five minutes and the
 

825
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,990
items despawn in five minutes and the
idea is when it despawns

826
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
idea is when it despawns
 

827
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,070
idea is when it despawns
like if this one shoots an item onto the

828
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
like if this one shoots an item onto the
 

829
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,750
like if this one shoots an item onto the
pressure plate

830
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
pressure plate
 

831
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,830
pressure plate
after five minutes uh

832
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
after five minutes uh
 

833
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,750
after five minutes uh
this torch will turn on which will power

834
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
this torch will turn on which will power
 

835
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,430
this torch will turn on which will power
this dispenser will cause it to shoot

836
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
this dispenser will cause it to shoot
 

837
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,470
this dispenser will cause it to shoot
here

838
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
here
 

839
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,310
here
after five minutes this one shoots and

840
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
after five minutes this one shoots and
 

841
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,590
after five minutes this one shoots and
five minutes more

842
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
five minutes more
 

843
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,750
five minutes more
and when it gets the end that's what

844
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
and when it gets the end that's what
 

845
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,070
and when it gets the end that's what
will

846
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
will
 

847
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,070
will
cause the cave spider spawners to

848
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
cause the cave spider spawners to
 

849
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,510
cause the cave spider spawners to
shut off or whatever so let's place

850
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
shut off or whatever so let's place
 

851
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,990
shut off or whatever so let's place
torches

852
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
torches
 

853
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,909
torches
and yeah we'll end it here

854
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919
and yeah we'll end it here
 

855
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,310
and yeah we'll end it here
okay and maybe we'll use glass on the

856
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
okay and maybe we'll use glass on the
 

857
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:40,830
okay and maybe we'll use glass on the
sides just so we can see

858
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840

 

859
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,430

items

860
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
items
 

861
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,110
items
okay so i just went ahead and finished

862
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
okay so i just went ahead and finished
 

863
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,630
okay so i just went ahead and finished
it here so

864
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
it here so
 

865
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,789
it here so
our prototype is a 20 minute timer

866
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
our prototype is a 20 minute timer
 

867
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,310
our prototype is a 20 minute timer
because we have four dispensers

868
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
because we have four dispensers
 

869
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,190
because we have four dispensers
each one is five minutes or so slightly

870
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
each one is five minutes or so slightly
 

871
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,750
each one is five minutes or so slightly
longer

872
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
longer
 

873
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,270
longer
because it there's also the time it

874
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
because it there's also the time it
 

875
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,510
because it there's also the time it
takes the item to shoot out and

876
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
takes the item to shoot out and
 

877
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,710
takes the item to shoot out and
land on the pressure plate and the

878
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
land on the pressure plate and the
 

879
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,150
land on the pressure plate and the
pressure plate to activate and

880
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
pressure plate to activate and
 

881
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,830
pressure plate to activate and
deactivate and all that stuff so it's

882
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
deactivate and all that stuff so it's
 

883
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,029
deactivate and all that stuff so it's
just slightly longer than five minutes

884
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
just slightly longer than five minutes
 

885
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,549
just slightly longer than five minutes
keep that in mind if you're trying to

886
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
keep that in mind if you're trying to
 

887
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,750
keep that in mind if you're trying to
use make a clock or something accurate

888
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
use make a clock or something accurate
 

889
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,390
use make a clock or something accurate
it's

890
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
it's
 

891
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,669
it's
just a little bit longer than five

892
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
just a little bit longer than five
 

893
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,870
just a little bit longer than five
minutes uh this is a very good way of

894
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
minutes uh this is a very good way of
 

895
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,870
minutes uh this is a very good way of
making a timer very compact very

896
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
making a timer very compact very
 

897
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,750
making a timer very compact very
efficient

898
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
efficient
 

899
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,830
efficient
i like it some people don't like doing

900
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
i like it some people don't like doing
 

901
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,510
i like it some people don't like doing
it this way because you have to refill

902
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
it this way because you have to refill
 

903
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,590
it this way because you have to refill
the dispensers

904
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
the dispensers
 

905
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,029
the dispensers
but i just figured it out on the

906
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
but i just figured it out on the
 

907
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,950
but i just figured it out on the
calculator

908
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
calculator
 

909
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,830
calculator
it will last for about 48 hours of

910
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
it will last for about 48 hours of
 

911
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,590
it will last for about 48 hours of
constant use so

912
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
constant use so
 

913
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,750
constant use so
before you have to refill them so it's

914
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
before you have to refill them so it's
 

915
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,029
before you have to refill them so it's
pretty

916
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
pretty
 

917
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,830
pretty
pretty good i wouldn't complain about

918
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
pretty good i wouldn't complain about
 

919
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,390
pretty good i wouldn't complain about
that

920
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
that
 

921
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,789
that
uh yeah so let's do a dry run of it here

922
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
uh yeah so let's do a dry run of it here
 

923
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,630
uh yeah so let's do a dry run of it here
so i have a lever hooked up to the cave

924
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
so i have a lever hooked up to the cave
 

925
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,710
so i have a lever hooked up to the cave
spider system i would replace that

926
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
spider system i would replace that
 

927
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,190
spider system i would replace that
probably with a button like i have here

928
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
probably with a button like i have here
 

929
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,789
probably with a button like i have here
and ideas when you would hit it it would

930
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
and ideas when you would hit it it would
 

931
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,390
and ideas when you would hit it it would
activate the first dispenser

932
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400

 

933
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,710

items falls down lands on the pressure

934
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
items falls down lands on the pressure
 

935
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,669
items falls down lands on the pressure
plate

936
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
plate
 

937
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,950
plate
turns the torch off now after five

938
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
turns the torch off now after five
 

939
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,870
turns the torch off now after five
minutes when it despawns

940
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
minutes when it despawns
 

941
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,750
minutes when it despawns
the torch will come back on and the next

942
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
the torch will come back on and the next
 

943
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,750
the torch will come back on and the next
one gets activated

944
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
one gets activated
 

945
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,870
one gets activated
and down the chain it goes until it gets

946
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
and down the chain it goes until it gets
 

947
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,070
and down the chain it goes until it gets
the last one

948
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080

 

949
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,549

and that now all the torches are on so

950
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559

 

951
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,909

that is what we want the thing is

952
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
that is what we want the thing is
 

953
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,990
that is what we want the thing is
we wouldn't just simply hook the wire up

954
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
we wouldn't just simply hook the wire up
 

955
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,230
we wouldn't just simply hook the wire up
to

956
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240

 

957
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,789

our lighting system from from this last

958
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
our lighting system from from this last
 

959
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,909
our lighting system from from this last
torch

960
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
torch
 

961
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,750
torch
you could do that it doesn't really work

962
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
you could do that it doesn't really work
 

963
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,950
you could do that it doesn't really work
though

964
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960

 

965
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,070

actually no that wouldn't work at all uh

966
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
actually no that wouldn't work at all uh
 

967
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,070
actually no that wouldn't work at all uh
you could try run a wire

968
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
you could try run a wire
 

969
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,470
you could try run a wire
between them all and then hook that up

970
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
between them all and then hook that up
 

971
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,350
between them all and then hook that up
the lighting system but the thing is

972
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
the lighting system but the thing is
 

973
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,789
the lighting system but the thing is
this is going to be powered the whole

974
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
this is going to be powered the whole
 

975
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,029
this is going to be powered the whole
time

976
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
time
 

977
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,270
time
so even if one of these turns off it's

978
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
so even if one of these turns off it's
 

979
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,070
so even if one of these turns off it's
still

980
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
still
 

981
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,789
still
being powered so what we actually need

982
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
being powered so what we actually need
 

983
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,990
being powered so what we actually need
to do is invert

984
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
to do is invert
 

985
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,070
to do is invert
all these torches

986
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080

 

987
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,750

so i think the easiest way of doing that

988
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
so i think the easiest way of doing that
 

989
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,750
so i think the easiest way of doing that
would probably just be

990
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
would probably just be
 

991
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,149
would probably just be
putting a torch here

992
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159

 

993
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,710

oh that one's active that's why it's on

994
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
oh that one's active that's why it's on
 

995
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,909
oh that one's active that's why it's on
something like that

996
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919

 

997
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,909

that will invert all the torches and

998
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
that will invert all the torches and
 

999
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,950
that will invert all the torches and
then

1000
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
then
 

1001
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,710
then
you could set up like a a wire line all

1002
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
you could set up like a a wire line all
 

1003
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,190
you could set up like a a wire line all
along

1004
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
along
 

1005
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,029
along
here

1006
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039

 

1007
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,990

uh right now there's no items on on the

1008
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
uh right now there's no items on on the
 

1009
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,549
uh right now there's no items on on the
pressure plates

1010
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
pressure plates
 

1011
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,110
pressure plates
there so this wire is off right now if

1012
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
there so this wire is off right now if
 

1013
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,230
there so this wire is off right now if
at any time

1014
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
at any time
 

1015
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,750
at any time
there is this timer is running this

1016
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
there is this timer is running this
 

1017
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,630
there is this timer is running this
wire will turn on now so

1018
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640

 

1019
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,710

first one on stays on

1020
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720

 

1021
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,510

oh accidentally grab that

1022
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520

 

1023
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,190

thing is it will flicker though so i

1024
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
thing is it will flicker though so i
 

1025
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,789
thing is it will flicker though so i
might have to add something else to this

1026
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
might have to add something else to this
 

1027
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,230
might have to add something else to this
to prevent that

1028
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
to prevent that
 

1029
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,789
to prevent that
uh not that it's a huge issue just might

1030
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
uh not that it's a huge issue just might
 

1031
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,070
uh not that it's a huge issue just might
be

1032
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080
be
 

1033
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,630
be
annoying to hear the pistons switch and

1034
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
annoying to hear the pistons switch and
 

1035
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,149
annoying to hear the pistons switch and
then switch back really quick

1036
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
then switch back really quick
 

1037
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,310
then switch back really quick
okay now let's say it's at this point i

1038
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
okay now let's say it's at this point i
 

1039
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,070
okay now let's say it's at this point i
come back to my computer i decide to

1040
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
come back to my computer i decide to
 

1041
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,630
come back to my computer i decide to
kill all the spiders

1042
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
kill all the spiders
 

1043
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,590
kill all the spiders
will the timer work again like can we

1044
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
will the timer work again like can we
 

1045
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,909
will the timer work again like can we
get it to run again while this is

1046
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
get it to run again while this is
 

1047
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,070
get it to run again while this is
already running and yes we can

1048
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
already running and yes we can
 

1049
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,470
already running and yes we can
if we press the button again even though

1050
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
if we press the button again even though
 

1051
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,230
if we press the button again even though
we already have an item further down the

1052
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
we already have an item further down the
 

1053
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,350
we already have an item further down the
line

1054
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
line
 

1055
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,909
line
we can restart it and it will last the

1056
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
we can restart it and it will last the
 

1057
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,830
we can restart it and it will last the
20 minutes again

1058
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
20 minutes again
 

1059
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,070
20 minutes again
so it's a pretty good way of doing a

1060
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
so it's a pretty good way of doing a
 

1061
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,110
so it's a pretty good way of doing a
timer

1062
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
timer
 

1063
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,950
timer
and that's what i'm going to hook up for

1064
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
and that's what i'm going to hook up for
 

1065
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,149
and that's what i'm going to hook up for
the spiders

1066
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159
the spiders
 

1067
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,590
the spiders
i might play around with trying to

1068
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
i might play around with trying to
 

1069
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,070
i might play around with trying to
prevent that flicker

1070
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
prevent that flicker
 

1071
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,710
prevent that flicker
between switches so i'll see if i can

1072
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
between switches so i'll see if i can
 

1073
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,789
between switches so i'll see if i can
figure something out

1074
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
figure something out
 

1075
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,750
figure something out
okay so i finally finally figured it out

1076
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
okay so i finally finally figured it out
 

1077
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,070
okay so i finally finally figured it out
here

1078
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
here
 

1079
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,110
here
um you know people some people think i'm

1080
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
um you know people some people think i'm
 

1081
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,149
um you know people some people think i'm
good at redstone

1082
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
good at redstone
 

1083
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,350
good at redstone
uh i got bad news for you guys it's not

1084
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
uh i got bad news for you guys it's not
 

1085
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,029
uh i got bad news for you guys it's not
really true

1086
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
really true
 

1087
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,190
really true
i struggle with even the simple things

1088
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
i struggle with even the simple things
 

1089
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,950
i struggle with even the simple things
sometimes

1090
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
sometimes
 

1091
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,430
sometimes
i i was messing around with an and gate

1092
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
i i was messing around with an and gate
 

1093
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,270
i i was messing around with an and gate
and a delay at first

1094
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
and a delay at first
 

1095
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,710
and a delay at first
and i realized that's not going to work

1096
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
and i realized that's not going to work
 

1097
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,630
and i realized that's not going to work
then i tried an rs nor latch

1098
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
then i tried an rs nor latch
 

1099
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,630
then i tried an rs nor latch
and a delay and that didn't work

1100
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
and a delay and that didn't work
 

1101
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,870
and a delay and that didn't work
and i was kind of shocked and worried

1102
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
and i was kind of shocked and worried
 

1103
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,830
and i was kind of shocked and worried
that that didn't work

1104
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
that that didn't work
 

1105
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,669
that that didn't work
and then i realized all you have to do

1106
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
and then i realized all you have to do
 

1107
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,270
and then i realized all you have to do
is have

1108
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
is have
 

1109
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,549
is have
have your long delay and have a just a

1110
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
have your long delay and have a just a
 

1111
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,990
have your long delay and have a just a
repeater here

1112
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
repeater here
 

1113
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,230
repeater here
and that will that will take care of any

1114
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
and that will that will take care of any
 

1115
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,510
and that will that will take care of any
flicker things

1116
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
flicker things
 

1117
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,710
flicker things
so because what happens is

1118
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
so because what happens is
 

1119
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,710
so because what happens is
uh it takes a while for the repeaters to

1120
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
uh it takes a while for the repeaters to
 

1121
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,950
uh it takes a while for the repeaters to
go off the long chain

1122
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
go off the long chain
 

1123
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,350
go off the long chain
so this wire stays powered for however

1124
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
so this wire stays powered for however
 

1125
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,190
so this wire stays powered for however
long that takes

1126
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
long that takes
 

1127
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,190
long that takes
and if you turn the power back on

1128
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
and if you turn the power back on
 

1129
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,470
and if you turn the power back on
it doesn't take long for it to go

1130
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
it doesn't take long for it to go
 

1131
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,310
it doesn't take long for it to go
through the short repeater

1132
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320
through the short repeater
 

1133
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,750
through the short repeater
and then it will it will get ahead of

1134
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
and then it will it will get ahead of
 

1135
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,230
and then it will it will get ahead of
the

1136
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
the
 

1137
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,590
the
of the delay here so

1138
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
of the delay here so
 

1139
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,510
of the delay here so
let's just see it it's easier to realize

1140
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
let's just see it it's easier to realize
 

1141
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,830
let's just see it it's easier to realize
so

1142
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840

 

1143
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,830

and that's that's it power stays on

1144
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:16,840
and that's that's it power stays on
 

1145
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,630
and that's that's it power stays on
constantly

1146
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
constantly
 

1147
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,310
constantly
so yeah like watch this wire here it

1148
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
so yeah like watch this wire here it
 

1149
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,590
so yeah like watch this wire here it
doesn't go off

1150
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600

 

1151
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,950

but if you keep this off for

1152
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
but if you keep this off for
 

1153
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,870
but if you keep this off for
however long your delay is here

1154
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
however long your delay is here
 

1155
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,350
however long your delay is here
then it will go off

1156
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360

 

1157
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,669

okay and you need to have like a

1158
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
okay and you need to have like a
 

1159
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,750
okay and you need to have like a
repeater or a torch or something here

1160
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
repeater or a torch or something here
 

1161
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,350
repeater or a torch or something here
something that prevents the power from

1162
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
something that prevents the power from
 

1163
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,149
something that prevents the power from
flowing back

1164
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
flowing back
 

1165
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,310
flowing back
because if you do this

1166
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
because if you do this
 

1167
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,149
because if you do this
like we don't need a delay at all but we

1168
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
like we don't need a delay at all but we
 

1169
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,990
like we don't need a delay at all but we
need to prevent the power from flowing

1170
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
need to prevent the power from flowing
 

1171
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,230
need to prevent the power from flowing
back so that's all that was there for

1172
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
back so that's all that was there for
 

1173
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,990
back so that's all that was there for
if you do this so you can't shut the

1174
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
if you do this so you can't shut the
 

1175
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,710
if you do this so you can't shut the
power off

1176
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720

 

1177
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,269

because what's happening is

1178
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279

 

1179
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,789

oh i don't know if i can explain this

1180
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
oh i don't know if i can explain this
 

1181
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,029
oh i don't know if i can explain this
this is constantly sending power out

1182
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
this is constantly sending power out
 

1183
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,029
this is constantly sending power out
from this repeater

1184
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
from this repeater
 

1185
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,990
from this repeater
like if you if you break this here this

1186
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
like if you if you break this here this
 

1187
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,909
like if you if you break this here this
one goes off first and then

1188
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
one goes off first and then
 

1189
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:23,029
one goes off first and then
this one then this one this one right

1190
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039

 

1191
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,710

but the thing is if this one's not going

1192
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
but the thing is if this one's not going
 

1193
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,470
but the thing is if this one's not going
off when you shut the power off

1194
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
off when you shut the power off
 

1195
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,310
off when you shut the power off
it's sending power back to the beginning

1196
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
it's sending power back to the beginning
 

1197
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,750
it's sending power back to the beginning
here of

1198
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
here of
 

1199
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,909
here of
of the chain and it's just a constant

1200
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
of the chain and it's just a constant
 

1201
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,110
of the chain and it's just a constant
infinite loop where you

1202
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
infinite loop where you
 

1203
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,870
infinite loop where you
can't shut it off so that's why

1204
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
can't shut it off so that's why
 

1205
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,549
can't shut it off so that's why
repeaters sometimes do that where you

1206
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
repeaters sometimes do that where you
 

1207
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,990
repeaters sometimes do that where you
can't shut them off

1208
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
can't shut them off
 

1209
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,549
can't shut them off
even though you're not powering them

1210
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
even though you're not powering them
 

1211
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,710
even though you're not powering them
okay so this will work uh what we got to

1212
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
okay so this will work uh what we got to
 

1213
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,630
okay so this will work uh what we got to
do next is figure out exactly what kind

1214
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
do next is figure out exactly what kind
 

1215
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,070
do next is figure out exactly what kind
of delay we need for

1216
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
of delay we need for
 

1217
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,789
of delay we need for
our setup here so i'm going to sleep and

1218
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
our setup here so i'm going to sleep and
 

1219
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,190
our setup here so i'm going to sleep and
we'll

1220
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
we'll
 

1221
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,350
we'll
try to see what that is

1222
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,360

 

1223
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,310

oh i got some bad news guys very very

1224
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
oh i got some bad news guys very very
 

1225
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,070
oh i got some bad news guys very very
bad news very sad news

1226
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,080
bad news very sad news
 

1227
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,269
bad news very sad news
tragic terrible the

1228
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
tragic terrible the
 

1229
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,310
tragic terrible the
the amazing pick the incredible pick is

1230
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
the amazing pick the incredible pick is
 

1231
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,110
the amazing pick the incredible pick is
just about

1232
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
just about
 

1233
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,750
just about
gone just about but it had a good life

1234
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
gone just about but it had a good life
 

1235
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,310
gone just about but it had a good life
long life full of good times good

1236
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
long life full of good times good
 

1237
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,590
long life full of good times good
memories

1238
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600

 

1239
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,950

i might keep it around just for just

1240
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
i might keep it around just for just
 

1241
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,630
i might keep it around just for just
so i can say i have one but no you can't

1242
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
so i can say i have one but no you can't
 

1243
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,269
so i can say i have one but no you can't
you can't repair enchanted tools so no

1244
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,279
you can't repair enchanted tools so no
 

1245
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,070
you can't repair enchanted tools so no
way to get the life back

1246
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
way to get the life back
 

1247
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,590
way to get the life back
uh oh well anyway

1248
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
uh oh well anyway
 

1249
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,390
uh oh well anyway
we got this set up i added glass on top

1250
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
we got this set up i added glass on top
 

1251
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,029
we got this set up i added glass on top
just so

1252
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
just so
 

1253
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,470
just so
this is consistent and correct

1254
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
this is consistent and correct
 

1255
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,310
this is consistent and correct
so all we have to do to figure out the

1256
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
so all we have to do to figure out the
 

1257
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,830
so all we have to do to figure out the
timing is just

1258
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:43,840
timing is just
 

1259
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,029
timing is just
see if that light turns off no

1260
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
see if that light turns off no
 

1261
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,510
see if that light turns off no
see if it turns on

1262
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520

 

1263
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,110

okay let's try shorten our delay here

1264
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
okay let's try shorten our delay here
 

1265
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,990
okay let's try shorten our delay here
quite a bit just want to figure out how

1266
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
quite a bit just want to figure out how
 

1267
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,750
quite a bit just want to figure out how
many repeaters i need

1268
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
many repeaters i need
 

1269
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,470
many repeaters i need
it doesn't have to be an exact delay or

1270
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
it doesn't have to be an exact delay or
 

1271
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,110
it doesn't have to be an exact delay or
anything

1272
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120

 

1273
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,149

okay i think it stayed off yeah

1274
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
okay i think it stayed off yeah
 

1275
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,510
okay i think it stayed off yeah
so we can shorten this a little bit more

1276
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
so we can shorten this a little bit more
 

1277
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,510
so we can shorten this a little bit more
we'll try that

1278
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520

 

1279
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,549

let's restart it

1280
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
let's restart it
 

1281
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,549
let's restart it
and so yeah this is the simple timer

1282
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
and so yeah this is the simple timer
 

1283
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,070
and so yeah this is the simple timer
this is the

1284
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
this is the
 

1285
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,669
this is the
the basic one we're doing for the cave

1286
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
the basic one we're doing for the cave
 

1287
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,070
the basic one we're doing for the cave
spiders but for the

1288
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,080
spiders but for the
 

1289
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,070
spiders but for the
for the blaze farm i'm going to be

1290
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
for the blaze farm i'm going to be
 

1291
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,590
for the blaze farm i'm going to be
making something

1292
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
making something
 

1293
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,950
making something
different which we'll probably get into

1294
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
different which we'll probably get into
 

1295
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,310
different which we'll probably get into
maybe next episode

1296
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320

 

1297
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,430

oh it flashed on okay so we need to

1298
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,440
oh it flashed on okay so we need to
 

1299
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,029
oh it flashed on okay so we need to
extend this a little bit

1300
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039

 

1301
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,510

and we'll restart it yeah i

1302
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520

 

1303
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,510

i got a pretty cool idea for the timer

1304
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
i got a pretty cool idea for the timer
 

1305
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,149
i got a pretty cool idea for the timer
it's going to be really over till though

1306
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
it's going to be really over till though
 

1307
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,630
it's going to be really over till though
totally unnecessary not still flashing

1308
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
totally unnecessary not still flashing
 

1309
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,149
totally unnecessary not still flashing
but a few months ago i made this block

1310
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
but a few months ago i made this block
 

1311
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,029
but a few months ago i made this block
swapper thing

1312
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039
swapper thing
 

1313
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,029
swapper thing
that i thought was pretty cool i was

1314
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
that i thought was pretty cool i was
 

1315
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,710
that i thought was pretty cool i was
pretty proud of it but i never used it

1316
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:06,720
pretty proud of it but i never used it
 

1317
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,350
pretty proud of it but i never used it
for anything

1318
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
for anything
 

1319
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,070
for anything
so the other day i happened to see it in

1320
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
so the other day i happened to see it in
 

1321
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,029
so the other day i happened to see it in
my creative world

1322
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
my creative world
 

1323
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,029
my creative world
and got the idea of making a timer out

1324
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
and got the idea of making a timer out
 

1325
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,870
and got the idea of making a timer out
of it

1326
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
of it
 

1327
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,909
of it
so that's what i'm going to do just so i

1328
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
so that's what i'm going to do just so i
 

1329
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,669
so that's what i'm going to do just so i
can use it in something

1330
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679

 

1331
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,430

i think we got it here oh

1332
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
i think we got it here oh
 

1333
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,350
i think we got it here oh
maybe not yeah it's still flashed okay

1334
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
maybe not yeah it's still flashed okay
 

1335
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,350
maybe not yeah it's still flashed okay
so

1336
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
so
 

1337
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,630
so
that's about the delay we need 1 or 4

1338
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
that's about the delay we need 1 or 4
 

1339
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,750
that's about the delay we need 1 or 4
8 9 10.

1340
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:41,760

 

1341
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,470

so it's really nine but since this is

1342
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
so it's really nine but since this is
 

1343
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,909
so it's really nine but since this is
this is delayed one so that

1344
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
this is delayed one so that
 

1345
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,190
this is delayed one so that
we need ten okay so

1346
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
we need ten okay so
 

1347
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,590
we need ten okay so
