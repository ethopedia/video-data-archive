start a building project here because I
want to talk a bit so before that let me

38
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:01,829
want to talk a bit so before that let me
 

39
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,130
want to talk a bit so before that let me
introduce the building project so we're

40
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,140
introduce the building project so we're
 

41
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,750
introduce the building project so we're
going to do the fishing shack over here

42
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
going to do the fishing shack over here
 

43
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,920
going to do the fishing shack over here
and I looked up some some videos not

44
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:09,930
and I looked up some some videos not
 

45
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,850
and I looked up some some videos not
videos images on Google for like what a

46
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:13,860
videos images on Google for like what a
 

47
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,679
videos images on Google for like what a
fishing shack actually looks like

48
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:15,689
fishing shack actually looks like
 

49
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,109
fishing shack actually looks like
because I wasn't I wasn't sure if

50
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:18,119
because I wasn't I wasn't sure if
 

51
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,429
because I wasn't I wasn't sure if
they're actually a real thing I just

52
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
they're actually a real thing I just
 

53
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,929
they're actually a real thing I just
called it that and it turns out they are

54
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:20,939
called it that and it turns out they are
 

55
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,289
called it that and it turns out they are
a real thing what a surprise and they're

56
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:27,299
a real thing what a surprise and they're
 

57
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,850
a real thing what a surprise and they're
pretty much what you would expect it's a

58
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:28,860
pretty much what you would expect it's a
 

59
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,270
pretty much what you would expect it's a
shack basically but from the images I

60
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280
shack basically but from the images I
 

61
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,270
shack basically but from the images I
saw they vary quite a bit you most of

62
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
saw they vary quite a bit you most of
 

63
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,700
saw they vary quite a bit you most of
them are pretty small though a lot of

64
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:37,710
them are pretty small though a lot of
 

65
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,069
them are pretty small though a lot of
the ones I saw were very old and rustic

66
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
the ones I saw were very old and rustic
 

67
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,190
the ones I saw were very old and rustic
looking kind of worn out and like almost

68
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
looking kind of worn out and like almost
 

69
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,100
looking kind of worn out and like almost
falling down this made out of wood most

70
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,110
falling down this made out of wood most
 

71
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,039
falling down this made out of wood most
of them and some of them were built in

72
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,049
of them and some of them were built in
 

73
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,840
of them and some of them were built in
the water some of them were built like

74
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:50,850
the water some of them were built like
 

75
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,270
the water some of them were built like
half in the water half on land so I'm

76
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
half in the water half on land so I'm
 

77
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,980
half in the water half on land so I'm
totally on land right next to the water

78
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:54,990
totally on land right next to the water
 

79
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,590
totally on land right next to the water
and yeah but pretty much all of them had

80
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,600
and yeah but pretty much all of them had
 

81
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,389
and yeah but pretty much all of them had
a dock around them so I think that's

82
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
a dock around them so I think that's
 

83
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,370
a dock around them so I think that's
what we'll do we'll try build it like

84
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,380
what we'll do we'll try build it like
 

85
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,429
what we'll do we'll try build it like
half in the water or at least maybe

86
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
half in the water or at least maybe
 

87
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,900
half in the water or at least maybe
mostly in the water and then part on

88
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:08,910
mostly in the water and then part on
 

89
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,100
mostly in the water and then part on
land and yeah so let's let's get it

90
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,110
land and yeah so let's let's get it
 

91
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,050
land and yeah so let's let's get it
going here

92
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,060
going here
 

93
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,979
going here
so my apologies guys it's been a good

94
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:18,989
so my apologies guys it's been a good
 

95
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,720

three days since I've been able to

96
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:20,730
three days since I've been able to
 

97
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,790
three days since I've been able to
record here actually let's figure out

98
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
record here actually let's figure out
 

99
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,460
record here actually let's figure out
where I want to line this up and I still

100
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,470
where I want to line this up and I still
 

101
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,559
where I want to line this up and I still
feel pretty crummy this last month has

102
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:30,569
feel pretty crummy this last month has
 

103
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,199
feel pretty crummy this last month has
actually been probably the worst in my

104
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,209
actually been probably the worst in my
 

105
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,589
actually been probably the worst in my
whole YouTube thing in terms of like

106
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:36,599
whole YouTube thing in terms of like
 

107
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,410
whole YouTube thing in terms of like
unexpected things coming up and making

108
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:39,420
unexpected things coming up and making
 

109
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,350
unexpected things coming up and making
it so I can't record and the number of

110
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,360
it so I can't record and the number of
 

111
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,820
it so I can't record and the number of
videos I've been putting out lately is

112
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,830
videos I've been putting out lately is
 

113
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,059
videos I've been putting out lately is
pretty crummy so my apologies for that

114
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:47,069
pretty crummy so my apologies for that
 

115
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,449
pretty crummy so my apologies for that
that's not like that's not going to be

116
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:50,459
that's not like that's not going to be
 

117
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,050
that's not like that's not going to be
like a routine thing is just a very bad

118
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,060
like a routine thing is just a very bad
 

119
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,890
like a routine thing is just a very bad
set of unexpected events happening that

120
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:57,900
set of unexpected events happening that
 

121
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,410
set of unexpected events happening that
is kind of put my channel in a debt and

122
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,420
is kind of put my channel in a debt and
 

123
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,350
is kind of put my channel in a debt and
a slump I guess but that's not going to

124
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
a slump I guess but that's not going to
 

125
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,059
a slump I guess but that's not going to
be characteristic of it I'm going to get

126
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,069
be characteristic of it I'm going to get
 

127
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,229
be characteristic of it I'm going to get
back to making videos like I used to

128
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
back to making videos like I used to
 

129
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,970
back to making videos like I used to
which wasn't very many I tried aim for

130
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:10,980
which wasn't very many I tried aim for
 

131
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,910
which wasn't very many I tried aim for
quality over quantity but still I looked

132
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
quality over quantity but still I looked
 

133
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,449
quality over quantity but still I looked
it up actually and like last month I put

134
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,459
it up actually and like last month I put
 

135
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,449
it up actually and like last month I put
out 22 videos the month before that I

136
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:20,459
out 22 videos the month before that I
 

137
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,199
out 22 videos the month before that I
put out 36 so there's definitely been a

138
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,209
put out 36 so there's definitely been a
 

139
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,660
put out 36 so there's definitely been a
drop and like two weeks of that was

140
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,670
drop and like two weeks of that was
 

141
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,449
drop and like two weeks of that was
because my internet went out

142
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:31,459
because my internet went out
 

143
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,949
because my internet went out
unexpectedly I'm just like setting up

144
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:33,959

145
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,379
unexpectedly I'm just like setting up
the dock here by the way made fashion

146
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:39,389
the dock here by the way made fashion
 

147
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,970
the dock here by the way made fashion
set up the dock first maybe I should

148
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:40,980
set up the dock first maybe I should
 

149
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,140
set up the dock first maybe I should
figure out where the cabin should go

150
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,150
figure out where the cabin should go
 

151
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,410

00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:51,739
to line up with this like these three
 

155
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:59,420
to line up with this like these three
blocks maybe we'll start it around here

156
00:03:59,420 --> 00:03:59,430
blocks maybe we'll start it around here
 

157
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,210
blocks maybe we'll start it around here
I would like it to be at least one block

158
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:02,220

749
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,260
still see the glowstone from the top I
did it's it's a lame roof but I think

750
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,270
did it's it's a lame roof but I think
 

751
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,910
did it's it's a lame roof but I think
it's okay because it's such a small

752
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:00,920
it's okay because it's such a small
 

753
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,940
it's okay because it's such a small
building I think it's okay I did the

754
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:03,950
building I think it's okay I did the
 

755
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,049
building I think it's okay I did the
crummy roof like I usually do but didn't

756
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:08,059
crummy roof like I usually do but didn't

see the ghosts on both sides if we cover

758
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:10,220
see the ghosts on both sides if we cover
 

759
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,289
see the ghosts on both sides if we cover
this though just go up for a second I

760
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:14,299
this though just go up for a second I
 

761
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,480
this though just go up for a second I
almost think we should leave it exposed

762
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,490
almost think we should leave it exposed
 

763
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,750
almost think we should leave it exposed
because if we tap if we cap it off with

764
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
because if we tap if we cap it off with
 

765
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,130
because if we tap if we cap it off with
something like that it gets really dark

766
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,140
something like that it gets really dark
 

767
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,740
something like that it gets really dark
up here because then there's no lighting

768
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:25,750

 

769
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,100

but I'm not sure of course I want

770
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,110

771
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,539
but I'm not sure of course I want

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,620
decide to do it from here
for here too and we have the dark wood

790
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:53,630
for here too and we have the dark wood
 

791
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,020
for here too and we have the dark wood
over top we have the regular wood along

792
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,030
over top we have the regular wood along
 

793
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,180
over top we have the regular wood along
the sides like the stairs going around

794
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,190
the sides like the stairs going around
 

795
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,180
the sides like the stairs going around
and then underneath it we have birch

796
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,190
and then underneath it we have birch
 

797
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,730
and then underneath it we have birch
wood so three different colors all all

798
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:03,740
wood so three different colors all all
 

799
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,130
wood so three different colors all all
mixed into one

800
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,140
mixed into one
 

801
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,650
mixed into one
pretty cool fences going up to it and

802
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:10,660

 

803
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,110

one why should one or two other things I

804
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,120
one why should one or two other things I
 

805
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,130
one why should one or two other things I
was considering maybe we should line the

806
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,140
was considering maybe we should line the
 

807
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,180
was considering maybe we should line the
bottom with something like that I'm

808
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,190
bottom with something like that I'm
 

809
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,130
bottom with something like that I'm
wondering maybe darker would be better

810
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,140
wondering maybe darker would be better
 

811
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,810
wondering maybe darker would be better
because we don't really want to focus on

812
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:28,820
because we don't really want to focus on
 

813
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,390
because we don't really want to focus on
it and that matches with these more so

814
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,400

 

815
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,650

possibly should we do that

816
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:38,660

 

817
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,200

one issue with that though is I liked

818
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,210
one issue with that though is I liked
 

819
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,630
one issue with that though is I liked
being able to see the water from this

820
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:43,640
being able to see the water from this
 

821
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,740
being able to see the water from this
side so we have to remove more dirts so

822
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:47,750
side so we have to remove more dirts so
 

823
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,500
side so we have to remove more dirts so
that we could still see it get this

824
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:53,510
that we could still see it get this
 

825
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,180
that we could still see it get this
going

826
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,190

 

827
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,660

830
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
mmm I'll work on it how about that I
 

831
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,140
mmm I'll work on it how about that I
could spend I could spend an hour on

832
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,150

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,390
keep the windows oh but I was thinking
maybe it would be better if we made them

850
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
maybe it would be better if we made them
 

851
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,120
maybe it would be better if we made them
a little more cheaper ronald woody maybe

852
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,130
a little more cheaper ronald woody maybe
 

853
