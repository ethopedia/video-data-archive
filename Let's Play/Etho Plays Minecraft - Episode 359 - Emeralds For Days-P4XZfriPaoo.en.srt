00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,250
they had to be naturally spawned in a
 

291
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,950
they had to be naturally spawned in a
village I couldn't breed them was my

292
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
village I couldn't breed them was my
 

293
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,280
village I couldn't breed them was my
original rule to it every time I found a

294
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,290

always died the zombies though and
 

299
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,150
always died the zombies though and

like one or two per village I think

302
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:52,780
like one or two per village I think
 

303
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,840
like one or two per village I think
that's still probably true though so

304
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:56,850
that's still probably true though so
 

305
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,580
that's still probably true though so
they were the rare two and I just never
