opposite side another thing I want to do
 

95
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:12,370
opposite side another thing I want to do
is a maze will do it right now

96
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:12,380

 

97
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,870

set this up so that it can handle squid

98
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:15,880
set this up so that it can handle squid
 

99
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:24,460
set this up so that it can handle squid
because squid spawn a lot now so we

100
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,470
because squid spawn a lot now so we
 

101
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,110
because squid spawn a lot now so we
should have a way of dealing with them

102
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,120
should have a way of dealing with them
 

103
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,099
should have a way of dealing with them
down here

104
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:30,109

 

105
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,940

okay so my old-style mob evader we use

106
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:34,950
okay so my old-style mob evader we use
 

107

okay so my old-style mob evader we use
pressure plates on the ground what we're

108
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:36,540
pressure plates on the ground what we're
 

109
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,319
pressure plates on the ground what we're
gonna do now is we're just gonna change

110
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,329
gonna do now is we're just gonna change
 

111
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:45,050

these two sides the blocks were the

112
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,060
these two sides the blocks were the
 

113
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,750
these two sides the blocks were the
pressure plates are so one here one here

114
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:50,760
pressure plates are so one here one here
 

115
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,300
pressure plates are so one here one here
and then do the sign on the sign trick

116
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,310
and then do the sign on the sign trick
 

117
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:01,420
and then do the sign on the sign trick
one there and do it on the other side I

118
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,430
one there and do it on the other side I
 

119
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,679
one there and do it on the other side I
should maybe put up a torch it's

120
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:03,689
should maybe put up a torch it's
 

121
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:12,649
should maybe put up a torch it's
probably dark now get here we go do it

122
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:12,659
probably dark now get here we go do it
 

123
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:21,400
probably dark now get here we go do it
again

124
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,410

 

125
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,040

and place the signs sign on the sign

126
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,050
and place the signs sign on the sign
 

127
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,870
and place the signs sign on the sign
make it match this one get pushed around

128
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
make it match this one get pushed around
 

129
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,409
make it match this one get pushed around
here

130
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:35,419

 

131
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:38,240

okay and what that does is it allows us

132
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,250
okay and what that does is it allows us
 

133
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:47,870
okay and what that does is it allows us
to have a hole here that the squid can

134
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880
to have a hole here that the squid can
 

135
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,450
to have a hole here that the squid can
fall down and that way they won't clog

136
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,460
fall down and that way they won't clog
 

137
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,029
fall down and that way they won't clog
up the system that's the whole point of

138
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,039
up the system that's the whole point of
 

139
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,020
up the system that's the whole point of
this and the other mobs will swim over

140
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,030
this and the other mobs will swim over
 

141
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,730
this and the other mobs will swim over
top the water and swim up so split sink

142
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:00,740
top the water and swim up so split sink
 

143
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,540
top the water and swim up so split sink
the pall mobs they they swim that's how

144
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:05,550
the pall mobs they they swim that's how
 

145
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,010
the pall mobs they they swim that's how
that's gonna work I made these pads out

146
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,020
that's gonna work I made these pads out
 

147
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,779
that's gonna work I made these pads out
of cobblestone just because it's

148
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:11,789
of cobblestone just because it's
 

149
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,810
of cobblestone just because it's
abundant my ice base I'll probably make

150
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:14,820
abundant my ice base I'll probably make
 

151
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,459
abundant my ice base I'll probably make
them out of sandstone because that's

152
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:16,469
them out of sandstone because that's
 

153
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:20,089
them out of sandstone because that's
what I like and I'll show you how I'm

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,170
blue shiny rock pay taxes here takes a
 

167
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,110
blue shiny rock pay taxes here takes a
bit of time doing all this but you know

168
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,120
bit of time doing all this but you know
 

169
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,000
bit of time doing all this but you know
it's important we do this I'm kind of

170
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,010
it's important we do this I'm kind of
 

171
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,740
it's important we do this I'm kind of
doing this so that I have a working

172
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:02,750
doing this so that I have a working
 

173
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,250
doing this so that I have a working
prototype of this mob system so when I

174
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,260
prototype of this mob system so when I
 

175
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,860
prototype of this mob system so when I
build a new one I'm sure it works you

176
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:08,870
build a new one I'm sure it works you
 

177
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,390
build a new one I'm sure it works you
know because there was a little bit of

178
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
know because there was a little bit of
 

179
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,650
know because there was a little bit of
doubt raised to me

180
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:11,660
doubt raised to me
 

181
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,060
doubt raised to me
last episode by certain people I want to

182
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,070
last episode by certain people I want to
 

183
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,270
last episode by certain people I want to
make sure this is all working and also I

184
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
make sure this is all working and also I
 

185
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,610
make sure this is all working and also I
want to test out that that they can

186
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:21,620
want to test out that that they can
 

187
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,860
want to test out that that they can
spawn on pressure plates I'm pretty sure

188
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:23,870
spawn on pressure plates I'm pretty sure
 

189
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,630
spawn on pressure plates I'm pretty sure
I tested that in the past and it worked

190
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:25,640
I tested that in the past and it worked
 

191
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,850
I tested that in the past and it worked
I know they also can spawn on signs and

192
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:29,860
I know they also can spawn on signs and
 

193
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,200
I know they also can spawn on signs and
if you have a sign at their head level

194
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,210
if you have a sign at their head level
 

195
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,300
if you have a sign at their head level
they will spawn but they won't move

196
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,310
they will spawn but they won't move
 

197
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,940
they will spawn but they won't move
they'll be stuck in the sign I know

198
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:36,950
they'll be stuck in the sign I know
 

199
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,110
they'll be stuck in the sign I know
that's the test I did before - okay so

200
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
that's the test I did before - okay so
 

201
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,980
that's the test I did before - okay so
now these ones with signs on dig them

202
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:46,990
now these ones with signs on dig them
 

203
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,580
now these ones with signs on dig them
play some cobble so that it looks good

204
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:50,590
play some cobble so that it looks good
 

205
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,350
play some cobble so that it looks good
well cobble doesn't look good but just

206
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
well cobble doesn't look good but just
 

207
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,090
well cobble doesn't look good but just
that it looks uniform like that and then

208
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:01,100
that it looks uniform like that and then
 

209
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,760
that it looks uniform like that and then
I fill this in a little outline of our

210
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:03,770
I fill this in a little outline of our
 

211
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:15,220
I fill this in a little outline of our
spawning pad this 6x6 oops okay so

212
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,230
spawning pad this 6x6 oops okay so
 

213
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,550
spawning pad this 6x6 oops okay so
that's our basic shape then I put down

214
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
that's our basic shape then I put down
 

215
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,290
that's our basic shape then I put down
the sticky pistons there's four in each

216
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:20,300
the sticky pistons there's four in each
 

217
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,710
the sticky pistons there's four in each
of these put in the corners okay and

218
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720
of these put in the corners okay and
 

219
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:36,460
of these put in the corners okay and
then we take this all down

220
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:36,470

 

221
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:42,270

and it's probably getting dark again

222
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,280

 

223
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,520

okay we dig that down I place four

224
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,530
okay we dig that down I place four
 

225
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,540
okay we dig that down I place four
blocks around on the right side get

226
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,550
blocks around on the right side get
 

227
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,890
blocks around on the right side get
roads these blocks showing here all four

228
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:53,900
roads these blocks showing here all four
 

229
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,640
roads these blocks showing here all four
sides

230
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,650
sides
 

231
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,350
sides
oops sorry about the camera control the

232
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
oops sorry about the camera control the
 

233
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,410
oops sorry about the camera control the
place it was cobble for that uniform

234
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:02,420
place it was cobble for that uniform
 

235
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,420
place it was cobble for that uniform
look and then we dig this down one and

236
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,430
look and then we dig this down one and
 

237
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,820
look and then we dig this down one and
replace it with cobble just to look make

238
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:09,830
replace it with cobble just to look make
 

239
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:21,040
replace it with cobble just to look make
it look good okay so that's the inside

240
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,050
it look good okay so that's the inside
 

241
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,710
it look good okay so that's the inside
of our spawning pad we place down wire

242
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:23,720
of our spawning pad we place down wire
 

243
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,870
of our spawning pad we place down wire
then in the center here just like this I

244
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:28,880
then in the center here just like this I
 

245
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,310
then in the center here just like this I
got it working so I don't need to use

246
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,320
got it working so I don't need to use
 

247
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,020
got it working so I don't need to use
repeaters so it'll save more redstone

248
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,030
repeaters so it'll save more redstone
 

249
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,050
repeaters so it'll save more redstone
and they'll be less delay and hopefully

250
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,060
and they'll be less delay and hopefully
 

251
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,800
and they'll be less delay and hopefully
less lag so there's 12 redstone dust and

252
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:38,810
less lag so there's 12 redstone dust and
 

253
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,800
less lag so there's 12 redstone dust and
a pad cover the four Center blocks to

254
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:44,810
a pad cover the four Center blocks to
 

255
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,230
a pad cover the four Center blocks to
cut the wires right so that the wire

256
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,240
cut the wires right so that the wire
 

257
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,080
cut the wires right so that the wire
points at the piston and then I'm not

258
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,090
points at the piston and then I'm not
 

259
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,400
points at the piston and then I'm not
sure if mobs can spawn on redstone but

260
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,410
sure if mobs can spawn on redstone but
 

261
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,020
sure if mobs can spawn on redstone but
at the moment none of my pads have

262
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,030
at the moment none of my pads have
 

263
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,410
at the moment none of my pads have
torches in if they can spawn on redstone

264
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,420
torches in if they can spawn on redstone
 

265
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,250
torches in if they can spawn on redstone
there's one block here where I'm worried

266
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,260
there's one block here where I'm worried
 

267
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,730
there's one block here where I'm worried
they'll be able to spawn inside the pad

268
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:08,740
they'll be able to spawn inside the pad
 

269
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,020
they'll be able to spawn inside the pad
so if they can and I'm gonna have to

270
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,030
so if they can and I'm gonna have to
 

271
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,420
so if they can and I'm gonna have to
replace or I'm gonna have to open up you

272
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,430
replace or I'm gonna have to open up you
 

273
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,000
replace or I'm gonna have to open up you
to these pads and place torches and so

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,010
to these pads and place torches and so
 

275
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,570
to these pads and place torches and so
that that doesn't happen but what I do

276
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:19,580
that that doesn't happen but what I do
 

277
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,230
that that doesn't happen but what I do
is I just cover this in a shanty my half

278
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,240
is I just cover this in a shanty my half
 

279
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,160
is I just cover this in a shanty my half
slabs place them on the Pistons

280
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,170

 

281
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:48,380

fill this in corners and the center and

282
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,390
fill this in corners and the center and
 

283
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,960
fill this in corners and the center and
that's how I've been changing the Pats

284
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:50,970
that's how I've been changing the Pats
 

285
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,900
that's how I've been changing the Pats
so they take a few minutes to do each

286
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:53,910
so they take a few minutes to do each
 

287
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,150
so they take a few minutes to do each
one but it's it's all for our future

288
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,160
one but it's it's all for our future
 

289
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,050
one but it's it's all for our future
plans let's test it out I will be

290
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,060
plans let's test it out I will be
 

291
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,940
plans let's test it out I will be
connecting from the bottom underneath I

292
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:04,950
connecting from the bottom underneath I
 

293
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,190
connecting from the bottom underneath I
think but you can also connect to the

294
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
think but you can also connect to the
 

295
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,810
think but you can also connect to the
sides here where the water normally

296
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:08,820
sides here where the water normally
 

297
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,810
sides here where the water normally
would be and they pop up like that and

298
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:14,820
would be and they pop up like that and
 

299
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,470
would be and they pop up like that and
go down so that's what we want so these

300
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
go down so that's what we want so these
 

301
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
go down so that's what we want so these
are all wired now all 16 pads and the

302
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:21,690
are all wired now all 16 pads and the
 

303
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,420
are all wired now all 16 pads and the
sides are all wired I'll show you how

304
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,430
sides are all wired I'll show you how
 

305
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:32,840
sides are all wired I'll show you how
they work so this is like where my

306
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:32,850
they work so this is like where my
 

307
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,460
they work so this is like where my
master controls going to be I think

308
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:34,470
master controls going to be I think
 

309
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,070
master controls going to be I think
let's just connect here somewhere

310
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,080
let's just connect here somewhere
 

311
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,010
let's just connect here somewhere
oh I think I'm on the wrong side yeah I

312
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,020
oh I think I'm on the wrong side yeah I
 

313
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,630
oh I think I'm on the wrong side yeah I
marked the main side with two torches on

314
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
marked the main side with two torches on
 

315
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,480
marked the main side with two torches on
the wall there yeah so this is where the

316
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,490
the wall there yeah so this is where the
 

317
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,800
the wall there yeah so this is where the
control will starts I break that torch

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:54,810
control will starts I break that torch
 

319
00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:00,290
control will starts I break that torch
they all go down and I just need to

320
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:00,300
they all go down and I just need to
 

321
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:08,150
they all go down and I just need to
build up my pads here and I'll probably

322
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
build up my pads here and I'll probably
 

323
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,080
build up my pads here and I'll probably
put some lighting under here probably

324
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,090
put some lighting under here probably
 

325
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,240
put some lighting under here probably
leave it like that so this is what the

326
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,250
leave it like that so this is what the
 

327
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,610
leave it like that so this is what the
pads will look like on top when they're

328
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:19,620
pads will look like on top when they're
 

329
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,770
pads will look like on top when they're
done

330
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:21,780
done
 

331
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,950
done
and so I'm gonna keep working on this I

332
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:24,960
and so I'm gonna keep working on this I
 

333
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,930
and so I'm gonna keep working on this I
am maybe we'll do some other stuff I've

334
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:30,940
am maybe we'll do some other stuff I've
 

335
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,180
am maybe we'll do some other stuff I've
been working on those spawning pads and

336
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,190
been working on those spawning pads and
 

337
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,580
been working on those spawning pads and
stuff wiring everything but I've ran out

338
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:35,590
stuff wiring everything but I've ran out
 

339
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,120
stuff wiring everything but I've ran out
of redstone now there's no more redstone

340
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,130
of redstone now there's no more redstone
 

341
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,980
of redstone now there's no more redstone
around here so we need to go back to the

342
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:40,990
around here so we need to go back to the
 

343
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,050
around here so we need to go back to the
lab back to ethos lab to collect some

344
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,060
lab back to ethos lab to collect some
 

345
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,490
lab back to ethos lab to collect some
more I could take the suicide booth but

346
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:50,500
more I could take the suicide booth but
 

347
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,870
more I could take the suicide booth but
then I would have to drop off all my

348
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:51,880
then I would have to drop off all my
 

349
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,240
then I would have to drop off all my
items and I've never shown you guys

350
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,250
items and I've never shown you guys
 

351
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,020
items and I've never shown you guys
actually how to get there from here so

352
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,030
actually how to get there from here so
 

353
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,460
actually how to get there from here so
we're gonna go on a little journey here

354
00:11:59,460 --> 00:11:59,470
we're gonna go on a little journey here
 

355
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,220
we're gonna go on a little journey here
it's not too far

356
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,230
it's not too far
 

357
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:10,050
it's not too far
bases at X 1024 and Zed 512 and we can

358
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:10,060
bases at X 1024 and Zed 512 and we can
 

359
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,580
bases at X 1024 and Zed 512 and we can
get pretty much all the way there just

this is really cool I like this area a
 

385
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,150
this is really cool I like this area a
lot it's like deep oceans and high

386
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
lot it's like deep oceans and high
 

387

may eventually build some stuff around

390
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:21,870
may eventually build some stuff around
 

391
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,050
may eventually build some stuff around
here just because I like the way this

392
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,060
here just because I like the way this
 

393
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:34,490
here just because I like the way this
looks eventually I think I'm just gonna

394
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:34,500
looks eventually I think I'm just gonna
 

395
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,699
looks eventually I think I'm just gonna
build a minecart system through here

396
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:37,709
build a minecart system through here
 

397
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:38,240
build a minecart system through here
anyway

398
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,250
anyway
 

399
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,140
anyway
just to simplify things because using

400
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,150
just to simplify things because using
 

401
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,120
just to simplify things because using
the suicide booth is quick but it you

402
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,130
the suicide booth is quick but it you
 

403
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,320
the suicide booth is quick but it you
know it's you can't carry stuff to the

404
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,330
know it's you can't carry stuff to the
 

405
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,360
know it's you can't carry stuff to the
lab using it so we should have minecarts

406
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,370
lab using it so we should have minecarts
 

407
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,060
lab using it so we should have minecarts
I may also extend the eats run out that

408
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,070
I may also extend the eats run out that
 

409
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,560
I may also extend the eats run out that
far too although I might not make the

410
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:00,570
far too although I might not make the
 

411
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,240
far too although I might not make the
eats roads super fancy because that's a

412
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,250
eats roads super fancy because that's a
 

413
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,269
eats roads super fancy because that's a
long ways to go and we just keep sailing

414
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:08,279
long ways to go and we just keep sailing
 

415
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,150

updating kind of slow yeah that's where

418
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:20,790
updating kind of slow yeah that's where
 

419
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,720
updating kind of slow yeah that's where
the ice started so I just followed that

420
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:26,730
the ice started so I just followed that
 

421
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,490
the ice started so I just followed that
ice when I saw it until I found a nice

422
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,500
ice when I saw it until I found a nice
 

423
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,069
ice when I saw it until I found a nice
open area which is where we ended up

424
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
open area which is where we ended up
 

425
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,710
open area which is where we ended up
building the base

426
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720

 

427
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,310

and over here it's kind of a arid land

428
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
and over here it's kind of a arid land
 

429
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,350
and over here it's kind of a arid land
nothing special I don't like arid places

430
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
nothing special I don't like arid places
 

431
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,750
nothing special I don't like arid places
like that this is usually where I get

432
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:52,760
like that this is usually where I get
 

433
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,639

off you can see somebody old boats here

434
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:54,649
off you can see somebody old boats here
 

435
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:09,600
off you can see somebody old boats here
still that takes us to 8:35 and 307 so

436
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,610
still that takes us to 8:35 and 307 so
 

437
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,569
still that takes us to 8:35 and 307 so
pretty close just go a little bit

438
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:13,579
pretty close just go a little bit
 

439
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:21,790
pretty close just go a little bit
further this way on land bunch of ice

440
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:21,800
further this way on land bunch of ice
 

441
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:33,780

around here keep following the land here

442
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:33,790

 

443
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,000

used to look a lot different though

444
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,010
used to look a lot different though
 

445
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,470

that's the big landmass I blew up it's

446
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:41,480
that's the big landmass I blew up it's
 

447
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:51,069
that's the big landmass I blew up it's
all frozen over now and there's the lab

448
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:51,079
all frozen over now and there's the lab
 

449
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,269
all frozen over now and there's the lab
just like we left it and yes I could

450
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
just like we left it and yes I could
 

451
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,920
just like we left it and yes I could
have used Pistons to move grass up I

452
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:56,930
have used Pistons to move grass up I
 

453
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,960
have used Pistons to move grass up I
wasn't thinking about that last when I

454
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:58,970
wasn't thinking about that last when I
 

455
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,350
wasn't thinking about that last when I
did it so that is a better way of moving

456
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,360
did it so that is a better way of moving
 

457
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:12,730
did it so that is a better way of moving
grass as many of you suggested well what

458
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:12,740
grass as many of you suggested well what
 

459
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,620

happened here man like three colors of

460
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:17,630
happened here man like three colors of
 

461
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,110
happened here man like three colors of
wool on the ground meat crazy okay and

462
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
wool on the ground meat crazy okay and
 

463
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:31,090
wool on the ground meat crazy okay and
this is where my redstone is somewhere

464
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,100

 

465
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:42,100

I hope I have some they always iron

466
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,110
I hope I have some they always iron
 

467
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,760
I hope I have some they always iron
I'm gonna take that with me to bring

468
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:48,770
I'm gonna take that with me to bring
 

469
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:57,010
I'm gonna take that with me to bring
some of this oh that's it it's all my

470

some of this oh that's it it's all my
 

471
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,920
some of this oh that's it it's all my
redstone so I'm running out again okay

472
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:02,930

 

473
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:18,670

let's head back those are empty ages so

474
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:18,680
let's head back those are empty ages so
 

475
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:27,400
let's head back those are empty ages so
we hit back through the portal we are on

476
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,410
we hit back through the portal we are on
 

477
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,810
we hit back through the portal we are on
hard by the way I always make sure

478
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:30,820
hard by the way I always make sure
 

479
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:39,860
hard by the way I always make sure

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,030
working on the mob system got late next
 

507
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,290
working on the mob system got late next
day same thing I rewatched the prestige

508
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:37,300
day same thing I rewatched the prestige
 

509
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,960
day same thing I rewatched the prestige
while working on the mob system because

510
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:39,970
while working on the mob system because
 

511
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,870
while working on the mob system because
it was such a good movie and now many

512
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
it was such a good movie and now many
 

513
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,330
it was such a good movie and now many
many hours later the mob system is close

514
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:48,340
many hours later the mob system is close
 

515
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,050
many hours later the mob system is close
to done so I've gotten a lot done but

516
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,060
to done so I've gotten a lot done but

526
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:11,590
just run through all the changes I've
 

527
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,560

529
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,720
made I got rid of all the soil and stone
and gravel and replaced everything with

530
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:18,730
and gravel and replaced everything with
 

531
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,290
and gravel and replaced everything with
the clean cobblestone finish so even

532
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:24,300
the clean cobblestone finish so even
 

533
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,400
the clean cobblestone finish so even
everything is cobblestone now all the

534
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,410
everything is cobblestone now all the
 

535
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,850
everything is cobblestone now all the
canals all the pads the ceiling the

536
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:32,860
canals all the pads the ceiling the
 

537
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,650
canals all the pads the ceiling the
walls it's all cobble okay other thing I

538
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:37,660
walls it's all cobble okay other thing I
 

539
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,780
walls it's all cobble okay other thing I
did we have a lighting system now get to

540
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:42,790
did we have a lighting system now get to
 

541
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:50,340
did we have a lighting system now get to
that a little bit I've also added a

542
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,350
that a little bit I've also added a
 

543
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,430
that a little bit I've also added a
squid killing thing here I finished this

544
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
squid killing thing here I finished this
 

545
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,260
squid killing thing here I finished this
up put some lights around

546
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,270
up put some lights around
 

547
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,680
up put some lights around
so I got four water sources here in the

548
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:02,690
so I got four water sources here in the
 

549
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,410
so I got four water sources here in the
center they push the squid to this lava

550
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:05,420
center they push the squid to this lava
 

551
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,980
center they push the squid to this lava
and they'll kill them if we want if you

552
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:08,990
and they'll kill them if we want if you
 

553
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,419
and they'll kill them if we want if you
don't want to kill this food if we just

554
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:10,429
don't want to kill this food if we just
 

555
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:13,419
don't want to kill this food if we just
want them to collect I'll keep the

556
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:13,429
want them to collect I'll keep the
 

557
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,820
want them to collect I'll keep the
trapdoors down and this squid will land

558
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:15,830
trapdoors down and this squid will land
 

559
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,680
trapdoors down and this squid will land
on top of them that's that plan that

560
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:20,690
on top of them that's that plan that
 

561
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,280
on top of them that's that plan that
should work pretty good I think I still

562
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,290
should work pretty good I think I still
 

563
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,220
should work pretty good I think I still
don't have the water canals in here it

564
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,230
don't have the water canals in here it
 

565
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,900
don't have the water canals in here it
wanted to show you this before I put

566
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:28,910
wanted to show you this before I put
 

567
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:36,220
wanted to show you this before I put
them back yeah and I started working on

568
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,230
them back yeah and I started working on
 

569
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,150
them back yeah and I started working on
a little control room viewing area type

570
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,160
a little control room viewing area type
 

571
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,330
a little control room viewing area type
thing that's what this is here not not a

572
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:46,340
thing that's what this is here not not a
 

573
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,610
thing that's what this is here not not a
whole lot done on it yet I added like a

574
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:48,620
whole lot done on it yet I added like a
 

575
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,960
whole lot done on it yet I added like a
sliding door thing cuz I always wanted

576
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:52,970
sliding door thing cuz I always wanted
 

577
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,310
sliding door thing cuz I always wanted
to build one of those since I saw one in

578
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,320
to build one of those since I saw one in
 

579
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,410
to build one of those since I saw one in
a document view that's cool there's a

580
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:02,420
a document view that's cool there's a
 

581
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,720
a document view that's cool there's a
lock for it

582
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:03,730
lock for it
 

583
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,610
lock for it
so the mobs can't get back in if we have

584
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:06,620
so the mobs can't get back in if we have
 

585
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,340
so the mobs can't get back in if we have
it locked or can't get in if it's locked

586
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,350
it locked or can't get in if it's locked
 

587
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,690
it locked or can't get in if it's locked
I should say let's let's go down here

588
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:13,700
I should say let's let's go down here
 

589
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,510
I should say let's let's go down here
show you changes I made with the wiring

590
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:16,520
show you changes I made with the wiring
 

591
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,930
show you changes I made with the wiring
and stuff

592
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:21,940

 

593
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,960

or how the wiring works so this I think

594
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:27,970
or how the wiring works so this I think
 

595
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,350
or how the wiring works so this I think
I showed you this before and I just

596
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
I showed you this before and I just
 

597
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,900
I showed you this before and I just
added this cobblestone wall here these

598
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:33,910
added this cobblestone wall here these
 

599
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,850
added this cobblestone wall here these
go to the Pistons there's a piston right

600
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:35,860
go to the Pistons there's a piston right
 

601
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,410
go to the Pistons there's a piston right
there

602
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:36,420
there
 

603
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,880
there
it goes all the way around I added

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:38,890
it goes all the way around I added
 

605
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,370
it goes all the way around I added
torches in here because I noticed mobs

606
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:41,380
torches in here because I noticed mobs
 

607
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,640
torches in here because I noticed mobs
were spawning on the redstone or else

608
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:44,650
were spawning on the redstone or else
 

609
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,740
were spawning on the redstone or else
they responding on these uh repeaters

610
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:46,750
they responding on these uh repeaters
 

611
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,740
they responding on these uh repeaters
I'm not sure so I may need to add

612
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:49,750
I'm not sure so I may need to add
 

613
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,140
I'm not sure so I may need to add
torches in my spawning pads after all

614
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,150
torches in my spawning pads after all
 

615
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,530
torches in my spawning pads after all
because there's four blocks where I

616
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:55,540
because there's four blocks where I
 

617
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,540
because there's four blocks where I
think they'll be able to spawn if

618
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:57,550
think they'll be able to spawn if
 

619
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,710
think they'll be able to spawn if
there's no light this goes all the way

620
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:01,720
there's no light this goes all the way
 

621
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,790
there's no light this goes all the way
around and these Pistons are for the

622
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:05,800
around and these Pistons are for the
 

623
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,460
around and these Pistons are for the
spider thing to turn spider spotting on

624
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:08,470
spider thing to turn spider spotting on
 

625
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:16,410
spider thing to turn spider spotting on
or off the ones that wrap all around our

626
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:16,420
or off the ones that wrap all around our
 

627
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,190
or off the ones that wrap all around our
for the outside ring I have and these

628
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,200
for the outside ring I have and these
 

629
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,030
for the outside ring I have and these
paths down here this wiring here is for

630
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,040
paths down here this wiring here is for
 

631
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,190
paths down here this wiring here is for
the spawning pads ooh

632
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,200

 

633
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,740

so why are you go straight right above

634
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:31,750
so why are you go straight right above
 

635
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,220
so why are you go straight right above
here is the spawning pad there's another

636
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,230
here is the spawning pad there's another
 

637
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,060
here is the spawning pad there's another
one above here another one above here

638
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,070
one above here another one above here
 

639
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,640
one above here another one above here
and another one above here so there's

640

total there are sixteen spawning pads
 

645
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,580
total there are sixteen spawning pads
and I have four wires so four times four

646
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:50,590
and I have four wires so four times four

and go to this redstone torch

658
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:15,750
and go to this redstone torch
 

659
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,390
and go to this redstone torch
there's a wire above that block and one

660
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
there's a wire above that block and one
 

661
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:26,220
there's a wire above that block and one
above that one and pistons bottom ones

662
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,230
above that one and pistons bottom ones
 

663
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,810
above that one and pistons bottom ones
over there and there's another one on

664

over there and there's another one on
 

665
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,170
over there and there's another one on
top of it they're pretty easy to set up

666
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:31,180
top of it they're pretty easy to set up
 

667
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,970
top of it they're pretty easy to set up
those sliding doors it's just a little

668
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:35,980
those sliding doors it's just a little
 

669
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,590
those sliding doors it's just a little
hard to see right now

670
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600

 

671
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,300

and I forgot how to get out of here oh

672
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,310
and I forgot how to get out of here oh
 

673
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:48,900
and I forgot how to get out of here oh
yeah over here so this one goes down to

674
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:48,910
yeah over here so this one goes down to
 

675
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,480
yeah over here so this one goes down to
that lower wiring for the for these uh

676
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:53,490
that lower wiring for the for these uh
 

677
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,270
that lower wiring for the for these uh
pressure plates to come out I did hook a

678
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,280
pressure plates to come out I did hook a
 

679
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:06,960
pressure plates to come out I did hook a
lever up for pretty cool like I don't

680
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:06,970
lever up for pretty cool like I don't
 

681
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,730
lever up for pretty cool like I don't
even know how many there on just tons

682
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:08,740
even know how many there on just tons
 

683
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,310
even know how many there on just tons
I'm sure I should I'll be able to tell

684
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,320
I'm sure I should I'll be able to tell
 

685
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,210
I'm sure I should I'll be able to tell
you in a second if you shout this okay

686
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:15,220
you in a second if you shout this okay
 

687
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,880
you in a second if you shout this okay
so there's 16 pads there's four on each

688
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:17,890
so there's 16 pads there's four on each
 

689
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,420
so there's 16 pads there's four on each
and then there's one two three four five

690
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,430
and then there's one two three four five
 

691
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,320
and then there's one two three four five
six times two is twelve thirteen

692
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,330
six times two is twelve thirteen
 

693
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:30,510
six times two is twelve thirteen
thirteen times four is the den fifty-two

694
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:30,520
thirteen times four is the den fifty-two
 

695
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:38,670
thirteen times four is the den fifty-two
I believe so 52 plus 16 times four is 16

696
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:38,680
I believe so 52 plus 16 times four is 16
 

697
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,640
I believe so 52 plus 16 times four is 16
times four

698
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:41,650

 

699
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:49,800

oh brain leg brain leg 40 plus 24 is 64

700
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:49,810
oh brain leg brain leg 40 plus 24 is 64
 

701
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,930
oh brain leg brain leg 40 plus 24 is 64
so 64 plus I forgot what I said thirteen

702
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:54,940
so 64 plus I forgot what I said thirteen
 

703
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,050
so 64 plus I forgot what I said thirteen
times four is you know I'm gonna I'm

704
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,060
times four is you know I'm gonna I'm
 

705
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,880
times four is you know I'm gonna I'm
just gonna use especially this is stupid

706
00:24:59,880 --> 00:24:59,890
just gonna use especially this is stupid
 

707
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,650
just gonna use especially this is stupid
13 times four plus 64

708
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:05,660
13 times four plus 64
 

709
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,230
13 times four plus 64
hundred and sixteen fresh or a hundred

710
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
hundred and sixteen fresh or a hundred
 

711
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,120
hundred and sixteen fresh or a hundred
and sixteen of these half-slabs pop out

712
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,130
and sixteen of these half-slabs pop out
 

713
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:16,960
and sixteen of these half-slabs pop out
of the ground that's a lot one piston

714
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:16,970
of the ground that's a lot one piston
 

715
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,850
of the ground that's a lot one piston
for each and there's also a hundred and

716
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:18,860
for each and there's also a hundred and
 

717
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,870
for each and there's also a hundred and
sixteen of these lava lights I thought

718
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
sixteen of these lava lights I thought
 

719
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,750
sixteen of these lava lights I thought
about the lighting a lot tried different

720
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
about the lighting a lot tried different
 

721
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,120
about the lighting a lot tried different
methods different types of lights some

722
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,130
methods different types of lights some
 

723
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,260
methods different types of lights some
that pop down from the ceiling like

724
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,270
that pop down from the ceiling like
 

725
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,720
that pop down from the ceiling like
using glowstone that comes down and then

726
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,730
using glowstone that comes down and then
 

727
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,420
using glowstone that comes down and then
gets replaced with cobblestone and you

728
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:37,430
gets replaced with cobblestone and you
 

729
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,930
gets replaced with cobblestone and you
know what

730
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:37,940
know what
 

731
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,440
know what
lava seemed like the simplest best

732
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,450
lava seemed like the simplest best
 

733
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,860
lava seemed like the simplest best
solution for me so that's what I chose

734
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:46,870
solution for me so that's what I chose
 

735
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,670
solution for me so that's what I chose
as each lab a light only uses one piston

736
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:50,680
as each lab a light only uses one piston
 

737
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:58,290
as each lab a light only uses one piston
no glowstone which is a nice feature and

738
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:58,300
no glowstone which is a nice feature and
 

739
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,780
no glowstone which is a nice feature and
it's pretty pretty simple the wire uses

740
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:01,790
it's pretty pretty simple the wire uses
 

741
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:09,090
it's pretty pretty simple the wire uses
little redstone with this method so oh

742
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,100
little redstone with this method so oh
 

743
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,040
little redstone with this method so oh
yeah and like the ones where the

744
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,050
yeah and like the ones where the
 

745
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,690
yeah and like the ones where the
glowstone comes down from the ceiling

746
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:13,700
glowstone comes down from the ceiling
 

747
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,670
glowstone comes down from the ceiling
and then retracts and gets replaced with

748
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:15,680
and then retracts and gets replaced with
 

749
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,160
and then retracts and gets replaced with
cobblestone that takes a lot of space

750
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,170
cobblestone that takes a lot of space
 

751
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,730
cobblestone that takes a lot of space
and it also each light takes three

752
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:21,740
and it also each light takes three
 

753
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,660
and it also each light takes three
Pistons at least I believe so with this

754
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:25,670
Pistons at least I believe so with this
 

755
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,670
Pistons at least I believe so with this
one they all take one they only take one

756
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:27,680
one they all take one they only take one
 

757
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,640
one they all take one they only take one
the light is pretty dim but it's spread

758
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:30,650
the light is pretty dim but it's spread
 

759
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,340
the light is pretty dim but it's spread
out very evenly because there's so many

760
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,350
out very evenly because there's so many
 

761
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,360
out very evenly because there's so many
lights so that's the way I like it and

762
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,370
lights so that's the way I like it and
 

763
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,980
lights so that's the way I like it and
that's bright enough that mobs won't

764
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:38,990
that's bright enough that mobs won't
 

765
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:45,760
that's bright enough that mobs won't
spawn so directly what the heck how did

766
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:45,770
spawn so directly what the heck how did
 

767
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:57,910
spawn so directly what the heck how did
I fall no no what happened there oh you

768
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:57,920
I fall no no what happened there oh you
 

769
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,000
I fall no no what happened there oh you
know what oh you you know what happened

770
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,010

 

771
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,370

ah by the way I came here to get some

772
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:06,380
ah by the way I came here to get some
 

773
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,490
ah by the way I came here to get some
redstone out of the chest

774
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:08,500
redstone out of the chest
 

775
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,830
redstone out of the chest
as apparently I had four or five stacks

776
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:10,840
as apparently I had four or five stacks
 

777
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,020
as apparently I had four or five stacks
here but you know what happened there

778
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,030
here but you know what happened there
 

779
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,050
here but you know what happened there
I fell through the ground because there

780
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,060
I fell through the ground because there
 

781
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,030
I fell through the ground because there
was a repeater on the ground I'm sure

782
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,040
was a repeater on the ground I'm sure
 

783
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,020
was a repeater on the ground I'm sure
that's what happened

784
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,030
that's what happened
 

785
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:26,580
that's what happened
oh I gotta hurry back my stuff better be

786
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:26,590
oh I gotta hurry back my stuff better be
 

787
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:34,430
oh I gotta hurry back my stuff better be
there that was a long walk actually

788
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,440

 

789
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,140

dang it I bet you I lost a lot of stuff

790
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,150
dang it I bet you I lost a lot of stuff
 

791
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,090
dang it I bet you I lost a lot of stuff
there

792
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,100

 

793
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,430

my pistons are fine I got a lot of

794
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:44,440
my pistons are fine I got a lot of
 

795
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,810
my pistons are fine I got a lot of
redstone back I think that's what I'm

796
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:48,820
redstone back I think that's what I'm
 

797
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,800
redstone back I think that's what I'm
mostly concerned about losing redstone

798
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:54,810

 

799
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:08,940

that's sucked

800
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:08,950

 

801
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,140

okay I just did that to get rid of the

802
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,150
okay I just did that to get rid of the
 

803
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,460
okay I just did that to get rid of the
water so that I could pick the slap up

804
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:14,470
water so that I could pick the slap up
 

805
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:24,220
water so that I could pick the slap up
make sure there's no items over here all

806
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,230
make sure there's no items over here all
 

807
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,520
make sure there's no items over here all
the lights are directly above the half

808
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,530
the lights are directly above the half
 

809
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:35,950
the lights are directly above the half
slabs down there put this back and I'm

810
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:35,960
slabs down there put this back and I'm
 

811
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,600
slabs down there put this back and I'm
gonna be a lot more careful and walking

812
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,610
gonna be a lot more careful and walking
 

813
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:41,590
gonna be a lot more careful and walking
around up here now there's a little

814
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
around up here now there's a little
 

815
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,500
around up here now there's a little
override switch up here Jason want to

816
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,510
override switch up here Jason want to
 

817
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:53,770
override switch up here Jason want to
test things out this took forever to dig

818
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:53,780
test things out this took forever to dig
 

819
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,160
test things out this took forever to dig
out and I had no TNT around I don't know

820
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,170
out and I had no TNT around I don't know
 

821
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,140
out and I had no TNT around I don't know
what happened to it all like it all

822
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,150
what happened to it all like it all
 

823
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:04,270
what happened to it all like it all
disappeared somewhere yeah I definitely

824
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,280
disappeared somewhere yeah I definitely
 

825
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,780
disappeared somewhere yeah I definitely
fell through a repeater B oh wait yeah

826
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:10,790
fell through a repeater B oh wait yeah
 

827
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,160
fell through a repeater B oh wait yeah
yeah I did because I just mined this out

828
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,170
yeah I did because I just mined this out
 

829
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,270
yeah I did because I just mined this out
there's no way I could fall into that

830
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,280
there's no way I could fall into that
 

831
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:24,730
there's no way I could fall into that
lab otherwise anyway so there's a lava

832
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:24,740
lab otherwise anyway so there's a lava
 

833
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,830
lab otherwise anyway so there's a lava
all the way on the outside and then

834
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:26,840
all the way on the outside and then
 

835
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,610
all the way on the outside and then
there's these four lines here and it all

836
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:33,620
there's these four lines here and it all
 

837
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,890
there's these four lines here and it all
kind of comes together this thing gets

838
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:38,900
kind of comes together this thing gets
 

839
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,980
kind of comes together this thing gets
activated it moves this block over lasts

840
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:41,990
activated it moves this block over lasts
 

841
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,430
activated it moves this block over lasts
directly below here so the lava gets

842
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,440
directly below here so the lava gets
 

843
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,070
directly below here so the lava gets
replaced with a cobblestone block when

844
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
replaced with a cobblestone block when
 

845
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,280
replaced with a cobblestone block when
this is extended and when it retracts

846
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,290
this is extended and when it retracts
 

847
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,320
this is extended and when it retracts
the lab is able to flow again and it

848
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,330
the lab is able to flow again and it
 

849
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,330
the lab is able to flow again and it
goes over top the glass that's how it

850
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:55,340
goes over top the glass that's how it
 

851
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,810
goes over top the glass that's how it
works and managed to keep it all within

852
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:01,820
works and managed to keep it all within
 

853
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,060
works and managed to keep it all within
2 blocks high which is great because I

854
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,070
2 blocks high which is great because I
 

855
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,160
2 blocks high which is great because I
really did not want to mine out any more

856
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,170
really did not want to mine out any more
 

857
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:12,660
really did not want to mine out any more
than I had to it took a few hours to do

858
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:12,670

 

859
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,180

uh-huh eventually I'll release my world

860
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,190
uh-huh eventually I'll release my world
 

861
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,240
uh-huh eventually I'll release my world
again and you can check this out in

862
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,250
again and you can check this out in
 

863
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:25,660
again and you can check this out in
further detail if you want and I'm gonna

864
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:25,670
further detail if you want and I'm gonna
 

865
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:34,530
further detail if you want and I'm gonna
have these little viewing areas here

866
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:34,540
have these little viewing areas here
 

867
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:46,560
have these little viewing areas here
thanks placement something like this so

868
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:46,570
thanks placement something like this so
 

869
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,000
thanks placement something like this so
this lever I'm actually going to change

870
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,010
this lever I'm actually going to change
 

871
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,810
this lever I'm actually going to change
to the lighting because it makes sense

872
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:52,820
to the lighting because it makes sense
 

873
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,270
to the lighting because it makes sense
because the lighting access is on the

874
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,280
because the lighting access is on the
 

875
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,990
because the lighting access is on the
side and I'm gonna change the spyder

876
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,000
side and I'm gonna change the spyder
 

877
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,539
side and I'm gonna change the spyder
option to this side because the wiring

878
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:01,549
option to this side because the wiring
 

879
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:04,060
option to this side because the wiring
for it is on the side because you go

880
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,070
for it is on the side because you go
 

881
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,880
for it is on the side because you go
down here to get to the wiring for it

882
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:08,890

 

883
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,640

I'll have that will have a glass on this

884
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:12,650
I'll have that will have a glass on this
 

885
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:20,770
I'll have that will have a glass on this
side too all the way mobs won't be able

886
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:20,780
side too all the way mobs won't be able
 

887
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,720
side too all the way mobs won't be able
to get in will have lighting on this

888
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:22,730
to get in will have lighting on this
 

889
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,510
to get in will have lighting on this
back will position it just right so that

890
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,520
back will position it just right so that
 

891
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,549
back will position it just right so that
it doesn't interfere with spawning here

892
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:27,559
it doesn't interfere with spawning here
 

893
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,000
it doesn't interfere with spawning here
and yet no mobs will be able to spawn in

894
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,010
and yet no mobs will be able to spawn in
 

895
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:37,120
and yet no mobs will be able to spawn in
here in the control room but that's all

896
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,130
here in the control room but that's all
 

897
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,210
here in the control room but that's all
a project for another day cuz this is a

898
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:39,220
a project for another day cuz this is a
 

899
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,210
a project for another day cuz this is a
getting along a lot of work to this

900
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:45,220
getting along a lot of work to this
 

901
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,930
getting along a lot of work to this
pretty much had to remove the mob system

902
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:49,940
pretty much had to remove the mob system
 

903
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,440
pretty much had to remove the mob system
and recreate it a hundred times more

904
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,450
and recreate it a hundred times more
 

905
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:59,680
and recreate it a hundred times more
complex a lot of work to it if you're

906
00:31:59,680 --> 00:31:59,690
complex a lot of work to it if you're
 

907
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,260
complex a lot of work to it if you're
doing stuff with lighting I'll explain

908
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,270
doing stuff with lighting I'll explain
 

909
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,070
doing stuff with lighting I'll explain
how you calculate this so lava glow

910
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
how you calculate this so lava glow
 

911
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,240
how you calculate this so lava glow
stone pumpkins fire that stuff has a

912
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,250
stone pumpkins fire that stuff has a
 

913
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,030
stone pumpkins fire that stuff has a
light level of fifteen torches at a

914
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,040
light level of fifteen torches at a
 

915
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,419
light level of fifteen torches at a
light level of 14 so it's one less so

916
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:16,429
light level of 14 so it's one less so
 

917
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:18,490
light level of 14 so it's one less so
where the block where the lava is is

918
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:18,500
where the block where the lava is is
 

919
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,610
where the block where the lava is is
light level 15 where the glasses is 14

920
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:21,620
light level 15 where the glasses is 14
 

921
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,760
light level 15 where the glasses is 14
and this is three high so it has to come

922
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:24,770
and this is three high so it has to come
 

923
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,750
and this is three high so it has to come
down three more

924
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
down three more
 

925
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,360
down three more
so 13 12 11 is where this half slab is

926
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,370
so 13 12 11 is where this half slab is
 

927
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,940
so 13 12 11 is where this half slab is
light level 11

928
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:33,950
light level 11
 

929
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,420
light level 11
spread out 1 block this way is 10 then

930
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:37,430
spread out 1 block this way is 10 then
 

931
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,880
spread out 1 block this way is 10 then
diagonally here from that is 9 so that's

932
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:42,890
diagonally here from that is 9 so that's
 

933
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,890
diagonally here from that is 9 so that's
the lowest level of light right here at

934
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:44,900
the lowest level of light right here at
 

935
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,170
the lowest level of light right here at
level 9 and hostile mob spawn at level 7

936
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,180
level 9 and hostile mob spawn at level 7
 

937
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,280
level 9 and hostile mob spawn at level 7
or less so it's plenty plenty right in

938
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,290
or less so it's plenty plenty right in
 

939
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,000
or less so it's plenty plenty right in
here don't have to worry about them

940
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,010
here don't have to worry about them
 

941
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,680
here don't have to worry about them
spawning when the lights are on except

942
00:32:59,680 --> 00:32:59,690
spawning when the lights are on except
 

943
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,940
spawning when the lights are on except
in these canals because they're not

944
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:00,950
in these canals because they're not
 

945
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:06,460
in these canals because they're not
filled yet so that's how you Tet delete

946
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,470
filled yet so that's how you Tet delete
 

947
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,630
filled yet so that's how you Tet delete
that same thing here I'll calculate it

948
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
that same thing here I'll calculate it
 

949
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,380
that same thing here I'll calculate it
so that like this cobblestone here is

950
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,390
so that like this cobblestone here is
 

951
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,230
so that like this cobblestone here is
that light light level aid at least and

952
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,240
that light light level aid at least and
 

953
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,140
that light light level aid at least and
everything out there will be lower so

954
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,150
everything out there will be lower so
 

955
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,190
everything out there will be lower so
let the in spawn so that's how that's

956
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,200
let the in spawn so that's how that's
 

957
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,810
let the in spawn so that's how that's
