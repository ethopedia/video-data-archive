down there I moved it over one block
 

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,930
down there I moved it over one block
then I tested out the astroturf ID it

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:47,940
then I tested out the astroturf ID it
 

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,260
then I tested out the astroturf ID it
looks decent so we're going to be

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,290
without spreading water everywhere
 

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,420
without spreading water everywhere
hopefully and let's place our lab over

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,430
hopefully and let's place our lab over
 

41
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,370
hopefully and let's place our lab over
here there's going to be a mostly

42
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,380
here there's going to be a mostly
 

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:57,649
here there's going to be a mostly

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:09,130
building episode so yeah I'm completely
get rid of this thing

46
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:09,140

 

47
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,810

00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:26,580
chops so I guess it's kind of to please
 

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,370
chops so I guess it's kind of to please
everybody pick out four for calling

56
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,380
everybody pick out four for calling
 

57
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,960
everybody pick out four for calling
bacon though even though that's probably

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:35,970
bacon though even though that's probably
 

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:55,340
bacon though even though that's probably
not correct J yeah so this update no no

60
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,350
not correct J yeah so this update no no
 

61
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,340
not correct J yeah so this update no no
aah

62
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,350

 

63
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,220

eat one water preserve much damage that

64
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,230
eat one water preserve much damage that
 

65
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,640
eat one water preserve much damage that
do

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:06,650

 

67
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:16,520

that's probably fine okay so the really

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,530
that's probably fine okay so the really
 

69
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,220
that's probably fine okay so the really
hard to see with we're all the glasses

70
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,230
hard to see with we're all the glasses
 

71
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:27,260
hard to see with we're all the glasses
here I'll probably run last longer

72
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,270
here I'll probably run last longer
 

73
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:39,850
here I'll probably run last longer
bottom here yeah okay

74
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:39,860

 

75
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:48,310

so pigs and wolves will fit through this

76
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,320

 

77
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,160

actually can't put it on there

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,170
actually can't put it on there
 

79
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,930
actually can't put it on there
the thing is that pigs can fit in a one

80
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:53,940
the thing is that pigs can fit in a one
 

81
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,240
the thing is that pigs can fit in a one
by one space so we kind of make these

82
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,250
by one space so we kind of make these
 

83
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:06,509
by one space so we kind of make these
half blocks when we to extend the screen

84
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:06,519

 

85
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:19,000

so we need sign here and this will keep

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,010
so we need sign here and this will keep
 

87
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:34,310
so we need sign here and this will keep
going out

88
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320

 

89
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,450

okay I want to make sure the water

90
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:42,460
okay I want to make sure the water
 

91
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,410
okay I want to make sure the water
doesn't spill out I'll probably actually

92
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:49,420
doesn't spill out I'll probably actually
 

93
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:57,630
doesn't spill out I'll probably actually
close this off some updates things okay

94
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:57,640
close this off some updates things okay
 

95
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,520
close this off some updates things okay
and then we can place more water I'm

96
00:04:59,520 --> 00:04:59,530
and then we can place more water I'm
 

97
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,940
and then we can place more water I'm
just going to place another sign here

98
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:04,950
just going to place another sign here
 

99
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,260
just going to place another sign here
and make sure the water doesn't spill

100
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,270
and make sure the water doesn't spill
 

101
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,340
and make sure the water doesn't spill
half there they will come along get

102
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,350
half there they will come along get
 

103
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,840
half there they will come along get
pushed up and then we're going to make

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:15,850
pushed up and then we're going to make
 

105
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:22,500
pushed up and then we're going to make
them fall again I'm going to build some

106
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,510
them fall again I'm going to build some
 

107
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,450
them fall again I'm going to build some
I'm going to place some cobblestone here

108
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,460
I'm going to place some cobblestone here
 

109
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,380
I'm going to place some cobblestone here
so I can walk around and then then we'll

110
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:28,390
so I can walk around and then then we'll
 

111
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:35,970
so I can walk around and then then we'll
be back okay so I just realized

112
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:35,980
be back okay so I just realized
 

113
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,130
be back okay so I just realized
something

114
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,140
something
 

115
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,040
something
excuse me it's going to be really ugly

116
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,050
excuse me it's going to be really ugly
 

117
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,880
excuse me it's going to be really ugly
if I have this sticking out like I do

118
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:44,890
if I have this sticking out like I do
 

119
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,210
if I have this sticking out like I do
plan on making this look better when

120
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,220
plan on making this look better when
 

121
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,560
plan on making this look better when
it's all done but it's going to be

122
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,570
it's all done but it's going to be
 

123
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,200
it's all done but it's going to be
really hard to make something that

124
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,210
really hard to make something that
 

125
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,320
really hard to make something that
sticks out that far that looks normal

126
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,330
sticks out that far that looks normal
 

127
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:04,500
sticks out that far that looks normal
I think so I'll probably just make the

128
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,510
I think so I'll probably just make the
 

129
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:14,219
I think so I'll probably just make the
pigs come down here instead

130
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:14,229

 

131
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,559

make it make it have a lower profile I

132
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:17,569
make it make it have a lower profile I
 

133
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:24,549
make it make it have a lower profile I
guess you could say so yeah it'll

134
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:24,559
guess you could say so yeah it'll
 

135
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:31,839
guess you could say so yeah it'll
probably make it drop around here the

136
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:31,849
probably make it drop around here the
 

137
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,279
probably make it drop around here the
same time I don't want it to be in the

138
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:33,289
same time I don't want it to be in the
 

139
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,230
same time I don't want it to be in the
way of my hostile mob system I don't

140
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,240
way of my hostile mob system I don't
 

141
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,790
way of my hostile mob system I don't
exactly know what I'm going to be

142
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
exactly know what I'm going to be
 

143
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,949
exactly know what I'm going to be
building down there but what can you do

144
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:44,959
building down there but what can you do
 

145
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,259
building down there but what can you do
I guess yeah so let's just punch a hole

146
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:50,269
I guess yeah so let's just punch a hole
 

147
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:56,249
I guess yeah so let's just punch a hole
down here

148
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,259
down here
 

149
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,019
down here
that pigs gonna push me off and you know

150
00:06:59,019 --> 00:06:59,029
that pigs gonna push me off and you know
 

151
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:26,500
that pigs gonna push me off and you know
it now here X yeah we need one more sign

152
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,510

 

153
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,510

and then the pigs and wolves are going

154
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
and then the pigs and wolves are going
 

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,670
and then the pigs and wolves are going
to fall down that hole and then we'll

156
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
to fall down that hole and then we'll
 

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,170
to fall down that hole and then we'll
probably have a water break so they

158
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,180
probably have a water break so they
 

159
00:07:39,180 --> 00:08:02,870
probably have a water break so they
don't take damage get this all closed

160
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:02,880
don't take damage get this all closed
 

161
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:13,420
don't take damage get this all closed
off okay that should be good I think

162
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,430

 

163
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,980

yeah so I will be destroying all this

164
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:18,990
yeah so I will be destroying all this
 

165
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,680
yeah so I will be destroying all this
combo light is placed unfortunately but

166
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:21,690
combo light is placed unfortunately but
 

167
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,390
combo light is placed unfortunately but
I'm not going to be doing that just yet

168
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,400
I'm not going to be doing that just yet
 

169
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,220
I'm not going to be doing that just yet
I'll do that off camera because that

170
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,230
I'll do that off camera because that
 

171
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:37,640
I'll do that off camera because that
stuff is painful to watch okay so let's

172
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:37,650
stuff is painful to watch okay so let's
 

173
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:52,199
stuff is painful to watch okay so let's
make a tube that comes down here

174
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:52,209

 

175
00:08:52,209 --> 00:09:08,389

I hope none of us get motion sickness

176
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399

 

177
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,960

all right yeah so this will be a lot

178
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:15,970
all right yeah so this will be a lot
 

179
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,869
all right yeah so this will be a lot
nicer will be lower profile still having

180
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:18,879
nicer will be lower profile still having
 

181
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,480
nicer will be lower profile still having
a huge platform sticking out of my

182
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,490
a huge platform sticking out of my
 

183
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:31,639
a huge platform sticking out of my
hopefully will be a finished basically

184
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:31,649

 

185
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,139

and I think I have some more science

186
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:34,149
and I think I have some more science
 

187
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:44,249
and I think I have some more science
down here yep so we'll have a water

188
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:44,259
down here yep so we'll have a water
 

189
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:56,759
down here yep so we'll have a water
break here's probably good that way they

190
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:56,769
break here's probably good that way they
 

191
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:07,850
break here's probably good that way they
don't take damage and then

192
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:07,860

 

193
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:16,080

I'll drop there will be a water source

194
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,090
I'll drop there will be a water source
 

195
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:28,860
I'll drop there will be a water source
here I'm kind of making this up as I go

196
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:28,870
here I'm kind of making this up as I go
 

197
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,910
here I'm kind of making this up as I go
along

198
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:34,920

 

199
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,330

okay oh you know what yeah we should

200
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,340
okay oh you know what yeah we should
 

201
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,980
okay oh you know what yeah we should
probably start the Wolfe separating as

202
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:43,990
probably start the Wolfe separating as
 

203
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,090
probably start the Wolfe separating as
soon as possible here so I'm going to

204
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,100
soon as possible here so I'm going to
 

205
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,160
soon as possible here so I'm going to
have a diagonal stream of water I guess

206
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,170
have a diagonal stream of water I guess
 

207
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,000
have a diagonal stream of water I guess

I'm not sure if my idea here is going to

00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
I'm not sure if my idea here is going to
 

211
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:14,130
I'm not sure if my idea here is going to
work but we'll find out I guess um let's

212
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,140
work but we'll find out I guess um let's
 

213
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:30,150
work but we'll find out I guess um let's
see let's just use cobblestone and so I

214
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
see let's just use cobblestone and so I
 

215
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,280
see let's just use cobblestone and so I
think if we have a block of cobblestone

216
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,290
think if we have a block of cobblestone
 

217
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,340
think if we have a block of cobblestone
ladder

218

I think this is going to work I'm not
 

223
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,570
I think this is going to work I'm not
sure if we make these little gaps like

224
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:45,580
sure if we make these little gaps like
 

225
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,050
sure if we make these little gaps like
this

226
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,060
this
 

227
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,820
this
the pigs won't fit through these but the

228
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:47,830
the pigs won't fit through these but the
 

229
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,840
the pigs won't fit through these but the
wolves will then we'll have a water

230
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:51,850
wolves will then we'll have a water
 

231
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,360
wolves will then we'll have a water
stream below the ladder that hopefully

232
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,370
stream below the ladder that hopefully
 

233
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:05,609
stream below the ladder that hopefully
the Wolves will drop into that's my plan

234
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:05,619

 

235
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:09,710

not sure how well this is gonna work

236
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:09,720
not sure how well this is gonna work

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,819

it's a little bit hard to build it here

240
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:17,329
it's a little bit hard to build it here
 

241
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:27,699
it's a little bit hard to build it here
- yeah I think this will work I don't

242
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:27,709
- yeah I think this will work I don't
 

243
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:32,229
- yeah I think this will work I don't
know I don't know how many of these

244
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:32,239
know I don't know how many of these
 

245
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:36,269
know I don't know how many of these
we'll need to get all the Wolves out

246
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:36,279
we'll need to get all the Wolves out
 

247
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,859
we'll need to get all the Wolves out
separated properly I'm just going to put

248
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:41,869
separated properly I'm just going to put
 

249
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:44,679
separated properly I'm just going to put
a cap on the end here for now and then

250
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:44,689
a cap on the end here for now and then
 

251
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:51,429
a cap on the end here for now and then
we'll extend it if this idea works now

252
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:51,439
we'll extend it if this idea works now
 

253
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,929
we'll extend it if this idea works now
let's do one more of these ladder things

254
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:52,939
let's do one more of these ladder things
 

255
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,419
let's do one more of these ladder things
I guess

256
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:56,429

 

257
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:08,189

and the water will flow like this so

258
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:08,199
and the water will flow like this so
 

259
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,629
and the water will flow like this so
they'll fall down and they'll get pushed

260
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:09,639
they'll fall down and they'll get pushed
 

261
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,349
they'll fall down and they'll get pushed
to this wall here only the Wolves will

262
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:13,359
to this wall here only the Wolves will
 

263
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,699
to this wall here only the Wolves will
be able to fit through so I'm going to

264
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:17,709
be able to fit through so I'm going to
 

265
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,559
be able to fit through so I'm going to
put glass overtop this so that they

266
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:19,569
put glass overtop this so that they
 

267
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:32,159
put glass overtop this so that they
can't jump around and we'll see if the

268
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,169
can't jump around and we'll see if the
 

269
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:36,659
can't jump around and we'll see if the
wolves and I dip through that or how

270
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:36,669
wolves and I dip through that or how
 

271
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:40,349
wolves and I dip through that or how
well they do I'm not sure it's probably

272
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:40,359
well they do I'm not sure it's probably
 

273
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,059
well they do I'm not sure it's probably
better if the ladders on this side

274
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:42,069
better if the ladders on this side
 

275
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,949
better if the ladders on this side
instead of this side I think so that's

276
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:43,959
instead of this side I think so that's
 

277
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:52,409
instead of this side I think so that's
what I'm going to try first and I'll let

278
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:52,419
what I'm going to try first and I'll let
 

279
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:53,789
what I'm going to try first and I'll let
you know how it turns out I'm going to

280
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:53,799
you know how it turns out I'm going to
 

281
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,359
you know how it turns out I'm going to
take a while so I universe so I'll be

282
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:57,369
take a while so I universe so I'll be
 

283
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:02,519
take a while so I universe so I'll be
back in a bit all right finally we got

284
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:02,529
back in a bit all right finally we got
 

285
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:06,900
back in a bit all right finally we got
some wolves oh I've been waiting for

286
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:06,910
some wolves oh I've been waiting for
 

287
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,939
some wolves oh I've been waiting for
like 15 minutes for them to spawn and

288
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:11,949
like 15 minutes for them to spawn and
 

289
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:14,939
like 15 minutes for them to spawn and
yeah this idea seems to work the pigs

290
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:14,949
yeah this idea seems to work the pigs
 

291
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,799
yeah this idea seems to work the pigs
can't fit through these gaps and the

292
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:16,809
can't fit through these gaps and the
 

293
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:21,269
can't fit through these gaps and the
Wolves can as you can see I've been

294
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
Wolves can as you can see I've been
 

295
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,090
Wolves can as you can see I've been
killing tons of pigs stuck over here

296
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,100

 

297
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,409

so yeah this should be pretty cool I

298
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:28,419
so yeah this should be pretty cool I
 

299
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:34,499
so yeah this should be pretty cool I
think three is probably enough like

300
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:34,509
think three is probably enough like
 

301
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,539
think three is probably enough like
three of these ladder separators I think

302
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:38,549
three of these ladder separators I think
 

303
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,159
three of these ladder separators I think
they're most likely to go into this one

304
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:41,169
they're most likely to go into this one
 

305
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,700
they're most likely to go into this one
or this one

306
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:46,710

 

307
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:52,620

all right so we can we'll just have like

308
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:52,630
all right so we can we'll just have like
 

309
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,950
all right so we can we'll just have like
water to pull them to where we want them

310
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:55,960
water to pull them to where we want them
 

311
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:02,490
water to pull them to where we want them
to go and the pig thing will just keep

312
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:02,500
to go and the pig thing will just keep
 

313
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:12,840
to go and the pig thing will just keep
extending here up to I just cook house I

314
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:12,850
extending here up to I just cook house I
 

315
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,710
extending here up to I just cook house I
don't know what to call it anymore

316
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720

 

317
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,940

yeah you can see the pigs can't fit

318
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:20,950
yeah you can see the pigs can't fit
 

319
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,970
yeah you can see the pigs can't fit
through so this works out great I was a

320
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:23,980
through so this works out great I was a
 

321
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,530
through so this works out great I was a
little worried the wolves are gonna like

322
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:25,540
little worried the wolves are gonna like
 

323
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,160
little worried the wolves are gonna like
it stuck climbing the ladders but they

324
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,170
it stuck climbing the ladders but they
 

325
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,380
it stuck climbing the ladders but they
seem to fall down pretty good

326
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,390

 

327
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,180

so that's how to make a proper wolf

328
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,190
so that's how to make a proper wolf
 

329
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,590
so that's how to make a proper wolf
separator that doesn't damage either

330
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:40,600
separator that doesn't damage either
 

331
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,050
separator that doesn't damage either
pigs or wolves because my other one

332
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,060
pigs or wolves because my other one
 

333
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,180
pigs or wolves because my other one
actually I wanted to mention this to

334
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,190
actually I wanted to mention this to
 

335
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,560
actually I wanted to mention this to
CoStar made the exact same thing in his

336
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:52,570
CoStar made the exact same thing in his
 

337
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,070
CoStar made the exact same thing in his
world I saw so it's not like I invented

338
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,080
world I saw so it's not like I invented
 

339
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,940
world I saw so it's not like I invented
that or anything but yeah the problem

340
00:15:59,940 --> 00:15:59,950
that or anything but yeah the problem
 

341
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,840
that or anything but yeah the problem
with that to design was that it damages

342
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:02,850
with that to design was that it damages
 

343
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,240
with that to design was that it damages
it has to kill the pigs to separate them

344
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,250
it has to kill the pigs to separate them
 

345
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,870
it has to kill the pigs to separate them
and also the Wolves get damaged from the

346
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:09,880
and also the Wolves get damaged from the
 

347
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,450
and also the Wolves get damaged from the
lab of my old speak inator so this way

348
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:14,460
lab of my old speak inator so this way
 

349
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:27,360
lab of my old speak inator so this way
both the mobs are fine

350
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,370

 

351
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,520

let's see let's extend this out I think

352
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:30,530
let's see let's extend this out I think
 

353
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:52,450
let's see let's extend this out I think
one more I lose those ah aerial and let

354
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:52,460
one more I lose those ah aerial and let
 

355
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,570
one more I lose those ah aerial and let
creepers been hanging around scaring me

356
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:57,580

 

357
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:05,710

let's put a slab here break this now

358
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:05,720
let's put a slab here break this now
 

359
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:14,740
let's put a slab here break this now
let's put a slab here yeah okay I'm just

360
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:14,750
let's put a slab here yeah okay I'm just
 

361
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,480
let's put a slab here yeah okay I'm just
going to seal this off for second place

362
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:19,490
going to seal this off for second place
 

363
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,270
going to seal this off for second place
this with glass I think I used up most

364
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
this with glass I think I used up most
 

365
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,920
this with glass I think I used up most
of my sword just trying to get the

366
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:26,930
of my sword just trying to get the
 

367
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:33,570
of my sword just trying to get the
Wolves to spawn

368
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:33,580

 

369
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,170

okay and now we'll just keep extending

370
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:38,180
okay and now we'll just keep extending
 

371
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:47,650
okay and now we'll just keep extending
this now the question is oh yeah where's

372
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:47,660
this now the question is oh yeah where's
 

373
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:54,250
this now the question is oh yeah where's
that creeper I just got to be really

374
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,260
that creeper I just got to be really
 

375
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:03,050
that creeper I just got to be really
careful here ah

376
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,060

 

377
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:17,010

so I want to now there is astroturf

378
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,020
so I want to now there is astroturf
 

379
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,500
so I want to now there is astroturf
looks a little bit fake it will look a

380
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,510
looks a little bit fake it will look a
 

381
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,420
looks a little bit fake it will look a
lot more real if you like plant trees on

382
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:21,430
lot more real if you like plant trees on
 

383
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,690
lot more real if you like plant trees on
it I think and if you have flowerbeds

384
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:24,700
it I think and if you have flowerbeds
 

385
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,180
it I think and if you have flowerbeds
around and stuff it might look a lot

386
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,190
around and stuff it might look a lot
 

387
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,220
around and stuff it might look a lot
more like grass than the bright green

388
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,230
more like grass than the bright green
 

389
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,740
more like grass than the bright green
stuff though is just too fake looking

390
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:36,750

 

391
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,460

unfortunately because I think I like

392
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:38,470
unfortunately because I think I like
 

393
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:51,570
unfortunately because I think I like
that color more let's see yeah I'm going

394
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:51,580
that color more let's see yeah I'm going
 

395
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,220
that color more let's see yeah I'm going
to finish extending this and then we'll

396
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,230
to finish extending this and then we'll
 

397
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,530
to finish extending this and then we'll
work on making our tiny little building

398
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:55,540
work on making our tiny little building
 

399
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:01,950
work on making our tiny little building
here I think okay one thing I wanted to

400
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:01,960
here I think okay one thing I wanted to
 

401
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
here I think okay one thing I wanted to

411
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:26,970
going to go up in flames right well I'm
really not worried about it as far as I

412
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:26,980
really not worried about it as far as I
 

413
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,960
really not worried about it as far as I
know lightning won't cause fires on

414
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:30,970
know lightning won't cause fires on
 

415
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,060
know lightning won't cause fires on
wooden houses and be pretty dumb if it

416
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,070
wooden houses and be pretty dumb if it
 

417
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,570
wooden houses and be pretty dumb if it
did and I would strongly suggest people

418
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:36,580
did and I would strongly suggest people
 

419
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,810
did and I would strongly suggest people
complain to notch if it does as far as I

420

complain to notch if it does as far as I
 

421
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,240
complain to notch if it does as far as I
know that doesn't happen if it did it

422
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,250
know that doesn't happen if it did it
 

423
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,590
know that doesn't happen if it did it
would mean like you can't build anything

424
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
would mean like you can't build anything
 

425
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:52,650
would mean like you can't build anything
out of wood would be stupid no um yes

426
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:52,660
out of wood would be stupid no um yes
 

427
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,170
out of wood would be stupid no um yes
these are the wouldn't take what jerk

428
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:57,180
these are the wouldn't take what jerk
 

429
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,170
these are the wouldn't take what jerk
these are the wooden half slabs so

430
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:00,180
these are the wooden half slabs so
 

431
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,320
these are the wooden half slabs so
they're they act like stone or petrified

432
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,330
they're they act like stone or petrified
 

433
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,360
they're they act like stone or petrified
wood I didn't do it with the whole whole

434
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,370
wood I didn't do it with the whole whole
 

435
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,780
wood I didn't do it with the whole whole
building though but if it is a problem

436
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:12,790
building though but if it is a problem
 

437
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,140
building though but if it is a problem
I will replace all this wood with half

438
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,150
I will replace all this wood with half
 

439
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,690
I will replace all this wood with half
slabs and I have many world backups so

440
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:21,700
slabs and I have many world backups so
 

441
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,810
slabs and I have many world backups so
if my storage room does burn down like

442
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:24,820
if my storage room does burn down like
 

443
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,640
if my storage room does burn down like
it has before I can just recover and fix

444
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:29,650
it has before I can just recover and fix
 

445
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:39,300
it has before I can just recover and fix
the problem moving on this is close to

446
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,310
the problem moving on this is close to
 

447
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:53,310
the problem moving on this is close to
done yeah let's let's feed his piggies

448
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:53,320
done yeah let's let's feed his piggies
 

449
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:09,120
done yeah let's let's feed his piggies
and let's cover this up should cover it

450
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,130
and let's cover this up should cover it
 

451
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,180
and let's cover this up should cover it
up first so one of the reasons I want to

452
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,190
up first so one of the reasons I want to
 

453
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,150
up first so one of the reasons I want to
separate the pigs is because when I had

454
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:18,160
separate the pigs is because when I had
 

455
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,100
separate the pigs is because when I had
it going to the main collection area I

456
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,110
it going to the main collection area I
 

457
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,760
it going to the main collection area I
pretty much always had the broke chops

458
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:23,770
pretty much always had the broke chops
 

459
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,560
pretty much always had the broke chops
shut off because they were clogging up

460
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:25,570
shut off because they were clogging up
 

461
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,440
shut off because they were clogging up
my inventory every time I picked up

462
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,450
my inventory every time I picked up
 

463
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,630
my inventory every time I picked up
gunpowder and stuff and it was really

464
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
gunpowder and stuff and it was really
 

465
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,620
gunpowder and stuff and it was really
annoying so it really is better to make

466
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:34,630
annoying so it really is better to make
 

467
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,120
annoying so it really is better to make
them drop to a separate location I think

468
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,130
them drop to a separate location I think
 

469
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,090
them drop to a separate location I think
and since I'm separating them it makes

470
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,100
and since I'm separating them it makes
 

471
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,070
and since I'm separating them it makes
sense that they should have a separate

472
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
sense that they should have a separate
 

473
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,780
sense that they should have a separate
drop location too

474
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:50,790

 

475
00:21:50,790 --> 00:22:09,140

oh that figis messed up tape so the

476
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,150
oh that figis messed up tape so the
 

477
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,420
oh that figis messed up tape so the
fancy way of doing this probably is to

478
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,430
fancy way of doing this probably is to
 

479
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,490
fancy way of doing this probably is to
make the pigs fall through lava and then

480
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:16,500
make the pigs fall through lava and then
 

481
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,640
make the pigs fall through lava and then
burn up in midair and drop a pork chop

482
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:19,650
burn up in midair and drop a pork chop
 

483
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,590
burn up in midair and drop a pork chop
into water since this is my collection

484
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:24,600
into water since this is my collection
 

485
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,040
into water since this is my collection
area above here I don't really need to

486
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,050
area above here I don't really need to
 

487
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,060
area above here I don't really need to
drop the pork chops into water because I

488
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,070
drop the pork chops into water because I
 

489
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,000
drop the pork chops into water because I
don't need to carry them off anywhere so

490
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,010
don't need to carry them off anywhere so
 

491
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:46,750
don't need to carry them off anywhere so
this is really simple for me if you guys

492
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:46,760
this is really simple for me if you guys
 

493
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,580
this is really simple for me if you guys
need me to invent something fancy for

494
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:49,590
need me to invent something fancy for
 

495
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,770
need me to invent something fancy for
you maybe I'll do that but for me I

496
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:51,780
you maybe I'll do that but for me I
 

497
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,140
you maybe I'll do that but for me I
really don't need to over complicate

498
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,150
really don't need to over complicate
 

499
00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:06,680
really don't need to over complicate
this a few more signs hey oh cool

500
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:06,690
this a few more signs hey oh cool
 

501
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,510
this a few more signs hey oh cool
alright hey I thought spiders don't

502
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
alright hey I thought spiders don't
 

503
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:32,740
alright hey I thought spiders don't
attack during the day very strange

504
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,750

 

505
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:50,900

yay how to do this now and I probably

506
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:50,910
yay how to do this now and I probably
 

507
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,890
yay how to do this now and I probably
should have thought this out a little

508
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:51,900
should have thought this out a little
 

509
00:23:51,900 --> 00:24:08,000
should have thought this out a little
more yeah let's extend this a little bit

510
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,010
more yeah let's extend this a little bit
 

511
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:19,460
more yeah let's extend this a little bit
more I counted that's about a five-block

512
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,470
more I counted that's about a five-block
 

513
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:28,880
more I counted that's about a five-block
drop so wouldn't really work well for me

514
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:28,890
drop so wouldn't really work well for me
 

515
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,350
drop so wouldn't really work well for me
dropping them through lava anyway

516
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,360
dropping them through lava anyway
 

517
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,420
dropping them through lava anyway
because they don't have enough of a drop

518
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,430
because they don't have enough of a drop
 

519
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:50,810
because they don't have enough of a drop
now let's go get some more water this is

520
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:50,820
now let's go get some more water this is
 

521
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,000
now let's go get some more water this is
a this is pretty close to done so I

522
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,010
a this is pretty close to done so I
 

523
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,710
a this is pretty close to done so I
think I'm just going to drop them into a

524
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
think I'm just going to drop them into a
 

525
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,690
think I'm just going to drop them into a
flame I'm pretty sure it will work

526
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:56,700
flame I'm pretty sure it will work
 

527
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,440
flame I'm pretty sure it will work
almost 100%

528
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,450

 

529
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,480

as long as you keep it open around the

530
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,490
as long as you keep it open around the
 

531
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,610
as long as you keep it open around the
flame that they have no wool no walls to

532
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:11,620
flame that they have no wool no walls to
 

533
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:56,340
flame that they have no wool no walls to
bump into and it's gonna hurt ya I hope

534
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,350
bump into and it's gonna hurt ya I hope
 

535
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,560
bump into and it's gonna hurt ya I hope
this doesn't pitch anything on fire too

536
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,570
this doesn't pitch anything on fire too
 

537
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:06,620
this doesn't pitch anything on fire too
is another thing I'm concerned about

538
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:06,630

 

539
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,840

can't remember if fire can spread if you

540
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:09,850
can't remember if fire can spread if you
 

541
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,720
can't remember if fire can spread if you
use another rack I think it might not

542
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:12,730
use another rack I think it might not
 

543
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:24,210
use another rack I think it might not
actually okay so one more water source

544
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,220
actually okay so one more water source
 

545
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,030
actually okay so one more water source
and this should be ready to kill some

546
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,040
and this should be ready to kill some
 

547
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,180
and this should be ready to kill some
pigs I think

548
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,190

 

549
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:38,060

oh no that's not gonna work shoot all

550
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,070
oh no that's not gonna work shoot all
 

551
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:48,580
oh no that's not gonna work shoot all
right well let's extend this then

552
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:48,590

 

553
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,150

because the pigs will just swim if

554
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,160
because the pigs will just swim if
 

555
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:09,800
because the pigs will just swim if
there's water above that hole oh all

556
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:09,810
there's water above that hole oh all
 

557
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:18,190
there's water above that hole oh all
right nice grass oh yeah

558
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,200
right nice grass oh yeah
 

559
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,230
right nice grass oh yeah
so I need to build some staircases up to

560
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,240
so I need to build some staircases up to
 

561
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,890
so I need to build some staircases up to
this thing

562
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:21,900
this thing
 

563
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,550
this thing
probably have some storage chests it'll

564
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:25,560
probably have some storage chests it'll
 

565
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,440
probably have some storage chests it'll
be all closed off so the pigs can't get

566
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,450
be all closed off so the pigs can't get
 

567
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,480
be all closed off so the pigs can't get
out this is open all the way around so

568
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,490
out this is open all the way around so
 

569
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,210
out this is open all the way around so
they should freely walk off onto this

570
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:35,220
they should freely walk off onto this
 

571
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,910
they should freely walk off onto this
glass here so I'm pretty sure this will

572
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:40,920
glass here so I'm pretty sure this will
 

573
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:48,650
glass here so I'm pretty sure this will
work pretty good yeah so I'm going to

574
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:48,660
work pretty good yeah so I'm going to
 

575
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,140
work pretty good yeah so I'm going to
kill these pigs wait for night and then

576
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,150
kill these pigs wait for night and then
 

577
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,910
kill these pigs wait for night and then
we should be able to watch this in

578
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:52,920
we should be able to watch this in
 

579
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,180
we should be able to watch this in
action all right it's night time things

580
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,190
action all right it's night time things
 

581
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:11,780
action all right it's night time things
are starting to funnel in

582
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:11,790

 

583
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:18,210

hmm yes I might need to do some

584
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:18,220
hmm yes I might need to do some
 

585
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,850
hmm yes I might need to do some
adjusting after all even if they die on

586
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:23,860
adjusting after all even if they die on
 

587
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,770
adjusting after all even if they die on
the flames the pork usually jumps away

588
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:28,780
the flames the pork usually jumps away
 

589
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:35,130
the flames the pork usually jumps away
from the flames but this is this is by

590
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,140
from the flames but this is this is by
 

591
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,730
from the flames but this is this is by
far the simplest way of doing it I think

592
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:37,740
far the simplest way of doing it I think
 

593
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:44,730
far the simplest way of doing it I think
some other ideas are - I could probably

594
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:44,740
some other ideas are - I could probably
 

595
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,130
some other ideas are - I could probably
put lava block it in this open-air space

596
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:50,140
put lava block it in this open-air space
 

597
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:56,790
put lava block it in this open-air space
here and they'll take damage through the

598
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:56,800
here and they'll take damage through the
 

599
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,260
here and they'll take damage through the
glass using the southwest glitch or

600
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,270
glass using the southwest glitch or
 

601
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:09,150
glass using the southwest glitch or
whatever it is and I'm sure you guys are

602
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,160
whatever it is and I'm sure you guys are
 

603
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,010
whatever it is and I'm sure you guys are
going to send me a hundred ideas and

604
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,020
going to send me a hundred ideas and
 

605
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:20,990
going to send me a hundred ideas and
I'll probably get a good one too so I

606
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,000

 

607
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,620

think I think the majority will walk off

608
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:24,630
think I think the majority will walk off
 

609
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,930
think I think the majority will walk off
and even if I lose a few pork chops I

610
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:27,940
and even if I lose a few pork chops I
 

611
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,700
and even if I lose a few pork chops I
don't really care because it's more than

612
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,710
don't really care because it's more than
 

613
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:39,210
don't really care because it's more than
enough as is and this is working good so

614
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:39,220
enough as is and this is working good so
 

615
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,230
enough as is and this is working good so
all in all I'm pretty happy with this so

616
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:43,240
all in all I'm pretty happy with this so
 

617
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,230
all in all I'm pretty happy with this so
I'm going to join these three ladder

618
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
I'm going to join these three ladder
 

619
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,020
I'm going to join these three ladder
things together and then I'll funnel the

620
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,030
things together and then I'll funnel the
 

621
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,530
things together and then I'll funnel the
volts off over that way and probably

622
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:52,540
volts off over that way and probably
 

623
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,390
volts off over that way and probably
start building a barn or something for

624
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:54,400
start building a barn or something for
 

625
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:02,130
start building a barn or something for
the other animals and I'm not quite sure

626
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,140
the other animals and I'm not quite sure
 

627
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,040
the other animals and I'm not quite sure
what I'm gonna build

628
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,050
what I'm gonna build
 

629
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:12,120
what I'm gonna build
this out of

630
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,130

 

631
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,150

yeah I got a switch let me try lava

632
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,160
yeah I got a switch let me try lava
 

633
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,850
yeah I got a switch let me try lava
think see if it works alright here we go

634
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:20,860
think see if it works alright here we go
 

635
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:34,960
think see if it works alright here we go
so you're a little holder here nope no

636
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:34,970
so you're a little holder here nope no
 

637
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:40,240
so you're a little holder here nope no
good all right well I just want to try

638
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,250
good all right well I just want to try
 

639
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:46,930
good all right well I just want to try
drop on through lava then yeah this

640
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:46,940
drop on through lava then yeah this
 

641
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,490
drop on through lava then yeah this
looks like good winner after all and

642
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:51,500
looks like good winner after all and
 

643
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,640
looks like good winner after all and
it's pretty simple to do ki it's just a

644
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:56,650
it's pretty simple to do ki it's just a
 

645
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:03,220
it's pretty simple to do ki it's just a
lab assisted by it's sign if you wanted

646
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,230
lab assisted by it's sign if you wanted
 

647
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,990
lab assisted by it's sign if you wanted
to drop the cooked four drops into water

648
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000

with the one one by one to hope and they

654
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,020
with the one one by one to hope and they
 

655
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,470
with the one one by one to hope and they
won't even fit past the ladder after the

656
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
won't even fit past the ladder after the
 

657

the only problem with there is some pork
 

667
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:55,750
the only problem with there is some pork
chops we get stuck on the ladder

668
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:55,760

 

669
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:04,300

but it's pretty minimal so yeah this is

670
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:04,310
but it's pretty minimal so yeah this is
 

671
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:12,520
but it's pretty minimal so yeah this is
cool not sure I might put glass around

672
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:12,530
cool not sure I might put glass around
 

673
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,870
cool not sure I might put glass around
here probably have like four or two HS

674
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
here probably have like four or two HS
 

675
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:24,340
here probably have like four or two HS
to store the pork chops and yeah I'll

00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:24,350
to store the pork chops and yeah I'll
 

677
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,000
to store the pork chops and yeah I'll
make it to look a little bit more pretty

678
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,010
make it to look a little bit more pretty
 

679
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:39,490
make it to look a little bit more pretty
probably two eventually and this um well

680
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:39,500
probably two eventually and this um well
 

681
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,750
probably two eventually and this um well
I guess we can probably quickly work on

682
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,760
I guess we can probably quickly work on
 

683
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:53,110
I guess we can probably quickly work on
this

684
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120

 

685
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:09,940

that's not good that's not good

686
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:09,950

 

687
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,100

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:41,350
oh yeah okay not all out of a small out
of glass yeah I'm pretty happy with this

692
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360

 

693
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,000

works pretty much exactly like I wanted

694
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,010
works pretty much exactly like I wanted
 

695
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:48,980
works pretty much exactly like I wanted
it to and they don't seem to be getting

696
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:48,990
it to and they don't seem to be getting
 

697
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:55,850
it to and they don't seem to be getting
stuck in the lava which is nice and the

698
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:55,860
stuck in the lava which is nice and the
 

699
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,470
stuck in the lava which is nice and the
wolves are going through that I've seen

700
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:57,480
wolves are going through that I've seen
 

701
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:12,310
wolves are going through that I've seen
so far so yeah very cool so this thing

702
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,320
so far so yeah very cool so this thing
 

703
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:22,730
so far so yeah very cool so this thing
let's

704
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:22,740

 

705
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,369

I guess so best way of doing this is

706
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:25,379
I guess so best way of doing this is
 

707
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:41,330
I guess so best way of doing this is
probably just have glass here just make

708
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:41,340
probably just have glass here just make
 

709
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:54,990
probably just have glass here just make
it scream out like that

710
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,000

 

711
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:04,290

and then that's we're pretty good I

712
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:04,300
and then that's we're pretty good I
 

713
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,240
and then that's we're pretty good I
think

714
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,250

 

715
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,490

hopefully the wolves don't get stuck

716
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:10,500
hopefully the wolves don't get stuck
 

717
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,810
hopefully the wolves don't get stuck

this squid farm I think I figured out

734
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,010
this squid farm I think I figured out
 

735
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,790
this squid farm I think I figured out
how to make them go up blocks really

736
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:53,800
how to make them go up blocks really
 

737
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,670
how to make them go up blocks really
well now and I'll show you how that

738
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:56,680
well now and I'll show you how that
 

739
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,580
well now and I'll show you how that
works next episode and we'll probably

740
00:35:59,580 --> 00:35:59,590
works next episode and we'll probably
 

741
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,130
works next episode and we'll probably
build an aquarium and maybe some way of

742
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,140
build an aquarium and maybe some way of
 

743
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:06,000
build an aquarium and maybe some way of
killing them automatically - there's now

744
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,010
killing them automatically - there's now
 

745
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,140
killing them automatically - there's now
that I can move them up I can place them

746
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,150
that I can move them up I can place them
 

747
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,370
that I can move them up I can place them
anywhere I want really in my world like

748
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:14,380
anywhere I want really in my world like
 

749
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,930
anywhere I want really in my world like
I could have a floating aquarium in the

750
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:15,940
I could have a floating aquarium in the
 

751
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,340
I could have a floating aquarium in the
sky if I wanted where they would collect

752
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,350
sky if I wanted where they would collect
 

753
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:28,560
sky if I wanted where they would collect
so that's that's pretty cool and at some

754
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:28,570
so that's that's pretty cool and at some
 

755
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,560
so that's that's pretty cool and at some
point we'll have to finish our hostile

756
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:31,570
point we'll have to finish our hostile
 

757
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,220
point we'll have to finish our hostile
mob system and we've done much with that

758
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,230
mob system and we've done much with that
 

759
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,250
mob system and we've done much with that
lately

760
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,260

 

761
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:47,210

that's weird

770
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,110

 

771
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:14,769

oh the rain put some ropes I think

772
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:14,779

775
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:25,910

let's test it out show

776
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920

 

777
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,820

I can't light a fire

778
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:31,830

 

779
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:53,690

781
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,920

but I don't think the water passes

782
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:55,930
but I don't think the water passes
 

783
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,890
but I don't think the water passes
through glass in horse and that's good

784
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:57,900
through glass in horse and that's good
 

785
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,489
through glass in horse and that's good
we should use it a fix all right but

786
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:02,499
we should use it a fix all right but
 

787
00:38:02,499 --> 00:38:03,809
we should use it a fix all right but
that's the end guys thank you for
