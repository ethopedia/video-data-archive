00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,390
default skin too which is I believe a
 

25
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,529

girl right or a guy with long hair
 

27
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,910
girl right or a guy with long hair
anyway and when they introduced Alex

28
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:52,920
anyway and when they introduced Alex
 

29
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,060
anyway and when they introduced Alex
they randomly gave people that's that

30
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,070
they randomly gave people that's that
 

31
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,619
they randomly gave people that's that
character model and I was one of the

32
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:57,629
character model and I was one of the
 

33
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,619
character model and I was one of the
lucky people and for a while I couldn't

34
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:00,629
lucky people and for a while I couldn't
 

35
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,810
lucky people and for a while I couldn't
change it I think I tend now but I can't

36
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:02,820
change it I think I tend now but I can't
 

37
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:10,070
change it I think I tend now but I can't
figure out how to so yay I think I have

38
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
figure out how to so yay I think I have
 

39
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,740
figure out how to so yay I think I have
to like when I go to the site it says

40
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:12,750
to like when I go to the site it says
 

41
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,590
to like when I go to the site it says
I'm Steve where has Steve selected by

42
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm Steve where has Steve selected by
 

43
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,710
I'm Steve where has Steve selected by
default so I think I have to re-up load

44
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
default so I think I have to re-up load
 

45
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,649
default so I think I have to re-up load
my skin maybe and select Steve I don't I

46
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
my skin maybe and select Steve I don't I
 

47
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,320
my skin maybe and select Steve I don't I
don't quite understand it but yeah if

48
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,330
don't quite understand it but yeah if
 

49
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,330
don't quite understand it but yeah if
skin servers ever go down or if my

50
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:29,340
skin servers ever go down or if my
 

51
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,380
skin servers ever go down or if my
internet is down like it is currently I

52
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,390
internet is down like it is currently I
 

53
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,270
internet is down like it is currently I
become Alex so I'll have to try figure

54
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
become Alex so I'll have to try figure
 

55
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,170
become Alex so I'll have to try figure
this out okay so let's jump into the

56
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,180
this out okay so let's jump into the
 

57
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,499
this out okay so let's jump into the
future a few hours together my

58
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:42,509
future a few hours together my
 

59
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,780
future a few hours together my
Internet's back up I got my normal skin

60
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:44,790
Internet's back up I got my normal skin
 

61
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,679
Internet's back up I got my normal skin
on I did do the upload or irie uploaded

62
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:48,689
on I did do the upload or irie uploaded
 

63
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,819
on I did do the upload or irie uploaded
my skin while Steve was selected and a

64
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:52,829
my skin while Steve was selected and a
 

65
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,440
my skin while Steve was selected and a
couple of hours have passed and yes my

66
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,450
couple of hours have passed and yes my
 

67
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,300
couple of hours have passed and yes my
arms are still three pixels wide so I'm

68
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,310
arms are still three pixels wide so I'm
 

69
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,350

still Alex I don't know what to do
 

71
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,209
still Alex I don't know what to do
there's no it's very strange there's no

there's no it's very strange there's no
 

73
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,160
there's no it's very strange there's no
like confirmed changes button on the

74
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,170
like confirmed changes button on the
 

75
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,440
like confirmed changes button on the
form so yeah for ever and Alex I guess

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,450
form so yeah for ever and Alex I guess
 

77
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,979
form so yeah for ever and Alex I guess
oh man well let's forget about that

78
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:16,989
oh man well let's forget about that
 

79
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,710
oh man well let's forget about that
let's get into our episode here I have

80
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:19,720
let's get into our episode here I have
 

81
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,110
let's get into our episode here I have
worked on this Simon Says well it's

82
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,120
worked on this Simon Says well it's
 

83
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,930
worked on this Simon Says well it's
actually I've been informed it's called

84
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:24,940
actually I've been informed it's called
 

85
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,089
actually I've been informed it's called
Simon not Simon Says

86
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:27,099
Simon not Simon Says
 

87
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,030
Simon not Simon Says
I had a Simon game when I was younger

88
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,040
I had a Simon game when I was younger
 

89
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,309
I had a Simon game when I was younger
and everybody always called it

90
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
and everybody always called it
 

91
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,580
and everybody always called it
Simon Says so that's just what I assumed

92
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,590
Simon Says so that's just what I assumed
 

93
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,270
Simon Says so that's just what I assumed
it was but apparently it's called Simon

94
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,280
it was but apparently it's called Simon
 

95
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,509
it was but apparently it's called Simon
the memory game and been trying to solve

96
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:42,519
the memory game and been trying to solve
 

97
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,240
the memory game and been trying to solve
the next problem we're having here so we

98
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,250
the next problem we're having here so we
 

99
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,190
the next problem we're having here so we
have this memory right here it'll be

100
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
have this memory right here it'll be
 

101
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,360
have this memory right here it'll be
like 30 to 40 droppers when we're done

102
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,370
like 30 to 40 droppers when we're done
 

103
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,569
like 30 to 40 droppers when we're done
when you start out the game the sequence

104
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:54,579
when you start out the game the sequence
 

105
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,580
when you start out the game the sequence
starts at one right you just got to

106
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:56,590
starts at one right you just got to
 

107
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,380
starts at one right you just got to
remember one thing then it builds up to

108
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,390
remember one thing then it builds up to
 

109
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,920
remember one thing then it builds up to
2 3 4 or 5 all the way up to however

110
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:01,930
2 3 4 or 5 all the way up to however
 

111
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,110
2 3 4 or 5 all the way up to however
many is the end of the game right the

112
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,120
many is the end of the game right the
 

113
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,000
many is the end of the game right the
thing is when we're at the very starts

114
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,010
thing is when we're at the very starts
 

115
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,509
thing is when we're at the very starts
when it's at 1 2 3 4 or whatever the

116
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
when it's at 1 2 3 4 or whatever the
 

117
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,420
when it's at 1 2 3 4 or whatever the
chain is very short and there's a lot of

118
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,430
chain is very short and there's a lot of
 

119
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,100
chain is very short and there's a lot of
blank spots like a lot of these droppers

120
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,110
blank spots like a lot of these droppers
 

121
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,250
blank spots like a lot of these droppers
will be empty and when we want to like

122
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,260
will be empty and when we want to like
 

123
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,520
will be empty and when we want to like
starts the sequence over we have to move

124
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,530
starts the sequence over we have to move
 

125
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,229
starts the sequence over we have to move
those items through all those empty

126
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
those items through all those empty
 

127
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,650
those items through all those empty
droppers and since we have to do this

128
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:25,660
droppers and since we have to do this
 

129
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,069
droppers and since we have to do this
thing where we delay all the droppers

130
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:28,079
thing where we delay all the droppers
 

131
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,800
thing where we delay all the droppers
like 3 or 4 seconds to delay them all

132
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:33,810
like 3 or 4 seconds to delay them all
 

133
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,229
like 3 or 4 seconds to delay them all
you do the math on that 30 times 3

134
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:37,239
you do the math on that 30 times 3
 

135
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,120
you do the math on that 30 times 3
seconds for example it's gonna take a

136
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,130
seconds for example it's gonna take a
 

137
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,809
seconds for example it's gonna take a
minute and a half to do one sequence or

138
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:42,819
minute and a half to do one sequence or
 

139
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,970
minute and a half to do one sequence or
to run through one sequence at the very

140
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:44,980
to run through one sequence at the very
 

141
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,410
to run through one sequence at the very
start of the game that's a problem it

142
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:49,420
start of the game that's a problem it
 

143
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,530
start of the game that's a problem it
technically will work but I'm gonna call

144
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:52,540
technically will work but I'm gonna call
 

145
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,449
technically will work but I'm gonna call
that a fail so I have to had to come up

146
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:54,459
that a fail so I have to had to come up
 

147
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,289
that a fail so I have to had to come up
with a new method and I experimented

148
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:58,299
with a new method and I experimented
 

149
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,349
with a new method and I experimented
with it and creative it was going good

150
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:01,359
with it and creative it was going good
 

151
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,610
with it and creative it was going good
for a while but I hit another wall

152
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:02,620
for a while but I hit another wall
 

153
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,830
for a while but I hit another wall
unfortunately but we'll just check that

154
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:04,840
unfortunately but we'll just check that
 

155
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,539
unfortunately but we'll just check that
out real quick and then we'll probably

156
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:06,549
out real quick and then we'll probably
 

157
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,819
out real quick and then we'll probably
do something else so let's jump into

158
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:08,829
do something else so let's jump into
 

159
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:16,339
do something else so let's jump into
creative so this is my new IDE whoa I

160
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:16,349
creative so this is my new IDE whoa I
 

161
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,300
creative so this is my new IDE whoa I
don't know if you heard that but my

162
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,310
don't know if you heard that but my
 

163
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,219
don't know if you heard that but my
elbow just bumped my glass of water and

164
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:20,229
elbow just bumped my glass of water and
 

165
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:24,570
elbow just bumped my glass of water and
it it was it was spitting it almost fell

166
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:24,580
it it was it was spitting it almost fell
 

167
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,050
it it was it was spitting it almost fell
dumped all over my desk

168
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,060
dumped all over my desk
 

169
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,350
dumped all over my desk
mmm-hmm I should move my record key yeah

170
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
mmm-hmm I should move my record key yeah
 

171
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,670
mmm-hmm I should move my record key yeah
so this is what I came up with everybody

172
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:32,680
so this is what I came up with everybody
 

173
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,369
so this is what I came up with everybody
I decided to use hoppers instead of

174
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:35,379
I decided to use hoppers instead of
 

175
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,990
I decided to use hoppers instead of
droppers the advantage they have is

176
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,000
droppers the advantage they have is
 

177
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,959
droppers the advantage they have is
items can flow freely through them the

178
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:39,969
items can flow freely through them the
 

179
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:42,529
items can flow freely through them the
disadvantage is I have to very precisely

180
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:42,539
disadvantage is I have to very precisely
 

181
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,450
disadvantage is I have to very precisely
lock them otherwise items are gonna

182
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,460
lock them otherwise items are gonna
 

183
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,990
lock them otherwise items are gonna
bunch up or skip spots or stuff like

184
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,000
bunch up or skip spots or stuff like
 

185
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,200
bunch up or skip spots or stuff like
that so this is the other thing though

186
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,210
that so this is the other thing though
 

187
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,939
that so this is the other thing though
that's really cool about this I came up

188
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:53,949
that's really cool about this I came up
 

189
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,959
that's really cool about this I came up
with this idea here so if we for example

190
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:57,969
with this idea here so if we for example
 

191
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:00,689
with this idea here so if we for example
had red clay in here it would flow to

192
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:00,699
had red clay in here it would flow to
 

193
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,659
had red clay in here it would flow to
the front here as soon as soon as it

194
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:03,669
the front here as soon as soon as it
 

195
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,600
the front here as soon as soon as it
enters here this detects it and then

196
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,610
enters here this detects it and then
 

197
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,879
enters here this detects it and then
locks the whole thing alright so that

198
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:08,889
locks the whole thing alright so that
 

199
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,309
locks the whole thing alright so that
stops items from flowing and then I have

200
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:11,319
stops items from flowing and then I have
 

201
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,129
stops items from flowing and then I have
like a release gate here when I push the

202
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:14,139
like a release gate here when I push the
 

203
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:21,029
like a release gate here when I push the
button it allows one item to move up a

204
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
button it allows one item to move up a
 

205
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,140
button it allows one item to move up a
spot it's time very precisely and if

206
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,150
spot it's time very precisely and if
 

207
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,809
spot it's time very precisely and if
it's the end of the chain like like that

208
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:27,819
it's the end of the chain like like that
 

209
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,089
it's the end of the chain like like that
was because it's a very first one it

210
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:30,099
was because it's a very first one it
 

211
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:32,070
was because it's a very first one it
will go all the way around and then when

212
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
will go all the way around and then when
 

213
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,899
will go all the way around and then when
it gets back to the front again it stops

214
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:33,909
it gets back to the front again it stops
 

215
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,140
it gets back to the front again it stops
automatically so it's really really cool

216
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,150
automatically so it's really really cool
 

217
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,430
automatically so it's really really cool
I thought I was on to something if we do

218
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
I thought I was on to something if we do
 

219
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,899
I thought I was on to something if we do
red red blue yellow Alice or green into

220
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:45,909
red red blue yellow Alice or green into
 

221
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:52,619
red red blue yellow Alice or green into
as an experiment we press this red jumps

222
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:52,629
as an experiment we press this red jumps
 

223
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:55,370
as an experiment we press this red jumps
ahead one spots

224
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,380
ahead one spots
 

225
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,190
ahead one spots
and that should be Oh see it should have

226
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,200
and that should be Oh see it should have
 

227
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,100
and that should be Oh see it should have
been red red but it jumped it skipped a

228
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,110
been red red but it jumped it skipped a
 

229
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,030
been red red but it jumped it skipped a
spot so we have issues with this design

230
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,040
spot so we have issues with this design
 

231
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,560
spot so we have issues with this design
yeah so basically the problem with this

232
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,570
yeah so basically the problem with this
 

233
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,860
yeah so basically the problem with this
is just the way items move through the

234
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:09,870
is just the way items move through the
 

235
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,050
is just the way items move through the
hoppers like we have we have it all

236
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
hoppers like we have we have it all
 

237
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,880
hoppers like we have we have it all
locking and releasing the items at the

238
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:13,890
locking and releasing the items at the
 

239
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,310
locking and releasing the items at the
exact same time you would think the

240
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,320
exact same time you would think the
 

241
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,080
exact same time you would think the
items would move through here equally

242
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,090
items would move through here equally
 

243
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,280
items would move through here equally
right that's not the way it works so if

244
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,290
right that's not the way it works so if
 

245
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,150
right that's not the way it works so if
we for example have red green blue the

246
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
we for example have red green blue the
 

247
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,280
we for example have red green blue the
game might actually decide to move the

248
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,290
game might actually decide to move the
 

249
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,260
game might actually decide to move the
green first because it has to pick one

250
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,270
green first because it has to pick one
 

251
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,510
green first because it has to pick one
of them to start with even though

252
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,520
of them to start with even though
 

253
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,770
of them to start with even though
they're all moving in the exact same

254
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:33,780
they're all moving in the exact same
 

255
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,770
they're all moving in the exact same
frame in the game logically it has to

256
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:36,780
frame in the game logically it has to
 

257
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,110
frame in the game logically it has to
pick one and it might decide to move the

258
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
pick one and it might decide to move the
 

259
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
pick one and it might decide to move the
green first and then it goes into the

260
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:40,890
green first and then it goes into the
 

261
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,000
green first and then it goes into the
second spot and then the red will maybe

262
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,010
second spot and then the red will maybe
 

263
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,220
second spot and then the red will maybe
move but now we have this empty spot and

264
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,230
move but now we have this empty spot and
 

265
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,740
move but now we have this empty spot and
the next time we move the blue which

266
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:48,750
the next time we move the blue which
 

267
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,000
the next time we move the blue which
will be here when it moves it's going to

268
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,010
will be here when it moves it's going to
 

269
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,560
will be here when it moves it's going to
go into that front spot this green one's

270
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,570
go into that front spot this green one's
 

271
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,990
go into that front spot this green one's
gonna get stuck there forever or until

272
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,000
gonna get stuck there forever or until
 

273
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,420
gonna get stuck there forever or until
something else messes up so we need to

274
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,430
something else messes up so we need to
 

275
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,310
something else messes up so we need to
precisely time these hoppers that so

276
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,320
precisely time these hoppers that so
 

277
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,380
precisely time these hoppers that so
they activate in the right order so I

278
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:03,390
they activate in the right order so I
 

279
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,410
they activate in the right order so I
came up with this and it also has a

280
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:06,420
came up with this and it also has a
 

281
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,040
came up with this and it also has a
problem

282
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,050
problem
 

283
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:14,780
problem
so like non-stop rain in this world I

284
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:14,790
so like non-stop rain in this world I
 

285
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,790
so like non-stop rain in this world I
tell you so it's red red blue green

286
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
tell you so it's red red blue green
 

287
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,590
tell you so it's red red blue green
yellow yeah you got it precisely times

288
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:20,600
yellow yeah you got it precisely times
 

289
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,760
yellow yeah you got it precisely times
every time we press this and moves ahead

290
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:22,770
every time we press this and moves ahead
 

291
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:29,600
every time we press this and moves ahead
one spot so red got me red red red red

292
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:29,610
one spot so red got me red red red red
 

293
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,140
one spot so red got me red red red red
blue red red blue yellow and I forget

294
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,150
blue red red blue yellow and I forget
 

295
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,610
blue red red blue yellow and I forget
already yeah

296
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:34,620
already yeah
 

297
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,700
already yeah
now yellow is at the end should be green

298
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:37,710
now yellow is at the end should be green
 

299
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,480
now yellow is at the end should be green
yellow

300
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,490
yellow
 

301
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,730
yellow
we have five items in here I pressed

302
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:41,740
we have five items in here I pressed
 

303
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,580
we have five items in here I pressed
this four times so red red blue green

304
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:46,590
this four times so red red blue green
 

305
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,010
this four times so red red blue green
last one is yellow when it's at the end

306
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,020
last one is yellow when it's at the end
 

307
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,450
last one is yellow when it's at the end
of the chain or the end of the sequence

308
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:51,460
of the chain or the end of the sequence
 

309
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,580
of the chain or the end of the sequence
it'll reset to the start and skip all

310
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:53,590
it'll reset to the start and skip all
 

311
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,219
it'll reset to the start and skip all
those empty spots so just take some

312
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:56,229
those empty spots so just take some
 

313
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,129
those empty spots so just take some
moments way less than a minute and a

314
00:07:59,129 --> 00:07:59,139
moments way less than a minute and a
 

315
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,580
moments way less than a minute and a
half though it's like five to ten

316
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:02,590
half though it's like five to ten
 

317
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,850
half though it's like five to ten
seconds and then it's it should be red

318
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:05,860
seconds and then it's it should be red
 

319
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,270
seconds and then it's it should be red
red blue green yellow again but for some

320
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
red blue green yellow again but for some
 

321
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,370
red blue green yellow again but for some
reason in this spot it decides to bunch

322
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:11,380
reason in this spot it decides to bunch
 

323
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,409
reason in this spot it decides to bunch
them up even though it's basically

324
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:13,419
them up even though it's basically
 

325
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,409
them up even though it's basically
exactly the same here as the rest of the

326
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:16,419
exactly the same here as the rest of the
 

327
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,480
exactly the same here as the rest of the
thing as far as I can tell there's no

328
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,490
thing as far as I can tell there's no
 

329
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,680
thing as far as I can tell there's no
errors in timing see 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3

330
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:24,690
errors in timing see 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3
 

331
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,080
errors in timing see 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3
2 1 yeah so it's for some reason the

332
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,090
2 1 yeah so it's for some reason the
 

333
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,969
2 1 yeah so it's for some reason the
game decides right here to mess it up I

334
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:31,979
game decides right here to mess it up I
 

335
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,620
game decides right here to mess it up I
don't know exactly what's going on and

336
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:34,630
don't know exactly what's going on and
 

337
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,290
don't know exactly what's going on and
I'm tired of thinking about it for today

338
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:37,300
I'm tired of thinking about it for today
 

339
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,750
I'm tired of thinking about it for today
so we will just forget about this for

340
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
so we will just forget about this for
 

341
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,889
so we will just forget about this for
right now this is the idea I want to

342
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:43,899
right now this is the idea I want to
 

343
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,120
right now this is the idea I want to
play around with today though I think

344
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,130
play around with today though I think
 

345
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,639
play around with today though I think
this is gonna be fun so this is an idea

346
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:47,649
this is gonna be fun so this is an idea
 

347
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:53,940
this is gonna be fun so this is an idea
for a sheep farm we're gonna go try

348
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:53,950
for a sheep farm we're gonna go try
 

349
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,260
for a sheep farm we're gonna go try
build this at the amplified base

350
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,270
build this at the amplified base
 

351
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,389
build this at the amplified base
something like this the idea is sheep

352
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
something like this the idea is sheep
 

353
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,040
something like this the idea is sheep
can actually eat grass when they're in

354
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,050
can actually eat grass when they're in
 

355
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,740
can actually eat grass when they're in
the mine carts and on a track so we we

356
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:04,750
the mine carts and on a track so we we
 

357
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,510
the mine carts and on a track so we we
can keep these guys on a track and have

358
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:06,520
can keep these guys on a track and have
 

359
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,790
can keep these guys on a track and have
them go around on a loop and when they

360
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
them go around on a loop and when they
 

361
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,530
them go around on a loop and when they
get to a spot to shoot them up like this

362
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,540
get to a spot to shoot them up like this
 

363
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,480
get to a spot to shoot them up like this
and cheer them alright everybody so here

364
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,490
and cheer them alright everybody so here
 

365
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,850
and cheer them alright everybody so here
we are at the amplified bass and I

366
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:17,860
we are at the amplified bass and I
 

367
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,579
we are at the amplified bass and I
looked around for a while trying to find

368
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:20,589
looked around for a while trying to find
 

369
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,090
looked around for a while trying to find
a good spot for it I think I might put

370
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,100
a good spot for it I think I might put
 

371
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,150
a good spot for it I think I might put
it up over here it has a very small

372
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,160
it up over here it has a very small
 

373
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,430
it up over here it has a very small
footprint like we could just we just

374
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
footprint like we could just we just
 

375
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,010
footprint like we could just we just
need like a 3x3 hole basically and then

376
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,020
need like a 3x3 hole basically and then
 

377
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,199
need like a 3x3 hole basically and then
we can hide the rest of it underground

378
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:34,209
we can hide the rest of it underground
 

379
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,010
we can hide the rest of it underground
like where the sheep actually stay so we

380
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,020
like where the sheep actually stay so we
 

381
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,440
like where the sheep actually stay so we
might put it here the only downside of

382
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,450
might put it here the only downside of
 

383
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,800
might put it here the only downside of
building here is how do we get the sheep

384
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:43,810
building here is how do we get the sheep
 

385
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,230
building here is how do we get the sheep
into the farm when we're way up in the

386
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
into the farm when we're way up in the
 

387
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,600
into the farm when we're way up in the
mountain that's gonna be the toughest

388
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:48,610
mountain that's gonna be the toughest
 

389
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,180
mountain that's gonna be the toughest
part of this whole thing unless we build

390
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,190
part of this whole thing unless we build
 

391
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,370
part of this whole thing unless we build
it down lower but I didn't really see

392
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:53,380
it down lower but I didn't really see
 

393
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,700
it down lower but I didn't really see
any

394
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:53,710
any
 

395
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,680
any
spots that stood out to me so I think

396
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:55,690
spots that stood out to me so I think
 

397
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,100
spots that stood out to me so I think
we'll put it here so my plan is we'll

398
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,110
we'll put it here so my plan is we'll
 

399
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,380
we'll put it here so my plan is we'll
probably pick a new spot darn it's the

400
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,390
probably pick a new spot darn it's the
 

401
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,060
probably pick a new spot darn it's the
tract is there haha yeah we we gotta

402
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,070
tract is there haha yeah we we gotta
 

403
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,870
tract is there haha yeah we we gotta
find a new spot okay well I've been

404
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
find a new spot okay well I've been
 

405
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
find a new spot okay well I've been
running around this place for like 15

406
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:14,890
running around this place for like 15
 

407
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,640
running around this place for like 15
minutes trying to find a spot it

408
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:17,650
minutes trying to find a spot it
 

409
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,000
minutes trying to find a spot it
actually I don't know it's really tough

410
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,010
actually I don't know it's really tough
 

411
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,160
actually I don't know it's really tough
to find a spot around here because it's

412
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,170
to find a spot around here because it's
 

413
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,860
to find a spot around here because it's
all open there's not a lot of walls or

414
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:25,870
all open there's not a lot of walls or
 

415
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,180
all open there's not a lot of walls or
corners around but I picked this spot

416
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,190
corners around but I picked this spot
 

417
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,380
corners around but I picked this spot
over here I think it'll work

418
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:31,390
over here I think it'll work
 

419
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,900
over here I think it'll work
it doesn't look very good right now

420
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:33,910
it doesn't look very good right now
 

421
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,780
it doesn't look very good right now
because the area's undeveloped but we'll

422
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:36,790
because the area's undeveloped but we'll
 

423
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,680
because the area's undeveloped but we'll
try we'll try and make it work so we got

424
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:40,690
try we'll try and make it work so we got
 

425
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,970
try we'll try and make it work so we got
a 3x3 hole and then what we'll do is

426
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:44,980
a 3x3 hole and then what we'll do is
 

427
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,580
a 3x3 hole and then what we'll do is
we'll like build the actual sheep farm

428
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:47,590
we'll like build the actual sheep farm
 

429
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,050
we'll like build the actual sheep farm
down here this is where they'll stay and

430
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,060
down here this is where they'll stay and
 

431
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,540
down here this is where they'll stay and
minecart track will take them to to this

432
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:54,550
minecart track will take them to to this
 

433
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,890
minecart track will take them to to this
spot and then we will have a oh where my

434
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:58,900
spot and then we will have a oh where my
 

435
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,220
spot and then we will have a oh where my
pistons oh well have a slime block

436
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,230
pistons oh well have a slime block
 

437
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,570
pistons oh well have a slime block
launcher thing I must have put them in

438
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:03,580
launcher thing I must have put them in
 

439
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,190
launcher thing I must have put them in
the chest up here and this actually

440
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,200
the chest up here and this actually
 

441
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,730
the chest up here and this actually
probably isn't gonna be very difficult

442
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:10,740
probably isn't gonna be very difficult
 

443
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,930
probably isn't gonna be very difficult
if I'm not mistaken we might not need to

444
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:15,940
if I'm not mistaken we might not need to
 

445
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,580
if I'm not mistaken we might not need to
control it at all like we could just

446
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,590
control it at all like we could just
 

447
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,190
control it at all like we could just
have mine carts all over the place

448
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,200
have mine carts all over the place
 

449
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,690
have mine carts all over the place
bouncing around and they should make

450
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:21,700
bouncing around and they should make
 

451
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,000
bouncing around and they should make
their way to the launcher you know I

452
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,010
their way to the launcher you know I
 

453
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,980
their way to the launcher you know I
think I might have planned this wrong I

454
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:28,990
think I might have planned this wrong I
 

455
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,040
think I might have planned this wrong I
might need to go up one more block we

456
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,050
might need to go up one more block we
 

457
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,960
might need to go up one more block we
should figure this out for sure actually

458
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:33,970
should figure this out for sure actually
 

459
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,320
should figure this out for sure actually
so let me know I need a minecart

460
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,330
so let me know I need a minecart
 

461
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,990
so let me know I need a minecart
at least I think I do maybe not let's

462
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,000
at least I think I do maybe not let's
 

463
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,610
at least I think I do maybe not let's
just see how high this launch is that's

464
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:44,620
just see how high this launch is that's
 

465
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:55,160
just see how high this launch is that's
that doesn't seem right wait a second

466
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,170

 

467
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,180

huh that seems very short I'm gonna get

468
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,190
huh that seems very short I'm gonna get
 

469
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,040
huh that seems very short I'm gonna get
a minecart just to be sure let's see

470
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,050
a minecart just to be sure let's see
 

471
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,440
a minecart just to be sure let's see
let's get back up here I did bring mine

472
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,450
let's get back up here I did bring mine
 

473
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,290
let's get back up here I did bring mine
carts this is very you know it would be

474
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:10,300
carts this is very you know it would be
 

475
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,630
carts this is very you know it would be
nice here is some ladders

476
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:12,640
nice here is some ladders
 

477
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,150
nice here is some ladders
never underestimate ladders they are

478
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,160
never underestimate ladders they are
 

479
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,370
never underestimate ladders they are
amazing

480
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,380
amazing
 

481
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,110
amazing
alright now let's grab one of these I

482
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
alright now let's grab one of these I
 

483
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,090
alright now let's grab one of these I
just want to make sure the sheep get

484
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,100
just want to make sure the sheep get
 

485
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,590
just want to make sure the sheep get
launched high enough before we build

486
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:22,600
launched high enough before we build
 

487
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,110
launched high enough before we build
this whole thing otherwise it's gonna be

488
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
this whole thing otherwise it's gonna be
 

489
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,700
this whole thing otherwise it's gonna be
a big problem so I want the minecart to

490
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:29,710
a big problem so I want the minecart to
 

491
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,010
a big problem so I want the minecart to
go above the surface here at least oh

492
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,020
go above the surface here at least oh
 

493
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,230
go above the surface here at least oh
yeah I think that was perfect actually

494
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,240
yeah I think that was perfect actually
 

495
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,710
yeah I think that was perfect actually
so we actually need to build up one

496
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
so we actually need to build up one
 

497
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,870
so we actually need to build up one
block I think okay here let's take a

498
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:45,880
block I think okay here let's take a
 

499
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,790
block I think okay here let's take a
moment to figure out how this is gonna

500
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:47,800
moment to figure out how this is gonna
 

501
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,270
moment to figure out how this is gonna
work so I made sort of a loop here we're

502
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,280
work so I made sort of a loop here we're
 

503
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,580
work so I made sort of a loop here we're
gonna have about 10 to 20 sheep down

504
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:53,590
gonna have about 10 to 20 sheep down
 

505
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,660
gonna have about 10 to 20 sheep down
here I figure and basically they'll go

506
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:57,670
here I figure and basically they'll go
 

507
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,910
here I figure and basically they'll go
into minecarts up to the launcher

508
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
into minecarts up to the launcher
 

509
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,860
into minecarts up to the launcher
they'll get launched up and then we

510
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:01,870
they'll get launched up and then we
 

511
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,420
they'll get launched up and then we
don't want to just send them back

512
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,430
don't want to just send them back
 

513
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,920
don't want to just send them back
because then they'll be in the front of

514
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:04,930
because then they'll be in the front of
 

515
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,100
because then they'll be in the front of
the line we want them to to like get out

516
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,110
the line we want them to to like get out
 

517
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,930
the line we want them to to like get out
of the way right because we'll shear

518
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:09,940
of the way right because we'll shear
 

519
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,850
of the way right because we'll shear
them and they need time for the the wool

520
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:11,860
them and they need time for the the wool
 

521
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,070
them and they need time for the the wool
to regrow and we want the next sheep to

522
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,080
to regrow and we want the next sheep to
 

523
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,470
to regrow and we want the next sheep to
come up that has wool so we'll probably

524
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
come up that has wool so we'll probably
 

525
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,460
come up that has wool so we'll probably
want like a piston to push the minecarts

526
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:19,470
want like a piston to push the minecarts
 

527
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,140
want like a piston to push the minecarts
out of the way onto the second track

528
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,150
out of the way onto the second track
 

529
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,970
out of the way onto the second track
over here

530
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:22,980
over here
 

531
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,140
over here
well not set in the track but you know

532
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,150
well not set in the track but you know
 

533
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,450
well not set in the track but you know
what I mean push them out of the way get

534
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:27,460
what I mean push them out of the way get
 

535
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,550
what I mean push them out of the way get
out of the way sheep you have no wool we

536
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:29,560
out of the way sheep you have no wool we
 

537
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,480
out of the way sheep you have no wool we
don't want you anymore

538
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,490
don't want you anymore
 

539
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,900
don't want you anymore
type of thing all right and we'll need a

540
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:33,910
type of thing all right and we'll need a
 

541
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,200
type of thing all right and we'll need a
detector rail to figure out when to

542
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,210
detector rail to figure out when to
 

543
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,730
detector rail to figure out when to
launch the sheep no I hate when this

544
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:41,740
launch the sheep no I hate when this
 

545
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,820
launch the sheep no I hate when this
happens

546
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:43,830

 

547
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,760

stuck oh there we go

548
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:47,770
stuck oh there we go
 

549
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,890
stuck oh there we go
okay so we'll probably run the wire just

550
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:49,900
okay so we'll probably run the wire just
 

551
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,140
okay so we'll probably run the wire just
underneath here for right now this is

552
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,150
underneath here for right now this is
 

553
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,690
underneath here for right now this is
just temporary

554
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:53,700
just temporary
 

555
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,220
just temporary
don't don't give me a hard time you know

556
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,230
don't don't give me a hard time you know
 

557
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,620
don't don't give me a hard time you know
I do this thing where I I put my what

558
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:58,630
I do this thing where I I put my what
 

559
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,560
I do this thing where I I put my what
redstone wiring on stone brick and if I

560
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:01,570
redstone wiring on stone brick and if I
 

561
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,010
redstone wiring on stone brick and if I
don't do it now people like Esau you

562
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,020
don't do it now people like Esau you
 

563
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,340
don't do it now people like Esau you
broke your rule go fix it and even if

564
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,350
broke your rule go fix it and even if
 

565
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,860
broke your rule go fix it and even if
it's tip

566
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:08,870
it's tip
 

567
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,720
it's tip
rewiring sometimes I get that and it's

568
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:10,730
rewiring sometimes I get that and it's
 

569
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,810
rewiring sometimes I get that and it's
like you know I choose to do this you

570
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:13,820
like you know I choose to do this you
 

571
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,090
like you know I choose to do this you
can't tell me what to do with my

572
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,100
can't tell me what to do with my
 

573
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,630
can't tell me what to do with my
redstone wiring okay so that launched it

574
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:19,640
redstone wiring okay so that launched it
 

575
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,120
redstone wiring okay so that launched it
up oh but then it didn't you know it

576
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,130
up oh but then it didn't you know it
 

577
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,750
up oh but then it didn't you know it
might need more delay let's try that

578
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
might need more delay let's try that
 

579
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,000
might need more delay let's try that
again

580
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,010
again
 

581
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,950
again
if we gave it more time oh that time it

582
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:29,960
if we gave it more time oh that time it
 

583
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,900
if we gave it more time oh that time it
was good actually because we want it to

584
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:31,910
was good actually because we want it to
 

585
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,640
was good actually because we want it to
false perfectly straight down again if

586
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:33,650
false perfectly straight down again if
 

587
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:39,730
false perfectly straight down again if
possible okay maybe we wonder if we

588
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:39,740
possible okay maybe we wonder if we
 

589
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,170
possible okay maybe we wonder if we
bumped it the first time or why didn't

590
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,180
bumped it the first time or why didn't
 

591
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,400
bumped it the first time or why didn't
it work okay that's perfect

592
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,410
it work okay that's perfect
 

593
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,930
it work okay that's perfect
that's perfect so if there's a sheep in

594
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:49,940
that's perfect so if there's a sheep in
 

595
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,700
that's perfect so if there's a sheep in
there this piston why should push them I

596
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:51,710
there this piston why should push them I
 

597
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,170
there this piston why should push them I
think because can we test that if I'm in

598
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,180
think because can we test that if I'm in
 

599
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,000
think because can we test that if I'm in
here man this is where they really need

600
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,010
here man this is where they really need
 

601
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:09,070
here man this is where they really need
help ta because no that did not want to

602
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,080
help ta because no that did not want to
 

603
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,170
help ta because no that did not want to
move me that's gonna be a problem isn't

604
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:14,180
move me that's gonna be a problem isn't
 

605
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,860
move me that's gonna be a problem isn't
it I'll have to think about this alright

606
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:17,870
it I'll have to think about this alright
 

607
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,110
it I'll have to think about this alright
so this is going to be a bit tricky we

608
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,120
so this is going to be a bit tricky we
 

609
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,740
so this is going to be a bit tricky we
can move the mic hurt if it's down there

610
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:22,750
can move the mic hurt if it's down there
 

611
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,160
can move the mic hurt if it's down there
the problem is if we put a piston there

612
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,170
the problem is if we put a piston there
 

613
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,570
the problem is if we put a piston there
we have another another issue the slime

614
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:31,580
we have another another issue the slime
 

615
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,100
we have another another issue the slime
block doesn't go down it sticks to that

616
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,110
block doesn't go down it sticks to that
 

617
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,810
block doesn't go down it sticks to that
piston so that's not gonna work we got a

618
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:34,820
piston so that's not gonna work we got a
 

619
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,079
piston so that's not gonna work we got a
you got to move it up at least one like

620
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,089
you got to move it up at least one like
 

621
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,620
you got to move it up at least one like
I wanted the thing is we're gonna have

622
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:41,630
I wanted the thing is we're gonna have
 

623
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,710
I wanted the thing is we're gonna have
to time this so that as the minecart is

624
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
to time this so that as the minecart is
 

625
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,050
to time this so that as the minecart is
falling down it'll push it in midair I

626
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,060
falling down it'll push it in midair I
 

627
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,370
falling down it'll push it in midair I
think which is not going to be fun or

628
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,380
think which is not going to be fun or
 

629
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,810
think which is not going to be fun or
maybe it'll be easy I don't know we'll

630
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:52,820
maybe it'll be easy I don't know we'll
 

631
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,960
maybe it'll be easy I don't know we'll
see so let's let's just try get some

632
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:55,970
see so let's let's just try get some
 

633
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,250
see so let's let's just try get some
delay going on this circuit see we got a

634
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,260
delay going on this circuit see we got a
 

635
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,780
delay going on this circuit see we got a
run let's try about a second delay see

636
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:04,790
run let's try about a second delay see
 

637
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,850
run let's try about a second delay see
if that works

638
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:05,860
if that works
 

639
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:13,150
if that works
oops yeah and we'll run that just to did

640
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,160
oops yeah and we'll run that just to did
 

641
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,710
oops yeah and we'll run that just to did
I just break that with my shovel

642
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
I just break that with my shovel
 

643
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,690
I just break that with my shovel
that's stoned am I seeing things

644
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:20,700
that's stoned am I seeing things
 

645
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,390
that's stoned am I seeing things
I thought for sure that's what just

646
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:23,400
I thought for sure that's what just
 

647
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,500
I thought for sure that's what just
happened okay oh we need way longer

648
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:27,510
happened okay oh we need way longer
 

649
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,860
happened okay oh we need way longer
delay we need like three or four seconds

650
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:29,870
delay we need like three or four seconds
 

651
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,000
delay we need like three or four seconds
okay this is pretty cool actually I

652
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,010
okay this is pretty cool actually I
 

653
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,410
okay this is pretty cool actually I
thought we would have to be extremely

654
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:33,420
thought we would have to be extremely
 

655
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,220
thought we would have to be extremely
precise with the timing on this move but

656
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,230
precise with the timing on this move but
 

657
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,110
precise with the timing on this move but
what happens is the minecart seems to

658
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
what happens is the minecart seems to
 

659
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,660
what happens is the minecart seems to
bounce on the slime block quite a bit so

660
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:41,670
bounce on the slime block quite a bit so
 

661
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,140
bounce on the slime block quite a bit so
it's like in-between two blocks and we

662
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,150
it's like in-between two blocks and we
 

663
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,930
it's like in-between two blocks and we
can yeah have a lot of flexibility here

664
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:47,940
can yeah have a lot of flexibility here
 

665
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,680
can yeah have a lot of flexibility here
actually not that it matters much I just

666
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:51,690
actually not that it matters much I just
 

667
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,050
actually not that it matters much I just
thought was interesting oh that's too

668
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,060
thought was interesting oh that's too
 

669
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:01,730
thought was interesting oh that's too
short if we do that we want as quick as

670
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:01,740
short if we do that we want as quick as
 

671
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,250
short if we do that we want as quick as
possible of still yeah so that's about

672
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,260
possible of still yeah so that's about
 

673
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,020
possible of still yeah so that's about
right and we'll want to push it onto a

674
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,030
right and we'll want to push it onto a
 

675
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:15,980
right and we'll want to push it onto a
downward slope track if possible so now

676
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:15,990
downward slope track if possible so now
 

677
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,810
downward slope track if possible so now
this this man I really wish these slime

678
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:20,820
this this man I really wish these slime
 

679
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,699
this this man I really wish these slime
blocks are so sticky they stick to

680
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:22,709
blocks are so sticky they stick to
 

681
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,439
blocks are so sticky they stick to
everything like if I have a track here

682
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:24,449
everything like if I have a track here
 

683
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,990
everything like if I have a track here
it's gonna get stuck on that now all

684
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,000
it's gonna get stuck on that now all
 

685
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,400
it's gonna get stuck on that now all
right

686
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,410

 

687
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:37,970

yeah okay so I decided to go down we got

688
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:37,980
yeah okay so I decided to go down we got
 

689
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,380
yeah okay so I decided to go down we got
a slope track there it should bring them

690
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,390
a slope track there it should bring them
 

691
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,510
a slope track there it should bring them
up here and then we want it to go back

692
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
up here and then we want it to go back
 

693
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,590
up here and then we want it to go back
into the loop so let's run this over to

694
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
into the loop so let's run this over to
 

695
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,610
into the loop so let's run this over to
here and oh we need another one of these

696
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:51,620
here and oh we need another one of these
 

697
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,470
here and oh we need another one of these
okay so now we got to do this BAM

698
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
okay so now we got to do this BAM
 

699
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,780
okay so now we got to do this BAM
minecart test if we have a bunch of mine

700
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:56,790
minecart test if we have a bunch of mine
 

701
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,390
minecart test if we have a bunch of mine
carts going here what happens when they

702
00:17:59,390 --> 00:17:59,400
carts going here what happens when they
 

703
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,740
carts going here what happens when they
start bumping into each other because

704
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,750
start bumping into each other because
 

705
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,750
start bumping into each other because
with just one it's perfectly fine okay

706
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
with just one it's perfectly fine okay
 

707
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,260
with just one it's perfectly fine okay
so let's get a few more going I'm kind

708
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,270
so let's get a few more going I'm kind
 

709
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,610
so let's get a few more going I'm kind
of hoping they'll look just like bounced

710
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:10,620
of hoping they'll look just like bounced
 

711
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,730
of hoping they'll look just like bounced
around and everything would be okay that

712
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:13,740
around and everything would be okay that
 

713
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,690
around and everything would be okay that
is not the case so we will have to set

714
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:17,700
is not the case so we will have to set
 

715
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,700
is not the case so we will have to set
up some sort of gate to block them I

716
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:21,710
up some sort of gate to block them I
 

717
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,160
up some sort of gate to block them I
don't think this is gonna work but we'll

718
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,170
don't think this is gonna work but we'll
 

719
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,900
don't think this is gonna work but we'll
try it this is very simple I just threw

720
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:26,910
try it this is very simple I just threw
 

721
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,180
try it this is very simple I just threw
a piston down here when they go over the

722
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,190
a piston down here when they go over the
 

723
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,010
a piston down here when they go over the
detector rail this will go up and it

724
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,020
detector rail this will go up and it
 

725
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,930
detector rail this will go up and it
should stop anymore from going through

726
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:32,940
should stop anymore from going through
 

727
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,120
should stop anymore from going through
for at least a second or two that work

728
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,130
for at least a second or two that work
 

729
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:43,280
for at least a second or two that work
oh that's what happened here oh is this

730
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,290
oh that's what happened here oh is this
 

731
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,840
oh that's what happened here oh is this
sticking to something oh I should have

732
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:44,850
sticking to something oh I should have
 

733
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,990
sticking to something oh I should have
put that block there yes ah ah you know

734
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
put that block there yes ah ah you know
 

735
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,490
put that block there yes ah ah you know
I was trying to fill in all the the

736
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:49,500
I was trying to fill in all the the
 

737
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,140
I was trying to fill in all the the
holes and make it look nice and then

738
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,150
holes and make it look nice and then
 

739
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:59,440
holes and make it look nice and then
breaks everything let's try again so

740
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,450
breaks everything let's try again so
 

741
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,040
breaks everything let's try again so
yeah this is activating way too soon

742
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,050
yeah this is activating way too soon
 

743
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,910
yeah this is activating way too soon
and it's messing up the minecart let's

744
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:07,920
and it's messing up the minecart let's
 

745
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,770
and it's messing up the minecart let's
try it again here I moved it one block

746
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:09,780
try it again here I moved it one block
 

747
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,720
try it again here I moved it one block
away from the detector rail search and

748
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:11,730
away from the detector rail search and
 

749
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:18,950
away from the detector rail search and
it mess up the minecarts good good very

750
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
it mess up the minecarts good good very
 

751
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,170
it mess up the minecarts good good very
good okay good

752
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,180
good okay good
 

753
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,140
good okay good
now let's spam my carts and see if we

754
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,150
now let's spam my carts and see if we
 

755
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,010
now let's spam my carts and see if we
have issues

756
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,020
have issues
 

757
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,380
have issues
so they will get stuck on that I'm kind

758
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,390
so they will get stuck on that I'm kind
 

759
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,670
so they will get stuck on that I'm kind
of hoping if we get a bunch of mine

760
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:30,680
of hoping if we get a bunch of mine
 

761
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,960
of hoping if we get a bunch of mine
carts bouncing around

762
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:31,970
carts bouncing around
 

763
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,300
carts bouncing around
they will bump it free they don't seem

764
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,310
they will bump it free they don't seem
 

765
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,910
they will bump it free they don't seem
to be moving it though oh there we go

766
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:39,920
to be moving it though oh there we go
 

767
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,400
to be moving it though oh there we go
Oh mmm cuz keep in mind there's gonna be

768
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,410
Oh mmm cuz keep in mind there's gonna be
 

769
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,150
Oh mmm cuz keep in mind there's gonna be
20 Mike Hertz bouncing around oh this is

770
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:49,160
20 Mike Hertz bouncing around oh this is
 

771
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,630
20 Mike Hertz bouncing around oh this is
getting nasty I might need to put a lot

772
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:55,640
getting nasty I might need to put a lot
 

773
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,250
getting nasty I might need to put a lot
more control in this whole thing

774
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:57,260
more control in this whole thing
 

775
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,280
more control in this whole thing
I was hoping like we could be pretty

776
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,290
I was hoping like we could be pretty
 

777
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,390
I was hoping like we could be pretty
pretty loose with it and it would work

778
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
pretty loose with it and it would work
 

779
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,140
pretty loose with it and it would work
but they're bunching up and they're

780
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,150
but they're bunching up and they're
 

781
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,640
but they're bunching up and they're
stacking on top of each other and

782
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,650
stacking on top of each other and
 

783
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,630
stacking on top of each other and
although if there was a sheep in that

784
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:13,640
although if there was a sheep in that
 

785
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,710
although if there was a sheep in that
minecart that wouldn't have happened

786

figuring out after every sequence a new

888

figuring out after every sequence a new
 

889
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,279
figuring out after every sequence a new
random thing just figured out all

890
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:35,289
random thing just figured out all
 

891
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,470
random thing just figured out all
beforehand and that way you don't have

892
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:37,480
beforehand and that way you don't have
 

893
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,080
beforehand and that way you don't have
to worry about it later which i think is

894
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,090
to worry about it later which i think is
 

895
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,039
