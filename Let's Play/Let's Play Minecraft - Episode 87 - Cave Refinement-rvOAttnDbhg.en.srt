19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,690

we finally have a door here before it

20
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:44,700
we finally have a door here before it
 

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,790

was just a dirt wall which was pretty
nasty looking now we had sliding doors

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,050
nasty looking now we had sliding doors
 

25
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,110
nasty looking now we had sliding doors
and it's unfinished out here still but

26
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
and it's unfinished out here still but
 

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,039
and it's unfinished out here still but
we have doors we were pretty cool they

28
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:04,049
we have doors we were pretty cool they
 

29
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,780
we have doors we were pretty cool they
seem to lag my game a bit though when I

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:05,790
seem to lag my game a bit though when I
 

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,450
seem to lag my game a bit though when I
asked to beat them you might have to

32
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:08,460
asked to beat them you might have to
 

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,539
asked to beat them you might have to
replace the glowstone with the some

34
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:11,549
replace the glowstone with the some
 

35
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,700
replace the glowstone with the some
other solid block that doesn't change

36
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:13,710
other solid block that doesn't change
 

37
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,910
other solid block that doesn't change
the lighting and I'll just quickly show

38
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
the lighting and I'll just quickly show
 

39
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,399
the lighting and I'll just quickly show
you the wiring for this it's pretty

40
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:19,409
you the wiring for this it's pretty
 

41
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:28,520
you the wiring for this it's pretty
simple so you have two Pistons two

42
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:28,530
simple so you have two Pistons two
 

43
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,499
simple so you have two Pistons two
sticky pistons on both sides that are

44
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:30,509
sticky pistons on both sides that are
 

45
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,950
sticky pistons on both sides that are
extended by default she's being powered

46
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
extended by default she's being powered
 

47
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,649
extended by default she's being powered
by this wire here so it goes it's

48
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:36,659
by this wire here so it goes it's
 

49
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,690
by this wire here so it goes it's
pointing at this one here and it's also

50
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:38,700
pointing at this one here and it's also
 

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,330
pointing at this one here and it's also
a block above this one so that's why

52
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,340
a block above this one so that's why
 

53
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,740
a block above this one so that's why
they're both game powered at the same

54
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:42,750
they're both game powered at the same
 

55
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,940
they're both game powered at the same
time hopefully I can do this without

56
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:46,950
time hopefully I can do this without
 

57
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,500
time hopefully I can do this without
wrecking all the wiring

58
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,510

 

59
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,380

so there's a torch directly below this

60
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,390
so there's a torch directly below this
 

61
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,810
so there's a torch directly below this
wire and the door the sliding doors

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,050
above here above these two sandstone
 

65
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,550
above here above these two sandstone
blocks are the wooden pressure plates

66
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
blocks are the wooden pressure plates
 

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,900
blocks are the wooden pressure plates
and above this wood block here is one of

68
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:13,910
and above this wood block here is one of
 

69
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,240
and above this wood block here is one of
the buttons above this one is the other

70
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,250
the buttons above this one is the other
 

71
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,610
the buttons above this one is the other
button and directly below them are these

72
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:18,620
button and directly below them are these
 

73
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,510
button and directly below them are these
wires which come down and join together

74
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:22,520
wires which come down and join together
 

75
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,570
wires which come down and join together
here and pressure plates above here also

76
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:28,580
here and pressure plates above here also
 

77
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,860
here and pressure plates above here also
power the same wire here move like and

78
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,870
power the same wire here move like and
 

79
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,740
power the same wire here move like and
these go to repeaters which are set at 3

80
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:35,750
these go to repeaters which are set at 3
 

81
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,840
these go to repeaters which are set at 3
right now and change it to whatever I

82
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:37,850
right now and change it to whatever I
 

83
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,300
right now and change it to whatever I
want and they go to the torches on both

84
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,310
want and they go to the torches on both
 

85
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,930
want and they go to the torches on both
sides here that's how that works if I

86
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:46,940
sides here that's how that works if I
 

87
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,610
sides here that's how that works if I
want pressure plates on the other side I

88
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:48,620
want pressure plates on the other side I
 

89
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,180
want pressure plates on the other side I
could just get rid of these blocks here

90
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,190
could just get rid of these blocks here
 

91
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:01,630
could just get rid of these blocks here
but wiring down get rid of these and

92
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,640
but wiring down get rid of these and
 

93
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,850
but wiring down get rid of these and
that would work if I didn't want to use

94
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:06,860
that would work if I didn't want to use
 

95
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,760
that would work if I didn't want to use
but you know so these are very simple to

96
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:12,770
but you know so these are very simple to
 

97
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:31,070
but you know so these are very simple to
wire

98
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,080

 

99
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,160

very simple okay so I'm gonna put that

100
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,170
very simple okay so I'm gonna put that
 

101
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,930
very simple okay so I'm gonna put that
back to normal and then we'll continue

102
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:36,940
back to normal and then we'll continue
 

103
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:49,350
back to normal and then we'll continue
on with the new changes okay I'll just

104
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
on with the new changes okay I'll just
 

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
on with the new changes okay I'll just
leave the buttons like that Steph having

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,010
leave the buttons like that Steph having
 

107
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,150
leave the buttons like that Steph having
them on the outside here the reason I

108
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,160
them on the outside here the reason I
 

109
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,339
them on the outside here the reason I
have those repeaters set to three torch

110
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:56,349
have those repeaters set to three torch
 

111
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,839
have those repeaters set to three torch
delays instead of just one is so that

112
00:03:59,839 --> 00:03:59,849
delays instead of just one is so that
 

113
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,339
delays instead of just one is so that
usually when I push these buttons I'm a

114
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:02,349
usually when I push these buttons I'm a
 

115
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,430
usually when I push these buttons I'm a
few blocks away from this door and I

116
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:05,440
few blocks away from this door and I
 

117
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,559
few blocks away from this door and I
don't want it closing before I get to it

118
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:07,569
don't want it closing before I get to it
 

119
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,259
don't want it closing before I get to it
so I don't want it cutting me in half

120
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:10,269
so I don't want it cutting me in half
 

121
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,470
so I don't want it cutting me in half
basically that gives me time to walk

122
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,480
basically that gives me time to walk
 

123
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,699
basically that gives me time to walk
through without it shutting so that's

124
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:17,709
through without it shutting so that's
 

125
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,939
through without it shutting so that's
important and of course I'll dress this

126
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:20,949
important and of course I'll dress this
 

127
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,980
important and of course I'll dress this
up a little bit on the outside make it

128
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:22,990
up a little bit on the outside make it
 

129
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,950
up a little bit on the outside make it
look nice as I find the time and the

130
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:27,960
look nice as I find the time and the
 

131
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,010
look nice as I find the time and the
desire

132
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,020

 

133
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,270

now the other big change is I have a

134
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
now the other big change is I have a
 

135
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,520
now the other big change is I have a
piston elevator now to get up and down

136
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,530
piston elevator now to get up and down
 

137
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,589
piston elevator now to get up and down
I'll just get up from my mob system to

138
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:46,599
I'll just get up from my mob system to
 

139
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:53,879
I'll just get up from my mob system to
get down go down here water break and

140
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:53,889
get down go down here water break and
 

141
00:04:53,889 --> 00:05:00,180
get down go down here water break and
you down pretty simple not too many mobs

142
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,190
you down pretty simple not too many mobs
 

143
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:08,339
you down pretty simple not too many mobs
in there right now let's see and to get

144
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:08,349
in there right now let's see and to get
 

145
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:15,300
in there right now let's see and to get
up you go down here you probably saw

146
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,310
up you go down here you probably saw
 

147
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,219
up you go down here you probably saw
this thank you to the top so it's pretty

148
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:20,229
this thank you to the top so it's pretty
 

149
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,909
this thank you to the top so it's pretty
nice you can actually make those go

150
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
nice you can actually make those go
 

151
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,700
nice you can actually make those go
faster if you hold shift when you're

152
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:26,710
faster if you hold shift when you're
 

153
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,420
faster if you hold shift when you're
riding it but you know I like like the

154
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:30,430
riding it but you know I like like the
 

155
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,870
riding it but you know I like like the
cleaner

156
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
cleaner
 

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:39,240
cleaner
feel of just walking it okay so what

158
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,250
feel of just walking it okay so what
 

159
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,719
feel of just walking it okay so what
else is new

160
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:41,729
else is new
 

161
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:46,020
else is new
well I've added these lights in to my

162
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,030
well I've added these lights in to my
 

163
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,129
well I've added these lights in to my
mob system here I had it figured out so

164
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:50,139
mob system here I had it figured out so
 

165
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,680
mob system here I had it figured out so
that everything behind this glass is

166
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,690
that everything behind this glass is
 

167
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,260
that everything behind this glass is
light level 7 or less and everything on

168
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,270
light level 7 or less and everything on
 

169
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,040
light level 7 or less and everything on
this side is above light level 7 light

170
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,050
this side is above light level 7 light
 

171
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,909
this side is above light level 7 light
level 7 is what mobs need hostile mobs

172
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:02,919
level 7 is what mobs need hostile mobs
 

173
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,270
level 7 is what mobs need hostile mobs
need to spawn so that would make it so

174
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,280
need to spawn so that would make it so
 

175
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,390
need to spawn so that would make it so
no mobs will spawn in here and mobs be

176
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,400
no mobs will spawn in here and mobs be
 

177
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,089
no mobs will spawn in here and mobs be
able to spawn out there the problem

178
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:12,099
able to spawn out there the problem
 

179
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:18,749
able to spawn out there the problem
though I was doing some tests actually

180
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:18,759
though I was doing some tests actually
 

181
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,339
though I was doing some tests actually
recording an episode that I deleted

182
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:20,349
recording an episode that I deleted
 

183
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,830
recording an episode that I deleted
because it was very long and boring and

184
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:22,840
because it was very long and boring and
 

185
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,610
because it was very long and boring and
I was just doing mob science tests the

186
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:26,620
I was just doing mob science tests the
 

187
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,920
I was just doing mob science tests the
whole time but what I figured out in

188
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:28,930
whole time but what I figured out in
 

189
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,010
whole time but what I figured out in
that episode I'll share with you first

190
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,020
that episode I'll share with you first
 

191
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,930
that episode I'll share with you first
of all it's always been my understanding

192
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:36,940
of all it's always been my understanding
 

193
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,960
of all it's always been my understanding
that's

194
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:39,970

 

195
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,400

as long as the ground is at light level

196
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,410
as long as the ground is at light level
 

197
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,120
as long as the ground is at light level
seven or less so from zero one two three

that mobs would have an equal chance of

202
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,360
that mobs would have an equal chance of
 

203
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,810
that mobs would have an equal chance of
say spawning on ground at light level

204
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:54,820
say spawning on ground at light level
 

205
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,060
say spawning on ground at light level
zero compared with flight level seven I

206
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,070
zero compared with flight level seven I
 

207
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,270
zero compared with flight level seven I
thought it was equal because I was under

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,280
thought it was equal because I was under

the belief that not removed that check

210
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,130
the belief that not removed that check
 

211
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,350
the belief that not removed that check
in the code and one of the patches a few

212
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
in the code and one of the patches a few
 

213
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,530
in the code and one of the patches a few
months ago but apparently that isn't the

214
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:10,540
months ago but apparently that isn't the
 

215
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,440
months ago but apparently that isn't the
case I did a bunch of tests in the

216
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,450
case I did a bunch of tests in the
 

217
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,960
case I did a bunch of tests in the
little deleted episode basically I

218
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:15,970
little deleted episode basically I
 

219
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,790
little deleted episode basically I
covered one of these spawn pads this one

220
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
covered one of these spawn pads this one
 

221
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
covered one of these spawn pads this one
here I put a wall all around it got rid

222
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:22,810
here I put a wall all around it got rid
 

223
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,410
here I put a wall all around it got rid
of these lights so it was completely

224
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:25,420
of these lights so it was completely
 

225
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,270
of these lights so it was completely
dark in there and on this pad here I had

226
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,280
dark in there and on this pad here I had
 

227
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,350
dark in there and on this pad here I had
it set to about light level five so this

228
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,360
it set to about light level five so this
 

229
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,850
it set to about light level five so this
was light level zero that was light

230
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:35,860
was light level zero that was light
 

231
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,320
was light level zero that was light
level five both of them could spawn mobs

232
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,330
level five both of them could spawn mobs
 

233
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,440
level five both of them could spawn mobs
and what I did is I went over here and I

234
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,450
and what I did is I went over here and I
 

235
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,050
and what I did is I went over here and I
did a bunch of checks basically I would

236
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,060
did a bunch of checks basically I would
 

237
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,760
did a bunch of checks basically I would
go to peaceful and then I'd switch it to

238
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:53,770
go to peaceful and then I'd switch it to
 

239
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,740
go to peaceful and then I'd switch it to
easy and I would count how many times

240
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:58,750
easy and I would count how many times
 

241
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,110
easy and I would count how many times
mobs spawned in the completely dark room

242
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
mobs spawned in the completely dark room
 

243
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,970
mobs spawned in the completely dark room
compared to the how many times they

244
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:02,980
compared to the how many times they
 

245
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,780
compared to the how many times they
spawned in the partially dark room and

246
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:06,790
spawned in the partially dark room and
 

247
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,080
spawned in the partially dark room and
it was something like I did a bunch of

248
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,090
it was something like I did a bunch of
 

249
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,940
it was something like I did a bunch of
tests I think it was like twenty twenty

250
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:14,950
tests I think it was like twenty twenty
 

251
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,700
tests I think it was like twenty twenty
one mob sets a mob spawned in the dark

252
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:17,710
one mob sets a mob spawned in the dark
 

253
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,000
one mob sets a mob spawned in the dark
room compared to it was about five sets

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,010
room compared to it was about five sets
 

255
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,060
room compared to it was about five sets
of mobs spawned in the partially dark

256
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,070
of mobs spawned in the partially dark
 

257
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,920
of mobs spawned in the partially dark
room so if it was even then it would

258
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:28,930
room so if it was even then it would
 

259
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,810
room so if it was even then it would
make no difference the light level but

260
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:30,820
make no difference the light level but
 

261
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,670
make no difference the light level but
since so many more spawned in the

262
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:32,680
since so many more spawned in the
 

263
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,640
since so many more spawned in the
completely dark room that tells me that

264
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:35,650
completely dark room that tells me that
 

265
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,290
completely dark room that tells me that
light levels do matter

266
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:40,300

 

267
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,969

so it's very important to keep in mind

268
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:42,979
so it's very important to keep in mind
 

269
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,870
so it's very important to keep in mind
if you have a mob system I don't in my

270
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
if you have a mob system I don't in my
 

271
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,900
if you have a mob system I don't in my
tutorial I said you could put up

272
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:48,910
tutorial I said you could put up
 

273
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,750
tutorial I said you could put up
redstone torches if you did that get rid

274
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:52,760
redstone torches if you did that get rid
 

275
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,160
redstone torches if you did that get rid
of them because they're lowering your

276
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,170
of them because they're lowering your
 

277
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,540
of them because they're lowering your
spawn rate okay also with my thing here

278
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:58,550
spawn rate okay also with my thing here
 

279
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,310
spawn rate okay also with my thing here
I'm gonna have to revoke these lights

280
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm gonna have to revoke these lights
 

281
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,060
I'm gonna have to revoke these lights
because they're the pads over here are

282
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,070
because they're the pads over here are
 

283
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,910
because they're the pads over here are
at light level 7 and it kind of feeds as

284
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:06,920
at light level 7 and it kind of feeds as
 

285
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,170
at light level 7 and it kind of feeds as
it goes back but ideally I want these at

286
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:11,180
it goes back but ideally I want these at
 

287
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,750
it goes back but ideally I want these at
light level 0 everything behind the

288
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
light level 0 everything behind the
 

289
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,650
light level 0 everything behind the
glass light level 0 so I'll have to rip

290
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:17,660
glass light level 0 so I'll have to rip
 

291
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,450
glass light level 0 so I'll have to rip
out these lights I'll probably put half

292
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:19,460
out these lights I'll probably put half
 

293
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
out these lights I'll probably put half
slabs on the ground here so mobs won't

294
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,470
slabs on the ground here so mobs won't
 

295
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,640
slabs on the ground here so mobs won't
spawn in here and yeah so keep those

296
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:27,650
spawn in here and yeah so keep those
 

297
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:33,040
spawn in here and yeah so keep those
changes in mind let's see what else what

298
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,050
changes in mind let's see what else what
 

299
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,500
changes in mind let's see what else what
else

300

one other test I did is I covered one

302
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,220
one other test I did is I covered one
 

303
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,610
one other test I did is I covered one
spawning pad completely with pressure

304
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:39,620
spawning pad completely with pressure
 

305
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,240
spawning pad completely with pressure
plates and mobs were still able to spawn

306
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,250
plates and mobs were still able to spawn
 

307
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,340
plates and mobs were still able to spawn
on it so yes mobs can spawn on pressure

308
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,350
on it so yes mobs can spawn on pressure
 

309
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,820
on it so yes mobs can spawn on pressure
plates I also tried redstone they can

310
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:48,830
plates I also tried redstone they can
 

311
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,120
plates I also tried redstone they can
spawn on redstone dust anyway that's

312
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,130
spawn on redstone dust anyway that's
 

313
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,470
spawn on redstone dust anyway that's
what I tried I did another test where I

314
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
what I tried I did another test where I
 

315
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,630
what I tried I did another test where I
had a spawning pad and closed one I

316
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,640
had a spawning pad and closed one I
 

317
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:13,079
had a spawning pad and closed one I
built basically it was closed like this

318
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:13,089

 

319
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,750

it wasn't a 2 by 2 pad it was this

320
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
it wasn't a 2 by 2 pad it was this
 

321
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,050
it wasn't a 2 by 2 pad it was this
enclosed 7 by 7 next to it I also had a

322
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,060
enclosed 7 by 7 next to it I also had a
 

323
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,579
enclosed 7 by 7 next to it I also had a
seven by seven enclosed spawning pad

324
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:23,589
seven by seven enclosed spawning pad
 

325
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,850
seven by seven enclosed spawning pad
except one of them was 2 blocks high and

you had above a pad made a difference on
 

333
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,940
you had above a pad made a difference on
the spawning rates and what I found out

334
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:41,950
the spawning rates and what I found out
 

335
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:48,670
the spawning rates and what I found out
after about 20 tests 10 spawned in the

that's how you can make a spawning pad

364
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,250
that's how you can make a spawning pad
 

365
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,550
that's how you can make a spawning pad
that only spawns spiders and not hostile

day

484
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,610

 

485
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,500

so for me it's pretty slow try it for

486
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,510
so for me it's pretty slow try it for
 

487
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,070
so for me it's pretty slow try it for
yourself

488
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,080
yourself
 

489
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,040
yourself
and if it takes if it doesn't take very

490
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,050
and if it takes if it doesn't take very
 

491
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,380
and if it takes if it doesn't take very
long that means you have lots of kids to

492
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,390
long that means you have lots of kids to
 

493
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:18,950
long that means you have lots of kids to
light up yet anyway

494
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:18,960
light up yet anyway
 

495
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,070
light up yet anyway
I think we should move on okay check

496
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,080
I think we should move on okay check
 

497
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,760
I think we should move on okay check
this out like right next to here I see

498
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:28,770
this out like right next to here I see
 

499
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,930
this out like right next to here I see
there's a mob so there's probably a

500
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:32,940
there's a mob so there's probably a
 

501
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:39,470
there's a mob so there's probably a
little tiny dark room just enough for

502
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:39,480
little tiny dark room just enough for
 

503
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,780
little tiny dark room just enough for
the mob to spawned you know it's not in

504
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:47,790
the mob to spawned you know it's not in
 

505
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,060
the mob to spawned you know it's not in
a main cave system probably just a

506
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,070
a main cave system probably just a
 

507
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,680
a main cave system probably just a
little tiny dirt room that you would

508
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:54,690
little tiny dirt room that you would
 

509
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,230
little tiny dirt room that you would
never find unless you heard a mob in it

510
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,240
never find unless you heard a mob in it
 

511
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:18,380
never find unless you heard a mob in it
or saw a mob using f3o

512
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,390

 

513
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,240

it was actually a place I've been before

514
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,250
it was actually a place I've been before
 

515
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,180
it was actually a place I've been before
but I didn't fully light it up so make

516
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,190
but I didn't fully light it up so make
 

517
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,860
but I didn't fully light it up so make
sure when you're lighting up your caves

518
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:27,870
sure when you're lighting up your caves
 

519
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:38,900
sure when you're lighting up your caves
do a good job I probably just missed

520
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:38,910
do a good job I probably just missed
 

521
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:47,890
do a good job I probably just missed
this little section here

522
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:47,900

 

523
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,330

I'd like to get rid of gravel when I see

524
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:50,340
I'd like to get rid of gravel when I see
 

525
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,289
I'd like to get rid of gravel when I see
it just cuz usually at the top of it

526
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:56,299
it just cuz usually at the top of it
 

527
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:59,870
it just cuz usually at the top of it
there's dark spots so if you get rid of

528
00:17:59,870 --> 00:17:59,880
there's dark spots so if you get rid of
 

529
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,120
there's dark spots so if you get rid of
it the grounds flat here it's easy to

530
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,130
it the grounds flat here it's easy to
 

531
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,270
it the grounds flat here it's easy to
light up flat ground and I see if we

532
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:08,280
light up flat ground and I see if we
 

533
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:15,410
light up flat ground and I see if we
looked at again at our either it when it

534
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,420
looked at again at our either it when it
 

535
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,870
looked at again at our either it when it
says 0 / 182 any entities that it's

536
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
says 0 / 182 any entities that it's
 

537
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,409
says 0 / 182 any entities that it's
drying on our screen counts as a number

538
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:24,419
drying on our screen counts as a number
 

539
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,110
drying on our screen counts as a number
at the first start there right now I'm

540
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
at the first start there right now I'm
 

541
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,940
at the first start there right now I'm
looking at 14 mobs in the distance 13 1

542
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:31,950
looking at 14 mobs in the distance 13 1
 

543
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,490
looking at 14 mobs in the distance 13 1
dusty spawned 12 so I got a bunch of

544
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,500
dusty spawned 12 so I got a bunch of
 

545
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,590
dusty spawned 12 so I got a bunch of
mobs in front of me right now

546
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
mobs in front of me right now
 

547
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,020
mobs in front of me right now
a bunch of cave systems I need to light

548
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,030
a bunch of cave systems I need to light
 

549
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,620
a bunch of cave systems I need to light
up over there so that's another way of

550
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:45,630
up over there so that's another way of
 

551
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,419
up over there so that's another way of
finding mobs if you can't really see

552
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:47,429
finding mobs if you can't really see
 

553
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:52,720
finding mobs if you can't really see
them a few if you move your mouse around

554
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:52,730

 

555
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,919

it'll tell you if you're looking at any

556
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:54,929
it'll tell you if you're looking at any
 

557
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:57,590
it'll tell you if you're looking at any
even if you can't see the label that far

558
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
even if you can't see the label that far
 

559
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,539
even if you can't see the label that far
away right now I'm looking at 13 yeah I

560
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:02,549
away right now I'm looking at 13 yeah I
 

561
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:03,350
away right now I'm looking at 13 yeah I
see them down there

562
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
see them down there
 

563
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,190
see them down there
oh wow

564
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
oh wow
 

565
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,620
oh wow
what's going on here this is a really

566
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:09,630
what's going on here this is a really
 

567
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:18,770
what's going on here this is a really
dark area see I thought I lit all this

568
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:18,780
dark area see I thought I lit all this
 

569
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:28,120
dark area see I thought I lit all this
stuff up but there's still more to do

570
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,130

 

571
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,650

anyway moving on moving on you get the

572
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:30,660
anyway moving on moving on you get the
 

573
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,140
anyway moving on moving on you get the
point okay so after further

574
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,150
point okay so after further
 

575
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,580
point okay so after further
investigating yes we're still talking

576
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:37,590
investigating yes we're still talking
 

577
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,909
investigating yes we're still talking
about this seems a lot of those mobs I

578
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:40,919
about this seems a lot of those mobs I
 

579
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:50,930
about this seems a lot of those mobs I
saw were actually wild slimes so there's

580
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:50,940
saw were actually wild slimes so there's
 

581
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,230
saw were actually wild slimes so there's
a ton down here

582
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240

 

583
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,910

so something to keep in mind these guys

584
00:19:59,910 --> 00:19:59,920
so something to keep in mind these guys
 

585
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,400
so something to keep in mind these guys
are taking up possible spots for your

586
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,410
are taking up possible spots for your
 

587
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,260
are taking up possible spots for your
hostile mobs to spawn went in mob spots

588
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,270
hostile mobs to spawn went in mob spots
 

589
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,630
hostile mobs to spawn went in mob spots
I mean so if the tap is set any hostile

590
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
I mean so if the tap is set any hostile
 

591
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,920
I mean so if the tap is set any hostile
mobs I don't know if that's the Cabot's

592
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:13,930
mobs I don't know if that's the Cabot's
 

593
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,250
mobs I don't know if that's the Cabot's
it's around 70 though I know let's say

594
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,260
it's around 70 though I know let's say
 

595
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,840
it's around 70 though I know let's say
70 if the cap is 70 if I have 20 slimes

596
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:21,850
70 if the cap is 70 if I have 20 slimes
 

597
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,620
70 if the cap is 70 if I have 20 slimes
down here then only 50 like creepers in

598
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:25,630
down here then only 50 like creepers in
 

599
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,390
down here then only 50 like creepers in
that are going to be able to spawn on my

600
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:27,400
that are going to be able to spawn on my
 

601
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,640
that are going to be able to spawn on my
spawning pads at a time so you need to

602
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:32,650
spawning pads at a time so you need to
 

603
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,780
spawning pads at a time so you need to
get rid of these slimes unfortunately

604
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:36,790
get rid of these slimes unfortunately
 

605
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,230
get rid of these slimes unfortunately
slimes they spawn at any light levels so

606
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
slimes they spawn at any light levels so
 

607
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,050
slimes they spawn at any light levels so
the only way you can keep these wild

608
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:43,060
the only way you can keep these wild
 

609
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,980
the only way you can keep these wild
slimes responding is to use that slime

610
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:46,990
slimes responding is to use that slime
 

611
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,730
slimes responding is to use that slime
finder program and then lay down half

612
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:50,740
finder program and then lay down half
 

613
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,360
finder program and then lay down half
slabs

614
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,370
slabs
 

615
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,000
slabs
and the chunks where you don't have

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,010
and the chunks where you don't have
 

617
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,750
and the chunks where you don't have
slime farms around the area and that's

618
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
slime farms around the area and that's
 

619
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,100
slime farms around the area and that's
how you can keep wild slimes from

620
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,110
how you can keep wild slimes from
 

621
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:12,120
how you can keep wild slimes from
stealing your mob spots okay okay so I

622
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,130
stealing your mob spots okay okay so I
 

623
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,620
stealing your mob spots okay okay so I
did miss this the first time I saw it

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:13,630
did miss this the first time I saw it
 

625
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,570
did miss this the first time I saw it
but when I was rewatching the video I

626
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:15,580
but when I was rewatching the video I

629
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,640

you are now gonna believe this this is

630
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:23,650
you are now gonna believe this this is
 

631
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:31,400
you are now gonna believe this this is
crazy

633
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:41,640

such a crazy patch oh yeah ah that's

634
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,650
such a crazy patch oh yeah ah that's
 

635

they've been multiplying for who knows
 

639
00:21:49,150 --> 00:22:02,170
they've been multiplying for who knows
how long

640
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,180

 

641
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,000

a while more slimes yes I'm gonna use

660
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,030
a while more slimes yes I'm gonna use
 

661
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,060
a while more slimes yes I'm gonna use
that slime program to find all their

662
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,070
that slime program to find all their
 

663
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,570
that slime program to find all their
chunks and put half slabs down so that

664
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:14,580
chunks and put half slabs down so that
 

665
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,040
chunks and put half slabs down so that
they can't spawn where I don't want them

666

they can't spawn where I don't want them
 

667
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,760
they can't spawn where I don't want them
to and I'll link it in the description

and you only have to keep them from

674
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:33,480
and you only have to keep them from
 

675
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,000
and you only have to keep them from

679
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,280

that's not a slime that's something else

getting really long already so we're
 

711
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,760
getting really long already so we're
gonna try wrap it up here this is what I

712
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:41,770
gonna try wrap it up here this is what I
 

713
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,320
gonna try wrap it up here this is what I
got by the way got about status slimes I

714
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,330
got by the way got about status slimes I
 

715
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,250
got by the way got about status slimes I
think I only got one stack of redstone

716
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,260
think I only got one stack of redstone
 

717
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,830

two diamonds so that was pretty good but

720
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:57,970
two diamonds so that was pretty good but
 

721
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,880
two diamonds so that was pretty good but
most importantly we lit up the caves

722
00:25:59,880 --> 00:25:59,890
most importantly we lit up the caves
 

723
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,680
most importantly we lit up the caves
that were lowering the efficiency of my

724
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:04,690
that were lowering the efficiency of my
 

725
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,610
that were lowering the efficiency of my
mob system okay so quickly few other

726
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:08,620
mob system okay so quickly few other
 

727
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:15,330
mob system okay so quickly few other
things this minecart thing is done okay

728
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,340
things this minecart thing is done okay
 

729
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,669
things this minecart thing is done okay
I ripped out all the wiring because I

730
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:20,679
I ripped out all the wiring because I
 

731
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,080
I ripped out all the wiring because I
needed it and also on you know I'm I

732
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,090
needed it and also on you know I'm I
 

733
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:29,070
needed it and also on you know I'm I
never use it so why bother when it's

734
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,080
never use it so why bother when it's
 

735
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,200
never use it so why bother when it's
running it likes the game a lot so I

736
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,210
running it likes the game a lot so I
 

737
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,310
running it likes the game a lot so I
don't want I don't want that huge like

738
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,320
don't want I don't want that huge like
 

739
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,200
don't want I don't want that huge like
spikes so what I'm just gonna do is I'm

740
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,210
spikes so what I'm just gonna do is I'm
 

741
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,060
spikes so what I'm just gonna do is I'm
gonna loop this will have one minecart

742
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,070
gonna loop this will have one minecart
 

743
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:49,280
gonna loop this will have one minecart
going around all the time and I will

744
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,290

 

745
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,750

cover up these holes I'll finish ripping

746
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
cover up these holes I'll finish ripping
 

747
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,380
cover up these holes I'll finish ripping
out the tracks and that will be done and

748
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,390
out the tracks and that will be done and
 

749
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,910
out the tracks and that will be done and
we'll actually be able to use this

750
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:56,920
we'll actually be able to use this
 

751
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:03,030
we'll actually be able to use this
hopefully they'll just be going around a

752
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,040
hopefully they'll just be going around a
 

753
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,150
hopefully they'll just be going around a
loop I may try add a few see if they

754
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,160
loop I may try add a few see if they
 

755
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,280
loop I may try add a few see if they
merge together or not in here's we won't

756
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,290
merge together or not in here's we won't
 

757
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,680
merge together or not in here's we won't
need these controls anymore if I do that

758
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:14,690
need these controls anymore if I do that
 

759
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,980
need these controls anymore if I do that
so I plan on maybe putting like one of

760
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:18,990
so I plan on maybe putting like one of
 

761
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,050
so I plan on maybe putting like one of
these water column things you walk in

762
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,060
these water column things you walk in
 

763
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,330
these water column things you walk in
and you can swim up to the mob pads

764
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:23,340
and you can swim up to the mob pads
 

765
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,270
and you can swim up to the mob pads
maybe because right now I don't have any

766
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,280
maybe because right now I don't have any
 

767
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,270
maybe because right now I don't have any
good way of getting to the mob pads

768
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,280
good way of getting to the mob pads
 

769
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,390
good way of getting to the mob pads
another thing I want to say thank you to

how I can improve the item despawn timer

776
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,490
how I can improve the item despawn timer
 

777
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,610
