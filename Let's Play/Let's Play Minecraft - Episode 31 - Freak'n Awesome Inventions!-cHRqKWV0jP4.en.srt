00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
normal like a normal chest and then we
 

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,400
normal like a normal chest and then we
have chests for extra supply here and

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,410

 

79
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,940

yeah so about the lighting issue with

80
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:26,950
yeah so about the lighting issue with
 

81
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,449
yeah so about the lighting issue with
the glowstone I've kind of solved it

82
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:32,459

 

83
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,220

here that fire in the background sound

84
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,230
here that fire in the background sound
 

85
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,550
here that fire in the background sound
of fire basically I kind of came up with

86
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:41,560
of fire basically I kind of came up with
 

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,690
of fire basically I kind of came up with
a solution this is easy to read right it

88
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:45,700
a solution this is easy to read right it
 

89
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,460
a solution this is easy to read right it
is for me it might be different on

90
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:47,470
is for me it might be different on
 

91
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,020
is for me it might be different on
YouTube but as some of you probably know

92
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,030
YouTube but as some of you probably know
 

93
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,130
YouTube but as some of you probably know
light can pass through stairs so this

94
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,140
light can pass through stairs so this
 

95
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,620
light can pass through stairs so this
looks like a solid wood plank but it's

96
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:58,630
looks like a solid wood plank but it's
 

97
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,330
looks like a solid wood plank but it's
actually a stair and there's fire on the

98
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:03,340
actually a stair and there's fire on the
 

99
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,110
actually a stair and there's fire on the
other side of it and so this lights up

100
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
other side of it and so this lights up
 

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,440
other side of it and so this lights up
the signs really bright I was using

102
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:10,450
the signs really bright I was using
 

103
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,449
the signs really bright I was using
torches before but fire lava glowstone

104
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:15,459
torches before but fire lava glowstone
 

105
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,680
torches before but fire lava glowstone
and the jack-o'-lanterns are a little

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:19,690
and the jack-o'-lanterns are a little
 

107
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,240
and the jack-o'-lanterns are a little
bit brighter than torches so fire is

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,250
bit brighter than torches so fire is
 

109
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,360
bit brighter than torches so fire is
actually a better choice I'll probably

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,370
actually a better choice I'll probably
 

111
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,909
actually a better choice I'll probably
replace it with lava just to get rid of

112
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
replace it with lava just to get rid of
 

113
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,560
replace it with lava just to get rid of
a that's stupid fire noise all the time

114
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,570

115
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,180
a that's stupid fire noise all the time
but I got to back up my world first to

116
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,190
but I got to back up my world first to
 

117
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,620
but I got to back up my world first to
make sure it doesn't burn everything

118
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:37,630
make sure it doesn't burn everything
 

119
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:48,050
make sure it doesn't burn everything
down and yeah so we got to let's see I

120
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,060
down and yeah so we got to let's see I
 

121
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,730
down and yeah so we got to let's see I
blew away this hillside a little bit

122
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:50,740
blew away this hillside a little bit
 

123
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,990
blew away this hillside a little bit
more using TNT and there's a minecart

124
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,000
more using TNT and there's a minecart
 

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,560
more using TNT and there's a minecart
track in our storage room it's kind of

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:58,570
track in our storage room it's kind of
 

127
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,020
track in our storage room it's kind of
busted because of an accident at the

128
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,030
busted because of an accident at the
 

129
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,880
busted because of an accident at the
moment but the track loops around the

130
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:05,890
moment but the track loops around the
 

131
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,839
moment but the track loops around the
storage room comes to this point here

132
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:10,849
storage room comes to this point here
 

133
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:15,429
storage room comes to this point here

carts going around a loop constantly

142
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:32,179
carts going around a loop constantly
 

143
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,290
carts going around a loop constantly
like within three to five seconds of

144
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:35,300
like within three to five seconds of
 

145
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,719
like within three to five seconds of
each other and so that's what I'm trying

146
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:37,729
each other and so that's what I'm trying
 

147
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:46,359
each other and so that's what I'm trying
to set up here so they're going to go

148
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:46,369
to set up here so they're going to go
 

149
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,609
to set up here so they're going to go
around this way and they're going to

150
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:48,619
around this way and they're going to
 

151
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:56,769
around this way and they're going to
return to a stack carts here I've never

152
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:56,779
return to a stack carts here I've never
 

153
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,799

built as dispenser minecart system

154
00:05:59,799 --> 00:05:59,809
built as dispenser minecart system
 

155
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:05,980
built as dispenser minecart system
before so it's a little bit challenging

156
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:05,990
before so it's a little bit challenging
 

157
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,040
before so it's a little bit challenging
for me but they fall on a half-block and

158
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,050
for me but they fall on a half-block and
 

159
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,249
for me but they fall on a half-block and
then there's going to be a booster track

160
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:15,259
then there's going to be a booster track
 

161
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,569
then there's going to be a booster track
next to this that's going to be

162
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:16,579
next to this that's going to be
 

163
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,420
next to this that's going to be
constantly going around with some

164
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,430
constantly going around with some
 

165
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,230
constantly going around with some
overload protection on it and it's going

166
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,240
overload protection on it and it's going
 

167
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,059
overload protection on it and it's going
to send the carts up up here and they're

168
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:28,069
to send the carts up up here and they're
 

169
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:29,829
to send the carts up up here and they're
going to go around they'll need to have

170
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:29,839
going to go around they'll need to have
 

171
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,629
going to go around they'll need to have
enough force to make it all the way

172
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:31,639
enough force to make it all the way
 

173
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,619
enough force to make it all the way
around and it's just going to keep

174
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:35,629
around and it's just going to keep
 

175
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:41,220
around and it's just going to keep
looping around and around and this is a

176
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,230

 

177
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,560

as dispenser is important because it's a

178
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,570
as dispenser is important because it's a
 

179
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,030
as dispenser is important because it's a
buffer and it's also a regulator to keep

180
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,040
buffer and it's also a regulator to keep
 

181
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,010
buffer and it's also a regulator to keep
the carts in equal spacing because

182
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,020
the carts in equal spacing because
 

183
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,420
the carts in equal spacing because
otherwise if you ride in a minecart it's

184
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,430
otherwise if you ride in a minecart it's
 

185
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,000
otherwise if you ride in a minecart it's
going to change the distance between an

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,010
going to change the distance between an
 

187
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:07,170
going to change the distance between an
empty line cards they're the spacing

188
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:07,180
empty line cards they're the spacing
 

189
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,170
empty line cards they're the spacing
will change if you ride in mine carts if

190
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,180
will change if you ride in mine carts if
 

191
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,610
will change if you ride in mine carts if
you don't have a regulator so this is

192
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:17,620
you don't have a regulator so this is
 

193
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,120
you don't have a regulator so this is
the fire system ideally I would like to

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,130
the fire system ideally I would like to
 

195
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,500
the fire system ideally I would like to
use glowstone if I have enough but I'm

196
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:25,510
use glowstone if I have enough but I'm
 

197
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:34,650
use glowstone if I have enough but I'm
just going to replace it with lava yes

198
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:34,660
just going to replace it with lava yes
 

199
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,160
just going to replace it with lava yes
so this is an experiment I was doing

200
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,170
so this is an experiment I was doing
 

201
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:51,180
so this is an experiment I was doing
just just now um so BD tetra made an

202
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,190
just just now um so BD tetra made an
 

203
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:58,830
just just now um so BD tetra made an
invention for sorting skeletons a lot of

204
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:58,840
invention for sorting skeletons a lot of
 

205
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,240
invention for sorting skeletons a lot of
people suggested that since skeletons

206
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,250
people suggested that since skeletons
 

207
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,460
people suggested that since skeletons
move counterclockwise from you that you

208
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,470
move counterclockwise from you that you
 

209
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,760
move counterclockwise from you that you
could make some sort of method to

210
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:08,770
could make some sort of method to
 

211
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,160
could make some sort of method to
separate them and that's what to DD

212
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,170
separate them and that's what to DD
 

213
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,230
separate them and that's what to DD
tetra figured out I'm going to post a

214
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
tetra figured out I'm going to post a
 

215
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
tetra figured out I'm going to post a
link to his invention and this is a

216
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,450
link to his invention and this is a
 

217
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,870
link to his invention and this is a
refinement I'm trying to make to it and

218
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:21,880
refinement I'm trying to make to it and
 

219
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,970
refinement I'm trying to make to it and
it seems to be working well

220
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:27,980

 

221
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,200

all right so we got some activity going

222
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,210
all right so we got some activity going
 

223
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,530
all right so we got some activity going
on here you just saw the skeleton one to

224
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:33,540
on here you just saw the skeleton one to
 

225
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:39,440
on here you just saw the skeleton one to
the left there and another one and so I

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,450
the left there and another one and so I
 

227
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,810
the left there and another one and so I
found out the best way to make them go

228
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:44,820
found out the best way to make them go
 

229
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,940
found out the best way to make them go
counterclockwise is to make sure that

230
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:46,950
counterclockwise is to make sure that
 

231
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,000
counterclockwise is to make sure that
they are on dry land so I don't know if

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,010
they are on dry land so I don't know if
 

233
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,990
they are on dry land so I don't know if
you can see it but there's a pressure

234
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
you can see it but there's a pressure
 

235
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,950
you can see it but there's a pressure
plate right where my cursor is and in

236
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:54,960
plate right where my cursor is and in
 

237
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,620
plate right where my cursor is and in
that one block space they go on dry land

238
00:08:59,620 --> 00:08:59,630

 

239
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,740

and the distance you are from them is

240
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:03,750
and the distance you are from them is
 

241
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,780
and the distance you are from them is
very important and so there's just a

242
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:08,790
very important and so there's just a
 

243
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,810
very important and so there's just a
hole here where the zombies and creepers

244
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:11,820
hole here where the zombies and creepers
 

245
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:22,910
hole here where the zombies and creepers
will fall and I don't really have this

246
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:22,920
will fall and I don't really have this
 

247
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,740
will fall and I don't really have this
doing anything right now just be dropped

248
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:24,750
doing anything right now just be dropped
 

249
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:38,540
doing anything right now just be dropped
into this room yeah so creepers up here

250
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:38,550
into this room yeah so creepers up here
 

251
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,290
into this room yeah so creepers up here
and this lava started to flow out and

252
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:42,300
and this lava started to flow out and
 

253
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,390
and this lava started to flow out and
that's what destroyed my car tracks

254
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:44,400
that's what destroyed my car tracks
 

255
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:52,270
that's what destroyed my car tracks
there man

256
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:52,280

 

257
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,050

but yeah this seems to work very well

258
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,060
but yeah this seems to work very well
 

259
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,060
but yeah this seems to work very well
I'm gonna work on polishing it up a bit

260
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,070
I'm gonna work on polishing it up a bit
 

261
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:11,620
I'm gonna work on polishing it up a bit
yet and so a little bit hard to see but

262
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:11,630
yet and so a little bit hard to see but
 

263
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,350
yet and so a little bit hard to see but
especially since I made out of the dirt

264
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,360
especially since I made out of the dirt
 

265
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:25,400
especially since I made out of the dirt
this is where elevator is I would like

266
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,410
this is where elevator is I would like
 

267
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,470
this is where elevator is I would like
to show you guys this I have to destroy

268
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
to show you guys this I have to destroy
 

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:48,790
to show you guys this I have to destroy
these and so

270
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800

 

271
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,050

the tall mob elevator is right over here

272
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,060
the tall mob elevator is right over here
 

273
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,530
the tall mob elevator is right over here
so it travels two blocks which is

274
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:57,540
so it travels two blocks which is
 

275
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,379
so it travels two blocks which is
important because if you let them free

276
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:00,389
important because if you let them free
 

277
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,069
important because if you let them free
roam over here they'll probably not move

278
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:03,079
roam over here they'll probably not move
 

279
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,639
roam over here they'll probably not move
so the water stream gets the movie at

280
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:07,649
so the water stream gets the movie at
 

281
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:13,220
so the water stream gets the movie at
the exit point and they see you and this

282
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,230
the exit point and they see you and this
 

283
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,980
the exit point and they see you and this
stream is going this way the skeleton

284
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:15,990
stream is going this way the skeleton
 

285
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,759
stream is going this way the skeleton
sees you he always moved this way and he

286
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:19,769
sees you he always moved this way and he
 

287
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,460
sees you he always moved this way and he
falls down into this little special

288
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,470
falls down into this little special
 

289
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,740
falls down into this little special
chamber the other mob just keep going

290
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:24,750
chamber the other mob just keep going
 

291
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,199
chamber the other mob just keep going
straight over here and then the half

292
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:30,209
straight over here and then the half
 

293
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:34,360
straight over here and then the half
blocks prevent them from coming to you

294
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,370
blocks prevent them from coming to you
 

295
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,379
blocks prevent them from coming to you
because can't fit through this space and

296
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:39,389
because can't fit through this space and
 

297
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:44,840
because can't fit through this space and
you need to be three blocks back from

298
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:44,850
you need to be three blocks back from
 

299
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,470
you need to be three blocks back from
the half block so all together it is

300
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
the half block so all together it is
 

301
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:58,790
the half block so all together it is
five eleven blocks total so the elevator

302
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
five eleven blocks total so the elevator
 

303
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,009
five eleven blocks total so the elevator
is ten blocks away from me and yeah that

304
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:04,019
is ten blocks away from me and yeah that
 

305
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:09,350
is ten blocks away from me and yeah that
it is that um I'm going to check how

306
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
it is that um I'm going to check how
 

307
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,879
it is that um I'm going to check how
much time we have and then we might do

308
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:10,889
much time we have and then we might do
 

309
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:15,220
much time we have and then we might do
something special so we'll be right back

310
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,230
something special so we'll be right back
 

311
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,780
something special so we'll be right back
okay so we still got a few minutes so

312
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:17,790
okay so we still got a few minutes so
 

313
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,699
okay so we still got a few minutes so
let's go do something fun um thanks to

314
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:22,709
let's go do something fun um thanks to
 

315
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,120
let's go do something fun um thanks to
everyone that sends me their videos and

going to go visit one of my viewers

320
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:31,740
going to go visit one of my viewers
 

321
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,879
going to go visit one of my viewers
worlds that he sent me one of his

take a few 120 maybe and if you saw my

376
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:28,600
take a few 120 maybe and if you saw my
 

377
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,870
take a few 120 maybe and if you saw my
previous LP videos um I basically

378
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:35,880

 

379
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,280

discovered something that I called warp

380
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,290
discovered something that I called warp
 

381
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,100

speed I brushed up against about a bunch

382
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,110

of mobs it would send you flying and

384
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,140
of mobs it would send you flying and

this is what this guy figured out only

386
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:49,540
this is what this guy figured out only
 

387
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,420
this is what this guy figured out only
using boats and is very reliable

388
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,430
using boats and is very reliable
 

389
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,690
using boats and is very reliable
so you just enter the minecart there the

390
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:57,700
so you just enter the minecart there the
 

391
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,100
so you just enter the minecart there the
boats then a 3x3 area here which is

392
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,110
boats then a 3x3 area here which is
 

393
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,970
boats then a 3x3 area here which is
important and all you do is point down

394
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:05,980
important and all you do is point down
 

395
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:15,180
important and all you do is point down
and right-click oh I'll get sent flying

396
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,190

 

397
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,579

I did a bit of testing and playing

398
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:17,589
I did a bit of testing and playing
 

399
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:22,139
I did a bit of testing and playing
around with this which is very cool it

400
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:22,149
around with this which is very cool it
 

401
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:29,629
around with this which is very cool it
sends you flying I think about 50 blocks

402
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:29,639

 

403
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,509

the way he has it set up right now and

404
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
the way he has it set up right now and
 

405
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,319
the way he has it set up right now and
it's only blocks off the ground so you

406
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:37,329
it's only blocks off the ground so you
 

407
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,960
it's only blocks off the ground so you
fly 50 blocks while only dropping 3 if

408
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:41,970
fly 50 blocks while only dropping 3 if
 

409
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,939
fly 50 blocks while only dropping 3 if
you fall further you'll go a lot farther

410
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:46,949
you fall further you'll go a lot farther
 

411
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:50,009
you fall further you'll go a lot farther
and if you use more boats you'll go even

412
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:50,019
and if you use more boats you'll go even
 

413
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:57,480
and if you use more boats you'll go even
farther oh and I hit the tree issues

414
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,490
farther oh and I hit the tree issues
 

415
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,400
farther oh and I hit the tree issues
with this and these are serious issues

416
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,410
with this and these are serious issues
 

417
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,929
with this and these are serious issues
reason why I wouldn't actually ends this

418
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:03,939
reason why I wouldn't actually ends this
 

419
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,340
reason why I wouldn't actually ends this
thing um it legs your game the more

420
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,350
thing um it legs your game the more
 

421
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,069
thing um it legs your game the more
boats use the more it's going to let

422
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:11,079
boats use the more it's going to let
 

423
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,230
boats use the more it's going to let
your game unfortunately because it is a

424
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
your game unfortunately because it is a
 

425
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
your game unfortunately because it is a
very reliable system you always go the

426
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,490
very reliable system you always go the
 

427
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:27,650
very reliable system you always go the
same distance and I hit this tree now oh

428
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:27,660
same distance and I hit this tree now oh
 

429
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:34,350
same distance and I hit this tree now oh
yeah it goes about 50 blocks and 5 10 15

430
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,360
yeah it goes about 50 blocks and 5 10 15
 

431
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:47,090
yeah it goes about 50 blocks and 5 10 15
20 25 30 this is about 30 pretty cool

432
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,100
20 25 30 this is about 30 pretty cool
 

433
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,290
20 25 30 this is about 30 pretty cool
thanks battle meter thanks for showing

434
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:49,300
thanks battle meter thanks for showing
 

435
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,780
thanks battle meter thanks for showing
us that I'm not sure how you position

436
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:51,790
us that I'm not sure how you position
 

437
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,110
us that I'm not sure how you position
the minecarts I don't know if you had a

438
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
the minecarts I don't know if you had a
 

439
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,519
the minecarts I don't know if you had a
method for doing it or if you just

440
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:58,529
method for doing it or if you just
 

441
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,519
method for doing it or if you just
brushed against it and somehow got it

442
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:02,529
brushed against it and somehow got it
 

443
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,189
brushed against it and somehow got it
perfect

444
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:04,199
perfect
 

445
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,169
perfect
maybe maybe he'll reply and tell us how

446
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:07,179
maybe maybe he'll reply and tell us how
 

447
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,710
maybe maybe he'll reply and tell us how
he did that because it's kind of a weird

448
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
he did that because it's kind of a weird
 

449
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,520
he did that because it's kind of a weird
spacing away from the block

450
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:16,530

 

451
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,260

and yeah so if you place the boats from

452
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,270
and yeah so if you place the boats from
 

453
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,020
and yeah so if you place the boats from
underneath here the boat gets placed on

454
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,030
underneath here the boat gets placed on
 

455
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,610
underneath here the boat gets placed on
top of this block that's how it's doing

456
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:25,620
top of this block that's how it's doing
 

457
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,680
top of this block that's how it's doing
that and inside the other boats pretty

458
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:30,690
that and inside the other boats pretty
 

459
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:37,190
that and inside the other boats pretty
cool um I think we have some time so I'm

460
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
cool um I think we have some time so I'm
 

461
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,310

going to show you my older world some of

462
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
going to show you my older world some of
 

463
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,020
going to show you my older world some of
you have seen this before

464
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,030

 

465
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,370

it's my old storage room and I mentioned

466
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:49,380
it's my old storage room and I mentioned
 

467
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,170
it's my old storage room and I mentioned
that I was making a fire river system in

468
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,180
that I was making a fire river system in
 

469
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,550
that I was making a fire river system in
my ceiling before and I'm actually a

470
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:55,560
my ceiling before and I'm actually a
 

471
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,380
my ceiling before and I'm actually a
fail work system because it didn't work

472
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,390
fail work system because it didn't work
 

473
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,740
fail work system because it didn't work
very well while it worked perfectly but

474
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,750
very well while it worked perfectly but
 

475
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,570
very well while it worked perfectly but
I overlooked one little thing and this

476
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:05,580
I overlooked one little thing and this
 

477
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:13,280
I overlooked one little thing and this
is a temporary wire I set up tested so

478
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,290
is a temporary wire I set up tested so
 

479
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:19,370
is a temporary wire I set up tested so
what I when I originally was making this

480
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,380
what I when I originally was making this
 

481
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,800
what I when I originally was making this
I used soil blocks and they look a

482
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:21,810
I used soil blocks and they look a
 

483
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,230
I used soil blocks and they look a
hundred times better than cactus blocks

484
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
hundred times better than cactus blocks
 

485
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,960
hundred times better than cactus blocks
because tactus blocks are a lot bigger

486
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:26,970
because tactus blocks are a lot bigger
 

487
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,450
because tactus blocks are a lot bigger
and they're green which is kind of ugly

488
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:29,460
and they're green which is kind of ugly
 

489
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,890
and they're green which is kind of ugly
but the bigger block blocks most of the

490
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:32,900
but the bigger block blocks most of the
 

491
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,570
but the bigger block blocks most of the
fire animation so it doesn't look nearly

492
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:35,580
fire animation so it doesn't look nearly
 

493
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:42,690
fire animation so it doesn't look nearly
as cool

494
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:42,700

 

495
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,399

there's one more thing I could show you

496
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:44,409
there's one more thing I could show you
 

497
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:49,289
there's one more thing I could show you
guys I'm going to cut it here hey

498
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:49,299
guys I'm going to cut it here hey
 

499
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,580
guys I'm going to cut it here hey
actually there's a few things I can show

500
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:50,590
actually there's a few things I can show
 

501
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,840
actually there's a few things I can show
you this is the gigantic cactus farm for

502
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:54,850
you this is the gigantic cactus farm for
 

503
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:00,629
you this is the gigantic cactus farm for
the fail work system it was supposed to

504
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:00,639
the fail work system it was supposed to
 

505
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:06,320
the fail work system it was supposed to
be few layers and for fireworks setups

506
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,330
be few layers and for fireworks setups
 

507
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:13,919
be few layers and for fireworks setups
never got finished and they all funnel

508
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:13,929
never got finished and they all funnel
 

509
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,869
never got finished and they all funnel
into these drop dates the original drop

510
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:18,879
into these drop dates the original drop
 

511
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:28,139
into these drop dates the original drop
gate and they fall down the minecart

512
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:28,149
gate and they fall down the minecart
 

513
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:34,080
gate and they fall down the minecart
date has replaced this and let's go take

00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:21,559
the random cactus logic thing which has
 

535
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,580
the random cactus logic thing which has
been destroyed then you did a redstone

536
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:26,590

 

537
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:34,619

here comes the boat and I just jumped
across an impossible jump and yeah so

568
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:05,119
across an impossible jump and yeah so
 

569
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,159
across an impossible jump and yeah so
we're out of time so I'm going to end

570
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:06,169
we're out of time so I'm going to end
