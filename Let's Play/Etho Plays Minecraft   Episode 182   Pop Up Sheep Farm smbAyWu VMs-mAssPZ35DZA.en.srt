not the full scale project but

36
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
not the full scale project but
 

37
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,549

i know the pattern that i need to repeat

38
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
i know the pattern that i need to repeat

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,470
i know the pattern that i need to repeat
so it should go pretty quickly we're

40
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
so it should go pretty quickly we're
 

41
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,990
so it should go pretty quickly we're
gonna build it over here

42
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
gonna build it over here
 

43
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,830
gonna build it over here
we need to make

44
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840

about 11 wide
 

47
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,630
about 11 wide
um probably about five or seven

back so quite a bit of space is needed
 

55
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,030
back so quite a bit of space is needed
and it's going to house 32 sheep

00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040

 

57
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,950

mode i'll
 

61
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,109
mode i'll
just make a tutorial about it but this

62
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
just make a tutorial about it but this
 

63
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,390
just make a tutorial about it but this
is something i want in my

is something i want in my
 

65
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,749

it's such a complicated build i figure i

68
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
it's such a complicated build i figure i
 

69
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,190
it's such a complicated build i figure i
should probably

70
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
should probably
 

71
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,830
should probably
try to explain it and blab on about it i

72
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
try to explain it and blab on about it i
 

73
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,990
try to explain it and blab on about it i
guess you could say

74
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
guess you could say
 

75
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,590
guess you could say
otherwise it'll probably go over

76
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
otherwise it'll probably go over
 

77
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,990
otherwise it'll probably go over
people's heads and they won't really

people's heads and they won't really
 

79
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,710
people's heads and they won't really
appreciate the intricate details

80
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
appreciate the intricate details
 

81
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,350

you'll see so i'm gonna get tnt and blow

90
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
you'll see so i'm gonna get tnt and blow
 

91

up that area
 

93
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,789
up that area
i also looked around a little bit

94
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
i also looked around a little bit
 

95

the most promising area i found was over

104
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
the most promising area i found was over
 

105
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,190

here
 

107
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,510
here
because it you know it's kind of wide

108
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
because it you know it's kind of wide
 

109
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,670
because it you know it's kind of wide
and it goes far back like that

110
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
and it goes far back like that

and i would have to build it floating in

116
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
and i would have to build it floating in
 

117
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,910
and i would have to build it floating in
the air which would be difficult

118

the air which would be difficult
 

119
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,110
the air which would be difficult
and i don't know this just isn't a very

120
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
and i don't know this just isn't a very
 

121
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,790
and i don't know this just isn't a very
good position for it so

122
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
good position for it so
 

123
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,430
good position for it so
i'm going to mine away the blocks and

124
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
i'm going to mine away the blocks and
 

125
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,470
i'm going to mine away the blocks and
have it

126
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
have it
 

127
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,990
have it
match up with the floor the grass

128
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
match up with the floor the grass
 

129
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,229

just a pen style one really those are
probably the most efficient

150
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
probably the most efficient
 

151
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,589
probably the most efficient
style this one we're going to build

152

style this one we're going to build
isn't very efficient it's more for fun

154
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
isn't very efficient it's more for fun
 

155
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,309
isn't very efficient it's more for fun
and for the cool factor but uh

over
 

231
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,909
over
each of those tnt takes out about a five

232
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
each of those tnt takes out about a five
 

233
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,590
each of those tnt takes out about a five
by five by five

234
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
by five by five
 

235
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,430
by five by five
as i showed in previous episodes not

236
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
as i showed in previous episodes not
 

237
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,710
as i showed in previous episodes not
long ago

238
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
long ago
 

239
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,790
long ago
this is this is where the water lake was

240
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
this is this is where the water lake was
 

241
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,150
this is this is where the water lake was
all right clean up time and i'm

242
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
all right clean up time and i'm
 

243
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,350
all right clean up time and i'm
wondering oh there's tracks

244
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
wondering oh there's tracks
 

245
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,590
wondering oh there's tracks
oh this is unexplored even wow

246
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600

 

247
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,350

i was like is that a slime what is that

248
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
i was like is that a slime what is that
 

249
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,990
i was like is that a slime what is that
that's a grass block

250
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
that's a grass block
 

251
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,070
that's a grass block
hmm i might have to check this out

252
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080

 

253
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,710

what did i fall

254
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720

 

255
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,469

check this out some other day i think it

256
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
check this out some other day i think it
 

257
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,350
check this out some other day i think it
fell there that was weird

258
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360

 

259
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,590

mm-hmm very good very good so that is

260
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
mm-hmm very good very good so that is
 

261
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,790
mm-hmm very good very good so that is
the rough dimensions of this thing

262
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
the rough dimensions of this thing
 

263
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,029
the rough dimensions of this thing
the left wall is going to be over here

264
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
the left wall is going to be over here
 

265
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,550
the left wall is going to be over here
the right wall will be over here okay

266
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
the right wall will be over here okay
 

267
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,830
the right wall will be over here okay
and the floor i'll probably make it

268
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
and the floor i'll probably make it
 

269
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,189
and the floor i'll probably make it
level with

270
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
level with
 

271
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,230
level with
this floor here and remember i said i

272
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
this floor here and remember i said i
 

273
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,790
this floor here and remember i said i
might make a path come up here from

274
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
might make a path come up here from
 

275
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,230
might make a path come up here from
from below

276
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240

 

277
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,790

that will come up to this level so then

278
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
that will come up to this level so then
 

279
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,790
that will come up to this level so then
a few blocks over we'll have the front

280
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
a few blocks over we'll have the front
 

281
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,950
a few blocks over we'll have the front
to the sheep farm

282
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
to the sheep farm
 

283
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,390
to the sheep farm
and this will be the floor level

284
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
and this will be the floor level
 

285
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,749
and this will be the floor level
here so at this height

286
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
here so at this height
 

287
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,110
here so at this height
and then what we're going to need is two

288
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
and then what we're going to need is two
 

289
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,950
and then what we're going to need is two
blocks underneath where we can walk

290
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
blocks underneath where we can walk
 

291
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,430
blocks underneath where we can walk
around

292
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
around
 

293
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,629
around
underneath the floor for the wiring and

294
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
underneath the floor for the wiring and
 

295
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,510
underneath the floor for the wiring and
whatnot

296
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
whatnot
 

297
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,110
whatnot
so i'm gonna have to shave off one block

298
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
so i'm gonna have to shave off one block
 

299
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,309
so i'm gonna have to shave off one block
all the way down there and give my pick

300
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
all the way down there and give my pick
 

301
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,790
all the way down there and give my pick
some use and also

302
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
some use and also
 

303
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,790
some use and also
the shape of this thing is kind of like

304
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
the shape of this thing is kind of like
 

305
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,629
the shape of this thing is kind of like
a dome

306
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
a dome
 

307
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,629
a dome
i can't remember exactly how high it is

308
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
i can't remember exactly how high it is
 

309
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,430
i can't remember exactly how high it is
but i think i'll probably have to

310
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
but i think i'll probably have to
 

311
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,790
but i think i'll probably have to
take off shave off one or two layers off

312
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
take off shave off one or two layers off
 

313
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,270
take off shave off one or two layers off
the top of this yet

314
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
the top of this yet
 

315
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,990
the top of this yet
so here i go

316
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000

 

317
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,110

and we are back so i actually had to

318
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
and we are back so i actually had to
 

319
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,189
and we are back so i actually had to
shave off two layers off the floor and i

320
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
shave off two layers off the floor and i
 

321
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,150
shave off two layers off the floor and i
replaced

322
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
replaced
 

323
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,070
replaced
one of the ones i took off with this new

324
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
one of the ones i took off with this new
 

325
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,950
one of the ones i took off with this new
floor with the soil and the stone bricks

326
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
floor with the soil and the stone bricks
 

327
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,990
floor with the soil and the stone bricks
i have begun using one of my many

328
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
i have begun using one of my many
 

329
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,150
i have begun using one of my many
efficiency 4 picks because my other one

330
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
efficiency 4 picks because my other one
 

331
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,430
efficiency 4 picks because my other one
broke

332
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
broke
 

333
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,909
broke
from all the work and you can see this

334
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
from all the work and you can see this
 

335
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:36,870
from all the work and you can see this
is where

336
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
is where
 

337
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,469
is where
where the floor is going to be we have

338
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
where the floor is going to be we have
 

339
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,550
where the floor is going to be we have
our two block high clearance now

340
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
our two block high clearance now
 

341
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,670
our two block high clearance now
that we need

342
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680

 

343
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,510

and this soil here is for grass

344
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
and this soil here is for grass
 

345
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,629
and this soil here is for grass
maybe we'll just punch a few holes every

346
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
maybe we'll just punch a few holes every
 

347
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,230
maybe we'll just punch a few holes every
so often

348
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
so often
 

349
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,830
so often
we'll put some some of this grass down

350
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
we'll put some some of this grass down
 

351
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,350
we'll put some some of this grass down
um and this is just so

352
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
um and this is just so
 

353
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,830
um and this is just so
we can

354
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840

 

355
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,110

the grass blocks that the the sheep eat

356
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
the grass blocks that the the sheep eat
 

357
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,110
the grass blocks that the the sheep eat
we need the grass to grow back somehow

358
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
we need the grass to grow back somehow
 

359
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,510
we need the grass to grow back somehow
so that's what this is for

360
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
so that's what this is for
 

361
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,990
so that's what this is for
and this will be all underneath the the

362
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
and this will be all underneath the the
 

363
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,830
and this will be all underneath the the
floor of the sheep farm

364
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
floor of the sheep farm
 

365
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,830
floor of the sheep farm
out of sight and

366
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
out of sight and
 

367
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,990
out of sight and
yeah so with this with this design i

368
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
yeah so with this with this design i
 

369
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,189
yeah so with this with this design i
think what i'll do is

370
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
think what i'll do is
 

371
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,430
think what i'll do is
give you the long drawn out details

372
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
give you the long drawn out details
 

373
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,630
give you the long drawn out details
um rambling

374
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
um rambling
 

375
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,110
um rambling

quick
tutorial of it afterwards

382
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
tutorial of it afterwards
 

383
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,149
tutorial of it afterwards
of uh just how to how to build it

384
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
of uh just how to how to build it
 

385
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,190
of uh just how to how to build it
basically not

386
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
basically not
 

387
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,269
basically not
the whole explanation of how it works

388
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
the whole explanation of how it works
 

389
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,430
the whole explanation of how it works
like i plan to do an lp

390
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
like i plan to do an lp

here okay
so now i will show you the shape of the

394
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
so now i will show you the shape of the
 

395
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,190
so now i will show you the shape of the
building this

396
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
building this
 

397
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,430
building this
is let's see what are we gonna do

398
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
is let's see what are we gonna do
 

399
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,829
is let's see what are we gonna do
like i said i've i've got this pretty

400
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
like i said i've i've got this pretty
 

401
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,509
like i said i've i've got this pretty
much all planned out usually i don't uh

402
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
much all planned out usually i don't uh
 

403
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,230
much all planned out usually i don't uh
plan out my stuff for my lp in creative

plan out my stuff for my lp in creative
 

405
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,070
plan out my stuff for my lp in creative
mode beforehand but just with this

406
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
mode beforehand but just with this
 

407
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,710
mode beforehand but just with this
project i have

408
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720

 

409
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,350

and if i do make something creative mode

410
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
and if i do make something creative mode
 

411
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,310
and if i do make something creative mode
i usually will

412
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
i usually will
 

413
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,310
i usually will
just make a tutorial for it like i said

414
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320

 

415
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,750

okay we're going to have half slabs in

416
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
okay we're going to have half slabs in
 

417
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,790
okay we're going to have half slabs in
the middle

418
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800

 

419
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,710

like this and

420
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720

 

421
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,110

like that right

422
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
like that right
 

423
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,790
like that right
yeah okay then

424
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
yeah okay then
 

425
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,310
yeah okay then
i'm gonna grab wood i think i'm gonna

426
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
i'm gonna grab wood i think i'm gonna
 

427
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,990
i'm gonna grab wood i think i'm gonna
make this out of stone bricks for the

428
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
make this out of stone bricks for the
 

429
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,910
make this out of stone bricks for the
floor and wooden or wooden planks for

430
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
floor and wooden or wooden planks for
 

431
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,590
floor and wooden or wooden planks for
the walls

432
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
the walls
 

433
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,269
the walls
we might have yeah one more

434
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
we might have yeah one more
 

435
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,990
we might have yeah one more
one more row of the stone bricks and

436
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
one more row of the stone bricks and
 

437
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,710
one more row of the stone bricks and
then the wall will go

438
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720

 

439
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,430

like that and

440
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440

 

441
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,820

um

442
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:13,830
um
 

443
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:22,710
um
[Music]

444
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720

 

445
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,910

just thinking here

446
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920

 

447
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,829

yeah like that okay then we grab our

448
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
yeah like that okay then we grab our
 

449
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,470
yeah like that okay then we grab our
stairs

450
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480

 

451
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,750

they will go up like that

452
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760

 

453
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,750

this has to go higher yet i

454
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
this has to go higher yet i
 

455
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,269
this has to go higher yet i
think i did full blocks before

456
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
think i did full blocks before
 

457
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,870
think i did full blocks before
and i have no idea how this looks on the

458
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
and i have no idea how this looks on the
 

459
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,910
and i have no idea how this looks on the
large scale i just

460
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920

 

461
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,630

with my with the one i did it was only

462
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
with my with the one i did it was only
 

463
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,949
with my with the one i did it was only
for

464
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
for
 

465
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,829
for
two sheep so i'm curious to see how this

466
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
two sheep so i'm curious to see how this
 

467
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,790
two sheep so i'm curious to see how this
is gonna

468
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
is gonna
 

469
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,790
is gonna
all look and work when it's all done

470
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800

 

471
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,190

yeah this is pretty much a pattern

472
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200

 

473
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,590

we'll do it three wide just to give you

474
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
we'll do it three wide just to give you
 

475
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,430
we'll do it three wide just to give you
a feel for it

476
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
a feel for it
 

477
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,269
a feel for it
to begin with the other side's the exact

478
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
to begin with the other side's the exact
 

479
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,990
to begin with the other side's the exact
same

480
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000

 

481
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,350

i have to be careful there's a lot of

482
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
i have to be careful there's a lot of
 

483
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,829
i have to be careful there's a lot of
mobs around

484
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
mobs around
 

485
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,910
mobs around
grass is growing

486
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:28,920
grass is growing
 

487
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:39,990
grass is growing
and just putting those there temporarily

488
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000

 

489
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,990

yeah that is the pattern so imagine that

490
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
yeah that is the pattern so imagine that
 

491
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,990
yeah that is the pattern so imagine that
all the way down that's what i have to

492
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
all the way down that's what i have to
 

493
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,030
all the way down that's what i have to
do

494
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
do
 

495
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,710
do
and i will probably skip you

496
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
and i will probably skip you
 

497
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,790
and i will probably skip you
or skip showing that on camera because

498
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
or skip showing that on camera because
 

499
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,710
or skip showing that on camera because
it's going to take a while

500
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
it's going to take a while
 

501
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,310
it's going to take a while
but uh i got all the materials ready so

502
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
but uh i got all the materials ready so
 

503
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,990
but uh i got all the materials ready so
and the space cleared out should go

504
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
and the space cleared out should go
 

505
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,990
and the space cleared out should go
fairly quick

506
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000

 

507
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,030

there we go the building is done did not

508
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
there we go the building is done did not
 

509
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,990
there we go the building is done did not
take me very long

510
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
take me very long
 

511
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,990
take me very long
it's a pretty pretty easy to repeat

512
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
it's a pretty pretty easy to repeat
 

513
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,110
it's a pretty pretty easy to repeat
pattern

514
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
pattern
 

515
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,750
pattern
all the way down and we'll need to put a

516
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
all the way down and we'll need to put a
 

517
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,829
all the way down and we'll need to put a
back wall on it yet

518
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
back wall on it yet
 

519
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,949
back wall on it yet
and a front although the front i might

520
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
and a front although the front i might
 

521
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,910
and a front although the front i might
keep

522
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
keep
 

523
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,150
keep
relatively open just so we can see it

524
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
relatively open just so we can see it
 

525
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,990
relatively open just so we can see it
from

526
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
from
 

527
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,269
from
further back like if we're

528
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
further back like if we're
 

529
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,790
further back like if we're
for over here i would like to be able to

530
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
for over here i would like to be able to
 

531
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,389
for over here i would like to be able to
see into the sheep farm to see how

532
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
see into the sheep farm to see how
 

533
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,629
see into the sheep farm to see how
they're doing

534
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
they're doing
 

535
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,230
they're doing
but we'll we'll put the back in the

536
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
but we'll we'll put the back in the
 

537
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,190
but we'll we'll put the back in the
front on towards the end of this project

538
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
front on towards the end of this project
 

539
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,230
front on towards the end of this project
and each of these holes here is for a

540
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
and each of these holes here is for a
 

541
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,790
and each of these holes here is for a
sheep

542
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
sheep
 

543
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,750
sheep
there's 32 sheep total so we'll have

544
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
there's 32 sheep total so we'll have
 

545
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,310
there's 32 sheep total so we'll have
sheep on the right and on the left

546
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
sheep on the right and on the left
 

547
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,590
sheep on the right and on the left
and the pattern goes sheep one

548
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
and the pattern goes sheep one
 

549
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,949
and the pattern goes sheep one
two blocks sheep one two three blocks

550
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
two blocks sheep one two three blocks
 

551
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,629
two blocks sheep one two three blocks
sheep one two sheep one two three

552
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
sheep one two sheep one two three
 

553
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,470
sheep one two sheep one two three
so it goes two three two three two three

554
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
so it goes two three two three two three
 

555
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,590
so it goes two three two three two three
all the way down

556
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600

 

557
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,949

mirrored on that side the sheep are

558
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
mirrored on that side the sheep are
 

559
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,509
mirrored on that side the sheep are
grouped by

560
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
grouped by
 

561
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,629
grouped by
twos so it's a group of two there group

562
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
twos so it's a group of two there group
 

563
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,269
twos so it's a group of two there group
of two there

564
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
of two there
 

565
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,110
of two there
group of two there that's how the

566
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
group of two there that's how the
 

567
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,949
group of two there that's how the
pattern is and i marked it out a little

568
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
pattern is and i marked it out a little
 

569
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,750
pattern is and i marked it out a little
clearer below

570
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
clearer below
 

571
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,750
clearer below
so you can it'll make wiring easier if

572
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
so you can it'll make wiring easier if
 

573
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:19,990
so you can it'll make wiring easier if
we

574
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
we
 

575
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,910
we
can clearly see where the sheep go

576
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
can clearly see where the sheep go
 

577
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,310
can clearly see where the sheep go
and now what we need to do as well is uh

578
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
and now what we need to do as well is uh
 

579
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,629
and now what we need to do as well is uh
right below each of these holes

580
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
right below each of these holes
 

581
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,389
right below each of these holes
punch a hole for the sheep to go into

582
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
punch a hole for the sheep to go into
 

583
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,430
punch a hole for the sheep to go into
one two three

584
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440

 

585
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,870

you can see they're matching up so i'll

586
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
you can see they're matching up so i'll
 

587
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,069
you can see they're matching up so i'll
do that all the way down both sides

588
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
do that all the way down both sides
 

589
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,670
do that all the way down both sides
then we'll be back

590
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680

 

591
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,629

and there we go we got our holes so with

592
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
and there we go we got our holes so with
 

593
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,230
and there we go we got our holes so with
this sheep farm

594
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
this sheep farm
 

595
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,550
this sheep farm
the majority of the time the sheep are

596
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
the majority of the time the sheep are
 

597
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,069
the majority of the time the sheep are
going to be underground here at this

598
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
going to be underground here at this
 

599
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,910
going to be underground here at this
level

600
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
level
 

601
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,069
level
we don't want to see them we want them

602
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
we don't want to see them we want them
 

603
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,750
we don't want to see them we want them
out of sight out of mind

604
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
out of sight out of mind
 

605
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,110
out of sight out of mind
the only time we want to see them is

606
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
the only time we want to see them is
 

607
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,030
the only time we want to see them is
when we want to see them type

608
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
when we want to see them type
 

609
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,470
when we want to see them type
thing and these holes are just so

610
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
thing and these holes are just so
 

611
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,350
thing and these holes are just so
when we pop them up they don't take

612
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
when we pop them up they don't take
 

613
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,430
when we pop them up they don't take
suffocation damage

614
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
suffocation damage
 

615
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,350
suffocation damage
when we when we jam their head through

616
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
when we when we jam their head through
 

617
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,030
when we when we jam their head through
the ceiling you know

618
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
the ceiling you know
 

619
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,470
the ceiling you know
uh this is also how we're going to load

620
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
uh this is also how we're going to load
 

621
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,269
uh this is also how we're going to load
them into ears through these holes

622
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
them into ears through these holes
 

623
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,389
them into ears through these holes
so the next part of this pop-up idea is

624
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
so the next part of this pop-up idea is
 

625
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,790
so the next part of this pop-up idea is
the piston underneath which is

626
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
the piston underneath which is
 

627
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,829
the piston underneath which is
crucial it goes like this right below

628
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
crucial it goes like this right below
 

629
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,430
crucial it goes like this right below
each of these holes

630
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
each of these holes
 

631
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,829
each of these holes
and on top of these is a soil block the

632
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
and on top of these is a soil block the
 

633
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,949
and on top of these is a soil block the
sheep

634
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
sheep
 

635
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,949
sheep
will stand right on top of this soil

636
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
will stand right on top of this soil
 

637
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,870
will stand right on top of this soil
block and since they're a block and a

638
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
block and since they're a block and a
 

639
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,230
block and since they're a block and a
half tall

640
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
half tall
 

641
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,829
half tall
they won't be able to wander off of

642
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
they won't be able to wander off of
 

643
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,310
they won't be able to wander off of
which is very important and we're going

644
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
which is very important and we're going
 

645
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,269
which is very important and we're going
to do that all the way down

646
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
to do that all the way down
 

647
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,189
to do that all the way down
oops so each sheep gets a 3 by 3

648
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
oops so each sheep gets a 3 by 3
 

649
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,829
oops so each sheep gets a 3 by 3
area to itself and two are right next to

650
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
area to itself and two are right next to
 

651
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,030
area to itself and two are right next to
each other

652
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
each other
 

653
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,430
each other
and there's a gap between each group of

654
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
and there's a gap between each group of
 

655
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,069
and there's a gap between each group of
two

656
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079

 

657
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,710

okay so i'll do that all the way down

658
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
okay so i'll do that all the way down
 

659
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,949
okay so i'll do that all the way down
and then we will be back

660
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959

 

661
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,350

all right that is looking very good very

662
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
all right that is looking very good very
 

663
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,350
all right that is looking very good very
good indeed

664
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
good indeed
 

665
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,750
good indeed
so with the pop-up thing i'll just show

666
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
so with the pop-up thing i'll just show
 

667
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,629
so with the pop-up thing i'll just show
you one thing about that

668
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
you one thing about that
 

669
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,069
you one thing about that
this is where stuff gets interesting um

670
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
this is where stuff gets interesting um
 

671
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,949
this is where stuff gets interesting um
so we got the piston right below here uh

672
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
so we got the piston right below here uh
 

673
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,710
so we got the piston right below here uh
the sheep stand on top of the grass

674
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
the sheep stand on top of the grass
 

675
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,470
the sheep stand on top of the grass
block this is what they eat to regrow

676
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
block this is what they eat to regrow
 

677
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,430
block this is what they eat to regrow
their wool too

678
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
their wool too
 

679
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,829
their wool too
it's the only block available to them to

680
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
it's the only block available to them to
 

681
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,030
it's the only block available to them to
eat

682
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
eat
 

683
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,150
eat
um when it's popped up like that though

684
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
um when it's popped up like that though
 

685
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,670
um when it's popped up like that though
we'll be able to see the sheep from this

686
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
we'll be able to see the sheep from this
 

687
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,269
we'll be able to see the sheep from this
level here

688
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
level here
 

689
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,310
level here
but it's only a one block high

690
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
but it's only a one block high
 

691
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,990
but it's only a one block high
thing here they can easily jump out of

692
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
thing here they can easily jump out of
 

693
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,710
thing here they can easily jump out of
that so another very important part of

694
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
that so another very important part of
 

695
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,189
that so another very important part of
this

696
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
this
 

697
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,910
this
is to have a block above that

698
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
is to have a block above that
 

699
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,470
is to have a block above that
so they can't get out but we we don't do

700
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
so they can't get out but we we don't do
 

701
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,230
so they can't get out but we we don't do
that until they're loaded in

702
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
that until they're loaded in
 

703
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,030
that until they're loaded in
so we'll wait on that can use pretty

704
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
so we'll wait on that can use pretty
 

705
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,030
so we'll wait on that can use pretty
much any block for that

706
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
much any block for that
 

707
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,749
much any block for that
i can even use glass or glowstone or

708
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
i can even use glass or glowstone or
 

709
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,269
i can even use glass or glowstone or
anything really

710
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279

 

711
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,470

oops

712
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480

 

713
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,110

okay another really important part of

714
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
okay another really important part of
 

715
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,069
okay another really important part of
this is the way

716
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
this is the way
 

717
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,590
this is the way
grass grows um maybe let's go outside

718
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
grass grows um maybe let's go outside
 

719
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,990
grass grows um maybe let's go outside

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000

 

721
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,749

let's pretend

722

723
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,829

do we have enough space probably let's

724
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
do we have enough space probably let's
 

725
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,110
do we have enough space probably let's
pretend

six high area is where grass will spread

746
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
six high area is where grass will spread
 

747
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,470
six high area is where grass will spread
from

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
from
 

749
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,990
from
the more grass blocks you have

750
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
the more grass blocks you have
 

751
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,390
the more grass blocks you have
the quicker it's likely to spread to the

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
the quicker it's likely to spread to the
 

753
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,470

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,429
soil block
of course there are issues with that you

756
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
of course there are issues with that you
 

757
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,789
of course there are issues with that you
can't just

758
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
can't just
 

759
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,390
can't just
have a big clump of grass blocks like

760
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
have a big clump of grass blocks like
 

761
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,630
have a big clump of grass blocks like
that you need

762
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
that you need
 

763
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,630
that you need
one block air space above each one

764
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
one block air space above each one
 

765
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,230
one block air space above each one
otherwise the grass will just quickly

766
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
otherwise the grass will just quickly
 

767
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,429
otherwise the grass will just quickly
die

768
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
die
 

769
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,950
die
for example but with our setup here

770
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
for example but with our setup here
 

771
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,390
for example but with our setup here
this is what we're doing we have the

772
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
this is what we're doing we have the
 

773
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,990
this is what we're doing we have the
soil block here

774
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
soil block here
 

775
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,710
soil block here
and we have grass one block below so

776
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
and we have grass one block below so
 

777
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,150
and we have grass one block below so
that'll work

778
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
that'll work
 

779
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,950
that'll work
if we had grass where these stone bricks

780
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
if we had grass where these stone bricks
 

781
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,470
if we had grass where these stone bricks
are they would be able to spread

782
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
are they would be able to spread
 

783
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,789
are they would be able to spread
to the soil block below as well but we

784
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
to the soil block below as well but we
 

785
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,750
to the soil block below as well but we
don't want that to happen here

786
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
don't want that to happen here
 

787
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,630
don't want that to happen here
because we're going to be hooking a bud

788
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
because we're going to be hooking a bud
 

789
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,430
because we're going to be hooking a bud
switch up to

790
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
switch up to
 

791
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,789
switch up to
these grass blocks and

792
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
these grass blocks and
 

793
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,350
these grass blocks and
we're using it to detect when the sheep

794
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
we're using it to detect when the sheep
 

795
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,110
we're using it to detect when the sheep
have regrown their wool

796
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
have regrown their wool
 

797
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,789
have regrown their wool
so if where's my lever

798
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799

 

799
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,070

this is extended and a sheep eats it

800
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
this is extended and a sheep eats it
 

801
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,909
this is extended and a sheep eats it
sheep can eat grass even if they have

802
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
sheep can eat grass even if they have
 

803
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,549
sheep can eat grass even if they have
their wool so

804
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
their wool so
 

805
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,669
their wool so
if the sheep is up like that and he eats

806
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
if the sheep is up like that and he eats
 

807
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,870
if the sheep is up like that and he eats
the grass and it's a soil block if we

808
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
the grass and it's a soil block if we
 

809
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,110
the grass and it's a soil block if we
if we have the grass like this it cannot

810
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
if we have the grass like this it cannot
 

811
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,029
if we have the grass like this it cannot
spread to the soil block it's out of

812
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
spread to the soil block it's out of
 

813
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,909
spread to the soil block it's out of
range

814
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
range
 

815
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,630
range
because it can only spread one block up

816
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
because it can only spread one block up
 

817
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,990
because it can only spread one block up
is its limit

818
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
is its limit
 

819
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,909
is its limit
if we had grass above though it would be

820
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
if we had grass above though it would be
 

821
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,830
if we had grass above though it would be
able to spread to it

822
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840

 

823
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,750

which we don't want because it'll mess

824
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
which we don't want because it'll mess
 

825
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,870
which we don't want because it'll mess
up all our

826
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
up all our
 

827
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,390
up all our
our sensing abilities here

828
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
our sensing abilities here
 

829
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,230
our sensing abilities here
that's also why this farm is going to be

830
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
that's also why this farm is going to be
 

831
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,909
that's also why this farm is going to be
inefficient because we don't have very

832
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
inefficient because we don't have very
 

833
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,150
inefficient because we don't have very
many grass blocks around so it'll take a

834
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
many grass blocks around so it'll take a
 

835
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,870
many grass blocks around so it'll take a
long time

836
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
long time
 

837
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,549
long time
for grass to spread to the soil

838
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
for grass to spread to the soil
 

839
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,270
for grass to spread to the soil
so sheep have very little opportunity to

840
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
so sheep have very little opportunity to
 

841
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,390
so sheep have very little opportunity to
eat grass

842
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
eat grass
 

843
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,990
eat grass
because they're only they're limited to

844
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
because they're only they're limited to
 

845
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,230
because they're only they're limited to
the one block and it regrows slowly

846
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
the one block and it regrows slowly
 

847
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,590
the one block and it regrows slowly
but this is mostly just for fun

848
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
but this is mostly just for fun
 

849
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,350
but this is mostly just for fun
i'm going to put some extra lighting

850
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
i'm going to put some extra lighting
 

851
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,150
i'm going to put some extra lighting
down here my

852
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
down here my
 

853
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,590
down here my
my mouse is breaking it's ah i just got

854
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
my mouse is breaking it's ah i just got
 

855
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,029
my mouse is breaking it's ah i just got
this mouse too

856
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
this mouse too
 

857
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,830
this mouse too
same thing that happened my last one if

858
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
same thing that happened my last one if
 

859
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,590
same thing that happened my last one if
i single click it sometimes double

860
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
i single click it sometimes double
 

861
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,950
i single click it sometimes double
clicks

862
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
clicks
 

863
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,470
clicks
it's really annoying

864
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480

 

865
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,909

i want to get rid of these torches down

866
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:23,919
i want to get rid of these torches down
 

867
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,270
i want to get rid of these torches down
here

868
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280

 

869
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,630

all right i hope you guys are ready

870
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640
all right i hope you guys are ready
 

871
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,710
all right i hope you guys are ready
we're gonna do the redstone now and look

872
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
we're gonna do the redstone now and look
 

873
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,270
we're gonna do the redstone now and look
into

874
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
into
 

875
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,390
into
the logic behind this this is the

876
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
the logic behind this this is the
 

877
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,830
the logic behind this this is the
part of this that gave me the most

878
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
part of this that gave me the most
 

879
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,029
part of this that gave me the most
trouble took the longest to figure out

880
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
trouble took the longest to figure out
 

881
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,789
trouble took the longest to figure out
in my first attempt the redstone was

882
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
in my first attempt the redstone was
 

883
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,630
in my first attempt the redstone was
about uh

884
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
about uh
 

885
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,909
about uh
six long by four wide so we would have

886
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
six long by four wide so we would have
 

887
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,950
six long by four wide so we would have
had this spacey

888
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
had this spacey
 

889
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,029
had this spacey
sheep like five blocks apart from each

890
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
sheep like five blocks apart from each
 

891
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,470
sheep like five blocks apart from each
other

892
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
other
 

893
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,630
other
my second attempt the redstone i think

894
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
my second attempt the redstone i think
 

895
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,310
my second attempt the redstone i think
was

896
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
was
 

897
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,510
was
three wide by five long and in the final

898
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
three wide by five long and in the final
 

899
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,750
three wide by five long and in the final
one it is two wide by five long

900
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
one it is two wide by five long
 

901
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,270
one it is two wide by five long
so i managed to compact it quite a bit

902
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
so i managed to compact it quite a bit
 

903
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,950
so i managed to compact it quite a bit
the goal of the sheep farm was to

904
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960

 

905
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,669

have the sheep automatically pop up

906
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
have the sheep automatically pop up
 

907
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,590
have the sheep automatically pop up
right when they regrow their wool

908
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
right when they regrow their wool
 

909
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,870
right when they regrow their wool
that's the only time i want to see them

910
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
that's the only time i want to see them
 

911
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,350
that's the only time i want to see them
i don't want them to pop up

912
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
i don't want them to pop up
 

913
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,710
i don't want them to pop up
if they have no wool on so

914
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720

 

915
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,470

i'm guessing you know how a bud switch

916
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
i'm guessing you know how a bud switch
 

917
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,630
i'm guessing you know how a bud switch
works but if not we'll go over that

918
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
works but if not we'll go over that
 

919
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,470
works but if not we'll go over that
because it's very important to this

920
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
because it's very important to this
 

921
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,909
because it's very important to this
that's what we're using to

922
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
that's what we're using to
 

923
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,470
that's what we're using to
to detect if they have their wool or not

924
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480

 

925
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,390

so if you power a piston diagonally like

926
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
so if you power a piston diagonally like
 

927
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,669
so if you power a piston diagonally like
this

928
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
this
 

929
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,270
this
and then it actually powers the piston

930
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
and then it actually powers the piston
 

931
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,190
and then it actually powers the piston
but it doesn't update until you put a

932
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
but it doesn't update until you put a
 

933
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,750
but it doesn't update until you put a
block next to it

934
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:49,760
block next to it
 

935
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,950
block next to it
and that triggers it doesn't matter how

936
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
and that triggers it doesn't matter how
 

937
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,310
and that triggers it doesn't matter how
many times you do it now it's going to

938
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
many times you do it now it's going to
 

939
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,149
many times you do it now it's going to
stay extended the only time you can

940
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
stay extended the only time you can
 

941
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,149
stay extended the only time you can
cause it to retract is if it's unpowered

942
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
cause it to retract is if it's unpowered
 

943
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,070
cause it to retract is if it's unpowered
and you cause another update

944
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080

 

945
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,070

okay so

946
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080

 

947
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,029

i'm gonna have trouble with this

948
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
i'm gonna have trouble with this
 

949
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,870
i'm gonna have trouble with this
probably i might have to check out my

950
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
probably i might have to check out my
 

951
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,950
probably i might have to check out my
creative world

952
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
creative world
 

953
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,390
creative world
but this is a piston we're going to use

954
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
but this is a piston we're going to use
 

955
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,310
but this is a piston we're going to use
to detect the grass growing

956
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
to detect the grass growing
 

957
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,110
to detect the grass growing
there's going to be two stages to this

958
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
there's going to be two stages to this
 

959
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,710
there's going to be two stages to this
and this is what makes it difficult

960
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
and this is what makes it difficult
 

961
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,549
and this is what makes it difficult
because

962
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559

 

963
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,230

let's say the sheep has no wool right

964
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
let's say the sheep has no wool right
 

965
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,110
let's say the sheep has no wool right
now he's on top of this block

966
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
now he's on top of this block
 

967
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,310
now he's on top of this block
and it's a soil block

968
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
and it's a soil block
 

969
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,830
and it's a soil block
if we made it pop up when grass grew

970
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
if we made it pop up when grass grew
 

971
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,510
if we made it pop up when grass grew
the sheep would be up there but he would

972
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
the sheep would be up there but he would
 

973
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,270
the sheep would be up there but he would
not have any walls so there's actually

974
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
not have any walls so there's actually
 

975
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,350
not have any walls so there's actually
two stages to this

976
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
two stages to this
 

977
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,630
two stages to this
we need to detect the

978
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
we need to detect the
 

979
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,270
we need to detect the
the grass growing and then detect the

980
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
the grass growing and then detect the
 

981
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,029
the grass growing and then detect the
sheep eating the grass

982
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
sheep eating the grass
 

983
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,510
sheep eating the grass
and then it becomes soil again and the

984
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
and then it becomes soil again and the
 

985
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,350
and then it becomes soil again and the
sheep pops up

986
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
sheep pops up
 

987
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,310
sheep pops up
so to do that we actually need a double

988
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
so to do that we actually need a double
 

989
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,909
so to do that we actually need a double
bud switch

990
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
bud switch
 

991
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,390
bud switch
that it does not self reset

992
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400

 

993
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,430

so this is what i came up with um oop

994
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
so this is what i came up with um oop
 

995
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,350
so this is what i came up with um oop
i'm gonna try to polish this up as we go

996
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
i'm gonna try to polish this up as we go
 

997
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,430
i'm gonna try to polish this up as we go
to

998
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440
to
 

999
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,390
to
um this is our first bud switch here

1000
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
um this is our first bud switch here
 

1001
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,350
um this is our first bud switch here
this will detect

1002
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
this will detect
 

1003
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,830
this will detect
the grass growing we have to power it

1004
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
the grass growing we have to power it
 

1005
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,950
the grass growing we have to power it
diagonally

1006
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
diagonally
 

1007
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:37,350
diagonally
so i put that there and then

1008
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360

 

1009
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,149

this is very complicated i think it was

1010
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
this is very complicated i think it was
 

1011
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:40,710
this is very complicated i think it was
here

1012
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
here
 

1013
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,830
here
i had a torch block here block

1014
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
i had a torch block here block
 

1015
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,909
i had a torch block here block
there

1016
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:47,919

 

1017
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,350

torch powers this block goes to the

1018
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
torch powers this block goes to the
 

1019
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,110
torch powers this block goes to the
redstone redstone powers

1020
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
redstone redstone powers
 

1021
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,510
redstone redstone powers
the block here which will cause an

1022
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
the block here which will cause an
 

1023
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,549
the block here which will cause an
update

1024
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559

 

1025
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,750

yes

1026
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760

 

1027
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,669

and it does not itself or it's uh

1028
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
and it does not itself or it's uh
 

1029
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,830
and it does not itself or it's uh
does not reset when we unpower it so

1030
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
does not reset when we unpower it so
 

1031
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,549
does not reset when we unpower it so
that's not good either

1032
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
that's not good either
 

1033
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,190
that's not good either
so then beyond that we're going to use

1034
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
so then beyond that we're going to use
 

1035
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,270
so then beyond that we're going to use
this piston here as our second bud

1036
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
this piston here as our second bud
 

1037
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,390
this piston here as our second bud
switch so it's going to do

1038
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
switch so it's going to do
 

1039
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,789
switch so it's going to do
two things for us it's going to it's

1040
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
two things for us it's going to it's
 

1041
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,830
two things for us it's going to it's
going to be a bud switch

1042
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
going to be a bud switch
 

1043
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,950
going to be a bud switch
to detect when the sheep eats the grass

1044
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
to detect when the sheep eats the grass
 

1045
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,470
to detect when the sheep eats the grass
and it's also gonna when the sheep eats

1046
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
and it's also gonna when the sheep eats
 

1047
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,990
and it's also gonna when the sheep eats
the grass it's gonna cause the update to

1048
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
the grass it's gonna cause the update to
 

1049
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,310
the grass it's gonna cause the update to
the piston and piston is gonna

1050
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
the piston and piston is gonna
 

1051
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,909
the piston and piston is gonna
pop pop the sheep up so it's a pretty

1052
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
pop pop the sheep up so it's a pretty
 

1053
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:34,789
pop pop the sheep up so it's a pretty
fancy

1054
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
fancy
 

1055
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,029
fancy
little piston over there

1056
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039

 

1057
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,070

when that extends it will send power to

1058
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
when that extends it will send power to
 

1059
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,470
when that extends it will send power to
this

1060
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
this
 

1061
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,510
this
wire

1062
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520

 

1063
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,750

and then we power this piston diagonally

1064
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
and then we power this piston diagonally
 

1065
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,789
and then we power this piston diagonally
using this block here

1066
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
using this block here
 

1067
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,470
using this block here
so the redstone goes to that block it's

1068
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
so the redstone goes to that block it's
 

1069
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,990
so the redstone goes to that block it's
powering it diagonally

1070
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
powering it diagonally
 

1071
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,470
powering it diagonally
now if there's an update next to it

1072
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:56,480
now if there's an update next to it
 

1073
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,590
now if there's an update next to it
it'll pop up

1074
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:01,600

 

1075
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,470

and it still does not self self-reset so

1076
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
and it still does not self self-reset so
 

1077
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,590
and it still does not self self-reset so
or it does not

1078
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600

 

1079
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,830

i'm mixing up my phrases here it's

1080
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
i'm mixing up my phrases here it's
 

1081
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,230
i'm mixing up my phrases here it's
it's not doing that until there's an

1082
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
it's not doing that until there's an
 

1083
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,950
it's not doing that until there's an
update

1084
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
update
 

1085
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,190
update
next to it which we have to add yet

1086
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
next to it which we have to add yet
 

1087
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,549
next to it which we have to add yet
otherwise

1088
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
otherwise
 

1089
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,470
otherwise
we will not be able to control this

1090
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
we will not be able to control this
 

1091
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,830
we will not be able to control this
thing after one use

1092
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
thing after one use
 

1093
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,630
thing after one use
so it does that does that

1094
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
so it does that does that
 

1095
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,190
so it does that does that
even if we turn this torch off the

1096
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
even if we turn this torch off the
 

1097
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,990
even if we turn this torch off the
sheep's gonna stay

1098
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
sheep's gonna stay
 

1099
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,230
sheep's gonna stay
up there

1100
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240

 

1101
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,070

yeah so the double bud switch here is

1102
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
yeah so the double bud switch here is
 

1103
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,909
yeah so the double bud switch here is
very important to this design

1104
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
very important to this design
 

1105
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,029
very important to this design
it's not it's not two separate bud

1106
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
it's not it's not two separate bud
 

1107
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,909
it's not it's not two separate bud
switches

1108
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
switches
 

1109
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,710
switches
they're working together this wire only

1110
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
they're working together this wire only
 

1111
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,230
they're working together this wire only
becomes powered

1112
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
becomes powered
 

1113
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,029
becomes powered
when this first one goes off

1114
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039

 

1115
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,549

i trap myself see now it's powered and

1116
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
i trap myself see now it's powered and
 

1117
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,510
i trap myself see now it's powered and
now it's powering

1118
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
now it's powering
 

1119
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,990
now it's powering
the second one diagonally otherwise when

1120
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
the second one diagonally otherwise when
 

1121
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,110
the second one diagonally otherwise when
the grass block

1122
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
the grass block
 

1123
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,549
the grass block
rose originally if they were two

1124
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
rose originally if they were two
 

1125
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,310
rose originally if they were two
separate bud switches they would both

1126
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
separate bud switches they would both
 

1127
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,750
separate bud switches they would both
get triggered at the same time because

1128
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
get triggered at the same time because
 

1129
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,830
get triggered at the same time because
that one's next to it

1130
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
that one's next to it
 

1131
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,510
that one's next to it
and the piston below is right next to

1132
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
and the piston below is right next to
 

1133
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,990
and the piston below is right next to
the block two

1134
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,000
the block two
 

1135
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,230
the block two
oopsies

1136
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240

 

1137
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,390

that's not right

1138
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400

 

1139
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,149

is it emitting light now what the heck

1140
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159

 

1141
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,190

that was weird anyway

1142
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
that was weird anyway
 

1143
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,549
that was weird anyway
glitches in the game the next one here

1144
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
glitches in the game the next one here
 

1145
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,390
glitches in the game the next one here
is going to be the exact same except

1146
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
is going to be the exact same except
 

1147
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,070
is going to be the exact same except
it's mirrored

1148
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
it's mirrored
 

1149
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,190
it's mirrored
so

1150
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,200

 

1151
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,149

weird mirrored mirrored torch goes here

1152
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
weird mirrored mirrored torch goes here
 

1153
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,549
weird mirrored mirrored torch goes here
and then instead of being over on this

1154
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
and then instead of being over on this
 

1155
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,669
and then instead of being over on this
side

1156
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
side
 

1157
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,789
side
the piston would go on this side

1158
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
the piston would go on this side
 

1159
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,549
the piston would go on this side
and do the exact same thing

1160
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
and do the exact same thing
 

1161
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,669
and do the exact same thing
and wire would be on this side

1162
00:25:59,669 --> 00:25:59,679
and wire would be on this side
 

1163
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,950
and wire would be on this side
like that

1164
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960

 

1165
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,230

so yeah it took me a while to figure

1166
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
so yeah it took me a while to figure
 

1167
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,110
so yeah it took me a while to figure
this out

1168
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
this out
 

1169
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,950
this out
and there's more to it yet so don't

1170
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
and there's more to it yet so don't
 

1171
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,310
and there's more to it yet so don't
think this is just it

1172
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
think this is just it
 

1173
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,149
think this is just it
otherwise i could make this wiring a

1174
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
otherwise i could make this wiring a
 

1175
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,470
otherwise i could make this wiring a
little bit smaller yet

1176
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480

 

1177
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,870

okay test it out yes

1178
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
okay test it out yes
 

1179
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,909
okay test it out yes
that's working

1180
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:27,919

 

1181
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,950

good

1182
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960

 

1183
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,190

all right and then just mirror it on

1184
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
all right and then just mirror it on
 

1185
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,110
all right and then just mirror it on
this side and then repeat the pattern

1186
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
this side and then repeat the pattern
 

1187
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,669
this side and then repeat the pattern
all the way down for every four sheep

1188
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
all the way down for every four sheep
 

1189
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,510
all the way down for every four sheep
that's all you gotta do

1190
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
that's all you gotta do
 

1191
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,710
that's all you gotta do
we're gonna jump ahead a little bit here

1192
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
we're gonna jump ahead a little bit here
 

1193
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,750
we're gonna jump ahead a little bit here
and go to there's gonna be an auto

1194
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
and go to there's gonna be an auto
 

1195
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,510
and go to there's gonna be an auto
wool collection system with this too and

1196
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
wool collection system with this too and
 

1197
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,510
wool collection system with this too and
to do that we're gonna get rid of these

1198
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
to do that we're gonna get rid of these
 

1199
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,630
to do that we're gonna get rid of these
two blocks

1200
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
two blocks
 

1201
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,310
two blocks
in between the sheep

1202
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320

 

1203
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,870

on all of these not that one

1204
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880

 

1205
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,070

raining again

1206
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
raining again
 

1207
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,110
raining again
i don't know what it is about the

1208
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
i don't know what it is about the
 

1209
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,029
i don't know what it is about the
minecraft server but it rains on there

1210
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
minecraft server but it rains on there
 

1211
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,789
minecraft server but it rains on there
all the time

1212
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799

 

1213
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,269

okay well we do that for all of them now

1214
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,279
okay well we do that for all of them now
 

1215
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,230
okay well we do that for all of them now
let's just hop down

1216
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240

 

1217
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,909

and then

1218
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919

 

1219
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,510

there's going to be grates

1220
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520

 

1221
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,389

not that way i'm going to use upside

1222
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
not that way i'm going to use upside
 

1223
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,389
not that way i'm going to use upside
down stairs like this

1224
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
down stairs like this
 

1225
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,149
down stairs like this
to make a little bit of a crack for

1226
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
to make a little bit of a crack for
 

1227
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,750
to make a little bit of a crack for
items to fall down

1228
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760

 

1229
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,110

oh it's actually we should probably do

1230
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
oh it's actually we should probably do
 

1231
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,630
oh it's actually we should probably do
that before we do any more wiring

1232
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
that before we do any more wiring
 

1233
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,590
that before we do any more wiring
otherwise

1234
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
otherwise
 

1235
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,710
otherwise
it will be in our way

1236
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:50,720

 

1237
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,149

and we'll do a few on this side and then

1238
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
and we'll do a few on this side and then
 

1239
00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:01,990
and we'll do a few on this side and then
i'll show you how it works

1240
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
i'll show you how it works
 

1241
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,830
i'll show you how it works
okay so we're going to use water to push

1242
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
okay so we're going to use water to push
 

1243
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,630
okay so we're going to use water to push
items into the grating

1244
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,640

 

1245
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,389

this is what it looks like

1246
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:12,399

 

1247
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,669

in between the two sheep

1248
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679

 

1249
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,110

now the thing is if you use a water

1250
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,120
now the thing is if you use a water
 

1251
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,029
now the thing is if you use a water
collection system

1252
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
collection system
 

1253
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,950
collection system
we got to put water

1254
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960

 

1255
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,430

where is it we need one here

1256
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440

 

1257
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,389

one here we'll probably make it come

1258
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
one here we'll probably make it come
 

1259
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,590
one here we'll probably make it come
from the ceiling

1260
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
from the ceiling
 

1261
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,230
from the ceiling
above we'll have a piston that retracts

1262
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
above we'll have a piston that retracts
 

1263
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,230
above we'll have a piston that retracts
to drop water down

1264
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
to drop water down
 

1265
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,029
to drop water down
at our command

1266
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039

 

1267
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,389

and the other one would be

1268
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
and the other one would be
 

1269
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,830
and the other one would be
here i guess so every every that

1270
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
here i guess so every every that
 

1271
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,630
here i guess so every every that
frequency

1272
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,640
frequency
 

1273
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,870
frequency
will have a water drop and

1274
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
will have a water drop and
 

1275
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,710
will have a water drop and
i'll show you

1276
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720

 

1277
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,230

if we had these holes here the water

1278
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
if we had these holes here the water
 

1279
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,750
if we had these holes here the water
would just pour down them it wouldn't

1280
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
would just pour down them it wouldn't
 

1281
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,590
would just pour down them it wouldn't
carry the items to these grates

1282
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:01,600
carry the items to these grates
 

1283
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,630
carry the items to these grates
so in the end of all this we need blocks

1284
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
so in the end of all this we need blocks
 

1285
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,070
so in the end of all this we need blocks
in all these otherwise

1286
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
in all these otherwise
 

1287
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,110
in all these otherwise
the water will just flow down there

1288
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120

 

1289
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,029

we'll cover them temporarily

1290
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039

 

1291
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,149

over here i just want to show you the

1292
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
over here i just want to show you the
 

1293
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,669
over here i just want to show you the
water pattern

1294
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679

 

1295
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:31,909

got two buckets with me

1296
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919

 

1297
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,190

one will go there and

1298
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200

 

1299
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,909

like that it's gotten extremely dark in

1300
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919
like that it's gotten extremely dark in
 

1301
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,389
like that it's gotten extremely dark in
here

1302
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:42,399
here
 

1303
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,870
here
one thing i did not plan with my design

1304
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
one thing i did not plan with my design
 

1305
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,110
one thing i did not plan with my design
is where i'm putting the lighting

1306
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120

 

1307
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,269

so we'll have to figure that out yet

1308
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279
so we'll have to figure that out yet
 

1309
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,549
so we'll have to figure that out yet
because we can't have torches on the

1310
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
because we can't have torches on the
 

1311
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,269
because we can't have torches on the
ground like that

1312
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
ground like that
 

1313
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,310
ground like that
the water will wash it away

1314
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
the water will wash it away
 

1315
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,350
the water will wash it away
excuse me okay so

1316
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,360
excuse me okay so
 

1317
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,870
excuse me okay so
if we

1318
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:04,880

 

1319
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,710

wait a minute is that right

1320
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
wait a minute is that right
 

1321
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,350
wait a minute is that right
something's wrong here something is

1322
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
something's wrong here something is
 

1323
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,310
something's wrong here something is
wrong

1324
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320

 

1325
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,470

the water's in the wrong spot maybe

1326
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480

 

1327
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,230

must be this one

1328
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240

 

1329
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,510

goes here right yeah there we go that's

1330
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:27,520
goes here right yeah there we go that's
 

1331
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,070
goes here right yeah there we go that's
better

1332
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
better
 

1333
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,110
better
i had in the wrong spot so you see the

1334
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
i had in the wrong spot so you see the
 

1335
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,389
i had in the wrong spot so you see the
water emerges together

1336
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:32,399
water emerges together
 

1337
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,230
water emerges together
right at these grates here which is

1338
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
right at these grates here which is
 

1339
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,590
right at these grates here which is
important

1340
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
important
 

1341
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,149
important
if we have a block thrown like that

1342
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:42,159

 

1343
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,350

pretend that's wool

1344
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360

 

1345
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,630

it'll always find its way to that

1346
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
it'll always find its way to that
 

1347
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:56,789
it'll always find its way to that
and it covers the whole room here

1348
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:56,799

 

1349
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,029

okay let's go down and see where they

1350
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
okay let's go down and see where they
 

1351
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,269
okay let's go down and see where they
landed

1352
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279

 

1353
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,190

then we'll probably rig some lighting in

1354
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
then we'll probably rig some lighting in
 

1355
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,190
then we'll probably rig some lighting in
here

1356
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200

 

1357
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,789

so all collect down there and then we'll

1358
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
so all collect down there and then we'll
 

1359
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,789
so all collect down there and then we'll
have water stream here

1360
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
have water stream here
 

1361
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,590
have water stream here
which will get all the wool into a main

1362
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:17,600
which will get all the wool into a main
 

1363
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,950
which will get all the wool into a main
water stream and it'll all

1364
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:18,960
water stream and it'll all
 

1365
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,110
water stream and it'll all
probably flow towards the front of this

1366
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
probably flow towards the front of this
 

1367
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,509
probably flow towards the front of this
farm

1368
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:25,519

 

1369
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,830

the lighting

1370
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840

 

1371
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,149

if we put a light here

1372
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159

 

1373
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,149

the light level 15 if we put a lamp

1374
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
the light level 15 if we put a lamp
 

1375
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,070
the light level 15 if we put a lamp
there be light level 15

1376
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,080
there be light level 15
 

1377
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,350
there be light level 15
down one is 14 13 12 at this block

1378
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
down one is 14 13 12 at this block
 

1379
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,830
down one is 14 13 12 at this block
height

1380
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
height
 

1381
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,350
height
here 12 11

1382
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,360
here 12 11
 

1383
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,950
here 12 11
ten nine eight and that's the farthest

1384
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
ten nine eight and that's the farthest
 

1385
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,350
ten nine eight and that's the farthest
point

1386
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,360
point
 

1387
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,789
point
so it'll that'll work because

1388
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
so it'll that'll work because
 

1389
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,350
so it'll that'll work because
mobs spawn at light levels below eight

1390
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
mobs spawn at light levels below eight
 

1391
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,549
mobs spawn at light levels below eight
so that's just

1392
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559
so that's just
 

1393
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,230
so that's just
barely enough so i'll put lamps every

1394
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
barely enough so i'll put lamps every
 

1395
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,310
barely enough so i'll put lamps every

i mentioned before with the water

1586
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
i mentioned before with the water
 

1587
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,750
i mentioned before with the water
it has has to go over top these holes it

1588
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
it has has to go over top these holes it
 

1589
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,870
it has has to go over top these holes it
can't flow down them

1590
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:54,880
can't flow down them
 

1591

otherwise the automatic wool collection

1592
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
otherwise the automatic wool collection
 

1593
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,630
otherwise the automatic wool collection
will not work in this

1594
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:00,640

 

1595
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,990

so you could put a sign like on that

1596
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,000
so you could put a sign like on that
 

1597
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,430
so you could put a sign like on that
block there right there

1598
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
block there right there
 

1599
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,430
block there right there
and the water would flow over just fine

1600
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
and the water would flow over just fine
 

1601
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,550
and the water would flow over just fine
but the problem is i'm going to

1698
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:28,480
i'm gonna put a block next to that just
 

1699
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,790
i'm gonna put a block next to that just
for now

1700
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:30,800
for now
 

1701
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,829
for now
no that's not gonna work uh how do we do

1702
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:36,839

 

1703
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,430

this

1704
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,440
this
 

1705
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,109
this
i wish you could put levers underneath

1706
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:41,119
i wish you could put levers underneath
 

1707
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,750
i wish you could put levers underneath
blocks

1708
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:43,760

 

1709
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,829

um we need this piston to be moved down

1710
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:49,839

 

1711
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,430

maybe i can get one more

1712
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
maybe i can get one more
 

1713
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,589
maybe i can get one more
just about no places it sideways

1714
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
just about no places it sideways
 

1715
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,589
just about no places it sideways
i guess i'll have to go on top and just

1716
00:40:59,589 --> 00:40:59,599
i guess i'll have to go on top and just
 

1717
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,030
i guess i'll have to go on top and just
do it that way it's kind of a pain

1718
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040

 

1719
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,069

get that down um

1720
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:08,079
get that down um
 

1721
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,109
get that down um
put one filler block in

1722
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119

 

1723
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,349

oh man this is gonna be such a pain

1724
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,359

 

1725
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,190

i forgot to retract it

1726
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200

 

1727
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,109

and one more

1728
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119

 

1729
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,510

just like that so that is a piston is a

1730
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
just like that so that is a piston is a
 

1731
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,430
just like that so that is a piston is a
block that won't suffocate them

1732
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
block that won't suffocate them
 

1733
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,309
block that won't suffocate them
so if they get pushed up into it they'll

1734
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:34,319
so if they get pushed up into it they'll
 

1735
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,829
so if they get pushed up into it they'll
be just fine

1736
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839

 

1737
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,270

for that put this back

1738
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:43,280

 

1739
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,910

then we will have a lamp here to hold

1740
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
then we will have a lamp here to hold
 

1741
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,390
then we will have a lamp here to hold
them

1742
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
them
 

1743
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,430
them
down so they won't climb out so now

1744
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,440
down so they won't climb out so now
 

1745
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,589
down so they won't climb out so now
let's do it again get the idea of the

1746
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:55,599
let's do it again get the idea of the
 

1747
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,550
let's do it again get the idea of the
effect here

1748
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:56,560
effect here
 

1749
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,150
effect here
i'll have to come up with a faster way

1750
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
i'll have to come up with a faster way
 

1751
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,349
i'll have to come up with a faster way
of doing this though of course updates

1752
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,359

 

1753
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:14,390

there's another one it's not suffocating

1754
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400

 

1755
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,750

that's what this sheep farm is going to

1756
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,760
that's what this sheep farm is going to
 

1757
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,589
that's what this sheep farm is going to
look like when they pop up you'll just

1758
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:17,599
look like when they pop up you'll just
 

1759
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,190
look like when they pop up you'll just
be able to see them like that

1760
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
be able to see them like that
 

1761
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,710
be able to see them like that
you can't get out if you shear them

1762
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720

 

1763
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,910

the wool won't fall down into the piston

1764
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:27,920
the wool won't fall down into the piston
 

1765
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,950
the wool won't fall down into the piston
it'll always come

1766
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
it'll always come
 

1767
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,950
it'll always come
on the top i've tested it many times

1768
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
on the top i've tested it many times
 

1769
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,270
on the top i've tested it many times
and also important to note is the wool

1770
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
and also important to note is the wool
 

1771
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,710
and also important to note is the wool
will always land within

1772
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:36,720
will always land within
 

1773
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,069
will always land within
a three by three area

1774
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
a three by three area
 

1775
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,829
a three by three area
or one block away from the piston in all

1776
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
or one block away from the piston in all
 

1777
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,790
or one block away from the piston in all
directions

1778
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800

 

1779
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,430

all right so i gotta do that with all

1780
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
all right so i gotta do that with all
 

1781
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,630
all right so i gotta do that with all
these i gotta get it

1782
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
these i gotta get it
 

1783
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,390
these i gotta get it
gotta get the piston there and the lamp

1784
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:52,400
gotta get the piston there and the lamp
 

1785
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,829
gotta get the piston there and the lamp
here

1786
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:55,839

 

1787
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,589

so doing this actually isn't too bad it

1788
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
so doing this actually isn't too bad it
 

1789
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,670
so doing this actually isn't too bad it
goes quick if you do the whole line like

1790
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
goes quick if you do the whole line like
 

1791
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,109
goes quick if you do the whole line like
this

1792
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
this
 

1793
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,270
this
and then just go up on top

1794
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,280
and then just go up on top
 

1795
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,990
and then just go up on top
i got my levers all down and you just

1796
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,000
i got my levers all down and you just
 

1797
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,790
i got my levers all down and you just
you can pretty much just walk across

1798
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:16,800

 

1799
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,510

pretty quick get them all

1800
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:21,520
pretty quick get them all
 

1801
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,950
pretty quick get them all
go down put another block or or whatever

1802
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:24,960
go down put another block or or whatever
 

1803
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,309
go down put another block or or whatever
you got to do

1804
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319

 

1805
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,150

and that's it so i take that out take

1806
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:30,160
and that's it so i take that out take
 

1807
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,150
and that's it so i take that out take
the piston out

1808
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
the piston out
 

1809
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,710
the piston out
and uh so we got the block here to keep

1810
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
and uh so we got the block here to keep
 

1811
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,230
and uh so we got the block here to keep
the sheet from jumping out we got the

1812
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
the sheet from jumping out we got the
 

1813
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,069
the sheet from jumping out we got the
piston there so the water can flow over

1814
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:38,079
piston there so the water can flow over
 

1815
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,030
piston there so the water can flow over
top

1816
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,040
top
 

1817
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,069
top
and soak in the items and

1818
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
and soak in the items and
 

1819
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,510
and soak in the items and
this doesn't get in the way of the water

1820
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
this doesn't get in the way of the water
 

1821
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,510
this doesn't get in the way of the water
stream it's off the ground

1822
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520

 

1823
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,030

very good the next thing we're going to

1824
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,040
very good the next thing we're going to
 

1825
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,670
very good the next thing we're going to
do here i got some wool prepared

1826
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
do here i got some wool prepared
 

1827
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,030
do here i got some wool prepared
and take it i don't like how when you

1828
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,040
and take it i don't like how when you
 

1829
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,390
and take it i don't like how when you
shift click it goes to the

1830
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
shift click it goes to the
 

1831
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,510
shift click it goes to the
the bottom right

1832
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:03,520

 

1833
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,630

should go in order oh

1834
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
should go in order oh
 

1835
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,390
should go in order oh
get her wool i don't want to mix up my

1836
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
get her wool i don't want to mix up my
 

1837
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,309
get her wool i don't want to mix up my
order this is

1838
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:12,319
order this is
 

1839
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,150
order this is
the way i want it

1840
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160

 

1841
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,150

okay and since there's

1842
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,160
okay and since there's
 

1843
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,430
okay and since there's
room for 32 sheep there are 32 sheep i

1844
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
room for 32 sheep there are 32 sheep i
 

1845
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,630
room for 32 sheep there are 32 sheep i
should say

1846
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
should say
 

1847
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,430
should say
we're gonna have two of each color if we

1848
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
we're gonna have two of each color if we
 

1849
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,870
we're gonna have two of each color if we
want to change it later we can

1850
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
want to change it later we can
 

1851
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,950
want to change it later we can
it's not not a problem and we'll use

1852
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
it's not not a problem and we'll use
 

1853
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,710
it's not not a problem and we'll use
the wool above the the lamps here to

1854
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
the wool above the the lamps here to
 

1855
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,510
the wool above the the lamps here to
indicate

1856
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:37,520
indicate
 

1857
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,589
indicate
what sheep is there because we won't be

1858
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
what sheep is there because we won't be
 

1859
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:48,550
what sheep is there because we won't be
able to see them if they're underground

1860
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560

 

1861
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,790

alright so they're grouped by twos that

1862
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:50,800
alright so they're grouped by twos that
 

1863
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,270
alright so they're grouped by twos that
works out perfect

1864
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280

 

1865
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,829

got them down but after looking at it i

1866
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:57,839
got them down but after looking at it i
 

1867
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,550
got them down but after looking at it i
think i want it reversed

1868
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:00,560
think i want it reversed
 

1869
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,230
think i want it reversed
so i want this and

1870
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:04,240
so i want this and
 

1871
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,870
so i want this and
that way so i have to reverse the order

1872
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
that way so i have to reverse the order
 

1873
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,150
that way so i have to reverse the order
of them all because these ones are more

1874
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,160
of them all because these ones are more
 

1875
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,030
of them all because these ones are more
colorful

1876
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,040
colorful
 

1877
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,550
colorful
they'll look better if the colorful ones

1878
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560
they'll look better if the colorful ones
 

1879
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,190
they'll look better if the colorful ones
are in front

1880
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,200

 

1881
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,109

yeah i prefer this order much more

1882
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119

 

1883
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,109

looks good nice and colorful at the

1884
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:21,119
looks good nice and colorful at the
 

1885
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,430
looks good nice and colorful at the
front uh

1886
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:23,440
front uh
 

1887
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,270
front uh
so you probably guessed it but these

1888
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
so you probably guessed it but these
 

1889
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,990
so you probably guessed it but these
lamps are gonna be our indicator lights

1890
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
lamps are gonna be our indicator lights
 

1891
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,670
lamps are gonna be our indicator lights
that turn on when the sheep grow their

1892
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
that turn on when the sheep grow their
 

1893
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,230
that turn on when the sheep grow their
wall and we're gonna

1894
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
wall and we're gonna
 

1895
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,829
wall and we're gonna
wire that up now we're not done with the

1896
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
wire that up now we're not done with the
 

1897
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,630
wire that up now we're not done with the
redstone yet

1898
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
redstone yet
 

1899
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,190
redstone yet
this is what we do i'm gonna add an

1900
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,200
this is what we do i'm gonna add an
 

1901
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,670
this is what we do i'm gonna add an
extra block here

1902
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680
extra block here
 

1903
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,190
extra block here
so remember the torch is underneath

1904
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
so remember the torch is underneath
 

1905
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,829
so remember the torch is underneath
powers this goes to here

1906
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
powers this goes to here
 

1907
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,190
powers this goes to here
i can't remember i think it's a repeater

1908
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
i can't remember i think it's a repeater
 

1909
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,430
i can't remember i think it's a repeater
yeah repeater redstone dust

1910
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440
yeah repeater redstone dust
 

1911
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,510
yeah repeater redstone dust
can't have those two connect put a block

1912
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,520
can't have those two connect put a block
 

1913
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,750
can't have those two connect put a block
here

1914
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
here
 

1915
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,750
here
if we had the repeater here it would

1916
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
if we had the repeater here it would
 

1917
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,510
if we had the repeater here it would
send power to this block and then down

1918
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
send power to this block and then down
 

1919
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,309
send power to this block and then down
to that wire

1920
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
to that wire
 

1921
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,030
to that wire
which we do not want so this this wire

1922
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,040
which we do not want so this this wire
 

1923
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,270
which we do not want so this this wire
here is important

1924
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,280
here is important
 

1925
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,230
here is important
and then we're gonna have to do more

1926
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,240
and then we're gonna have to do more
 

1927
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,270
and then we're gonna have to do more
digging i

1928
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
digging i
 

1929
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,109
digging i
went through another efficiency for pick

1930
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:17,119
went through another efficiency for pick
 

1931
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,550
went through another efficiency for pick
but don't worry

1932
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,560
but don't worry
 

1933
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,390
but don't worry
i got plenty of them plenty of them

1934
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:22,400
i got plenty of them plenty of them
 

1935
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,589
i got plenty of them plenty of them
not gonna run out um

1936
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599
not gonna run out um
 

1937
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,309
not gonna run out um
so go to this block then we'll put

1938
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
so go to this block then we'll put
 

1939
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,670
so go to this block then we'll put
redstone torch there

1940
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680
redstone torch there
 

1941
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,990
redstone torch there
block above uh we may as well take out

1942
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
block above uh we may as well take out
 

1943
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,870
block above uh we may as well take out
another

1944
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
another
 

1945
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,069
another
layer here

1946
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:38,079

 

1947
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:44,069

we'll just follow it up

1948
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079

 

1949
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,390

okay and then we put another one here

1950
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,400
okay and then we put another one here
 

1951
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,950
okay and then we put another one here
that's two

1952
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:48,960
that's two
 

1953
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:56,309
that's two
and then

1954
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
and then
 

1955
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,670
and then
this goes up to the top of the ceiling

1956
00:46:59,670 --> 00:46:59,680
this goes up to the top of the ceiling
 

1957
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,750
this goes up to the top of the ceiling
or the roof as it's also called

1958
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:03,760

 

1959
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,270

wire goes here there right on top the

1960
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,280
wire goes here there right on top the
 

1961
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,710
wire goes here there right on top the
wool block

1962
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:08,720
wool block
 

1963
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,390
wool block
and now if that's powered it will light

1964
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400
and now if that's powered it will light
 

1965
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,349
and now if that's powered it will light
up the lamp below

1966
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,359
up the lamp below
 

1967
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,510
up the lamp below
so you gotta do that with all of them

1968
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
so you gotta do that with all of them
 

1969
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,430
so you gotta do that with all of them
it's gonna be fun

1970
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
it's gonna be fun
 

1971
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,190
it's gonna be fun
um we can actually test this out now the

1972
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
um we can actually test this out now the
 

1973
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,950
um we can actually test this out now the
other thing this does is it causes the

1974
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:22,960
other thing this does is it causes the
 

1975
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,349
other thing this does is it causes the
update which will

1976
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:25,359
update which will
 

1977
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:31,349
update which will
make it all retract when you reset it

1978
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359

 

1979
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,549

by the way my shovel's gone too

1980
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:36,559

 

1981
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:43,270

sheet pops up let's go check them out

1982
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280

 

1983
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,109

so we'll have to dye them all too the

1984
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
so we'll have to dye them all too the
 

1985
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,309
so we'll have to dye them all too the
colors that we've

1986
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:46,319
colors that we've
 

1987
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,270
colors that we've
picked so he'll be yellow and you can

1988
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:49,280
picked so he'll be yellow and you can
 

1989
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,030
picked so he'll be yellow and you can
see the lamp is on

1990
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
see the lamp is on
 

1991
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,950
see the lamp is on
because he's popped up like that um

1992
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:53,960
because he's popped up like that um
 

1993
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,390
because he's popped up like that um
[Music]

1994

[Music]
 

1995
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,270
[Music]
let's just try this out so if we were to

1996
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
let's just try this out so if we were to
 

1997
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,510
let's just try this out so if we were to
send a pulse to this torch

1998
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:01,520
send a pulse to this torch
 

1999
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,630
send a pulse to this torch
now it actually retracts all of it

2000
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,640
now it actually retracts all of it
 

2001
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,829
now it actually retracts all of it
all the bud switches and everything so

2002
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:07,839
all the bud switches and everything so
 

2003
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,710
all the bud switches and everything so
that's

2004
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
that's
 

2005
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,470
that's
what we want we gotta do it for all of

2006
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
what we want we gotta do it for all of
 

2007
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,030
what we want we gotta do it for all of
them now

2008
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,040

 

2009
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,430

and then i'll be back we gotta we gotta

2010
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440
and then i'll be back we gotta we gotta
 

2011
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,950
and then i'll be back we gotta we gotta

so we will dye them their colors um

2036
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:51,839
so we will dye them their colors um
 

2037
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,910
so we will dye them their colors um
given enough time if these guys ever get

2038
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:53,920
given enough time if these guys ever get
 

2039
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,870
given enough time if these guys ever get
out of whack

2040
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:54,880
out of whack
 

2041
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,910
out of whack
like the sensors they will auto correct

2042
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
like the sensors they will auto correct
 

2043
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,950
like the sensors they will auto correct

2044
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960

because the sheep keep eating and it'll

2046
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,000
because the sheep keep eating and it'll
 

2047
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,069
because the sheep keep eating and it'll
just keep triggering the bud switches

2048
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
just keep triggering the bud switches
 

2049
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,069
just keep triggering the bud switches
until they get to the final

2050
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:06,079
until they get to the final
 

2051
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,150
until they get to the final
stage which is with their head popped up

2052
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
stage which is with their head popped up
 

2053
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,829
stage which is with their head popped up
like this that's the end of the cycle

2054
00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:14,839

 

2055
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,710

so

2056
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:16,720
so
 

2057
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,069
so
the only way uh to reset it is to

2058
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079
the only way uh to reset it is to
 

2059
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,349
the only way uh to reset it is to
unpower that torch let's

2060
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
unpower that torch let's
 

2061
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,150
unpower that torch let's
let's head down quickly

2062
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:30,160
let's head down quickly
 

2063
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,829
let's head down quickly
we got to send a pulse to this and that

2064
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
we got to send a pulse to this and that
 

2065
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,309
we got to send a pulse to this and that
will reset it so they go back down

2066
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
will reset it so they go back down
 

2067
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,670
will reset it so they go back down
and then soil blocks gets grass block

2068
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
and then soil blocks gets grass block
 

2069
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,470
and then soil blocks gets grass block
she beats grass block pops back up until

2070
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
she beats grass block pops back up until
 

2071
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,670
she beats grass block pops back up until
we reset it again

2072
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
we reset it again
 

2073
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,940
we reset it again
that's the cycle

2074
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:43,950
that's the cycle
 

2075
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,309

anyway i'll dye them and uh
 

2079
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,430
anyway i'll dye them and uh
got maybe one or two more things we'll

2080
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
got maybe one or two more things we'll
 

2081
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,910
got maybe one or two more things we'll
do today real quick and call in an end

2082
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920

 

2083
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,270

yeah i forgot to show you guys the top

2084
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
yeah i forgot to show you guys the top
 

2085

here i've been mining it out a bit

2086
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
here i've been mining it out a bit
 

2087
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,150
here i've been mining it out a bit
and i got the wires going to all the

2088
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,160
and i got the wires going to all the
 

2089
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,109
and i got the wires going to all the
wool

2090
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
wool
 

2091
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,430
wool
to all the lamps um

2092
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:07,440
to all the lamps um
 

2093
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,750
to all the lamps um
what we'll have to do is hook up our

2094
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
what we'll have to do is hook up our
 

2095
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,030
what we'll have to do is hook up our
water

2096
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
water
 

2097
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,309
water
thing here we might wait till 1.3 so we

2098
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
thing here we might wait till 1.3 so we
 

2099
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,829
thing here we might wait till 1.3 so we
can

2100
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:15,839
can
 

2101
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,549
can
shoot water out of dispensers because

2102
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
shoot water out of dispensers because
 

2103
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,069
shoot water out of dispensers because
that seems like the simplest way of

2104
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
that seems like the simplest way of
 

2105
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,589
that seems like the simplest way of
doing it

2106
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599

 

2107
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,589

oh yeah check them out man that looks

2108
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
oh yeah check them out man that looks
 

2109
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,589
oh yeah check them out man that looks
cool

2110
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:27,599
cool
 

2111
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,069
cool
we are missing the two hardest to get

2112
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:30,079
we are missing the two hardest to get
 

2113
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,270
we are missing the two hardest to get
colors

2114
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
colors
 

2115
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,630
colors
of course we'll get cocoa beans soon

2116
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640
of course we'll get cocoa beans soon
 

2117
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,230
of course we'll get cocoa beans soon
so i don't mind using them i got three

2118
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
so i don't mind using them i got three
 

2119
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,309
so i don't mind using them i got three
left anyway

2120
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:40,319
left anyway
 

2121
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,510
left anyway
skittles okay

2122
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:43,520
skittles okay
 

2123
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,109
skittles okay
um next thing we're going to do here

2124
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
um next thing we're going to do here
 

2125
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,790
um next thing we're going to do here
let's hook up the reset we'll need

2126
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800
let's hook up the reset we'll need
 

2127
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,710
let's hook up the reset we'll need
buttons for that and we'll have a manual

2128
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:54,720
buttons for that and we'll have a manual
 

2129
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,030
buttons for that and we'll have a manual
reset to this and we'll also have an

2130
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
reset to this and we'll also have an
 

2131
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,230
reset to this and we'll also have an
automatic

2132
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
automatic
 

2133
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,870
automatic
reset using the water system which we'll

2134
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
reset using the water system which we'll
 

2135
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,549
reset using the water system which we'll
add later

2136
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
add later
 

2137
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,630
add later
the manual reset buttons will be over

2138
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:04,640
the manual reset buttons will be over
 

2139
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,190
the manual reset buttons will be over
here so if this guy's popped up

2140
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200
here so if this guy's popped up
 

2141
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,829
here so if this guy's popped up
we shear him he's gotten a wall we

2142
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
we shear him he's gotten a wall we
 

2143
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,510
we shear him he's gotten a wall we
collect the wool and then we hit

2144
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
collect the wool and then we hit
 

2145
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,030
collect the wool and then we hit
the reset button to get him back down

2146
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,040
the reset button to get him back down
 

2147
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,829
the reset button to get him back down
that's the way the manual one works

2148
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:19,839

 

2149
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,790

doing this

2150
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:24,800

 

2151
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,390

and then we gotta hook up the wiring for

2152
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,400
and then we gotta hook up the wiring for
 

2153
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,829
and then we gotta hook up the wiring for
this

2154
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:31,839

 

2155
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,829

right so these buttons are for the

2156
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
right so these buttons are for the
 

2157
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,589
right so these buttons are for the
manual reset there's one per

2158
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
manual reset there's one per
 

2159
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,309
manual reset there's one per
sheep we have that option but there's

2160
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
sheep we have that option but there's
 

2161
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:38,870
sheep we have that option but there's
also

2162
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
also
 

2163
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,910
also
the option for an automatic reset and

2164
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:41,920
the option for an automatic reset and
 

2165
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,470
the option for an automatic reset and
that

2166
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:42,480
that
 

2167
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,390
that
that gets triggered by water falling

2168
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
that gets triggered by water falling
 

2169
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,750
that gets triggered by water falling
down

2170
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760
down
 

2171
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,510
down
and pushing the wool we share from the

2172
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:47,520
and pushing the wool we share from the
 

2173
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,630
and pushing the wool we share from the
sheep into these grates and then

2174
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:50,640
sheep into these grates and then
 

2175
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,549
sheep into these grates and then
before the wool falls into a water canal

2176
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:54,559
before the wool falls into a water canal
 

2177
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,710
before the wool falls into a water canal
it's gonna do this we're gonna have

2178
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:56,720
it's gonna do this we're gonna have
 

2179
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,630
it's gonna do this we're gonna have
fences here

2180
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
fences here
 

2181
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,150
fences here
in between these two things so now we

2182
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:00,160
in between these two things so now we
 

2183
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,750
in between these two things so now we
can't walk through

2184
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:01,760
can't walk through
 

2185
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,150
can't walk through
that's why we do it last so wiring is a

2186
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,160
that's why we do it last so wiring is a
 

2187
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,349
that's why we do it last so wiring is a
little bit easier

2188
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:07,359

 

2189
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,710

um put pressure plates on that

2190
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,720
um put pressure plates on that
 

2191
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,230
um put pressure plates on that
the wool will hit the wooden pressure

2192
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,240
the wool will hit the wooden pressure
 

2193
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,390
the wool will hit the wooden pressure
plates and then fall below

2194
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:14,400
plates and then fall below
 

2195
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,349
plates and then fall below
here so the water canals will probably

2196
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
here so the water canals will probably
 

2197
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,710
here so the water canals will probably
be

2198
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,720
be
 

2199
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,750
be
here and go out this way

2200
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:21,760
here and go out this way
 

2201
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,349
here and go out this way
and then run all along here to the front

2202
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:25,359
and then run all along here to the front
 

2203
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,510
and then run all along here to the front
but we'll wait till we get ice for the

2204
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:27,520
but we'll wait till we get ice for the
 

2205
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,510
but we'll wait till we get ice for the
water canals

2206
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
water canals
 

2207
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,349
water canals
coming out in 1.3 as well

2208
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:33,359
coming out in 1.3 as well
 

2209
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,950
coming out in 1.3 as well
um but these the automatic reset and the

2210
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:36,960
um but these the automatic reset and the
 

2211
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,150
um but these the automatic reset and the
manual reset connect at the same line

2212
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
manual reset connect at the same line
 

2213
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,829
manual reset connect at the same line
so we'll put the repeater up there

2214
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:43,839
so we'll put the repeater up there
 

2215
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,130
so we'll put the repeater up there
see it's triggered um

2216
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:46,140
see it's triggered um
 

2217
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,670
see it's triggered um

00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,470
[Music]
two blocks here

2220
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:52,480

 

2221
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,390

redstone dust there another repeater

2222
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
redstone dust there another repeater
 

2223
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,109
redstone dust there another repeater
going that way and we need the repeater

2224
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119
going that way and we need the repeater
 

2225
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,390
going that way and we need the repeater
because

2226
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:00,400
because
 

2227
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,270
because
this torch goes to this block so if we

2228
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
this torch goes to this block so if we
 

2229
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,950
this torch goes to this block so if we
didn't have the repeater there a dust

2230
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
didn't have the repeater there a dust
 

2231
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,150
didn't have the repeater there a dust
would get powered

2232
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,160
would get powered
 

2233
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,150
would get powered
by this probably and mess things up

2234
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
by this probably and mess things up
 

2235
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,670
by this probably and mess things up
that goes to another block

2236
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
that goes to another block
 

2237
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:20,230
that goes to another block
we'll need some dirt

2238
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240

 

2239
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,349

that goes to redstone dust now

2240
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:23,359
that goes to redstone dust now
 

2241
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:28,470
that goes to redstone dust now
the what you'll call it we'll cheat a

2242
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,480
the what you'll call it we'll cheat a
 

2243
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,589
the what you'll call it we'll cheat a
little bit here

2244
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
little bit here
 

2245
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,990
little bit here
it's right behind here so

2246
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,000
it's right behind here so
 

2247
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,589
it's right behind here so
to use that we're gonna put a block here

2248
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:37,599
to use that we're gonna put a block here
 

2249
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,950
to use that we're gonna put a block here
and again we have

2250
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:40,960
and again we have
 

2251
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,349
and again we have
trouble of our wires getting mixed up

2252
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:45,359
trouble of our wires getting mixed up
 

2253
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,589
trouble of our wires getting mixed up
here so we have to use

2254
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
here so we have to use
 

2255
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,109
here so we have to use
a repeater again i believe

2256
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
a repeater again i believe
 

2257
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,630
a repeater again i believe
maybe i'll double check this i don't

2258
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:52,640
maybe i'll double check this i don't
 

2259
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,109
maybe i'll double check this i don't
know if we do

2260
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:55,119
know if we do
 

2261
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,430
know if we do
yeah because that torch goes to that

2262
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
yeah because that torch goes to that
 

2263
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,790
yeah because that torch goes to that
block so if that was a dust that could

2264
00:53:58,790 --> 00:53:58,800
block so if that was a dust that could
 

2265
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,910
block so if that was a dust that could
get powered

2266
00:53:59,910 --> 00:53:59,920
get powered
 

2267
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,230
get powered
unintentionally uh we'll put a block

2268
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:02,240
unintentionally uh we'll put a block
 

2269
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,430
unintentionally uh we'll put a block
there

2270
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:03,440
there
 

2271
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,829
there
so this repeater powers it from above

2272
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
so this repeater powers it from above
 

2273
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,549
so this repeater powers it from above
for a manual reset and the automatic

2274
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
for a manual reset and the automatic
 

2275
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,109
for a manual reset and the automatic
reset

2276
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:11,119
reset
 

2277
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,829
reset
powers it from below so they both go to

2278
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:13,839
powers it from below so they both go to
 

2279
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,430
powers it from below so they both go to
that dust right there

2280
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440

 

2281
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,150

and it turns out we have hit

2282
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,160
and it turns out we have hit
 

2283
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,549
and it turns out we have hit
what is this the storage room wiring

2284
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:26,559

 

2285
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,910

which might be a problem i hope not

2286
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
which might be a problem i hope not
 

2287
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,950
which might be a problem i hope not
but the goal was to then

2288
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
but the goal was to then
 

2289
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,710
but the goal was to then
yeah it's a problem dang it

2290
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
yeah it's a problem dang it
 

2291
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,910
yeah it's a problem dang it
uh i might have to do a little

2292
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:45,920
uh i might have to do a little
 

2293
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,190
uh i might have to do a little
improvising to make this work now

2294
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
improvising to make this work now
 

2295
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,910
improvising to make this work now
but it shouldn't i know i have a way out

2296
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:51,920
but it shouldn't i know i have a way out
 

2297
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,309
but it shouldn't i know i have a way out
of here

2298
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:52,319
of here
 

2299
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,150
of here
it was very

2300
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160

 

2301
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,030

anyway i'll find it i'll find it i know

2302
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
anyway i'll find it i'll find it i know
 

2303
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,549
anyway i'll find it i'll find it i know
there is one

2304
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:04,559

 

2305
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,829

man that sucks so with these first four

2306
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:07,839
man that sucks so with these first four
 

2307
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,630
man that sucks so with these first four
it looks like our first three anyway

2308
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
it looks like our first three anyway
 

2309
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,030
it looks like our first three anyway
i'll probably have to make some

2310
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
i'll probably have to make some
 

2311
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,390
i'll probably have to make some
adjustments with the wiring it'll

2312
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,400
adjustments with the wiring it'll
 

2313
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,030
adjustments with the wiring it'll
probably be

2314
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,040
probably be
 

2315
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,710
probably be
a bit more sloppy but i'll show you

2316
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
a bit more sloppy but i'll show you
 

2317
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,630
a bit more sloppy but i'll show you
on the right side here instead i got it

2318
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
on the right side here instead i got it
 

2319
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,710
on the right side here instead i got it
set up to where we were

2320
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
set up to where we were
 

2321
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,270
set up to where we were
so that's that's the dust there we have

2322
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
so that's that's the dust there we have
 

2323
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,710
so that's that's the dust there we have
to get that dust

2324
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720

 

2325
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,150

to this torch so what i

2326
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
to this torch so what i
 

2327
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,589
to this torch so what i
think we'll do

2328
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:35,599
think we'll do
 

2329
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,230
think we'll do
take away more wall i actually went

2330
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
take away more wall i actually went
 

2331
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,630
take away more wall i actually went
through

2332
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,640
through
 

2333
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,349
through
pretty much all my picks on today's

2334
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,359
pretty much all my picks on today's
 

2335
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,349
pretty much all my picks on today's
project

2336
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:45,359

 

2337
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:52,390

and do a spiral staircase down

2338
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400

 

2339
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,250

to

2340
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:53,260
to
 

2341
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:58,390
to
[Music]

2342
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:58,400

 

2343
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,510

at least here um

2344
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
at least here um
 

2345
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,710
at least here um
where's the torch i think it's

2346
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:04,720
where's the torch i think it's
 

2347
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,109
where's the torch i think it's
it's on this side so we got we want it

2348
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:07,119
it's on this side so we got we want it
 

2349
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,750
it's on this side so we got we want it
to go to the inside

2350
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760

 

2351
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,670

but i think

2352
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680

 

2353
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,349

yeah this is what we'll do

2354
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:19,359

 

2355
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,390

we have to be careful because

2356
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:22,400
we have to be careful because
 

2357
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,390
we have to be careful because
we do have to set up water canals yet

2358
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,400
we do have to set up water canals yet
 

2359
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,990
we do have to set up water canals yet
and they will probably have to go down

2360
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
and they will probably have to go down
 

2361
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,750
and they will probably have to go down
one block otherwise the water will flow

2362
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:27,760
one block otherwise the water will flow
 

2363
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,069
one block otherwise the water will flow
into that wire and we need

2364
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079
into that wire and we need
 

2365
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,430
into that wire and we need
this part here

2366
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:35,440

 

2367
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,710

so water will probably go here we can't

2368
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
so water will probably go here we can't
 

2369
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,430
so water will probably go here we can't
have

2370
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
have
 

2371
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,150
have
like wire here either for example we'll

2372
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
like wire here either for example we'll
 

2373
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,390
like wire here either for example we'll
have to make sure there's a wall there

2374
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
have to make sure there's a wall there
 

2375
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:56,069
have to make sure there's a wall there
so this will go down

2376
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079

 

2377
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,109

like this maybe we'll do a torch

2378
00:56:59,109 --> 00:56:59,119
like this maybe we'll do a torch
 

2379
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,710
like this maybe we'll do a torch
let's see where this goes i think this

2380
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:00,720
let's see where this goes i think this
 

2381
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,109
let's see where this goes i think this
will go to the torch

2382
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:03,119
will go to the torch
 

2383
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,430
will go to the torch
and hopefully we gotta be careful not to

2384
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
and hopefully we gotta be careful not to
 

2385
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,589
and hopefully we gotta be careful not to
interfere with anything else so

2386
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599

 

2387
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:21,750

i hate to mess up the grass

2388
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:21,760

 

2389
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,670

yeah that should work we went a little

2390
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:23,680
yeah that should work we went a little
 

2391
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:30,069
yeah that should work we went a little
bit too far

2392
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079

 

2393
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,270

we'll put a torch here

2394
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
we'll put a torch here
 

2395
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,950
we'll put a torch here
then we will put i always have to do

2396
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960

 

2397
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,430

or make my wire path something else just

2398
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
or make my wire path something else just
 

2399
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,309
or make my wire path something else just
so i know

2400
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:42,319
so i know
 

2401
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:47,589
so i know
in case it gets washed away or something

2402
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599

 

2403
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,309

is that right we might have to invert it

2404
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
is that right we might have to invert it
 

2405
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,789
is that right we might have to invert it
yet i don't know

2406
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:52,799
yet i don't know
 

2407
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,470
yet i don't know
no it's powered sweet

2408
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:56,480
no it's powered sweet
 

2409
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,910
no it's powered sweet
okay so we'll clean this up

2410
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
okay so we'll clean this up
 

2411
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,069
okay so we'll clean this up
and i think that's good

2412
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
and i think that's good
 

2413
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,829
and i think that's good
don't think that interfered with

2414
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:06,839
don't think that interfered with
 

2415
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:08,069
don't think that interfered with
anything

2416
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
anything
 

2417
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,270
anything
go up top and we'll try it out uh let's

2418
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,280
go up top and we'll try it out uh let's
 

2419
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,710
go up top and we'll try it out uh let's
force some updates first

2420
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:16,720

 

2421
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,510

this one first

2422
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:21,520

 

2423
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,230

and this one okay our sheep is up there

2424
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
and this one okay our sheep is up there
 

2425
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,390
and this one okay our sheep is up there
let's see if the reset works

2426
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400

 

2427
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,829

uh maybe we'll shear him even don't have

2428
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:34,839

 

2429
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:40,710

shears

2430
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:40,720

 

2431
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,349

the orange ones look yellow call me

2432
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:43,359
the orange ones look yellow call me
 

2433
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:44,069
the orange ones look yellow call me
crazy

2434
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:44,079
crazy
 

2435
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,510
crazy
but they really do tell me this works

2436
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:49,520

 

2437
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,670

oh that's so beautiful

2438
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:53,680

 

2439
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:58,069

and the pistons got reset yep

2440
00:58:58,069 --> 00:58:58,079

 

2441
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,990

so now uh when that grass block grows

2442
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,000
so now uh when that grass block grows
 

2443
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,870
so now uh when that grass block grows
the first piston triggers the first bud

2444
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:04,880
the first piston triggers the first bud
 

2445
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,870
the first piston triggers the first bud
that preps the second one

2446
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:06,880
that preps the second one
 

2447
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,670
that preps the second one
when the second one goes off uh the

2448
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:09,680
when the second one goes off uh the
 

2449
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,270
when the second one goes off uh the
sheep goes up

2450
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
sheep goes up
 

2451
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,549
sheep goes up
pop-up sheep farm that's the idea

2452
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:14,559
pop-up sheep farm that's the idea
 

2453
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,270
pop-up sheep farm that's the idea
so that's as much as we're doing today

2454
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,280
so that's as much as we're doing today
 

2455
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,990
so that's as much as we're doing today
this episode's probably an hour already

2456
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,000
this episode's probably an hour already
 

2457
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,990
this episode's probably an hour already
i'm sorry i wanted to show it all

2458
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,000
i'm sorry i wanted to show it all
 

2459
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,750
i'm sorry i wanted to show it all
working in

2460
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:23,760
working in
 

2461
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,150
working in
and everything but we'll continue on

2462
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
and everything but we'll continue on
 

2463
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,349
and everything but we'll continue on
next episode

2464
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
next episode
 

2465
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,950
next episode
most likely there's a few other

2466
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:30,960
most likely there's a few other
 

2467
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,789
most likely there's a few other
things i would like to do with this

2468
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799

 

2469
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,990

but i'll try to get the wiring done

2470
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,000
but i'll try to get the wiring done
 

2471
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,589
but i'll try to get the wiring done
afterwards here and next episode we'll

2472
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:41,599
afterwards here and next episode we'll
 

2473
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,510
afterwards here and next episode we'll
we'll take a better look at everything

2474
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
we'll take a better look at everything
 

2475
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,109
we'll take a better look at everything
and then afterwards

2476
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
and then afterwards
 

2477
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,950
and then afterwards
sometime i'll try to make a tutorial for

2478
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:46,960
sometime i'll try to make a tutorial for
 

2479
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,150
sometime i'll try to make a tutorial for
this that

2480
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:48,160
this that
 

2481
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,549
this that
shows you how to build it in only a few

2482
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:50,559
shows you how to build it in only a few
 

2483
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,829
shows you how to build it in only a few
minutes instead of

2484
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:51,839
minutes instead of
 

2485
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,630
minutes instead of
a whole hour or whatever and there's

2486
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640
a whole hour or whatever and there's
 

2487
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,549
a whole hour or whatever and there's
also a bunch of simpler ways

2488
00:59:56,549 --> 00:59:56,559
also a bunch of simpler ways
 

2489
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,270
also a bunch of simpler ways
you can set this up too the whole pop-up

2490
00:59:59,270 --> 00:59:59,280
you can set this up too the whole pop-up
 

2491
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,309
you can set this up too the whole pop-up
thing is

2492
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:00,319
thing is
 

2493
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,630
thing is
is my favorite part of it um you don't

2494
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
is my favorite part of it um you don't
 

2495
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,349
is my favorite part of it um you don't
have to have detection and lights and

2496
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
have to have detection and lights and
 

2497
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:08,069
have to have detection and lights and
and everything there's much much simpler

2498
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
and everything there's much much simpler
 

2499
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,470
and everything there's much much simpler
ways of doing a cool farm with this idea

2500
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:12,480

 

2501
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,549

but this this is the coolest way in my

2502
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:14,559
but this this is the coolest way in my
 

2503
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,829
but this this is the coolest way in my
opinion

2504
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:15,839
opinion
 

2505
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,990
opinion
