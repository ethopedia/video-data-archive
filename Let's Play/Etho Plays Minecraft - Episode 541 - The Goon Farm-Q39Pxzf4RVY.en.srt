also had to take a few breaks while

74
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,430
also had to take a few breaks while
 

75
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,770
also had to take a few breaks while
building this because I was starting to

76
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:33,780
building this because I was starting to
 

77
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,289
building this because I was starting to
get that carpal tunnel feeling and my my

get that carpal tunnel feeling and my my
 

79

get that carpal tunnel feeling and my my
risk from placing so many blocks so I

80
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:39,299
risk from placing so many blocks so I
 

81
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,910
risk from placing so many blocks so I
had a bit of a tough time deciding near

had a bit of a tough time deciding near
what to do because I felt like there was

84
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,570
what to do because I felt like there was
 

85
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,350
what to do because I felt like there was
three main options to choose for what to

86
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
three main options to choose for what to
 

87
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,210
three main options to choose for what to
do with our nether tunnels number one

88
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,220
do with our nether tunnels number one
 

89
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,310
do with our nether tunnels number one
being just continue the original perper

design we had here I wanted to stop

92
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
design we had here I wanted to stop
 

93
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,690
design we had here I wanted to stop
using this because perper is actually a

94
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:53,700
using this because perper is actually a
 

95
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,440
using this because perper is actually a
real pain to collect like you gotta even

though we got a big firm for it you

98
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:58,649
though we got a big firm for it you
 

99
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,819
though we got a big firm for it you
still got a smelt it you're gonna craft

100
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:01,829
still got a smelt it you're gonna craft
 

101
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,410
still got a smelt it you're gonna craft
it you got to replant it all that kind

102
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:03,420
it you got to replant it all that kind
 

103
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,730
it you got to replant it all that kind
of stuff I think the easiest way of

104
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:04,740
of stuff I think the easiest way of
 

105
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,289
of stuff I think the easiest way of
collecting it is actually just to set up

106
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:06,299
collecting it is actually just to set up
 

107
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,710
collecting it is actually just to set up
a speed mining beacon at a and fortress

a speed mining beacon at a and fortress
 

109
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,559

and just plow it down but even still

110
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:12,569
and just plow it down but even still
 

111
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,350
and just plow it down but even still
that's

112
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
that's
 

113
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,940
that's
a lot of work I also didn't like how I

114
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:14,950
a lot of work I also didn't like how I
 

115
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,830
a lot of work I also didn't like how I
use solid glass here that's a lot more

116
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:16,840
use solid glass here that's a lot more
 

117
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,080
use solid glass here that's a lot more
resources compared to like using glass

118
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,090
resources compared to like using glass
 

119
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,030

panes which is what we ended up

120
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
panes which is what we ended up
 

121
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,610
panes which is what we ended up
upgrading to here and also we're using

122
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:23,620
upgrading to here and also we're using
 

123
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,100
upgrading to here and also we're using
three wide packed ice and Pat dice is

124
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,110
three wide packed ice and Pat dice is

only 40 bucks per second travel speed by

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:28,750
only 40 bucks per second travel speed by
 

127
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,590
only 40 bucks per second travel speed by
boat while blue ice what we upgraded to

128
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:31,600
boat while blue ice what we upgraded to
 

129
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,080
boat while blue ice what we upgraded to
here is 60 blocks per second so that's

130
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,090
here is 60 blocks per second so that's
 

131
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,820
here is 60 blocks per second so that's
the time and half quicker and that is a

132
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,830
the time and half quicker and that is a
 

133
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,010
the time and half quicker and that is a
big deal when you're going a long

134
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,020
big deal when you're going a long
 

135
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,770
big deal when you're going a long
distance like we are here so second

136
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:40,780
distance like we are here so second
 

137
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,270
distance like we are here so second
option was to upgrade our tunnel which

138
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,280
option was to upgrade our tunnel which
 

139
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,699
option was to upgrade our tunnel which
is what we chose but the third option is

140
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:44,709
is what we chose but the third option is
 

141
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,530
is what we chose but the third option is
we could have just flew around the

142
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:46,540
we could have just flew around the
 

143
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,449
we could have just flew around the
nether ceiling now like portals connects

144
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:48,459
nether ceiling now like portals connects
 

145
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,070
nether ceiling now like portals connects
from the nether ceiling you don't

146
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
from the nether ceiling you don't
 

147
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
from the nether ceiling you don't
actually need to make nether tunnels

148
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,370
actually need to make nether tunnels
 

149
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,790
actually need to make nether tunnels
anymore but I decided to still go with

150
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:53,800
anymore but I decided to still go with
 

151
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,400
anymore but I decided to still go with
the tunnels because I wanted the blue

152
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,410
the tunnels because I wanted the blue
 

153
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,620
the tunnels because I wanted the blue
ice it's a faster way of traveling

154
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:58,630
ice it's a faster way of traveling
 

155
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,750
ice it's a faster way of traveling
compared to Rockets I think in general

156
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:00,760
compared to Rockets I think in general
 

157
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,770
compared to Rockets I think in general
and also we have the option now to carry

158
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:04,780
and also we have the option now to carry
 

159
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,470
and also we have the option now to carry
mobs around through our nether by boat

160
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:07,480
mobs around through our nether by boat
 

161
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,600
mobs around through our nether by boat
which i think was better while if we

162
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:09,610
which i think was better while if we
 

163
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,210
which i think was better while if we
were flying around the roof and we want

164
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,220
were flying around the roof and we want
 

165
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,160
were flying around the roof and we want
to move a mob around we still have a big

166
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,170
to move a mob around we still have a big
 

167
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,160
to move a mob around we still have a big
problem so as you saw there we need a

168
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,170
problem so as you saw there we need a
 

169
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,810
problem so as you saw there we need a
lot of power rails that's one of our big

170
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:18,820
lot of power rails that's one of our big
 

171
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,340
lot of power rails that's one of our big
problems right now and then I this is

172
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,350
problems right now and then I this is
 

173
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,080
problems right now and then I this is

197
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,340

this is also a newly generated area for

this is also a newly generated area for
 

199
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,860
this is also a newly generated area for
me so I got pretty excited when I saw

this this is a bamboo jungle the very

202
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,050
this this is a bamboo jungle the very
 

203
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,890
this this is a bamboo jungle the very
first one I found and I was hoping we

204
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:01,900
first one I found and I was hoping we
 

205
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,080
first one I found and I was hoping we
would find pandas and I looked through

206
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,090
would find pandas and I looked through
 

207
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,290
would find pandas and I looked through
here and I can't find any though which

208
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,300
here and I can't find any though which
 

209
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,760
here and I can't find any though which
is a little bit disappointing I think

210
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:08,770
is a little bit disappointing I think
 

211
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,870
is a little bit disappointing I think
cuz we're unamplified

212
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:09,880
cuz we're unamplified
 

213
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,010
cuz we're unamplified
it messes up some of the passive mob

214
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,020
it messes up some of the passive mob
 

215
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,870
it messes up some of the passive mob
spawning like they only spawn at certain

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:15,880
spawning like they only spawn at certain
 

217
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,550
spawning like they only spawn at certain
levels I'm guessing and because most the

218
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:17,560
levels I'm guessing and because most the
 

219
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,670
levels I'm guessing and because most the
terrain is amplified up high there's

220
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:20,680
terrain is amplified up high there's
 

221
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,770
terrain is amplified up high there's
very little area where new mobs can

222
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:22,780
very little area where new mobs can
 

223
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,409
very little area where new mobs can
actually spawn oh well we only need two

224
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:25,419
actually spawn oh well we only need two
 

225
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,510

we'll find them eventually I gotta say I
 

227
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,670
we'll find them eventually I gotta say I
do really enjoy the amplifi terrain

228
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
do really enjoy the amplifi terrain
 

229
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,260
do really enjoy the amplifi terrain
still though like it's so much fun to

230
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,270
still though like it's so much fun to
 

231
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,750
still though like it's so much fun to
explore this stuff look at this this is

232
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:33,760
explore this stuff look at this this is
 

233
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,650

so cool and now I got a computer they

234
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:37,660
so cool and now I got a computer they
 

235
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:44,869
so cool and now I got a computer they
didn't actually handle it

236
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:44,879

 

237
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,449

well we only got one rocket left here we

238
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:47,459
well we only got one rocket left here we
 

239
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,179
well we only got one rocket left here we
got to make it count straight up and

240
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:50,189
got to make it count straight up and
 

241
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:56,379
got to make it count straight up and
over and we made it awesome okay 40

242
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:56,389
over and we made it awesome okay 40
 

243
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,059
over and we made it awesome okay 40
Rockets excellent so there's also a

244
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:02,069
Rockets excellent so there's also a
 

245
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,399
Rockets excellent so there's also a
giant desert by that frozen ocean so I'm

246
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,409
giant desert by that frozen ocean so I'm
 

247
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,559
giant desert by that frozen ocean so I'm
probably gonna make that my new sand

248
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:06,569
probably gonna make that my new sand
 

249
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:08,359
probably gonna make that my new sand
mining outpost because the other one we

250
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:08,369
mining outpost because the other one we
 

251
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:11,179
mining outpost because the other one we
were using is running out actually we're

252
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:11,189
were using is running out actually we're
 

253
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:12,829
were using is running out actually we're
gonna smelt that up into some glass for

254
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:12,839
gonna smelt that up into some glass for
 

255
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,689
gonna smelt that up into some glass for
the blue glass of the tunnels

256
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:14,699
the blue glass of the tunnels
 

257
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,879
the blue glass of the tunnels
oh man I'm actually pretty excited about

258
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:16,889
oh man I'm actually pretty excited about

this it's been months I think since we
 

261
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,219
this it's been months I think since we
last had to fire up our lab here today's

262
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:22,229
last had to fire up our lab here today's

00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,289
yeah Here I am oh man oh snappers we got
 

323
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,739
yeah Here I am oh man oh snappers we got
it done here we actually got it done and

324
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:36,749
it done here we actually got it done and
 

325
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:40,399
it done here we actually got it done and
I am so happy this is gonna be huge for

326
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:40,409
I am so happy this is gonna be huge for
 

327
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,989
I am so happy this is gonna be huge for
our world having this road ah man so it

328
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:44,999
our world having this road ah man so it
 

329
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,709
our world having this road ah man so it
comes out at minus 1,000 minus 3,500 so

330
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:48,719
comes out at minus 1,000 minus 3,500 so
 

331
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,779
comes out at minus 1,000 minus 3,500 so
that is that our crimson key area here

332
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:50,789
that is that our crimson key area here
 

333
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,609
that is that our crimson key area here
you might be thinking II thought you

334
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:52,619
you might be thinking II thought you
 

335
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,290
you might be thinking II thought you
know that seems a bit crazy to build a

336
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,300
know that seems a bit crazy to build a
 

337
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,850
know that seems a bit crazy to build a
tunnel just to get to your trims and

338
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:55,860
tunnel just to get to your trims and
 

339
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,040
tunnel just to get to your trims and
keep that's not just what it's for this

340
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,050
keep that's not just what it's for this
 

341
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,399
keep that's not just what it's for this
gives us

342
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:58,409
gives us
 

343
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:01,879
gives us
a big range of area in our overworld

344
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:01,889
a big range of area in our overworld
 

345
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,459
a big range of area in our overworld
that we can cover now so like with all

346
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:04,469
that we can cover now so like with all
 

347
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,199
that we can cover now so like with all
our another tunnels we didn't cover over

348
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,209
our another tunnels we didn't cover over
 

349
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,999
our another tunnels we didn't cover over
like a 50,000 block area in the

350
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:08,009
like a 50,000 block area in the
 

351
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,429
like a 50,000 block area in the
overworld so when new content comes out

352
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:10,439
overworld so when new content comes out
 

353
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,829
overworld so when new content comes out
in the game there's a good chance it's

354
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:12,839
in the game there's a good chance it's
 

355
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,999
in the game there's a good chance it's
gonna be reachable now

356
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:14,009
gonna be reachable now
 

357
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,139
gonna be reachable now
oh yeah and I'll give you guys a view

358
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:15,149
oh yeah and I'll give you guys a view
 

359
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,489
oh yeah and I'll give you guys a view
from the outside as well because I think

360
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:16,499
from the outside as well because I think
 

361
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,729
from the outside as well because I think
it looks pretty cool on the outside too

362
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:18,739
it looks pretty cool on the outside too
 

363
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,589
it looks pretty cool on the outside too
I'm happy with that it's not like I'm

364
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
I'm happy with that it's not like I'm
 

365
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,899
I'm happy with that it's not like I'm
gonna build the support posts or

366
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:23,909
gonna build the support posts or
 

367
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,429
gonna build the support posts or
anything for it though that's getting

368
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:25,439
anything for it though that's getting
 

369
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,040
anything for it though that's getting
too crazy I wanted to try to keep the

370
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,050
too crazy I wanted to try to keep the
 

371
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,719
too crazy I wanted to try to keep the
tunnel as simple as I could while still

372
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:29,729
tunnel as simple as I could while still
 

373
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,939
tunnel as simple as I could while still
keeping it as detailed as I could so

374
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:31,949
keeping it as detailed as I could so
 

375
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,819
keeping it as detailed as I could so
it's just five blocks tall so that's ten

376
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:34,829
it's just five blocks tall so that's ten
 

377
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,819
it's just five blocks tall so that's ten
and then three connecting on the top and

378
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:37,829
and then three connecting on the top and
 

379
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,589
and then three connecting on the top and
bottom so that's sixteen blocks every

380
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
bottom so that's sixteen blocks every
 

381
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,209
bottom so that's sixteen blocks every
one block of space you want to move

382
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:41,219
one block of space you want to move
 

383
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:44,329
one block of space you want to move
forward more detailed tunnels obviously

384
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:44,339
forward more detailed tunnels obviously
 

385
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,489
forward more detailed tunnels obviously
will look better but that adds so much

386
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:46,499
will look better but that adds so much
 

387
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,679
will look better but that adds so much
more work every single block you add to

388
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:48,689
more work every single block you add to
 

389
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:51,169
more work every single block you add to
it yeah so I said it's done but it's not

390
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:51,179
it yeah so I said it's done but it's not
 

391
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,699
it yeah so I said it's done but it's not
actually done we're missing the power

392
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:52,709
actually done we're missing the power
 

393
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,769
actually done we're missing the power
rails for about two thousand blocks of

394
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:54,779
rails for about two thousand blocks of
 

395
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,629
rails for about two thousand blocks of
the tunnel right now so we got to get

396
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
the tunnel right now so we got to get
 

397
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,419
the tunnel right now so we got to get
those somehow and as you can see they

398
00:07:59,419 --> 00:07:59,429
those somehow and as you can see they
 

399
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:03,169
those somehow and as you can see they
are super important because without them

400
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:03,179
are super important because without them
 

401
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,329
are super important because without them
you get mob spotting on the tunnel on

402
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:05,339
you get mob spotting on the tunnel on
 

403
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,239
you get mob spotting on the tunnel on
the ice here and that means we need gold

404
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:08,249
the ice here and that means we need gold
 

405
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:10,489
the ice here and that means we need gold
everybody lots and lots of gold for the

406
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:10,499
everybody lots and lots of gold for the
 

407
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:16,069
everybody lots and lots of gold for the
power rails oh he's getting out we could

408
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:16,079
power rails oh he's getting out we could
 

409
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,480
power rails oh he's getting out we could
just use gold farm number three we

410
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,490
just use gold farm number three we
 

411
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,429
just use gold farm number three we
recently fixed that up and it is working

412
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:19,439
recently fixed that up and it is working
 

413
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,279
recently fixed that up and it is working
again but I got to thinking what about

414
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,289
again but I got to thinking what about
 

415
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,119
again but I got to thinking what about
gold from number two guys this could be

416
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,129
gold from number two guys this could be
 

417
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,559
gold from number two guys this could be
one of the most perfect projects we

418
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:27,569
one of the most perfect projects we
 

419
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,719
one of the most perfect projects we
could ever do actually so let me try

420
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:29,729
could ever do actually so let me try
 

421
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:30,649
could ever do actually so let me try
explain this to you

422
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:30,659
explain this to you
 

423
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,600
explain this to you
gold farm number two here is actually

424
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,610
gold farm number two here is actually
 

425
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,639
gold farm number two here is actually
broken it broke a long time ago because

426
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:34,649
broken it broke a long time ago because
 

427
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,089
broken it broke a long time ago because
some game mechanics changed before we

428
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:38,099
some game mechanics changed before we
 

429
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,969
some game mechanics changed before we
had some iron golems in here we just

430
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:40,979
had some iron golems in here we just
 

431
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,699
had some iron golems in here we just
manually spun them in and they would

432
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:43,709
manually spun them in and they would
 

433
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,240
manually spun them in and they would
attack the zombie pigmen and the zombie

434
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,250
attack the zombie pigmen and the zombie
 

435
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,559
attack the zombie pigmen and the zombie
pigmen weren't able to hurt the iron

436
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:48,569
pigmen weren't able to hurt the iron
 

437
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,509
pigmen weren't able to hurt the iron
golem before so they would just kill all

438
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
golem before so they would just kill all
 

439
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,319
golem before so they would just kill all
the zombie pigmen now they're gonna turn

440
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:54,329
the zombie pigmen now they're gonna turn
 

441
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,590
the zombie pigmen now they're gonna turn
on me let's get out of here yeah now the

442
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
on me let's get out of here yeah now the
 

443
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,590
on me let's get out of here yeah now the
Pigman killed pretty quickly and then

444
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,600
Pigman killed pretty quickly and then
 

445
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,179
Pigman killed pretty quickly and then
there's no more iron golems right and

446
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:02,189
there's no more iron golems right and
 

447
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,429
there's no more iron golems right and
farms broken now the other side to all

448
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:04,439
farms broken now the other side to all
 

449
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:07,220
farms broken now the other side to all
this is we also desperately need an iron

450
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,230
this is we also desperately need an iron
 

451
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,949
this is we also desperately need an iron
farm in our world our snowflake one

452
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:09,959
farm in our world our snowflake one
 

453
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,269
farm in our world our snowflake one
broke a while ago and I've just been

454
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
broke a while ago and I've just been
 

455
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:11,960
broke a while ago and I've just been
cannibal

456
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:11,970
cannibal
 

457
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,449
cannibal
vegan bases lately to get our iron but

458
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:14,459
vegan bases lately to get our iron but
 

459
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,999
vegan bases lately to get our iron but
that's gonna run out pretty soon and so

460
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:17,009
that's gonna run out pretty soon and so
 

461
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,939
that's gonna run out pretty soon and so
we need something so how perfect is this

462
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:19,949
we need something so how perfect is this
 

463
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:22,699
we need something so how perfect is this
right we need iron we need gold why

464
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:22,709
right we need iron we need gold why
 

465
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,480
right we need iron we need gold why
don't we just set up some villagers here

466
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,490
don't we just set up some villagers here
 

467
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,800
don't we just set up some villagers here
they'll spawn an iron golems on the

468
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:27,810
they'll spawn an iron golems on the
 

469
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,929
they'll spawn an iron golems on the
platform they don't spawn on glass so

470
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:29,939
platform they don't spawn on glass so
 

471
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,269
platform they don't spawn on glass so
this is all fine well they should spot

472
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:32,279
this is all fine well they should spot
 

473
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,179
this is all fine well they should spot
on the platform I believe and iron

474
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:35,189
on the platform I believe and iron
 

475
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:37,129
on the platform I believe and iron
golems will fight the zombie pigmen the

476
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:37,139
golems will fight the zombie pigmen the
 

477
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,929
golems will fight the zombie pigmen the
zombie pigmen will fight the iron golems

478
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:38,939
zombie pigmen will fight the iron golems
 

479
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:42,139
zombie pigmen will fight the iron golems
and we'll get both and we'll be fixing

480
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:42,149
and we'll get both and we'll be fixing
 

481

and we'll get both and we'll be fixing
an old broken project in the process so

482
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,240
an old broken project in the process so
 

483
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,999
an old broken project in the process so
it's like three birds in one stone right

484
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:47,009
it's like three birds in one stone right
 

485
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:49,970
it's like three birds in one stone right
and the crazy thing is there was

486
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:49,980
and the crazy thing is there was
 

487
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,650
and the crazy thing is there was
actually two villagers here just sitting

488
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:51,660
actually two villagers here just sitting
 

489
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,170
actually two villagers here just sitting
here is like when you punch a zombie

490
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,180
here is like when you punch a zombie
 

491
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,400
here is like when you punch a zombie
pigman sometimes they would spawn

492
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,410
pigman sometimes they would spawn
 

493
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,340
pigman sometimes they would spawn
zombies and I think a couple of them

494
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,350
zombies and I think a couple of them
 

495
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,410
zombies and I think a couple of them
were zombie villagers I cured them just

496
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:00,420
were zombie villagers I cured them just
 

497
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,050
were zombie villagers I cured them just
because I was bored and yeah so we can

498
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,060
because I was bored and yeah so we can
 

499
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,509
because I was bored and yeah so we can
start up a village pretty easily here I

500
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
start up a village pretty easily here I
 

501
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,879
start up a village pretty easily here I
think and these villagers are from

502
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:07,889
think and these villagers are from
 

503
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,889
think and these villagers are from
before the villager changes and I

504
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:09,899
before the villager changes and I
 

505
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,780
before the villager changes and I
suspect this might be another cheat

506
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:11,790
suspect this might be another cheat
 

507
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,569
suspect this might be another cheat
though because just says cleric it

508
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:14,579
though because just says cleric it
 

509
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,299
though because just says cleric it
doesn't say rank or anything up here

that should be good and then from here

640
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:09,389
that should be good and then from here
 

641
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,019
that should be good and then from here
from this villager sell to that one you

642
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:12,029
from this villager sell to that one you
 

643
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,389
from this villager sell to that one you
got one two three four five six seven

644
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
got one two three four five six seven
 

645
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,389
got one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve to this one

646
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:17,399
eight nine ten eleven twelve to this one
 

647
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,829
eight nine ten eleven twelve to this one
so again we have a 10 block space

648
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
so again we have a 10 block space
 

649
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,749
so again we have a 10 block space
alright well I think we're ready to get

650
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:20,759
alright well I think we're ready to get
 

651
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,110
alright well I think we're ready to get
started here and this is

652
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,120
started here and this is
 

653
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,300
started here and this is
be so easy for us to build because all

654
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,310
be so easy for us to build because all
 

655
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,769
be so easy for us to build because all
the hard work is done we got the

656
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:25,779
the hard work is done we got the
 

657
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,540
the hard work is done we got the
platform we got the collection system

658
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:27,550
platform we got the collection system
 

659
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,670
platform we got the collection system
underneath that we got this glass cover

660
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
underneath that we got this glass cover
 

661
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,640
underneath that we got this glass cover
all we got to do is build the villager

662
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:32,650
all we got to do is build the villager
 

663
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,780
all we got to do is build the villager
cells and get some zombies up here so

664
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:36,790
cells and get some zombies up here so
 

665
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,450
cells and get some zombies up here so
villager cells go in here and I should

666
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,460
villager cells go in here and I should
 

667
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,400
villager cells go in here and I should
warn you this is not pre-built and

668
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,410
warn you this is not pre-built and
 

669
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,980
warn you this is not pre-built and
creative so it might not work we will

670
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:43,990
creative so it might not work we will
 

671
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,220
creative so it might not work we will
find out I got to be very careful not to

672
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,230
find out I got to be very careful not to
 

673
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,900
find out I got to be very careful not to
right-click a bed as well as I'm doing

674
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:48,910
right-click a bed as well as I'm doing
 

675
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,700
right-click a bed as well as I'm doing
this or I'm gonna be very sad so I think

676
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:53,710
this or I'm gonna be very sad so I think
 

677
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,730
this or I'm gonna be very sad so I think
we need the pillow part facing the the

678
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:56,740
we need the pillow part facing the the
 

679
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:02,250
we need the pillow part facing the the
villagers and we want surround this now

680
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,260
villagers and we want surround this now
 

681
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,820
villagers and we want surround this now
with some glass this is the eco custom

682
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:05,830
with some glass this is the eco custom
 

683
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,180
with some glass this is the eco custom
cell let's see if it works or not

684
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,190
cell let's see if it works or not
 

685
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,329
cell let's see if it works or not
okay I'm gonna come over there and we

686
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:15,339
okay I'm gonna come over there and we
 

687
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:16,530
okay I'm gonna come over there and we
got to make sure when they wake up out

688
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:16,540
got to make sure when they wake up out
 

689
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,390
got to make sure when they wake up out
of the bed they don't spawn outside here

690
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:18,400
of the bed they don't spawn outside here
 

691
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,579
of the bed they don't spawn outside here
on the ground so I'm gonna build up here

692
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:20,589
on the ground so I'm gonna build up here
 

693
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:26,370
on the ground so I'm gonna build up here
I think I need to and possibly outside

694
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:26,380
I think I need to and possibly outside
 

695
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,440
I think I need to and possibly outside
here as well well no I think they

696
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,450
here as well well no I think they
 

697
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,699
here as well well no I think they
spawned from the pillow block not the

698
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:31,709
spawned from the pillow block not the
 

699
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,900
spawned from the pillow block not the
not the foot so that everything else

700
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:33,910
not the foot so that everything else
 

701
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,350
not the foot so that everything else
around that surrounded the glass overtop

702
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
around that surrounded the glass overtop
 

703
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,540
around that surrounded the glass overtop
of this as well and then we just got to

704
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,550
of this as well and then we just got to
 

705
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,430
of this as well and then we just got to
make sure the villagers can't get out so

706
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,440
make sure the villagers can't get out so
 

707
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,870
make sure the villagers can't get out so
we're gonna put some slabs in front

708
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:45,880
we're gonna put some slabs in front
 

709
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,910
we're gonna put some slabs in front
they'll bump their head on that and then

710
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
they'll bump their head on that and then
 

711
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,490
they'll bump their head on that and then
we need to make sure nothing spawns on

712
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:53,500
we need to make sure nothing spawns on
 

713
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,780
we need to make sure nothing spawns on
top of this so we're gonna put more

714
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:54,790
top of this so we're gonna put more
 

715
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,820
top of this so we're gonna put more
slabs over top here just cover the whole

716
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:56,830
slabs over top here just cover the whole
 

717
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,640
slabs over top here just cover the whole
thing although they don't spawn nothing

718
00:14:59,640 --> 00:14:59,650
thing although they don't spawn nothing
 

719
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,199
thing although they don't spawn nothing
spawns on glass so we don't really need

720
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:01,209
spawns on glass so we don't really need
 

721
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,019
spawns on glass so we don't really need
to put it of that I'm gonna do it anyway

722
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:04,029
to put it of that I'm gonna do it anyway
 

723
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,940
to put it of that I'm gonna do it anyway
okay and I think that's pretty much all

724
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:08,950
okay and I think that's pretty much all
 

725
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,949
okay and I think that's pretty much all
there is to it although I realized stuff

726
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
there is to it although I realized stuff
 

727
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,360
there is to it although I realized stuff
might spawn on top of these workstations

728
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,370
might spawn on top of these workstations
 

729
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,699
might spawn on top of these workstations
so I'm gonna put some redstone on top of

730
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:14,709
so I'm gonna put some redstone on top of
 

731
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,730
so I'm gonna put some redstone on top of
them that stops mobs from spawning good

732
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:17,740
them that stops mobs from spawning good
 

733
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,470
them that stops mobs from spawning good
use power rails as well or something

734
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,480
use power rails as well or something
 

735
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,199
use power rails as well or something
like that but that should be good I

736
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:22,209
like that but that should be good I
 

737
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,269
like that but that should be good I
think I don't think that blocks the

738
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:24,279
think I don't think that blocks the
 

739
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,490
think I don't think that blocks the
villagers from using the work station it

740
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:26,500
villagers from using the work station it
 

741
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,040
villagers from using the work station it
could be wrong again I don't really know

742
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,050
could be wrong again I don't really know
 

743
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,920
could be wrong again I don't really know
a lot about the mechanics but just the

744
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:31,930
a lot about the mechanics but just the
 

745
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,069
a lot about the mechanics but just the
basics so the zombies gonna go into his

746
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:35,079
basics so the zombies gonna go into his
 

747
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:35,890
basics so the zombies gonna go into his
cage over he

748
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:35,900
cage over he
 

749
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,810
cage over he
you'll be able to see the villagers

750
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:37,820
you'll be able to see the villagers
 

751
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,730

755
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,360
they're gonna freak out they're gonna
panic and then they're gonna spawn iron

756
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,370
panic and then they're gonna spawn iron
 

757
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,090
panic and then they're gonna spawn iron
golems up to six blocks but below them

758
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,100
golems up to six blocks but below them
 

759
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,850
golems up to six blocks but below them
and above them and six blocks below them

and above them and six blocks below them
 

761
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,890
and above them and six blocks below them
just happens to be a platform where we

762
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:50,900
just happens to be a platform where we
 

763
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,350
just happens to be a platform where we
want them time for school time the wake

don't even need to move them into the

768
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:57,320
don't even need to move them into the
 

769
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,880
don't even need to move them into the
cell if we just block them in there oh

770
00:15:59,880 --> 00:15:59,890
cell if we just block them in there oh
 

771
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,650
cell if we just block them in there oh

well I learned something new while
 

775
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,180
well I learned something new while
building this I did not know four

776
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,190
building this I did not know four
 

777
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,519
building this I did not know four
villagers to breed they need not only a

778
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:09,529
villagers to breed they need not only a
 

779
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,310
villagers to breed they need not only a
bed a workstation and food they also

780
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
bed a workstation and food they also
 

781
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,269
bed a workstation and food they also
need two air spaces above the beds for

782
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:16,279
need two air spaces above the beds for
 

783
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,200
need two air spaces above the beds for
the baby villagers to jump on otherwise

784
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,210
the baby villagers to jump on otherwise
 

785
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,880
the baby villagers to jump on otherwise
they don't see it as a valid bed so we

786
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:21,890
they don't see it as a valid bed so we
 

787
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,380
they don't see it as a valid bed so we
covered over the beds here I could not

788
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,390
covered over the beds here I could not
 

789
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,769
covered over the beds here I could not
figure out for like an hour why the

790
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:26,779
figure out for like an hour why the
 

791
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,590
figure out for like an hour why the
villagers totally stopped reading it's

792
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
villagers totally stopped reading it's
 

793
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,750
villagers totally stopped reading it's
because we had glass above the beds here

794
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:31,760
because we had glass above the beds here
 

795
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,430
because we had glass above the beds here
so now that they're done breeding we got

796
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440

what's going on here the mechanics are
 

955
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,000
what's going on here the mechanics are
so strange three four five six okay that

956
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,010
so strange three four five six okay that
 

957
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,529
so strange three four five six okay that
was a good one we got at least six iron

958
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:39,539
was a good one we got at least six iron
 

959
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:45,519
was a good one we got at least six iron
golems was it only six or was ready

960
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:45,529
golems was it only six or was ready
 

961
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:48,799
golems was it only six or was ready
we're trying to get eight four five six

962
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:48,809
we're trying to get eight four five six
 

963
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:53,560
we're trying to get eight four five six
I'm only seeing six hmm

964
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:53,570
I'm only seeing six hmm
 

965
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,399
I'm only seeing six hmm
alright well I think that's all we're

966
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:55,409
alright well I think that's all we're
 

967
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:56,990
alright well I think that's all we're
gonna do with this for today I know it's

968
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,000
gonna do with this for today I know it's
 

969
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,860
gonna do with this for today I know it's
not perfect but I know I can just read

970
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,870
not perfect but I know I can just read
 

971
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,269
not perfect but I know I can just read
the comments after this episode and

972
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:02,279
the comments after this episode and
 

973
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,380
the comments after this episode and
somebody's probably gonna give me the

974
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,390
somebody's probably gonna give me the
 

975
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,000
somebody's probably gonna give me the
answer to this so that's a lot easier

976
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,010
answer to this so that's a lot easier
 

977
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,490
answer to this so that's a lot easier
than trying to figure it out so thank

978
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:07,500
than trying to figure it out so thank
 

979
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,110
than trying to figure it out so thank
you in advance for that but I did see

980
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,120
you in advance for that but I did see
 

981
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,610
you in advance for that but I did see
eight spawn at once so there's

982
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:13,620
eight spawn at once so there's
 

983
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,560
eight spawn at once so there's
definitely potential here I think that

984
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:15,570
definitely potential here I think that
 

985
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,990
definitely potential here I think that
means the cells are spaced properly

986
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
means the cells are spaced properly
 

987
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,360
means the cells are spaced properly
there's this some other mechanic in play

988
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,370
there's this some other mechanic in play
 

989
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,510
there's this some other mechanic in play
that I don't understand I know you're

990
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
that I don't understand I know you're
 

991
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,250
that I don't understand I know you're
supposed to drop iron golems like

992
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,260
supposed to drop iron golems like
 

993
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,980
supposed to drop iron golems like
sixteen blocks away from villagers we

994
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:27,990
sixteen blocks away from villagers we
 

995
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,870
sixteen blocks away from villagers we
can't really do that with this project

996
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:29,880
can't really do that with this project
 

997
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,930
can't really do that with this project
cuz we're at the top of the roof here so

998
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:32,940
cuz we're at the top of the roof here so
 

999
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,090
cuz we're at the top of the roof here so
that might lower our iron rates a little

1000
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,100
that might lower our iron rates a little
 

1001
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,830
that might lower our iron rates a little
bit because we're not doing that but I

1002
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:38,840
bit because we're not doing that but I
 

1003
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,330
bit because we're not doing that but I
don't think it should be a big deal but

1004
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:41,340
don't think it should be a big deal but
 

1005
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,940
don't think it should be a big deal but
I could be wrong the way this works is

1006
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:43,950
I could be wrong the way this works is
 

1007
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,970
I could be wrong the way this works is
we put in some filters here for what

1008
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:46,980
we put in some filters here for what
 

1009
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,039
we put in some filters here for what
items we want to collect then when a

1010
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,049
items we want to collect then when a
 

1011
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,110
items we want to collect then when a
hopper minecart passes by those it grabs

1012
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
hopper minecart passes by those it grabs
 

1013
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,899
hopper minecart passes by those it grabs
one of each

1014
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:52,909
one of each
 

1015
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,969
one of each
and then it goes underneath the farm and

1016
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:54,979
and then it goes underneath the farm and
 

1017
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,859
and then it goes underneath the farm and
grabs all the stuff that way it doesn't

1018
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:56,869
grabs all the stuff that way it doesn't
 

1019
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,129
grabs all the stuff that way it doesn't
grab any of the swords or or poppies or

1020
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:00,139
grab any of the swords or or poppies or
 

1021
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:02,139
grab any of the swords or or poppies or
anything else that you might not want to

1022
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:02,149
anything else that you might not want to
 

1023
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:04,060
anything else that you might not want to
collect alright and I just checked in

1024
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,070
collect alright and I just checked in
 

1025
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,009
collect alright and I just checked in
what we got so far with the farm and

1026
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:06,019
what we got so far with the farm and
 

1027
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,289
what we got so far with the farm and
it's definitely producing a bit quite a

1028
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:08,299
it's definitely producing a bit quite a
 

1029
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:13,299
it's definitely producing a bit quite a
bit iron here already seven eight nine

1030
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:13,309
bit iron here already seven eight nine
 

1031
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:15,940
bit iron here already seven eight nine
kind of about nine stacks of iron so far

1032
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:15,950
kind of about nine stacks of iron so far
 

1033
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,950
kind of about nine stacks of iron so far
I think one or two of those are from the

1034
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:17,960
I think one or two of those are from the
 

1035
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,159
I think one or two of those are from the
filter that I supplied myself so

1036
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:21,169
filter that I supplied myself so
 

1037
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,099
filter that I supplied myself so
probably 7 or so stacks how many's out

1038
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:24,109
probably 7 or so stacks how many's out
 

1039
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,690
probably 7 or so stacks how many's out
of here it's not gonna happen smithing

1040
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:25,700
of here it's not gonna happen smithing
 

1041
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,609
of here it's not gonna happen smithing
so I have to manually put this stuff in

1042
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:27,619
so I have to manually put this stuff in
 

1043
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:30,089
so I have to manually put this stuff in
here with the way I got the firm set up

1044
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:30,099
here with the way I got the firm set up
 

1045
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,169
here with the way I got the firm set up
but it lasts for quite a few hours

1046
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:32,179
but it lasts for quite a few hours
 

1047
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:36,460
but it lasts for quite a few hours
before you have to refill yeah it's it's

1048
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,470
before you have to refill yeah it's it's
 

1049
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,930
before you have to refill yeah it's it's
gonna give us gas tears it's gonna give

1050
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:37,940
gonna give us gas tears it's gonna give
 

1051
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,639
gonna give us gas tears it's gonna give
us gold we got quite a bit of gold here

1052
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:39,649
us gold we got quite a bit of gold here
 

1053
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,799
us gold we got quite a bit of gold here
too we could get eight iron golem

1054
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:41,809
too we could get eight iron golem
 

1055
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,469
too we could get eight iron golem
spawning at once every single time

1056
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:43,479
spawning at once every single time
 

1057
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,810
spawning at once every single time
that's like eight every minute I think

1058
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:46,820
that's like eight every minute I think
 

1059
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,479
that's like eight every minute I think
then it's gonna really start producing

1060
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:49,489
then it's gonna really start producing
 

1061
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:51,369
then it's gonna really start producing
and I think once we get all the

1062
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:51,379
and I think once we get all the
 

1063
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:52,989
and I think once we get all the
mechanics working good on this farm I'm

1064
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:52,999
mechanics working good on this farm I'm
 

1065
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,669
mechanics working good on this farm I'm
also gonna turn it into a villager

1066
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:54,679
also gonna turn it into a villager
 

1067
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,789
also gonna turn it into a villager
Trading Post because we got 24 villagers

1068
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:57,799
Trading Post because we got 24 villagers
 

1069
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,129
Trading Post because we got 24 villagers
here they are on ground level so I can

1070
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:00,139
here they are on ground level so I can
 

1071
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:01,869
here they are on ground level so I can
interact with them and and trade with

1072
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:01,879
interact with them and and trade with
 

1073
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:03,879
interact with them and and trade with
them so I may as well that way it'll be

1074
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:03,889
them so I may as well that way it'll be
 

1075
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:06,519
them so I may as well that way it'll be
like three things in one iron farm gold

1076
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:06,529
like three things in one iron farm gold
 

1077
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:09,759
like three things in one iron farm gold
farm and Trading Post oh yeah before we

1078
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:09,769
farm and Trading Post oh yeah before we
 

1079
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,169
farm and Trading Post oh yeah before we
leave here I did want to check if this

1080
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:11,179
leave here I did want to check if this
 

1081
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,529
leave here I did want to check if this
guy's a cheap though which means

1082
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:13,539
guy's a cheap though which means
 

1083
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:16,089
guy's a cheap though which means
basically he doesn't have a limit to how

1084
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:16,099
basically he doesn't have a limit to how
 

1085
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:21,580
basically he doesn't have a limit to how
many times you can trade with them 67 oh

1086
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:21,590
many times you can trade with them 67 oh
 

1087
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,469
many times you can trade with them 67 oh
yeah he's cheap though normally I think

1088
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:23,479
yeah he's cheap though normally I think
 

1089
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,299
yeah he's cheap though normally I think
you're limited to 16 trades and we just

1090
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:25,309
you're limited to 16 trades and we just
 

1091
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,820
you're limited to 16 trades and we just
did 20 there and he didn't have to

1092
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:27,830
did 20 there and he didn't have to
 

1093
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,249
did 20 there and he didn't have to
restock I am kind of curious what

1094
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:30,259
restock I am kind of curious what
 

1095
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,729
restock I am kind of curious what
happens if you hear one of these guys if

1096
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:33,739
happens if you hear one of these guys if
 

1097
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:35,349
happens if you hear one of these guys if
the price is dropping you can still do

1098
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:35,359
the price is dropping you can still do
 

1099
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,320
the price is dropping you can still do
that then it becomes like super cheap

1100
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,330
that then it becomes like super cheap
 

1101
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,869
that then it becomes like super cheap
though he traded like one flesh for an

1102
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:40,879
though he traded like one flesh for an
 

1103
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,440
though he traded like one flesh for an
emerald with no restock time and

1104
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,450
emerald with no restock time and
 

1105
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,820
emerald with no restock time and
attempted to do that but that might be

1106
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:45,830
attempted to do that but that might be
 

1107
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,799
attempted to do that but that might be
too cheap though oh yeah and I thought

1108
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:47,809

very different we're still gonna be
 

1265
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,940
very different we're still gonna be
doing random stuff mixed in I'm sure but

1266
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:02,950
doing random stuff mixed in I'm sure but
 

1267
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,510
doing random stuff mixed in I'm sure but
for the next ten here I'm hoping for the

1268
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:06,520
for the next ten here I'm hoping for the
 

1269
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,850
for the next ten here I'm hoping for the
world tour and world download coming up

1270
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:08,860
world tour and world download coming up
 

1271
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,190
world tour and world download coming up
at episode 550 we're gonna be ready for

1272
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,200
at episode 550 we're gonna be ready for
 

1273
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,680
at episode 550 we're gonna be ready for
it we're gonna finish up some projects

1274
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:13,690
it we're gonna finish up some projects
 

1275
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,660
it we're gonna finish up some projects
here fix up some things and also I want

1276
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:15,670
here fix up some things and also I want
 

1277
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,970
here fix up some things and also I want
to organize the world a bit better so

1278
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:17,980
to organize the world a bit better so
 

1279
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,130
to organize the world a bit better so
like it would be nice to have signs that

1280
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,140
like it would be nice to have signs that
 

1281
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,680
like it would be nice to have signs that
tell you what's where how stuff works

1282
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:22,690
tell you what's where how stuff works
 

1283
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,060
tell you what's where how stuff works
that sort of thing

1284
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,070
that sort of thing
 

1285
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,640
that sort of thing
I noticed when people check out my world

1286
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:26,650
I noticed when people check out my world
 

1287
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,160
I noticed when people check out my world
they're actually really confused a lot

1288
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,170
they're actually really confused a lot
 

1289
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,560
they're actually really confused a lot
of the time which isn't really what I

1290
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:31,570
of the time which isn't really what I
 

1291
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,690
of the time which isn't really what I
want I would like them to be able to

1292
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:33,700
want I would like them to be able to
 

1293
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,240
want I would like them to be able to
find things and understand things right

1294
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,250
find things and understand things right
 

1295
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,640
find things and understand things right
so I'm gonna put an effort into that and

1296
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,650
so I'm gonna put an effort into that and
 

1297
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,160
so I'm gonna put an effort into that and
we're gonna be doing another stuff in

1298
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,170
we're gonna be doing another stuff in
 

1299
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,040
we're gonna be doing another stuff in
between as well I'm hoping then sometime

1300
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,050
between as well I'm hoping then sometime
 

1301
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,230
between as well I'm hoping then sometime
after episode 550 is when we're gonna

1302
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240
after episode 550 is when we're gonna
 

1303
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,500
after episode 550 is when we're gonna
start the major special project I don't

1304
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,510
start the major special project I don't
 

1305
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,580
start the major special project I don't
want to over hype it I don't want to

1306
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:50,590
want to over hype it I don't want to
 

1307
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,500
want to over hype it I don't want to
give too much away right now but I got

1308
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,510
give too much away right now but I got
 

1309
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,610
give too much away right now but I got
something massive planned that's gonna

1310
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:56,620
something massive planned that's gonna
 

1311
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,400
something massive planned that's gonna
be like the main feature of our world I

1312
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,410
be like the main feature of our world I
 

1313
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,280
be like the main feature of our world I
think so pretty excited about that I

1314
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,290
think so pretty excited about that I
 

1315
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,810
think so pretty excited about that I
want to start it today but I'm holding

1316
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:03,820
want to start it today but I'm holding
 

1317
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,390
want to start it today but I'm holding
off I'll give myself more time to plan

1318
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:06,400
off I'll give myself more time to plan
 

1319
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,210
off I'll give myself more time to plan
it out and it'll hopefully be better

1320
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:08,220
it out and it'll hopefully be better
 

1321
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,590
it out and it'll hopefully be better
aha so in line with that goal this

1322
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:10,600
aha so in line with that goal this
 

1323
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,480
aha so in line with that goal this
episode we did do some other stuff we

1324
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,490
episode we did do some other stuff we
 

1325
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,790
episode we did do some other stuff we
built that another tunnel and we fixed

1326
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:14,800
built that another tunnel and we fixed
 

1327
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,770
built that another tunnel and we fixed
up a broken project the gold firm number

1328
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:16,780
up a broken project the gold firm number
 

1329
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,690
up a broken project the gold firm number
2 and made something new out of it so

1330
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:18,700
2 and made something new out of it so
 

1331
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,970
2 and made something new out of it so
that is pretty cool but probably the

1332
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:20,980
that is pretty cool but probably the
 

1333
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,530
that is pretty cool but probably the
second biggest thing I did besides the

1334
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:22,540
second biggest thing I did besides the
 

1335
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,020
second biggest thing I did besides the
nether tunnel is I worked on fixing up

1336
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,030
nether tunnel is I worked on fixing up
 

1337
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,260
nether tunnel is I worked on fixing up
the broken pumpkin and round mushroom

1338
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,270
the broken pumpkin and round mushroom
 

1339
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,570
the broken pumpkin and round mushroom
farm we had yeah so the pumpkin farmer

1340
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:30,580
farm we had yeah so the pumpkin farmer
 

1341
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,060
farm we had yeah so the pumpkin farmer
broken because before a pumpkin would

1342
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,070
broken because before a pumpkin would
 

1343
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,500
broken because before a pumpkin would
grow in front of the piston like that

1344
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,510
grow in front of the piston like that
 

1345
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,820
grow in front of the piston like that
and that would block out the light from

1346
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:35,830
and that would block out the light from
 

1347
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,610
and that would block out the light from
reaching the daylight sensor which would

1348
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:38,620
reaching the daylight sensor which would
 

1349
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,769
reaching the daylight sensor which would
cause us to trigger and activate the

1350
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:40,779
cause us to trigger and activate the
 

1351
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:42,659
cause us to trigger and activate the
piston breaking the pumpkin and letting

1352
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:42,669
piston breaking the pumpkin and letting
 

1353
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:45,840
piston breaking the pumpkin and letting
light through again that was when light

1354
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:45,850
light through again that was when light
 

1355
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,490
light through again that was when light
would pass through Pistons which isn't

1356
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:47,500
would pass through Pistons which isn't
 

1357
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,620
would pass through Pistons which isn't
the case anymore so this piston would

1358
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:49,630
the case anymore so this piston would
 

1359
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,940
the case anymore so this piston would
get stuck after that update and couldn't

1360
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:53,950
get stuck after that update and couldn't
 

1361
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,799
get stuck after that update and couldn't
grow any more pumpkins now the new

1362
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:55,809
grow any more pumpkins now the new
 

1363
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,720
grow any more pumpkins now the new
system that we upgraded to here is

1364
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:57,730
system that we upgraded to here is
 

1365
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,570
system that we upgraded to here is
pumpkin grows in front of the piston

1366
00:28:59,570 --> 00:28:59,580
pumpkin grows in front of the piston
 

1367
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,070
pumpkin grows in front of the piston
under the note block that updates the

1368
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,080
under the note block that updates the
 

1369
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,370
under the note block that updates the
note block which observer detects ours

1370
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:05,380
note block which observer detects ours
 

1371
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,860
note block which observer detects ours
this block here which powers the piston

1372
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:07,870
this block here which powers the piston
 

1373
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,889
this block here which powers the piston
diagonally and we update the piston with

1374
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:10,899
diagonally and we update the piston with
 

1375
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:14,279
diagonally and we update the piston with
the power rail down below here now it's

1376
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:14,289
the power rail down below here now it's
 

1377
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,659
the power rail down below here now it's
important to keep in mind if you are

1378
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:15,669
important to keep in mind if you are
 

1379
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:16,980
important to keep in mind if you are
building a farm like this it does not

1380
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:16,990
building a farm like this it does not
 

1381
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,330
building a farm like this it does not
work with melons that is because melons

1382
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:21,340
work with melons that is because melons
 

1383
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,639
work with melons that is because melons
don't actually change the notes on the

1384
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:23,649
don't actually change the notes on the
 

1385
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:29,299
don't actually change the notes on the
note block still piano while pumpkins

1386
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:29,309
note block still piano while pumpkins
 

1387
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,919
note block still piano while pumpkins
uh-huh awesome so this is a new fully

1388
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:31,929
uh-huh awesome so this is a new fully
 

1389
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:34,259
uh-huh awesome so this is a new fully
upgraded pumpkin and brown mushroom farm

1390
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:34,269
upgraded pumpkin and brown mushroom farm
 

1391
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:37,019
upgraded pumpkin and brown mushroom farm
with the new mechanics ever pumpkin

1392
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:37,029
with the new mechanics ever pumpkin
 

1393
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:41,250
with the new mechanics ever pumpkin
grows it triggers uh-huh I put glass

1394
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,260
grows it triggers uh-huh I put glass
 

1395
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,139
grows it triggers uh-huh I put glass
over top here now as well as having some

1396
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:43,149
over top here now as well as having some
 

1397
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,180
over top here now as well as having some
issues where mobs respond here and they

1398
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,190
issues where mobs respond here and they
 

1399
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,370
issues where mobs respond here and they
would trample the the crops now they

1400
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:47,380
would trample the the crops now they
 

1401
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,769
would trample the the crops now they
can't do that and we also did a few

1402
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:49,779
can't do that and we also did a few
 

1403
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:51,810
can't do that and we also did a few
aesthetic things around here so we added

1404
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:51,820
aesthetic things around here so we added
 

1405
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,480
aesthetic things around here so we added
some lights some some lanterns here with

1406
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,490
some lights some some lanterns here with
 

1407
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,090
some lights some some lanterns here with
the chain block we added posts before

1408
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,100
the chain block we added posts before
 

1409
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,740
the chain block we added posts before
this is all floating and it didn't look

1410
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:58,750
this is all floating and it didn't look
 

1411
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,789
this is all floating and it didn't look
very good we got rid of the regular dark

1412
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:02,799
very good we got rid of the regular dark
 

1413
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,250
very good we got rid of the regular dark
oak and we stripped it all and added

1414
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:05,260
oak and we stripped it all and added
 

1415
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,899
oak and we stripped it all and added
some rings around each of the mushroom

1416
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:06,909
some rings around each of the mushroom
 

1417
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:09,330
some rings around each of the mushroom
plants here and the idea what the

1418
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,340
plants here and the idea what the
 

1419
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,860
plants here and the idea what the
trapdoors here I haven't tried them out

have a good day

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:12,970

 

1577
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,529
