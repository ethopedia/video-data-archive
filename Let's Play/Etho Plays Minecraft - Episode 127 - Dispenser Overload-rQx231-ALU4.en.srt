00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:09,809
hello while you ask some people how are
 

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,220
hello while you ask some people how are

00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,230
you doing today I'm doing well it's
 

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,939
you doing today I'm doing well it's
still working on the potion room it's

6
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:16,949
still working on the potion room it's
 

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,910
still working on the potion room it's
coming along I've been working on the

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
coming along I've been working on the
 

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,700
coming along I've been working on the
dispenser area so I set up some ladders

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,710
dispenser area so I set up some ladders
 

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,150
dispenser area so I set up some ladders
here just to get up here for now and oh

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
here just to get up here for now and oh
 

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,269
here just to get up here for now and oh
hello there's there's a cave up to the

14
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:32,279
hello there's there's a cave up to the
 

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,490
hello there's there's a cave up to the
surface yeah so I cleared out some space

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,500
surface yeah so I cleared out some space
 

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,290
surface yeah so I cleared out some space
to set up our dispensers to hold our

18
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:41,300
to set up our dispensers to hold our
 

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,090
to set up our dispensers to hold our
twelve items or whatever twelve

20
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,100
twelve items or whatever twelve
 

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,389
twelve items or whatever twelve
different items so I got a hook all

22
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,399
different items so I got a hook all
 

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,930
different items so I got a hook all
these buttons over here

24
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:49,940
these buttons over here
 

25
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,220
these buttons over here
you know there's twelve buttons we got

26
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,230
you know there's twelve buttons we got
 

27
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,229
you know there's twelve buttons we got
to hook those up to twelve different

28
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
to hook those up to twelve different
 

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,040
to hook those up to twelve different
groups of dispensers up here so it'll go

30
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,050
groups of dispensers up here so it'll go
 

31
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,939
groups of dispensers up here so it'll go
something like this we'll have a water

32
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:01,949
something like this we'll have a water
 

33
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,640
something like this we'll have a water
stream here actually fit pretty nice

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,650
stream here actually fit pretty nice
 

35
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,890
stream here actually fit pretty nice
I'll go there to the center so if any

36
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:09,900
I'll go there to the center so if any
 

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,500
I'll go there to the center so if any
item falls in these streams they'll go

38
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,510
item falls in these streams they'll go
 

39
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,690
item falls in these streams they'll go
to the center like so then I'll have um

40
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:19,700
to the center like so then I'll have um
 

41
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,830
to the center like so then I'll have um
still design what to do about the

42
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
still design what to do about the
 

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,039
still design what to do about the
dispensers as thinking originally that I

44
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,049
dispensers as thinking originally that I
 

45
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:32,050
dispensers as thinking originally that I
have ten for each group oops like this

46
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,060
have ten for each group oops like this
 

47
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,460
have ten for each group oops like this
there are better ways I could position

48
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:34,470
there are better ways I could position
 

49
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,999
there are better ways I could position
these that would take less space but I'm

50
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:38,009
these that would take less space but I'm
 

51
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,219
these that would take less space but I'm
worried patches might change way like

52
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:43,229
worried patches might change way like
 

53
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,920
worried patches might change way like
items going through blocks works like

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:45,930
items going through blocks works like
 

55
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,050
items going through blocks works like
otherwise I would just put put them like

56
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,060
otherwise I would just put put them like
 

57
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,940
otherwise I would just put put them like
this like right next to each other and

58
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:49,950
this like right next to each other and
 

59
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,060
this like right next to each other and
they'll items will fall down through the

60
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,070
they'll items will fall down through the
 

61
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,490
they'll items will fall down through the
block but I'm going to keep it like this

62
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:55,500
block but I'm going to keep it like this
 

63
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:04,250
block but I'm going to keep it like this
for safety yeah so ten per ingredients

64
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,260
for safety yeah so ten per ingredients
 

65
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,540
for safety yeah so ten per ingredients
I was thinking I could do five per

66
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,550
I was thinking I could do five per
 

67
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,130
I was thinking I could do five per
ingredient and then just send two pulses

68
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,140
ingredient and then just send two pulses
 

69
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,510
ingredient and then just send two pulses
but really that would make things a lot

70
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:14,520
but really that would make things a lot
 

71
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,020
but really that would make things a lot
more complicated and this is just not a

72
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,030
more complicated and this is just not a
 

73
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,090
more complicated and this is just not a
bad way of doing it so I'm going to try

74
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,100
bad way of doing it so I'm going to try
 

75
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,000
bad way of doing it so I'm going to try
run wire along the top of these

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,010
run wire along the top of these
 

77
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,850
run wire along the top of these
dispensers if that eventually gets

78
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:28,860
dispensers if that eventually gets
 

79
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,990
dispensers if that eventually gets
patched I should be able to do it in a

80
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,000
patched I should be able to do it in a
 

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,050
patched I should be able to do it in a
way that will work still so if you don't

82
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,060
way that will work still so if you don't
 

83
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,760
way that will work still so if you don't
know this you can place wire on

84
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:37,770
know this you can place wire on
 

85
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,100
know this you can place wire on
dispensers if you place it next to a

86
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,110
dispensers if you place it next to a
 

87
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,600
dispensers if you place it next to a
block buy it like this otherwise if you

88
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,610
block buy it like this otherwise if you
 

89
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,250
block buy it like this otherwise if you
right-click on a dispenser or you just

90
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,260
right-click on a dispenser or you just
 

91
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,700
right-click on a dispenser or you just
you just look at it so I think that

92
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:49,710
you just look at it so I think that
 

93
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,330
you just look at it so I think that
would do the trick here maybe we'll try

94
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:53,340
would do the trick here maybe we'll try
 

95
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,860
would do the trick here maybe we'll try
it out sounds like it let's test it

96
00:02:59,860 --> 00:02:59,870
it out sounds like it let's test it
 

97
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,370
it out sounds like it let's test it
split this up so in total there is going

98
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:04,380
split this up so in total there is going
 

99
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,250
split this up so in total there is going
to be oh I don't know over a hundred of

100
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,260
to be oh I don't know over a hundred of
 

101
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,410
to be oh I don't know over a hundred of
these dispensers it they'll be good

102
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:09,420
these dispensers it they'll be good
 

103
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,090
these dispensers it they'll be good
because I'll use them for storage as

104
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,100
because I'll use them for storage as
 

105
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,110
because I'll use them for storage as
well like I got so many spider eyes I

106
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
well like I got so many spider eyes I
 

107
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,670
well like I got so many spider eyes I
wouldn't mind having a place to keep

108
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:16,680
wouldn't mind having a place to keep
 

109
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,890
wouldn't mind having a place to keep
them yep dispensed five that's what we

110
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:21,900
them yep dispensed five that's what we
 

111
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,520
them yep dispensed five that's what we
want perfect

112
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,530

 

113
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,610

the wires will connect over here

114
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:31,620
the wires will connect over here
 

115
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,580
the wires will connect over here
probably like this and then there'll be

116
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:37,590
probably like this and then there'll be
 

117
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,920
probably like this and then there'll be
another water stream right here go off

118
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:42,930
another water stream right here go off
 

119
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,640
another water stream right here go off
to here with fence gates hold the water

120
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,650
to here with fence gates hold the water
 

121
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,840
to here with fence gates hold the water
in place so give me one second and I

122
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:50,850
in place so give me one second and I
 

123
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,759
in place so give me one second and I
will rig it rigged that all up here all

124
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:55,769
will rig it rigged that all up here all
 

125
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,410
will rig it rigged that all up here all
right guys I got this finished now you

126
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,420
right guys I got this finished now you
 

127
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,860
right guys I got this finished now you
got our ingredient dispenser arrays all

128
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:00,870
got our ingredient dispenser arrays all
 

129
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,150
got our ingredient dispenser arrays all
set up here with water streams with the

130
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,160
set up here with water streams with the
 

131
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,320
set up here with water streams with the
Redstone groupings in total there's 100

132
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,330
Redstone groupings in total there's 100
 

133
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,199
Redstone groupings in total there's 100
dispensers here and ten groups but we

134
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,209
dispensers here and ten groups but we
 

135
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,170
dispensers here and ten groups but we
need 12 groups total so I'll either have

136
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,180
need 12 groups total so I'll either have
 

137
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,370
need 12 groups total so I'll either have
to split these up a little bit to do

138
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,380
to split these up a little bit to do
 

139
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,550
to split these up a little bit to do
some fancier wiring like to send more

140
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
some fancier wiring like to send more
 

141
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,620
some fancier wiring like to send more
than one pulse so so like we need 10

142
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:25,630
than one pulse so so like we need 10
 

143
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,600
than one pulse so so like we need 10
ingredients to come out but we could

144
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,610
ingredients to come out but we could
 

145
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,530
ingredients to come out but we could
like just to have 5 dispensers full and

146
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:31,540
like just to have 5 dispensers full and
 

147
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,140
like just to have 5 dispensers full and
send 2 pulses to that that would be like

148
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,150
send 2 pulses to that that would be like
 

149
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,320
send 2 pulses to that that would be like
5 times 2 is 10 or for the last bottles

150
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,330
5 times 2 is 10 or for the last bottles
 

151
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,990
5 times 2 is 10 or for the last bottles
for example we could have 10 dispensers

152
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
for example we could have 10 dispensers
 

153
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,900
for example we could have 10 dispensers
and send 3 pulses to get 30 bottles out

154
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:42,910
and send 3 pulses to get 30 bottles out
 

155
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,660
and send 3 pulses to get 30 bottles out
like we need which isn't as difficult to

156
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:48,670
like we need which isn't as difficult to
 

157
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,730
like we need which isn't as difficult to
do as I thought it was going to be I'll

158
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:50,740
do as I thought it was going to be I'll
 

159
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,590
do as I thought it was going to be I'll
show you in a second that first I'll

160
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,600
show you in a second that first I'll
 

161
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,540
show you in a second that first I'll
show you this working I got a button

162
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,550
show you this working I got a button
 

163
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,830
show you this working I got a button
here will power this 10 items get shot

164
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:58,840
here will power this 10 items get shot
 

165
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,710
here will power this 10 items get shot
out of the 10 dispensers and they fall

166
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:01,720
out of the 10 dispensers and they fall
 

167
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,820
out of the 10 dispensers and they fall
down and then they make their way to the

168
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:05,830
down and then they make their way to the
 

169
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,750
down and then they make their way to the
center for potions I'm going to make

170
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:09,760
center for potions I'm going to make
 

171
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,730
center for potions I'm going to make
more often I'll obviously want those

172
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:11,740
more often I'll obviously want those
 

173
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,590
more often I'll obviously want those
closer to the center so it doesn't take

174
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
closer to the center so it doesn't take
 

175
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,410
closer to the center so it doesn't take
as long if I had ice I could speed this

176
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,420
as long if I had ice I could speed this
 

177
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,110
as long if I had ice I could speed this
up but I don't and as far as I know you

178
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
up but I don't and as far as I know you
 

179
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,790
up but I don't and as far as I know you
can't get ice with silk touch anymore

180
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
can't get ice with silk touch anymore
 

181
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,850
can't get ice with silk touch anymore
which sucks but that's the way it is

182
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:25,860

 

183
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,120

yeah

184
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,130
yeah
 

185
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,640
yeah
so that's up here so we'll be standing

186
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:32,650
so that's up here so we'll be standing
 

187
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,830
so that's up here so we'll be standing
here items will fall on us yeah I did a

188
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
here items will fall on us yeah I did a
 

189
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
here items will fall on us yeah I did a
little test I thought I was going to

190
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,370
little test I thought I was going to
 

191
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,000
little test I thought I was going to
need three repeaters to send a double

192
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,010
need three repeaters to send a double
 

193
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,710
need three repeaters to send a double
pulse to a dispenser but you don't

194
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:43,720
pulse to a dispenser but you don't
 

195
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,830
pulse to a dispenser but you don't
actually you just need one repeater you

196
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
actually you just need one repeater you
 

197
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,770
actually you just need one repeater you
see it shot to you and you can have it

198
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:54,780
see it shot to you and you can have it
 

199
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,010
see it shot to you and you can have it
if you have it on add to delay it will

200
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,020
if you have it on add to delay it will
 

201
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,780
if you have it on add to delay it will
only shoot one but if you go up to three

202
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:00,790
only shoot one but if you go up to three
 

203
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,510
only shoot one but if you go up to three
then it'll shoot - so that's the minimum

204
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
then it'll shoot - so that's the minimum
 

205
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,930
then it'll shoot - so that's the minimum
to make that happen so yeah won't be

206
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:09,940
to make that happen so yeah won't be
 

207
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,650
to make that happen so yeah won't be
that difficult to send double pulses so

208
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:12,660
that difficult to send double pulses so
 

209
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,840
that difficult to send double pulses so
for then the potions I won't be making

210
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:15,850
for then the potions I won't be making
 

211
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,530
for then the potions I won't be making
as often like the regeneration potions

212
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:19,540
as often like the regeneration potions
 

213
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,030
as often like the regeneration potions
because I probably won't get a million

214
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,040
because I probably won't get a million
 

215
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,290
because I probably won't get a million
gas tears or anything I might i'll

216
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,300
gas tears or anything I might i'll
 

217
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,950
gas tears or anything I might i'll
probably just

218
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
probably just
 

219
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,490
probably just
have a group of five instead of a group

220
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:30,500
have a group of five instead of a group
 

221
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,180
have a group of five instead of a group
of ten and in that way I'll try to get

222
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,190
of ten and in that way I'll try to get
 

223
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,830
of ten and in that way I'll try to get
them all to fit in this thing so I don't

224
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
them all to fit in this thing so I don't
 

225
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,170
them all to fit in this thing so I don't
have to add more dispensers because this

226
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,180
have to add more dispensers because this
 

227
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,379
have to add more dispensers because this
is probably quite excessive as it is

228
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:43,389

 

229
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,550

well it seems like I'm having problems

230
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:45,560
well it seems like I'm having problems
 

231
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,400
well it seems like I'm having problems
with the multi pulsing after all it's

232
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,410
with the multi pulsing after all it's
 

233
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,860
with the multi pulsing after all it's
just not working for me like like when I

234
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:50,870
just not working for me like like when I
 

235
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,980
just not working for me like like when I
tested it before I was trying to do a

236
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:53,990
tested it before I was trying to do a
 

237
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,080
tested it before I was trying to do a
triple pulsing here for the glass

238
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,090
triple pulsing here for the glass
 

239
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,820
triple pulsing here for the glass
bottles but this is what happens we've

240
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:00,830
bottles but this is what happens we've
 

241
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,390
bottles but this is what happens we've
got some cobble in there still 22 when I

242
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
got some cobble in there still 22 when I
 

243
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,210
got some cobble in there still 22 when I
press this button here it should send

244
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,220
press this button here it should send
 

245
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,200
press this button here it should send
out three different delayed signals and

246
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,210
out three different delayed signals and
 

247
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,200
out three different delayed signals and
they are at least three torch delays

248
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,210
they are at least three torch delays
 

249
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,960
they are at least three torch delays
apart from each other so this one is 1

250
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:16,970
apart from each other so this one is 1
 

251
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,580
apart from each other so this one is 1
this is 4 and this is 8 so should send

252
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:21,590
this is 4 and this is 8 so should send
 

253
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,680
this is 4 and this is 8 so should send
out 3 signals that the dispenser can

254
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:23,690
out 3 signals that the dispenser can
 

255
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,950
out 3 signals that the dispenser can
take but according to my last test but

256
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
take but according to my last test but
 

257
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,510
take but according to my last test but
that's not actually the case

258
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:30,520

 

259
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,830

in total only one got shot out there

260
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:34,840
in total only one got shot out there
 

261
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,360
in total only one got shot out there
even though it sounded like five pulses

262
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,370
even though it sounded like five pulses
 

263
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,310
even though it sounded like five pulses
went out four pulses went out somehow

264
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,320
went out four pulses went out somehow
 

265
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,960
went out four pulses went out somehow
from that so yeah I just we're just

266
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:46,970
from that so yeah I just we're just
 

267
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,060
from that so yeah I just we're just
going to do with this simple way added

268
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,070
going to do with this simple way added
 

269
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,820
going to do with this simple way added
40 extra dispensers though not a big

270
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:51,830
40 extra dispensers though not a big
 

271
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,300
40 extra dispensers though not a big
deal we'll have more storage space doing

272
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,310
deal we'll have more storage space doing
 

273
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,640
deal we'll have more storage space doing
that it's just a cross here with the 10

274
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:00,650
that it's just a cross here with the 10
 

275
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:07,710
that it's just a cross here with the 10
per arm so if I connected here and here

276
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:07,720
per arm so if I connected here and here
 

277
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,110
per arm so if I connected here and here
it we would have 30 for the glass

278
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
it we would have 30 for the glass
 

279
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,469
it we would have 30 for the glass
bottles or something like that so up

280
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
bottles or something like that so up
 

281
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,450
bottles or something like that so up
here I'm going to thirty of these are

282
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:16,460
here I'm going to thirty of these are
 

283
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,920
here I'm going to thirty of these are
going to be for the glass bottles in ten

284
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:17,930
going to be for the glass bottles in ten
 

285
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,240
going to be for the glass bottles in ten
are going to be for the netherwart

286
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,250
are going to be for the netherwart
 

287
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,420
are going to be for the netherwart
and that will just I will just simplify

288
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,430
and that will just I will just simplify
 

289
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,820
and that will just I will just simplify
everything and I can load these from

290
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:24,830
everything and I can load these from
 

291
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:32,790
everything and I can load these from
below so it's not terrible okay

292
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800

 

293
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,060

okay as walking by my farm here and a

294
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,070
okay as walking by my farm here and a
 

295
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,280
okay as walking by my farm here and a
bunch of squid just fell to their death

296
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,290

 

297
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,800

missed it though that's what happened

298
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:45,810
missed it though that's what happened
 

299
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,470
missed it though that's what happened
and it seems Enderman are still getting

300
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
and it seems Enderman are still getting
 

301
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,989
and it seems Enderman are still getting
down my jave really annoying

302
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:55,999

 

303
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:58,519

alright guys I got lots to show you now

304
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:58,529
alright guys I got lots to show you now
 

305
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,439
alright guys I got lots to show you now
I worked on the potion room for a good

306
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:00,449
I worked on the potion room for a good
 

307
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,960
I worked on the potion room for a good
three hours at least and half that time

308
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:02,970
three hours at least and half that time
 

309
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,119
three hours at least and half that time
is probably on the wiring just because

310
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:05,129
is probably on the wiring just because
 

311
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,269
is probably on the wiring just because
it was really tedious but yeah this is

312
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:08,279
it was really tedious but yeah this is
 

313
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,670
it was really tedious but yeah this is
it still not complete but got a lot done

314
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
it still not complete but got a lot done
 

315
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,769
it still not complete but got a lot done
on it and I decided since I put over 500

316
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:18,779
on it and I decided since I put over 500
 

317
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,480
on it and I decided since I put over 500
redstone into this thing that I'd go all

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:44,540
let's try it out somebody has made a
 

369
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,810
let's try it out somebody has made a
tutorial on this 3x3 door that's really

tutorial on this 3x3 door that's really
 

371
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,420
tutorial on this 3x3 door that's really
awesome - but I think I'm going to stick

372
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,430
awesome - but I think I'm going to stick
 

373
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,980
awesome - but I think I'm going to stick
with this one just because it's done

374
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:52,990

 

375
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,730

okay here we go

376
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:54,740
okay here we go
 

377
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:02,620
okay here we go
first hit will use our pick and then got

378
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:02,630
first hit will use our pick and then got
 

379
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:12,400
first hit will use our pick and then got
four five and three not bad okay let's

380
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,410
four five and three not bad okay let's
 

381
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,230
four five and three not bad okay let's
look at the picture so it's a pixel art

382
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
look at the picture so it's a pixel art
 

383
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,170
look at the picture so it's a pixel art
of a potion because it matched the room

384
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:17,180
of a potion because it matched the room
 

385
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,260
of a potion because it matched the room
pretty much perfectly a little bit

386
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,270
pretty much perfectly a little bit
 

387
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,910
pretty much perfectly a little bit
different than what I normally do it's

388
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
different than what I normally do it's
 

389
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,780
different than what I normally do it's
pretty pretty out there and somehow I'm

390
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:25,790
pretty pretty out there and somehow I'm
 

391
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,050
pretty pretty out there and somehow I'm
going to have to transition from stone

392
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,060
going to have to transition from stone
 

393
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,380
going to have to transition from stone
brick to this iron actual iron block

394
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,390
brick to this iron actual iron block
 

395
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:38,650

door here and over here we have the

396
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:38,660
door here and over here we have the
 

397
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,850
door here and over here we have the
actual brewing area so you would stand

398
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:42,860
actual brewing area so you would stand
 

399
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,680
actual brewing area so you would stand
here and you can hit all the buttons and

400
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:47,690
here and you can hit all the buttons and
 

401
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,890
here and you can hit all the buttons and
hear that click divot after everyone oh

402
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:52,900

 

403
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,110

I can't reach here let's just have to

404
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,120
I can't reach here let's just have to
 

405
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:04,180
I can't reach here let's just have to
stand a little bit closer that's okay so

406
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,190
stand a little bit closer that's okay so
 

407
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,170
stand a little bit closer that's okay so
yeah each of these is an individual wire

408
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,180
yeah each of these is an individual wire
 

409
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,240
yeah each of these is an individual wire
that goes up to the dispensers above

410
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,250
that goes up to the dispensers above
 

411
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:20,020
that goes up to the dispensers above
which was a huge pain to do so some run

412
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,030
which was a huge pain to do so some run
 

413
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,300
which was a huge pain to do so some run
underneath some run above we'll just run

414
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,310
underneath some run above we'll just run
 

415
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,640
underneath some run above we'll just run
through it quick and then it goes up to

416
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:29,650
through it quick and then it goes up to
 

417
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,170
through it quick and then it goes up to
redstone torches which take the signal

418
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,180
redstone torches which take the signal
 

419
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,410
redstone torches which take the signal
straight up other sides the exact same

420
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:35,420
straight up other sides the exact same
 

421
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,770
straight up other sides the exact same
here is a huge mess because originally I

422
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:38,780
here is a huge mess because originally I
 

423
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,410
here is a huge mess because originally I
was doing spiral staircases up for the

424
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:41,420
was doing spiral staircases up for the
 

425
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,210
was doing spiral staircases up for the
wire so I wouldn't use what I have to

426
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,220
wire so I wouldn't use what I have to
 

427
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,120
wire so I wouldn't use what I have to
use redstone torches just to speed up

428
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,130
use redstone torches just to speed up
 

429
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,190
use redstone torches just to speed up
the

430
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,200
the
 

431
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,270
the
the wire rates I guess the lower the

432
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:52,280
the wire rates I guess the lower the
 

433
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,390
the wire rates I guess the lower the
delay after the button press let's see

434
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:55,400
delay after the button press let's see
 

435
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,070
delay after the button press let's see
how do I get up here it might not be a

436
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,080
how do I get up here it might not be a
 

437
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,260
how do I get up here it might not be a
way to get up here anymore

438
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,270

 

439
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:10,780

and then there's wire everywhere

440
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:10,790
and then there's wire everywhere
 

441
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,520
and then there's wire everywhere
basically I will be putting up this

442
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:15,530
basically I will be putting up this
 

443
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,560
basically I will be putting up this
world for download very soon again so

444
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:17,570
world for download very soon again so
 

445
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,990
world for download very soon again so
you'll be able to check it out then if

446
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
you'll be able to check it out then if
 

447
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,020
you'll be able to check it out then if
you want these guys went all out in here

448
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,030
you want these guys went all out in here
 

449
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,730
you want these guys went all out in here
- I've got glowstone can't remember how

450
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:30,740
- I've got glowstone can't remember how
 

451
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,670
- I've got glowstone can't remember how
much you saw last time it's been so long

452
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
much you saw last time it's been so long
 

453
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,310
much you saw last time it's been so long
I've been working on this on these signs

454
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
I've been working on this on these signs
 

455
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,330
I've been working on this on these signs
I will have they'll say they reading in

456
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,340
I will have they'll say they reading in
 

457
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,070
I will have they'll say they reading in
it so if I ever come to restock it'll be

458
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,080
it so if I ever come to restock it'll be
 

459
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,420
it so if I ever come to restock it'll be
simple to find where to put the stuff

460
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,430
simple to find where to put the stuff
 

461
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,470
simple to find where to put the stuff
it's easy to restock because

462
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:47,480
it's easy to restock because
 

463
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,340
it's easy to restock because
everything's down here or you can reach

464
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,350
everything's down here or you can reach
 

465
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,210
everything's down here or you can reach
above half slabs are just so I don't

466
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,220
above half slabs are just so I don't
 

467
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,920
above half slabs are just so I don't
fall into the stream below because if

468
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:56,930
fall into the stream below because if
 

469
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,720
fall into the stream below because if
you do that then you can't get out due

470
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:58,730
you do that then you can't get out due
 

471
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,580
you do that then you can't get out due
to that water glitch most the time and

472
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:03,590
to that water glitch most the time and
 

473
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,660
to that water glitch most the time and
now it's about it pretty pretty good I'm

474
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:07,670
now it's about it pretty pretty good I'm
 

475
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,390
now it's about it pretty pretty good I'm
glad it's all done have some repeaters

476
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,400
glad it's all done have some repeaters
 

477
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,550
glad it's all done have some repeaters
up here to extend the signal so this arm

478
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:15,560
up here to extend the signal so this arm
 

479
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,200
up here to extend the signal so this arm
this arm and this arm are connected

480
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,210
this arm and this arm are connected
 

481
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,750
this arm and this arm are connected
together here and then this one's on its

482
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
together here and then this one's on its
 

483
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:29,250
together here and then this one's on its
own pretty boring I know I know okay

484
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,260

 

485
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,330

also yeah this is like this is where

486
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,340
also yeah this is like this is where
 

487
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,950
also yeah this is like this is where
like three the torches come up and one

488
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:35,960
like three the torches come up and one
 

489
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,430
like three the torches come up and one
of them keeps going up here and one goes

490
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
of them keeps going up here and one goes
 

491
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,040
of them keeps going up here and one goes
to this group here the other one has to

492
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,050
to this group here the other one has to
 

493
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,260
to this group here the other one has to
extend all the way around and it goes to

494
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,270
extend all the way around and it goes to
 

495
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,910
extend all the way around and it goes to
this next group then on the other side

496
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:48,920
this next group then on the other side
 

497
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,600
this next group then on the other side
much the same stuff happens this is

498
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,610
much the same stuff happens this is
 

499
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,120
much the same stuff happens this is
running a wire a long distance

500
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,130
running a wire a long distance
 

501
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,110
running a wire a long distance
so much redstone and just by chance that

502
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120
so much redstone and just by chance that

for these storage areas I did them out

516
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,310
for these storage areas I did them out
 

517
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,319
for these storage areas I did them out
of wooden planks it mostly because it

518
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:42,329
of wooden planks it mostly because it
 

519
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,540
of wooden planks it mostly because it
blends in with the chests pretty good

520
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:44,550
blends in with the chests pretty good
 

521
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,879
blends in with the chests pretty good
cuz they're both a similar color also

522
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:46,889
cuz they're both a similar color also
 

523
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,949
cuz they're both a similar color also
blends in with glowstone nicely and

524
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
blends in with glowstone nicely and
 

525
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,319
blends in with glowstone nicely and
sandstone that's why I chose that

526
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:53,329
sandstone that's why I chose that
 

527
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:56,559
sandstone that's why I chose that
so probably keep them three chests high

528
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:56,569
so probably keep them three chests high
 

529
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:59,269
so probably keep them three chests high
below the bottom one is glowstone to

530
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
below the bottom one is glowstone to
 

531
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,660
below the bottom one is glowstone to
brighten up the area and I'll probably

532
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:02,670
brighten up the area and I'll probably
 

533
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:10,939
brighten up the area and I'll probably
put stairs at the top like this and that

534
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:10,949
put stairs at the top like this and that
 

535
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:14,179
put stairs at the top like this and that
will make it look like a solid block but

536
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:14,189
will make it look like a solid block but
 

537
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:16,160
will make it look like a solid block but
it's not so you can still open the chest

538
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,170
it's not so you can still open the chest
 

539
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,249
it's not so you can still open the chest
which is pretty cool and a good tip I

540
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:19,259
which is pretty cool and a good tip I
 

541
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,470
which is pretty cool and a good tip I
got from you guys is I should color code

542
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:21,480
got from you guys is I should color code
 

543
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,050
got from you guys is I should color code
these by putting the wool blocks behind

544
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,060
these by putting the wool blocks behind
 

545
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,960
these by putting the wool blocks behind
the chest so you'll still be able to see

546
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:26,970
the chest so you'll still be able to see
 

547
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,829
the chest so you'll still be able to see
them I'm hoping you can color coat the

548
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:30,839
them I'm hoping you can color coat the
 

549
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,920
them I'm hoping you can color coat the
chests I'm not sure if each potion will

550
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:33,930
chests I'm not sure if each potion will
 

551
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,449
chests I'm not sure if each potion will
have its own unique color but we'll I

552
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:38,459
have its own unique color but we'll I
 

553
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,069
have its own unique color but we'll I
don't know we'll see what happens that

554
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
don't know we'll see what happens that
 

555
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,870
don't know we'll see what happens that
then I'll probably have signs saying

556
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:41,880
then I'll probably have signs saying
 

557
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,230
then I'll probably have signs saying
what's in the chest as well we need to

558
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
what's in the chest as well we need to
 

559
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,579
what's in the chest as well we need to
work on a ceiling and air force maybe

560
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:50,589

too just so we can connect together and
 

585
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,669
too just so we can connect together and
then behind that I'll probably put

586
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:44,679
then behind that I'll probably put
 

587
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:57,480
then behind that I'll probably put
glowstone yeah that's good so I'll do

00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:34,850
see how quick we can get down with our
efficiency forward to it still takes a

636
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:34,860
efficiency forward to it still takes a
 

637
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,950
efficiency forward to it still takes a
lot yeah flint every time it's cool I

638
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:39,960
lot yeah flint every time it's cool I
 

639
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,480
lot yeah flint every time it's cool I
want to see if it works on these

640
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:41,490
want to see if it works on these
 

641
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:53,210
want to see if it works on these
mushrooms too - don't really harvest a

642
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:53,220
mushrooms too - don't really harvest a
 

643
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,739
mushrooms too - don't really harvest a
whole lot of mushrooms so I don't know I

644
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:54,749
whole lot of mushrooms so I don't know I
 

645
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:59,029
whole lot of mushrooms so I don't know I
don't have anything to compare it to but

646
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,039
don't have anything to compare it to but
 

647
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,580
don't have anything to compare it to but
I don't think it's helping could be

648
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:01,590
I don't think it's helping could be
 

649
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:14,659
I don't think it's helping could be
wrong probably get more seeds but that's

650
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:14,669
wrong probably get more seeds but that's
 

651
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:15,590
wrong probably get more seeds but that's
pretty much useless

652
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
pretty much useless
 

653
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,799
pretty much useless
so yeah I'll probably just use it like a

654
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:18,809
so yeah I'll probably just use it like a
 

655
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:24,139
so yeah I'll probably just use it like a
regular shovel all right back in the

656
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:24,149
regular shovel all right back in the
 

657
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:26,269
regular shovel all right back in the

I got it organized that was a another
big part and I even put some ingredients

664
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:33,389
big part and I even put some ingredients
 

665
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:35,869
big part and I even put some ingredients
in the dispensers so we will be able to

666
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:35,879
in the dispensers so we will be able to
 

667
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:38,919
in the dispensers so we will be able to
test this this episode which is good

668
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:38,929
test this this episode which is good
 

669
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,930
test this this episode which is good

resistant ones so they're kind of

716
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:57,670
resistant ones so they're kind of
 

717
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,070
resistant ones so they're kind of
grouped together then over here there's

718
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,080
grouped together then over here there's
 

719
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,650
grouped together then over here there's
also sugar these are what I'll probably

720
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:01,660
also sugar these are what I'll probably
 

721
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,460
also sugar these are what I'll probably
make the most of of anything and then we

722
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:05,470
make the most of of anything and then we
 

723
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,150
make the most of of anything and then we
have two negative ingredients that

724
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,160
have two negative ingredients that
 

725
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,830
have two negative ingredients that
fermented spider eyes and then the

fermented spider eyes and then the
 

727
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,410
fermented spider eyes and then the
spider eyes and you use those to make

728
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:13,420
spider eyes and you use those to make

to the center it's quite a quite a ways
 

773
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,290
to the center it's quite a quite a ways
it will take a few seconds so redstone I

you use these quite a lot if you're
 

799
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,040
you use these quite a lot if you're
using if you're making negative potions

800
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,050
using if you're making negative potions
 

801
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,470
using if you're making negative potions
so I wanted them somewhere in between

whole lot at first but once that get a
mob system going I'll probably use it a

822
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
mob system going I'll probably use it a
 

823
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,800
mob system going I'll probably use it a
ton so I wanted that to be a quick

so to fill these just go like like this
 

875
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,410
so to fill these just go like like this
and if we don't have enough inventory

876
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:14,420
and if we don't have enough inventory
 

877
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,100
and if we don't have enough inventory
space they'll get thrown up onto the

878
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,110
space they'll get thrown up onto the
 

879
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,050
space they'll get thrown up onto the
ground right at our feet and we just go

880
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,060
ground right at our feet and we just go
 

881
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:27,150
ground right at our feet and we just go
go around loading them in it's pretty

882
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,160
go around loading them in it's pretty
 

883
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,560
go around loading them in it's pretty
pretty simple you don't have to make a

884
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:29,570
pretty simple you don't have to make a
 

885
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,330
pretty simple you don't have to make a
bunch of trips back and forth to the

886
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:31,340
bunch of trips back and forth to the
 

887
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,840
bunch of trips back and forth to the
chest

888
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:31,850
chest
 

889
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,660

pick up your water water bottles this

890
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:34,670
pick up your water water bottles this
 

891
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,580
pick up your water water bottles this
way which is nice

892
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:39,590

 

893
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,860

I'm a little worried that those

894
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:41,870
I'm a little worried that those
 

895
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,770
I'm a little worried that those
dispensers are going to shoot out over

896
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:44,780
dispensers are going to shoot out over
 

897
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,560
dispensers are going to shoot out over
top each other now because in that that

898
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:47,570
top each other now because in that that
 

899
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,860
top each other now because in that that
first test there was one we only got 29

900
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:50,870
first test there was one we only got 29
 

901
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,850
first test there was one we only got 29
bottles instead of 31 landed on a

902
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:53,860
bottles instead of 31 landed on a
 

903
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,580
bottles instead of 31 landed on a
dispenser on the other side so we'll see

904
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:57,590
dispenser on the other side so we'll see
 

905
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,930
dispenser on the other side so we'll see
how this goes that might have just been

906
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:58,940
how this goes that might have just been
 

907
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:05,210
how this goes that might have just been
a very rare case

908
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,220

 

909
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,419

and 30 as you can see is kind of tedious

910
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:08,429
and 30 as you can see is kind of tedious
 

911
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:11,330
and 30 as you can see is kind of tedious
that took probably close to a minute

912
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,340
that took probably close to a minute
 

913
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,610
that took probably close to a minute
just loading up the bottles but a lot

916
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:17,400
easier than it would be if you did this
 

917
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,149
easier than it would be if you did this
just randomly day now we get our nether

918
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
just randomly day now we get our nether
 

919
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:31,820
just randomly day now we get our nether
warts should get 10 9 10 great so really

you could just press this button and

922
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:32,940
you could just press this button and
 

923
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,880
you could just press this button and
press this when we get the two at the

924
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:34,890
press this when we get the two at the
 

925
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,230
press this when we get the two at the
same time and then you go around loading

926
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
same time and then you go around loading
 

927
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:46,850
same time and then you go around loading
loading these up to make awkward potions

928
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:46,860
loading these up to make awkward potions
 

929
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,159
loading these up to make awkward potions
from the water bottles which I think you

930
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:52,169
from the water bottles which I think you
 

931
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,930
from the water bottles which I think you
can make every potion from an awkward

932
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:53,940
can make every potion from an awkward
 

933
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,700
can make every potion from an awkward
potion so that's why we're doing it like

934
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:55,710
potion so that's why we're doing it like
 

935
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,490
potion so that's why we're doing it like
this instead of making thick potions and

936
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:58,500
this instead of making thick potions and
 

937
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,750
this instead of making thick potions and
mundane potions you pretty much just do

938
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:02,760
mundane potions you pretty much just do
 

939
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,030
mundane potions you pretty much just do
an awkward potion every time

940
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,040

 

941
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,160
