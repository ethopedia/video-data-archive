554
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
oh man okay this is going to
 

555
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,470
oh man okay this is going to
take a long time i think to build

556
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
take a long time i think to build
 

557
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,870
take a long time i think to build
yeah okay i just want to do this with

558

you guys so i want to
 

561
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,110
you guys so i want to
anvil up there and then we're going to

562
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
anvil up there and then we're going to
 

563
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,430
anvil up there and then we're going to
put a bunch of anvils on top i tested

564
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
put a bunch of anvils on top i tested
 

565
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,870
put a bunch of anvils on top i tested
this out in creative they don't

566
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
this out in creative they don't
 

567
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,990
this out in creative they don't
really take damage usually when you

568
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
really take damage usually when you
 

569
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,670

are just dropping them one block like

570
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
are just dropping them one block like
 

571
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,269
are just dropping them one block like
that

that
 

573
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,269
that
so i think we can do that and

574
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
so i think we can do that and
 

575
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,949
so i think we can do that and
i don't want to see the other anvils

576
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
i don't want to see the other anvils
 

577
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,389
i don't want to see the other anvils
though so we got to put like a block

578
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
though so we got to put like a block
 

579
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,470
though so we got to put like a block
right there to hide it so that's the

580
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
right there to hide it so that's the
 

581
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,470
right there to hide it so that's the
height of our enchanting area

582
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
height of our enchanting area
 

583
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:10,150
height of our enchanting area

641
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,470
i want it right right there good
yeah that's that's like the build limit

642
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
yeah that's that's like the build limit
 

643
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,910
yeah that's that's like the build limit
right there

644
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
right there
 

645
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,190
right there
and then fences on top

646
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
and then fences on top
 

647
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,910
and then fences on top
so this will be like the floor up here

648
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
so this will be like the floor up here
 

649
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,110

at this height here

650
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
at this height here
 

651
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,550
at this height here
and then you can look down into the

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,310
like a little water fountain

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,350
and then have a pool of water uh like

842
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
that goes like this
 

843
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,830
that goes like this
kind of but i'm not sure

844
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840

 

845
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,150

912
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
i think at this level too so that uh
 

913
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,350
i think at this level too so that uh
i like this so that like the fence still

i like this so that like the fence still
 

915
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,350
i like this so that like the fence still
stops you here but you

916
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
stops you here but you
 

917
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,789
stops you here but you
you get a nice view otherwise you're

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
slime block or something there
 

1249
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,549
slime block or something there
oh man

1250
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559

 

1251
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,590

why is this one not working

1254
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919

 

1255
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,070

it does retract oh how can we look at

1256
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
it does retract oh how can we look at
 

1257
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,269
it does retract oh how can we look at
what's wrong there okay it's over here

1258
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
what's wrong there okay it's over here
 

1259

he is there
 

1261
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,789
he is there
there's a slime block there

1262
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799

 

1263
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,149

oh here we go i bet you that was doing

1264

it
 

1267
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,190
it
let's try again the slime block was

1268
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
let's try again the slime block was
 

1269
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,830
let's try again the slime block was
sticking to that

1270
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
sticking to that
 

1271
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,269
sticking to that
oh actually let's leave it there one

1272
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
oh actually let's leave it there one
 

1273
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,789
oh actually let's leave it there one
more time just so we can get them all in

1274
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
more time just so we can get them all in
 

1275
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,070
more time just so we can get them all in
the same place

1276
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
the same place
 

1277
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,269
the same place
ah it doesn't matter actually

1278
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
ah it doesn't matter actually
 

1279
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,390
ah it doesn't matter actually
doesn't matter

1280
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
doesn't matter
 

1281
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,830
doesn't matter
there we go

1282
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840

 

1283
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,669

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,830
you know what i got some water there too
i just realized

1286
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
i just realized
 

1287
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,430
i just realized
oh i need a water budget now this is

1288
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
oh i need a water budget now this is
 

1289
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,590
oh i need a water budget now this is
going terribly i just wanted to trade

1290
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
going terribly i just wanted to trade

1295
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,870

okay i think i can reach it there we go

1296
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:44,880
okay i think i can reach it there we go
 

1297
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,110
okay i think i can reach it there we go
everything is good

1298
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,120
everything is good
 

1299
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,230
everything is good
so this guy is really cool he's got the

1300
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
so this guy is really cool he's got the
 

1301
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,350
so this guy is really cool he's got the
great pick it's cheap 12 emeralds that's

1302
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
great pick it's cheap 12 emeralds that's
 

1303
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,149
great pick it's cheap 12 emeralds that's
nothing

1304
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159

 

1305
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,750

let's buy two of them i just want to try

1306
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,760
let's buy two of them i just want to try
 

1307
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,230
let's buy two of them i just want to try
something if we were to combine these we

1308
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
something if we were to combine these we
 

1309
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,070
something if we were to combine these we
would get efficiency for unbreaking

1310
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,080
would get efficiency for unbreaking
 

1311
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,990
would get efficiency for unbreaking
three how many levels is that going to

1312
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,000
three how many levels is that going to
 

1313
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,669
three how many levels is that going to
cost

1314
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
cost
 

1315
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,350
cost
because we could straight up by

1316
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360
because we could straight up by
 

1317
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,830
because we could straight up by
efficiency for unbreaking three for

1318
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
efficiency for unbreaking three for
 

1319
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,669
efficiency for unbreaking three for
24 emeralds there and 10 levels

1320
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
24 emeralds there and 10 levels
 

1321
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,190
24 emeralds there and 10 levels
okay all right that's interesting

1322
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
okay all right that's interesting
 

1323
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,750
okay all right that's interesting
the other great thing about this though

1324
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
the other great thing about this though
 

1325
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,630
the other great thing about this though
i think you need

1326
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
i think you need
 

1327
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,870
i think you need
it's either efficiency two or efficiency

1328
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
it's either efficiency two or efficiency
 

1329
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,190
it's either efficiency two or efficiency
three i think it's two

1330
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
three i think it's two
 

1331
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,870
three i think it's two
once you get that oh i disabled this so

1332
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
once you get that oh i disabled this so
 

1333
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,389
once you get that oh i disabled this so
that we can move them

1334
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
