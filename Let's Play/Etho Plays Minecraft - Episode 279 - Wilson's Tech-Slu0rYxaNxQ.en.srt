67
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,069
components attitudes since last time I
show this and one of those the one we're

68
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
show this and one of those the one we're
 

69
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,310

this handles all the updates and all the

72
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:46,979
this handles all the updates and all the
 

73
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,850
this handles all the updates and all the
crazy stuff you see back here this this

74
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860
crazy stuff you see back here this this
 

75
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,969
crazy stuff you see back here this this
is what drives it all his heart once we

76
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:52,979
is what drives it all his heart once we
 

77
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,060
is what drives it all his heart once we
boot this up he's actually going to

78
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,070
boot this up he's actually going to
 

79
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,959
boot this up he's actually going to
start running so all I got to do is

80
00:01:59,959 --> 00:01:59,969
start running so all I got to do is
 

81
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,090
start running so all I got to do is
connect this and we'll probably get

82
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,100
connect this and we'll probably get
 

83
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,980
connect this and we'll probably get
quite a bit of lag because it's running

84
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:03,990
quite a bit of lag because it's running
 

85
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,749
quite a bit of lag because it's running
faster than I wanted to when it's

86
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
faster than I wanted to when it's
 

87
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,029
faster than I wanted to when it's
actually when we actually enter beta

88
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:08,039
actually when we actually enter beta
 

89
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,510

like a status report of where we're at
with this project and we'll go down the

104
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,270
with this project and we'll go down the
 

105
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,030
with this project and we'll go down the
back and see some of the wiring working

106
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
back and see some of the wiring working
 

107
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,190
back and see some of the wiring working
and then I'll get you involved with some

108
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
and then I'll get you involved with some
 

109

of the planning and and research for
some of the other components we got to

112
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,530
some of the other components we got to
 

113
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,620
some of the other components we got to
add to this yet

114
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:38,630
add to this yet
 

115
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,300
add to this yet
and then hopefully later we'll go do

116
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,310
and then hopefully later we'll go do
 

117
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,199
and then hopefully later we'll go do
something else too

118
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,209
something else too
 

119
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,670
something else too
something a little less time-consuming

120
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
something a little less time-consuming
 

121
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,820

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,510
this - so the age let's go on up here
 

145
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,720
this - so the age let's go on up here
real quick I've showed this before you

146
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:26,730
real quick I've showed this before you
 

147

real quick I've showed this before you
know those variable things well he has

148
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:28,769
know those variable things well he has
 

149
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:36,740
know those variable things well he has
an age variable really where let's be

150
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:36,750
an age variable really where let's be
 

151
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,590
an age variable really where let's be
down below somewhere hopefully there's

152
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:39,600
down below somewhere hopefully there's
 

153
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,350
down below somewhere hopefully there's
no creepers okay so you saw that every

154
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:42,360
no creepers okay so you saw that every
 

155
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,300

time the heart beats it sends a pulse to

156
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,310
time the heart beats it sends a pulse to
 

157
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,100
time the heart beats it sends a pulse to
this wire and that goes to this dropper

158
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,110
this wire and that goes to this dropper
 

159
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,350
this wire and that goes to this dropper
here and then it sends one item from

160
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,360
here and then it sends one item from
 

161
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,080
here and then it sends one item from
here into this and it this is basically

162
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,090
here into this and it this is basically
 

163
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,069
here into this and it this is basically
how old Wilson is right now he's 20 out

164
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,079
how old Wilson is right now he's 20 out
 

165
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,240
how old Wilson is right now he's 20 out
of 576 that's all this will hold and

166
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,250
of 576 that's all this will hold and
 

167
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,910
of 576 that's all this will hold and
he's running a lot faster than he will

168
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
he's running a lot faster than he will
 

169
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,370
he's running a lot faster than he will
when he's officially done because I just

170
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,380
when he's officially done because I just
 

171
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,199
when he's officially done because I just
I'm just testing it right now

172
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,209
I'm just testing it right now
 

173
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:12,289
I'm just testing it right now
if we take that number 576 and we if we

174
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:12,299
if we take that number 576 and we if we
 

175
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,849
if we take that number 576 and we if we
were to make his heart beat once every

176
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:13,859
were to make his heart beat once every
 

177
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,039
were to make his heart beat once every
minute or for him to update every minute

178
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:18,049
minute or for him to update every minute
 

179
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,900
minute or for him to update every minute
576 minutes divided by 60 that's like

180
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:20,910
576 minutes divided by 60 that's like
 

181
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,440
576 minutes divided by 60 that's like
nine point six hours it would take for

182
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,450
nine point six hours it would take for
 

183
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,749
nine point six hours it would take for
his age to get all the way up

184
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:26,759
his age to get all the way up
 

185
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,550
his age to get all the way up
and even that I think might be a little

186
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
and even that I think might be a little
 

187
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,219
and even that I think might be a little
too quick so we'll probably make that

188
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:31,229
too quick so we'll probably make that
 

189
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,540
too quick so we'll probably make that
move only every two or three minutes so

190
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:35,550
move only every two or three minutes so
 

191
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,350
move only every two or three minutes so
he'll live about 20 30 hours or so if we

192
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
he'll live about 20 30 hours or so if we
 

193
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,899
he'll live about 20 30 hours or so if we
can keep them alive that long so this as

194
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:43,909
can keep them alive that long so this as
 

195
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,300
can keep them alive that long so this as
as more and more items get added I'm

196
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,310
as more and more items get added I'm
 

197
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,149
as more and more items get added I'm
going to watch my popcorn here more and

198
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:50,159
going to watch my popcorn here more and
 

199
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,800
going to watch my popcorn here more and
more items get added to here they'll go

200
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:51,810
more items get added to here they'll go
 

201
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,219
more items get added to here they'll go
out further and further Oh or this

202
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:55,229
out further and further Oh or this
 

203
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,409
out further and further Oh or this
further and further these lights will

204
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:57,419
further and further these lights will
 

205
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,110
further and further these lights will
turn on alright that's how the ADA is

206
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,120
turn on alright that's how the ADA is
 

207
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,129
turn on alright that's how the ADA is
being handled at the moments health is

208
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:04,139
being handled at the moments health is
 

209
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,969
being handled at the moments health is
working pretty much entirely health this

210
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:07,979
working pretty much entirely health this
 

211
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,980
working pretty much entirely health this
top left one this is what determines

212
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:09,990
top left one this is what determines
 

213
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,159
top left one this is what determines
whether or not he dies if this goes all

214
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:13,169
whether or not he dies if this goes all
 

215
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,649
whether or not he dies if this goes all
the way down to zero he will die and his

216
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:15,659
the way down to zero he will die and his
 

217
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:19,129
the way down to zero he will die and his
heart will actually stop beating so then

218
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:19,139
heart will actually stop beating so then
 

219
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,379
heart will actually stop beating so then
we'll see what at what age he was when

220
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:21,389
we'll see what at what age he was when
 

221
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,209
we'll see what at what age he was when
he died and all that the health takes

222
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:26,219
he died and all that the health takes
 

223
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,700
he died and all that the health takes
into account his weights his happiness

224
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:28,710
into account his weights his happiness
 

225
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,249
into account his weights his happiness
and his hunger if all three of those are

226
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:31,259
and his hunger if all three of those are
 

227
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,350
and his hunger if all three of those are
good is his health will increase if

228
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
good is his health will increase if
 

229
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,390
good is his health will increase if
they're bad they'll go down if they're

230
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
they're bad they'll go down if they're
 

231
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,230
they're bad they'll go down if they're
average it'll just kind of stay the same

232
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
average it'll just kind of stay the same
 

233
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,240
average it'll just kind of stay the same
so we this is the main thing we got a

234
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,250
so we this is the main thing we got a
 

235
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,740
so we this is the main thing we got a
watch make sure it doesn't go down and

236
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:42,750
watch make sure it doesn't go down and
 

237
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,050
watch make sure it doesn't go down and
it changes very slowly to happiness I

238
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,060
it changes very slowly to happiness I
 

239
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,040
it changes very slowly to happiness I
have not really set up to work yet oh we

240
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,050
have not really set up to work yet oh we
 

241
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,540
have not really set up to work yet oh we
can actually I think the hunger has gone

242
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:53,550
can actually I think the hunger has gone
 

243
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,779
can actually I think the hunger has gone
down quite a bit since we started it up

244
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:55,789
down quite a bit since we started it up
 

245
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,929
down quite a bit since we started it up
I haven't really oh there goes he's

246
00:05:59,929 --> 00:05:59,939
I haven't really oh there goes he's
 

247
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,529
I haven't really oh there goes he's
starving to death no so if he was at

248
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:03,539
starving to death no so if he was at
 

249
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,899
starving to death no so if he was at
this state right now he would be losing

250
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:05,909
this state right now he would be losing
 

251
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:10,100
this state right now he would be losing
lots of health every update in fact I

252
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,110
lots of health every update in fact I
 

253
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,990
lots of health every update in fact I
kind of thought it would have gone down

254
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
kind of thought it would have gone down
 

255
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,350
kind of thought it would have gone down
by now let's go check that out

256
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,360
by now let's go check that out
 

257
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,700
by now let's go check that out
all right I think I figured out why the

258
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:16,710
all right I think I figured out why the
 

259
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,670
all right I think I figured out why the
health wasn't going down it's because I

260
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,680
health wasn't going down it's because I
 

261
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,079
health wasn't going down it's because I
overfilled this there's only supposed to

262
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,089
overfilled this there's only supposed to
 

263
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,379
overfilled this there's only supposed to
be 200 items in something this quick

264
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:24,389
be 200 items in something this quick
 

265
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,600
be 200 items in something this quick
okay so that should be full health right

266
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,610
okay so that should be full health right
 

267
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,389
okay so that should be full health right
there and every update should happen any

268
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:32,399
there and every update should happen any
 

269
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,159
there and every update should happen any
second here we can probably see the

270
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,169
second here we can probably see the
 

271
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,209
second here we can probably see the
wires do crazy things if we look this is

272
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:38,219
wires do crazy things if we look this is
 

273
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,070
wires do crazy things if we look this is
empty

274
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,080

 

275
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,760

all right oh why is that pulsing Dayton

276
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,770
all right oh why is that pulsing Dayton
 

277
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,089
all right oh why is that pulsing Dayton
I got a lot of bug fixing and stuff so

278
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:52,099
I got a lot of bug fixing and stuff so
 

279
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:56,679
I got a lot of bug fixing and stuff so
we lost for health that update let's see

280
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:56,689
we lost for health that update let's see
 

281
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,119
we lost for health that update let's see
if it does it again this is not supposed

282
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:58,129
if it does it again this is not supposed
 

283
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:02,909
if it does it again this is not supposed
to be doing that that pissed in there

284
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:02,919
to be doing that that pissed in there
 

285
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,610
to be doing that that pissed in there
come on come on what I wonder it's mean

286
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:09,620
come on come on what I wonder it's mean
 

287
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,279
come on come on what I wonder it's mean
power from zip from above huh

288
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:17,289
power from zip from above huh
 

289
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:20,679
power from zip from above huh
so yeah you saw all the pulses in this

290
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:20,689
so yeah you saw all the pulses in this
 

291
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,420
so yeah you saw all the pulses in this
one is decreasing the health all the

292
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,430
one is decreasing the health all the
 

293
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,790
one is decreasing the health all the
pulses in this one is increasing it per

294
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
pulses in this one is increasing it per
 

295
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,610
pulses in this one is increasing it per
update and it bounces out to being a

296
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:27,620
update and it bounces out to being a
 

297
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,909
update and it bounces out to being a
loss of for every update at the moment

298
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:30,919
loss of for every update at the moment
 

299
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,939
loss of for every update at the moment
with the current health and weights and

300
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:33,949
with the current health and weights and
 

301
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,420
with the current health and weights and
happiness stats so if we left them like

302
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,430
happiness stats so if we left them like
 

303
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,070
happiness stats so if we left them like
this eventually he would die I think we

304
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,080
this eventually he would die I think we
 

305
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,730
this eventually he would die I think we
have to do something to improve is is

306
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:42,740
have to do something to improve is is
 

307
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,879
have to do something to improve is is
stat point so we can we can feed them

308
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:45,889
stat point so we can we can feed them
 

309
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,129
stat point so we can we can feed them
and that will that will help them out a

310
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:48,139
and that will that will help them out a
 

311
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,329
and that will that will help them out a
lot um

312
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:49,339
lot um
 

313
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:53,829
lot um
and feed them steak and then you gain

314
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:53,839
and feed them steak and then you gain
 

315
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,670
and feed them steak and then you gain
some health or some hunger quite a bit

316
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:56,680

if you overfeed him like if you give
 

335
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,089
if you overfeed him like if you give
them too much food at a time he'll gain

336

periods of time his health or his weight
 

343
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,519
periods of time his health or his weight
will slowly go down as well this changes

344
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:39,529
will slowly go down as well this changes
 

345
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,219
will slowly go down as well this changes
pretty slowly ideally you want it to be

346
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:42,229
pretty slowly ideally you want it to be
 

347
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,610
pretty slowly ideally you want it to be
at level 3 here but yeah the manage is

348
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:45,620
at level 3 here but yeah the manage is
 

349

I think like every update it decreases

352
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:49,670
I think like every update it decreases
 

353
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,280
I think like every update it decreases
by a little bit like you just saw it go

354
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,290
by a little bit like you just saw it go
 

355
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,519
by a little bit like you just saw it go
down what by 1 there if he over eats

356
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:54,529
down what by 1 there if he over eats
 

357
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:57,340
down what by 1 there if he over eats
it increases quite a bit if he's

358
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,350
it increases quite a bit if he's
 

359
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,509
it increases quite a bit if he's
starving then it's really going to

360
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
starving then it's really going to
 

361
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,420
starving then it's really going to
decrease so there's there's a bit of a

362
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,430
decrease so there's there's a bit of a
 

363
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,509
decrease so there's there's a bit of a
control method to it poor poor Wilson

to these hopper timers I replaced all

390
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:46,610
to these hopper timers I replaced all
 

391
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,900
to these hopper timers I replaced all
the repeaters we had here with these and

we can control how long this wire stays
 

395
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,739
we can control how long this wire stays
on based on how many items we have in

many pulses that works out too but we

406
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:11,779
many pulses that works out too but we
 

407
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,840
many pulses that works out too but we
can try fake a feeding here this turns

408
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:16,850
can try fake a feeding here this turns
 

409
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,249
can try fake a feeding here this turns
on and this was pulsing as that was on

410
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:20,259
on and this was pulsing as that was on
 

411
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:27,790

this adds food to his hunger um up here

412
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:27,800
this adds food to his hunger um up here
 

413
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,829
this adds food to his hunger um up here
it branches off a bunch of different

414
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
it branches off a bunch of different
 

415
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,860
it branches off a bunch of different
directions that's to is hunger variable

416
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:32,870
directions that's to is hunger variable
 

417
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,819
directions that's to is hunger variable
over there it also goes to this this is

418
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:36,829
over there it also goes to this this is
 

419
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,949
over there it also goes to this this is
what determines if he's over eaten or

420
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
what determines if he's over eaten or
 

421
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,169
what determines if he's over eaten or
not there's a small buffer here that

422
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:41,179
not there's a small buffer here that
 

423
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,860
not there's a small buffer here that
replenishes overtime so I think a steak

424
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:44,870
replenishes overtime so I think a steak
 

425
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,249
replenishes overtime so I think a steak
takes a weight around 20 or so cobbles

426
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:48,259
takes a weight around 20 or so cobbles
 

427
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,669
takes a weight around 20 or so cobbles
so if you give them two steaks in a row

428
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:50,679
so if you give them two steaks in a row
 

429
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,090
so if you give them two steaks in a row
he will gain the double weight penalty

430
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,100
he will gain the double weight penalty
 

431
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,139
he will gain the double weight penalty
for like four ten of those points or so

432
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:58,149
for like four ten of those points or so
 

433
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,280
for like four ten of those points or so
right I don't know something like that

this is the bladder system I showed this

436
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:04,850
this is the bladder system I showed this
 

437
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,210
this is the bladder system I showed this
in a video not too recently and sort of

438
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:07,220
in a video not too recently and sort of
 

439
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,410
in a video not too recently and sort of
explained it

440

475
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:07,990

as crazy as it sounds up here so this is

476
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
as crazy as it sounds up here so this is
 

477
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,019
as crazy as it sounds up here so this is
a randomizer based on how healthy is he

478
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:11,029
a randomizer based on how healthy is he
 

479
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,750
a randomizer based on how healthy is he
as a is a lower chance of getting city

480
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
as a is a lower chance of getting city
 

481
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,750
as a is a lower chance of getting city
bees healthy and a higher one if he's

482
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
bees healthy and a higher one if he's
 

483
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,569
bees healthy and a higher one if he's
unhealthy on this is just a bunch of

484
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:19,579
unhealthy on this is just a bunch of
 

485
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:24,250
unhealthy on this is just a bunch of
hopper randomizers every updates it goes

486
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,260
hopper randomizers every updates it goes
 

487
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,880
hopper randomizers every updates it goes
to this one if that goes through it goes

488
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:27,890
to this one if that goes through it goes
 

489
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,930
to this one if that goes through it goes
to here and it will send a pulse into

490
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:31,940
to here and it will send a pulse into
 

491
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,439
to here and it will send a pulse into
those blocks if he's unhealthy we can

492
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:35,449
those blocks if he's unhealthy we can
 

493
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,800
those blocks if he's unhealthy we can
fake it let's take away some of his

494
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:38,810
fake it let's take away some of his
 

495
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,150
fake it let's take away some of his
health right so two of these Pistons

496
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,160
health right so two of these Pistons
 

497
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,019
health right so two of these Pistons
went out right now he's probably it to

498
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:47,029
went out right now he's probably it to
 

499
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,519
went out right now he's probably it to
health maybe OOP so hard to show you

500
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:51,529
health maybe OOP so hard to show you
 

501
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:55,389
health maybe OOP so hard to show you
guys stuff here the disaster yeah so

502
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:55,399
guys stuff here the disaster yeah so
 

503
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,800
guys stuff here the disaster yeah so
he's at two health right now now every

504
00:12:59,800 --> 00:12:59,810
he's at two health right now now every
 

505
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,770
he's at two health right now now every
updates um

506
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:04,780

 

507
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,940

this receives a pulse the sing here and

508
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:08,950
this receives a pulse the sing here and
 

509
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,390
this receives a pulse the sing here and
if it happens to work out that the sword

510
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:12,400
if it happens to work out that the sword
 

511
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,040
if it happens to work out that the sword
goes into the hopper it will send the

512
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,050
goes into the hopper it will send the
 

513
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,800
goes into the hopper it will send the
signal all the way to here and all the

514
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,810
signal all the way to here and all the
 

515
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,720
signal all the way to here and all the
ones that have a block in front it will

516
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:21,730
ones that have a block in front it will
 

517
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,720
ones that have a block in front it will
send to these other randomizers and the

518
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:24,730
send to these other randomizers and the
 

519
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,010
send to these other randomizers and the
more of these that get activated a

520
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,020
more of these that get activated a
 

521
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,830
more of these that get activated a
higher chance he will get sick and that

522
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:28,840
higher chance he will get sick and that
 

523
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,400
higher chance he will get sick and that
goes to here and to this piston which

524
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,410
goes to here and to this piston which
 

525
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,350
goes to here and to this piston which
then sends this out as an RS nor latch

526
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:36,360
then sends this out as an RS nor latch
 

527
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,830
then sends this out as an RS nor latch
crazy all right let's see let's let's

528
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:43,840
crazy all right let's see let's let's
 

529
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,670
crazy all right let's see let's let's
force this will make them get sick my

530
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
force this will make them get sick my
 

531
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,560
force this will make them get sick my
force here again so one a nine chance of

532
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,570
force here again so one a nine chance of
 

533
00:13:52,570 --> 00:14:00,540
force here again so one a nine chance of
this gain triggered come on no we are

534
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,550
this gain triggered come on no we are
 

535
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,280
this gain triggered come on no we are
just messing them up there we go so that

536
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,290
just messing them up there we go so that
 

537
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,330
just messing them up there we go so that
got triggered and I don't know if this

538
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,340
got triggered and I don't know if this
 

539
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,580
got triggered and I don't know if this
randomizer now so he didn't get sick

540
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:08,590
randomizer now so he didn't get sick
 

541
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,140
randomizer now so he didn't get sick
this time because out of these out of

542
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,150
this time because out of these out of
 

543
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,150
this time because out of these out of
these two hoppers the sword didn't go up

544
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,160
these two hoppers the sword didn't go up
 

545
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
these two hoppers the sword didn't go up
when it received a power pulse so it's

546
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,170
when it received a power pulse so it's
 

547
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,270
when it received a power pulse so it's
very rare that he's actually going to

548
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,280
very rare that he's actually going to
 

549
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,670
very rare that he's actually going to
get sick um if he does get sick though

550
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
get sick um if he does get sick though
 

551
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,840
get sick um if he does get sick though
this extends will just really forcefully

552
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:30,850
this extends will just really forcefully
 

553
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,720
this extends will just really forcefully
make them get sick now okay that makes

554
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:33,730
make them get sick now okay that makes
 

555
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,080
make them get sick now okay that makes
this piston go out as well this line of

556
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,090
this piston go out as well this line of
 

557
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,750
this piston go out as well this line of
wire here is what increases his health

558
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
wire here is what increases his health
 

559
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,730
wire here is what increases his health
so when he's sick it's not possible for

560
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:41,740
so when he's sick it's not possible for
 

561
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,160
so when he's sick it's not possible for
his health to to increase it will only

562
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,170
his health to to increase it will only
 

563
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,800
his health to to increase it will only
decrease until we cure him

564
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:48,810
decrease until we cure him
 

565
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,350
decrease until we cure him
so if he's sick he's going to die really

566
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,360
so if he's sick he's going to die really
 

567
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,510
so if he's sick he's going to die really
quick if we don't cure them and the way

568
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:54,520
quick if we don't cure them and the way
 

569
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,640
quick if we don't cure them and the way
we cure them is with a Golden Apple

570
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:58,650
we cure them is with a Golden Apple
 

571
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:06,020
we cure them is with a Golden Apple
which will you can see if if this wire

572
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,030
which will you can see if if this wire
 

573
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,730
which will you can see if if this wire
is powered it will make the piston

574
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:08,740
is powered it will make the piston
 

575
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,140
is powered it will make the piston
extend and that will go back to this

576
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,150
extend and that will go back to this
 

577
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,750
extend and that will go back to this
this place here so if we follow this

578
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:12,760
this place here so if we follow this
 

579
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,519
this place here so if we follow this
wire

580
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:14,529
wire
 

581
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,549
wire
it will connect to our food detection

582
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:18,559
it will connect to our food detection
 

583
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,929
it will connect to our food detection
system all the way over here at the

584
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:22,939
system all the way over here at the
 

585
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:28,660
system all the way over here at the
start you can do lots to this guy's

586
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:28,670
start you can do lots to this guy's
 

587
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,650
start you can do lots to this guy's
absolutely crazy amount of work this

588
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:32,660
absolutely crazy amount of work this
 

589
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,150
absolutely crazy amount of work this
thing here so this is where that wire

590
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
thing here so this is where that wire
 

591
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,989
thing here so this is where that wire
connects to this is this is what the

592
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:37,999
connects to this is this is what the
 

593
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,910
connects to this is this is what the
text if we gave a medicine or not so if

594
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
text if we gave a medicine or not so if
 

595
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,939
text if we gave a medicine or not so if
we if we give them an Apple that

596
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:42,949
we if we give them an Apple that
 

597
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,829
we if we give them an Apple that
redstone block will go back to the not

598
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:44,839
redstone block will go back to the not
 

599
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,569
redstone block will go back to the not
sick position let's do that I don't

600
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:49,579
sick position let's do that I don't
 

601
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,160
sick position let's do that I don't
think we can get there quick enough to

602
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,170
think we can get there quick enough to
 

603
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,329
think we can get there quick enough to
see it happen

604
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:52,339
see it happen
 

605
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:59,499
see it happen
oh that we missed it it happens pretty

606
00:15:59,499 --> 00:15:59,509
oh that we missed it it happens pretty
 

607
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,600
oh that we missed it it happens pretty
quick so it's back into that spot so

608
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,610
quick so it's back into that spot so
 

609
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,629
quick so it's back into that spot so
he's not sick now that we cured him oh

610
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639

 

611
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,699

no I just that's it for Wilson for today

612
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:11,709
no I just that's it for Wilson for today
 

613
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,809
no I just that's it for Wilson for today
I've been running around here getting

614
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:13,819
I've been running around here getting
 

615
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,449
I've been running around here getting
ready for our next project neglecting

616
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:16,459
ready for our next project neglecting
 

617
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,059
ready for our next project neglecting
him and when I came to check on him he's

618
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:19,069
him and when I came to check on him he's
 

619
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:22,720
him and when I came to check on him he's
he's gone he's dead he ran out of health

620
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:22,730
he's gone he's dead he ran out of health
 

621
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,269
he's gone he's dead he ran out of health
and that that was actually a pretty good

622
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
and that that was actually a pretty good
 

623
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,249
and that that was actually a pretty good
test cell because I can see he made it

624
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:27,259
test cell because I can see he made it
 

625
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,210
test cell because I can see he made it
to level five for his age before he died

626
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,220
to level five for his age before he died
 

627
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,129
to level five for his age before he died
that's with me neglecting him I think he

628
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:33,139
that's with me neglecting him I think he
 

629
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:37,419
that's with me neglecting him I think he
was at like age level two or three where

630
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:37,429
was at like age level two or three where
 

631
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,039
was at like age level two or three where
we were still here and kind of feeding

632

it's not moving basically what happens

658
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:14,299
it's not moving basically what happens
 

659
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,689
it's not moving basically what happens
is this it sends out a power signal to

660
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:16,699
is this it sends out a power signal to
 

661
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,370
is this it sends out a power signal to
this block and that prevents the hopper

662
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:18,380
this block and that prevents the hopper
 

663
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,889
this block and that prevents the hopper
timer from running anymore until this

664
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:20,899
timer from running anymore until this
 

665
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:23,769
timer from running anymore until this
becomes unpowered and that's just

666
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:23,779
becomes unpowered and that's just
 

667
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:27,690
becomes unpowered and that's just
connected to his health stat

668
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:27,700

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:03,500
that I really liked now somebody made
 

687
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,380
that I really liked now somebody made
like this medical station out of a

688
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,390
like this medical station out of a
 

689
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,010
like this medical station out of a
zombie spawner to create villagers like

690
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,020
zombie spawner to create villagers like
 

691
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,840
zombie spawner to create villagers like
it's it's like the villager purifier

692
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:10,850
it's it's like the villager purifier
 

693
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,640
it's it's like the villager purifier
thing I think we're going to build

694
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:12,650
thing I think we're going to build
 

695
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,370
thing I think we're going to build
another one over at our village here

696
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:15,380
another one over at our village here
 

697
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,610
another one over at our village here
just because there's a zombie spawner

698
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:18,620
just because there's a zombie spawner
 

699
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,140
just because there's a zombie spawner
pretty close to here and it would be a

700
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,150
pretty close to here and it would be a
 

701
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,990
pretty close to here and it would be a
lot more convenient than trying to

702
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
lot more convenient than trying to
 

703
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,419
lot more convenient than trying to
transport them from our other one

704
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:24,429
transport them from our other one
 

705
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,620
transport them from our other one
through the nether and all the way over

706
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:26,630
through the nether and all the way over
 

707
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,000
through the nether and all the way over
here so let's give that a shot I think

708
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,010
here so let's give that a shot I think
 

709
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,750
here so let's give that a shot I think
it'll be fun so the zombie spawner is

710
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:34,760
it'll be fun so the zombie spawner is
 

711
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,360
it'll be fun so the zombie spawner is
just down here it's about 50 blocks away

712
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,370
just down here it's about 50 blocks away
 

713
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:44,909
just down here it's about 50 blocks away
or so up these stairs all right here

714
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:44,919
or so up these stairs all right here
 

715
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,919
or so up these stairs all right here
alright so let's get it going here I

716
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:47,929
alright so let's get it going here I
 

717
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,080
alright so let's get it going here I
brought a bunch of sandstone I should

718
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,090
brought a bunch of sandstone I should
 

719
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,880
brought a bunch of sandstone I should
have brought some other stuff I think

720
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:51,890
have brought some other stuff I think
 

721
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,180
have brought some other stuff I think
maybe we didn't use dirt and yes I

722
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,190
maybe we didn't use dirt and yes I
 

723
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,039
maybe we didn't use dirt and yes I
figure what we'll do is we'll make a

724
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,049
figure what we'll do is we'll make a
 

725
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:02,830
figure what we'll do is we'll make a
layer level with the spawner nice 7x7 at

726
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:02,840
layer level with the spawner nice 7x7 at
 

727
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,750
layer level with the spawner nice 7x7 at
least let's go on up there actually the

728
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
least let's go on up there actually the
 

729
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,880
least let's go on up there actually the
idea behind the medical like purifier

730
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:12,890
idea behind the medical like purifier
 

731
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,280
idea behind the medical like purifier
thing I saw is instead of like spawning

732
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,290
thing I saw is instead of like spawning
 

733
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,289
thing I saw is instead of like spawning
zombies and then dropping them in water

734
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:20,299
zombies and then dropping them in water
 

735
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,000
zombies and then dropping them in water
and moving them and separating them

736
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,010
and moving them and separating them
 

737
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,190
and moving them and separating them
getting the villager zombies out from

738
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
getting the villager zombies out from
 

739
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,400
getting the villager zombies out from
the regular zombies I got the post I saw

740
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,410
the regular zombies I got the post I saw
 

741
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,280
the regular zombies I got the post I saw
you just spawn them into a one by one by

742
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,290
you just spawn them into a one by one by
 

743
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,850
you just spawn them into a one by one by
two high area and separate them that way

744
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:39,860
two high area and separate them that way
 

745
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,110
two high area and separate them that way
right from the spa

746
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
right from the spa
 

747
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,040
right from the spa
here so I think I'm going to try build a

748
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,050
here so I think I'm going to try build a
 

749
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:51,549
here so I think I'm going to try build a
sandstone I think so they'll spawn

750
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:51,559
sandstone I think so they'll spawn
 

751
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,640
sandstone I think so they'll spawn
within an 8x8 area of this zombie

752
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,650
within an 8x8 area of this zombie
 

753
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,340
within an 8x8 area of this zombie
spawner so that would be this would be

754
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,350
spawner so that would be this would be
 

755
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,270
spawner so that would be this would be
pretty close to the limit here let's do

756
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,280
pretty close to the limit here let's do
 

757
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,150
pretty close to the limit here let's do
it like this each of these slots here is

758
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,160
it like this each of these slots here is
 

759
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,060
it like this each of these slots here is
going to be where a zombie can spawn we

760
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,070
going to be where a zombie can spawn we
 

761
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,980
going to be where a zombie can spawn we
got to make sure we make it dark though

762
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:11,990
got to make sure we make it dark though
 

763
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,310
got to make sure we make it dark though
so that they'll actually spawn in that

764
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,320
so that they'll actually spawn in that
 

765
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,530
so that they'll actually spawn in that
spot and we'll try to keep the rest of

766
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:17,540
spot and we'll try to keep the rest of
 

767
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,460
spot and we'll try to keep the rest of
the area like over here light so they're

768
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,470
the area like over here light so they're
 

769
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,200
the area like over here light so they're
not spawning next to us or anything like

770
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,210
not spawning next to us or anything like
 

771
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:23,710
not spawning next to us or anything like
that

772
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:23,720
that
 

773
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,910
that
let's make maybe seven spots this is

774
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:30,920
let's make maybe seven spots this is
 

775
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,540
let's make maybe seven spots this is
within range yeah yeah okay yeah let's

776
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:37,550
within range yeah yeah okay yeah let's
 

777
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,870
within range yeah yeah okay yeah let's
do it like that

778
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:39,880
do it like that
 

779
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:52,960
do it like that
okay so we'll put a wall over here all

780
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:52,970
okay so we'll put a wall over here all
 

781
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,150
okay so we'll put a wall over here all
right cool

782
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,160
right cool
 

783
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:04,440
right cool
let's okay okay let's get back up there

784
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,450
let's okay okay let's get back up there
 

785
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,880
let's okay okay let's get back up there
I'm going to make a staircase here just

786
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:06,890
I'm going to make a staircase here just
 

787
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,440
I'm going to make a staircase here just
so I have a feeling I'm going to fall a

788
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,450
so I have a feeling I'm going to fall a
 

789
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:14,730
so I have a feeling I'm going to fall a
lot of times span this out a little bit

790
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:14,740

 

791
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,200

so the idea I have

792
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,210
so the idea I have
 

793
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,120
so the idea I have
let's put half slabs like this I want to

794
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,130
let's put half slabs like this I want to
 

795
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,040
let's put half slabs like this I want to
be able to see the zombies but still

796
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,050
be able to see the zombies but still
 

797
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,600
be able to see the zombies but still
make it dark so that they can spawn

798
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:25,610
make it dark so that they can spawn
 

799
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,020
make it dark so that they can spawn
within these one by one areas so we need

800
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,030
within these one by one areas so we need
 

801
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,480
within these one by one areas so we need
to block out all the lights we can if we

802
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,490
to block out all the lights we can if we
 

803
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,669
to block out all the lights we can if we
did that and then we had a cover over

804
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
did that and then we had a cover over
 

805
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,070
did that and then we had a cover over
top it would be dark enough within that

806
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
top it would be dark enough within that
 

807
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,840
top it would be dark enough within that
area here for them to spawn I think

808
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:47,850

 

809
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,519

even though it looks like light can pass

810
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:50,529
even though it looks like light can pass
 

811
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:53,760
even though it looks like light can pass
through from here to here it can't like

812
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:53,770
through from here to here it can't like
 

813
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,700
through from here to here it can't like
even if it torches right next to this I

814
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:55,710
even if it torches right next to this I
 

815
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,180
even if it torches right next to this I
think that's still a dark spot believe

816
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,190
think that's still a dark spot believe
 

817
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,580
think that's still a dark spot believe
we'll leave that and see if any zombies

818
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:02,590
we'll leave that and see if any zombies
 

819
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,740
we'll leave that and see if any zombies
spawn there what I want to do is put

820
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:07,750
spawn there what I want to do is put
 

821
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:15,799
spawn there what I want to do is put
lamps underneath each of these spots oh

822
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:15,809

 

823
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,480

look at that okay so he did spawn in

824
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:18,490
look at that okay so he did spawn in
 

825
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,560
look at that okay so he did spawn in
there even though it's bright outside

826
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,570
there even though it's bright outside
 

827
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,710
there even though it's bright outside
here no zombies will spawn outside but

828
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
here no zombies will spawn outside but
 

829
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,060
here no zombies will spawn outside but
they'll spawn within each of these

830
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,070
they'll spawn within each of these
 

831
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,370
they'll spawn within each of these
little compartments we're making just

832
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:26,380
little compartments we're making just
 

833
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,639
little compartments we're making just
good then what I want to do on top of

834
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:29,649
good then what I want to do on top of
 

835
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,909
good then what I want to do on top of
each of these lamps put a pressure plate

836
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
each of these lamps put a pressure plate
 

837
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,779
each of these lamps put a pressure plate
so that when they do spawn they will

838
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:35,789
so that when they do spawn they will
 

839
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,789
so that when they do spawn they will
turn the light on and place it yeah I

840
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
turn the light on and place it yeah I
 

841
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,600
turn the light on and place it yeah I
can turn the light on and also maybe

842
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:42,610
can turn the light on and also maybe
 

843
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:50,130
can turn the light on and also maybe
activate some redstone stuff here what I

844
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,140
activate some redstone stuff here what I
 

845
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,580
activate some redstone stuff here what I
would like when they spawn if we could

846
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,590
would like when they spawn if we could
 

847
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,529
would like when they spawn if we could
move this half slab up so that we could

848
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:55,539
move this half slab up so that we could
 

849
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,750
move this half slab up so that we could
see their their face because even if

850
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
see their their face because even if
 

851
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,070
see their their face because even if
this is missing they won't be able to

852
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,080
this is missing they won't be able to
 

853
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,639
this is missing they won't be able to
get out but we need it there before they

854
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:02,649
get out but we need it there before they
 

855
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:10,470
get out but we need it there before they
spawn to keep it dark so Pistons will go

856
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
spawn to keep it dark so Pistons will go
 

857
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:20,279
spawn to keep it dark so Pistons will go
up above then something like that okay I

858
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:20,289
up above then something like that okay I
 

859
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,810
up above then something like that okay I
think we're going to go with this setup

860
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:21,820
think we're going to go with this setup
 

861
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,990
think we're going to go with this setup
here what I want to do is hook up these

862
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,000
here what I want to do is hook up these
 

863
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,120
here what I want to do is hook up these
pressure plates to these Pistons now if

864
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,130
pressure plates to these Pistons now if
 

865
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,980
pressure plates to these Pistons now if
we can so let's

866
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:30,990
we can so let's
 

867
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,139
we can so let's
let's see how do we do this we will put

868
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:36,149
let's see how do we do this we will put
 

869
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:40,970
let's see how do we do this we will put
that's their something-something so they

870
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:40,980
that's their something-something so they
 

871
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,000
that's their something-something so they
can't get out what I want actually is to

872
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,010
can't get out what I want actually is to
 

873
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,690
can't get out what I want actually is to
let them out here so have Pistons down

874
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:47,700
let them out here so have Pistons down
 

875
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,760
let them out here so have Pistons down
below like that that will make these

876
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:51,770
below like that that will make these
 

877
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,730
below like that that will make these
slabs retract and that so that they can

878
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:55,740
slabs retract and that so that they can
 

879
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,899
slabs retract and that so that they can
just walk out when it when they're down

880
00:23:58,899 --> 00:23:58,909
just walk out when it when they're down
 

881
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:01,240
just walk out when it when they're down
we will

882
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,250
we will
 

883
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,620
we will
although the back here a little bit just

884
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:03,630
although the back here a little bit just
 

885
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:10,220
although the back here a little bit just
to try this okay so where is that little

886
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,230
to try this okay so where is that little
 

887
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,560
to try this okay so where is that little
stone it's right there let's how I did

888
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,570
stone it's right there let's how I did
 

889
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,659
stone it's right there let's how I did
bring something good we're going to put

890
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:17,669
bring something good we're going to put
 

891
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:24,169
bring something good we're going to put
some of that down right stone so if

892
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:24,179
some of that down right stone so if
 

893
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,460
some of that down right stone so if
that's pressed down this will turn on

894
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:27,470
that's pressed down this will turn on
 

895
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,799
that's pressed down this will turn on
make that goes there to torch and

896
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:32,809
make that goes there to torch and
 

897
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,820
make that goes there to torch and
hopefully this won't interfere with

898
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:34,830
hopefully this won't interfere with
 

899
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,070
hopefully this won't interfere with
anything see do we need to invert it one

900
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
anything see do we need to invert it one
 

901
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,279
anything see do we need to invert it one
more time or is that good let's try that

902
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:43,289
more time or is that good let's try that
 

903
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,100
more time or is that good let's try that
out so if we do that

904
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,110
out so if we do that
 

905
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:53,210
out so if we do that
that's whoops and bring it all the way

906
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,220
that's whoops and bring it all the way
 

907
00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:00,250
that's whoops and bring it all the way
up good cool so that made that go down

908
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:00,260
up good cool so that made that go down
 

909
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,730
up good cool so that made that go down
which will block the light from entering

910
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:03,740
which will block the light from entering
 

911
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,889
which will block the light from entering
and if they spawn here it'll go up and

912
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:06,899
and if they spawn here it'll go up and
 

913
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:10,970
and if they spawn here it'll go up and
we'll be able to see their face alright

914
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:10,980
we'll be able to see their face alright
 

915
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,529
we'll be able to see their face alright
so we still have the dark spot good nope

916
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:15,539
so we still have the dark spot good nope
 

917
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,320
so we still have the dark spot good nope
we got one that spawned sweet that's

918
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,330
we got one that spawned sweet that's
 

919
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:45,519
we got one that spawned sweet that's
that's working exactly like I want it to

920
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:45,529

 

921
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:47,480

okay well this seems to be working

922
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,490
okay well this seems to be working
 

923
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,789
okay well this seems to be working
pretty good so what we're doing is we're

924
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:49,799
pretty good so what we're doing is we're
 

925
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,940
pretty good so what we're doing is we're
trying to separate them and get a zombie

926
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:52,950
trying to separate them and get a zombie
 

927
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,560
trying to separate them and get a zombie
villager to spawn and one of these in

928
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:54,570
villager to spawn and one of these in
 

929
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,539
villager to spawn and one of these in
when they do then we give them the

930
00:25:59,539 --> 00:25:59,549
when they do then we give them the
 

931
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:02,899
when they do then we give them the
weakness potions and the apples convert

932
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:02,909
weakness potions and the apples convert
 

933
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,690
weakness potions and the apples convert
them into real villagers they drop it

934
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:05,700
them into real villagers they drop it
 

935
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,850
them into real villagers they drop it
now they never drop it and when they're

936
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:10,860
now they never drop it and when they're
 

937
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,799
now they never drop it and when they're
dark like that it's really easy for them

938
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:12,809
dark like that it's really easy for them
 

939
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,830
dark like that it's really easy for them
to spawn so it seems to work pretty good

940
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:17,840
to spawn so it seems to work pretty good
 

941
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,149
to spawn so it seems to work pretty good
now the only thing is we want to make it

942
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
now the only thing is we want to make it
 

943
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,269
now the only thing is we want to make it
look a little bit better if we can

944
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:22,279
look a little bit better if we can
 

945
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:29,029
look a little bit better if we can
whoops whoops what did I just break yeah

946
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
whoops whoops what did I just break yeah
 

947
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,710
whoops whoops what did I just break yeah
let's try this again we'll put stairs at
