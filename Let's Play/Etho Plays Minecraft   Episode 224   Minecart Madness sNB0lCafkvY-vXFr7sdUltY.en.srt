00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
hello everybody
 

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,709
hello everybody
this is etho and welcome back to another

6
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
this is etho and welcome back to another
 

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,470
this is etho and welcome back to another
episode

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
episode
 

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,230
episode
so today i think what we should do

10
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
so today i think what we should do
 

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,310
so today i think what we should do
is work on the nether hub some more

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320

 

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,470

it's been really helpful having these

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
it's been really helpful having these
 

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,070
it's been really helpful having these
paths in the nether

16
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
paths in the nether
 

17
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,589
paths in the nether
in these portals and everything and

18
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
in these portals and everything and
 

19
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,589
in these portals and everything and
i would really like to get it hooked up

20
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
i would really like to get it hooked up
 

21
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,030
i would really like to get it hooked up
where i could actually use the mine

22
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
where i could actually use the mine
 

23
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,150
where i could actually use the mine
carts

24
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
carts
 

25
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,030
carts
uh for most of the stuff so far it's

26
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
uh for most of the stuff so far it's
 

27
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,630
uh for most of the stuff so far it's
been pretty close

28
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
been pretty close
 

29
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,630
been pretty close
like the stronghold is not that far i

30
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
like the stronghold is not that far i
 

31
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,830
like the stronghold is not that far i
don't mind walking

32
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
don't mind walking
 

33
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,150
don't mind walking
this um but hey if there was mine carts

34
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
this um but hey if there was mine carts
 

35
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,510
this um but hey if there was mine carts
that would be even better

36
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520

 

37
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,189

yeah strongholds just over here

38
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
yeah strongholds just over here
 

39
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,830
yeah strongholds just over here
through this portal uh but you can see i

40
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
through this portal uh but you can see i
 

41
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,310
through this portal uh but you can see i
started going further

42
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
started going further
 

43
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,830
started going further
this this track now goes all the way to

44
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
this this track now goes all the way to
 

45
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,310
this this track now goes all the way to
my nether fortress where i've been

46
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
my nether fortress where i've been
 

47
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,469
my nether fortress where i've been
hunting wither skeletons

48
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
hunting wither skeletons
 

49
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,310
hunting wither skeletons
and that is at about i think it goes up

50
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
and that is at about i think it goes up
 

51
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,230
and that is at about i think it goes up
to like

52
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,240
to like
 

53
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,030
to like
380 zed or something

54
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
380 zed or something
 

55
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,710
380 zed or something
so it is a it's a little bit of a

56
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
so it is a it's a little bit of a
 

57
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,789
so it is a it's a little bit of a
distance

58
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
distance
 

59
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,190
distance
so minecarts we want minecarts

60
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200

 

61
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,310

oh oh no those are those are blank i'm

62
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
oh oh no those are those are blank i'm
 

63
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,789
oh oh no those are those are blank i'm
like

64
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
like
 

65
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,350
like
man the text isn't loading again but no

66
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
man the text isn't loading again but no
 

67
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,710
man the text isn't loading again but no
i never put any text for them because

68
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
i never put any text for them because
 

69
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,710
i never put any text for them because
it's not set up

70
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
it's not set up
 

71
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,149
it's not set up
but yeah we have our selector panel here

72
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
but yeah we have our selector panel here
 

73
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,510
but yeah we have our selector panel here
little thing to select our destination

74
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
little thing to select our destination
 

75
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,550
little thing to select our destination
so the way this is supposed to work

76
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
so the way this is supposed to work
 

77
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,510
so the way this is supposed to work
you pick your destination sends you down

78
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
you pick your destination sends you down
 

79
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,670
you pick your destination sends you down
this main tunnel here

80
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
this main tunnel here
 

81
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,469
this main tunnel here
and then like at 10 different places

82
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
and then like at 10 different places
 

83
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,950
and then like at 10 different places
along this tunnel there's going to be a

84
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
along this tunnel there's going to be a
 

85
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,310
along this tunnel there's going to be a
a t junction

86
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
a t junction
 

87
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,069
a t junction
with the minecart tracks that will

88
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
with the minecart tracks that will
 

89
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,270
with the minecart tracks that will
send you off to your x test x

90
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
send you off to your x test x
 

91
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,710
send you off to your x test x
destination yeah

92
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
destination yeah
 

93
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,070
destination yeah
when you get to it so

94
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
when you get to it so
 

95
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,270
when you get to it so
the thing about that though

96
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
the thing about that though
 

97
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,510
the thing about that though
um it's not as easy as it sounds like

98
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
um it's not as easy as it sounds like
 

99
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,990
um it's not as easy as it sounds like
in order to send information to those

100
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
in order to send information to those
 

101
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,750
in order to send information to those
t-junctions

102
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
t-junctions
 

103
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,869
t-junctions
i would have to run a redstone line

104
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
i would have to run a redstone line
 

105
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,949
i would have to run a redstone line
from this main selector panel all the

106
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
from this main selector panel all the
 

107
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,550
from this main selector panel all the
way

108
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
way
 

109
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,869
way
to as far as it goes you know so if we

110
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
to as far as it goes you know so if we
 

111
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,150
to as far as it goes you know so if we
have a junction a thousand blocks away

112
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
have a junction a thousand blocks away
 

113
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,910
have a junction a thousand blocks away
we have to run a redstone line a

114
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
we have to run a redstone line a
 

115
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,229
we have to run a redstone line a
thousand blocks away

116
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
thousand blocks away
 

117
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,949
thousand blocks away
um and one for each of these

118
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
um and one for each of these
 

119
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,390
um and one for each of these
which is like oh no what have i done

120
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
which is like oh no what have i done
 

121
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,790
which is like oh no what have i done
i can't do that so

122
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
i can't do that so
 

123
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,150
i can't do that so
yeah we're gonna experiment with

124
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
yeah we're gonna experiment with
 

125
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,630
yeah we're gonna experiment with
something today uh there is

126
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
something today uh there is
 

127
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,630
something today uh there is
ways i've seen like where people can

128
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
ways i've seen like where people can
 

129
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,630
ways i've seen like where people can
send multiple signals

130
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
send multiple signals
 

131
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,470
send multiple signals
with a single uh redstone

132
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480

 

133
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,990

line um

134
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
line um
 

135
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,070
line um
using different lengths of pulses and

136
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
using different lengths of pulses and
 

137
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,030
using different lengths of pulses and
stuff

138
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
stuff
 

139
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,390
stuff
we're going to do something similar to

140
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
we're going to do something similar to
 

141
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,070
we're going to do something similar to
that with minecart tracks

142
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
that with minecart tracks
 

143
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,149
that with minecart tracks
and this is an idea i played around with

144
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
and this is an idea i played around with
 

145
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,670
and this is an idea i played around with
over a year ago now i was going to use

146
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
over a year ago now i was going to use
 

147
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,910
over a year ago now i was going to use
it on eats road

148
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
it on eats road
 

149
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,750
it on eats road
and it's it seemed like it was working

150
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
and it's it seemed like it was working
 

151
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,670
and it's it seemed like it was working
but it's kind of complicated too i don't

152
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
but it's kind of complicated too i don't
 

153
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,149
but it's kind of complicated too i don't
know

154
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
know
 

155
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,270
know
if it'll be successful or not

156
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
if it'll be successful or not
 

157
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,509
if it'll be successful or not
but like for these close junctions like

158
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
but like for these close junctions like
 

159
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,430
but like for these close junctions like
i would put a junction

160
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
i would put a junction
 

161
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,149
i would put a junction
here to go to the stronghold that's not

162
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
here to go to the stronghold that's not
 

163
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,149
here to go to the stronghold that's not
that far that's only

164
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
that far that's only
 

165
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,070
that far that's only
like 40 or 50 blocks i don't mind

166
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
like 40 or 50 blocks i don't mind
 

167
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,190
like 40 or 50 blocks i don't mind
running redstone that far

168
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
running redstone that far
 

169
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,270
running redstone that far
but it gets to the point where you get

170
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
but it gets to the point where you get
 

171
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,990
but it gets to the point where you get
hundreds and hundreds of blocks away

172
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
hundreds and hundreds of blocks away
 

173
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,550
hundreds and hundreds of blocks away
we need a better way of triggering the

174
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
we need a better way of triggering the
 

175
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,990
we need a better way of triggering the
junctions

176
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
junctions
 

177
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,589
junctions
for this to work the way out what i

178
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
for this to work the way out what i
 

179
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,190
for this to work the way out what i
hoped it too

180
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
hoped it too
 

181
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,229
hoped it too
so i'm gonna get some minecart stuff

182
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
so i'm gonna get some minecart stuff
 

183
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:58,710
so i'm gonna get some minecart stuff
together

184
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
together
 

185
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,429
together
we're gonna go do it up in a nice grass

186
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
we're gonna go do it up in a nice grass
 

187
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:01,990
we're gonna go do it up in a nice grass
area

188
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
area
 

189
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,110
area
nice flat grass area and just experiment

190
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
nice flat grass area and just experiment
 

191
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,789
nice flat grass area and just experiment
with an idea

192
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
with an idea
 

193
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,229
with an idea
and i'll see you there

194
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239

 

195
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,869

all right so here's the idea let's

196
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
all right so here's the idea let's
 

197
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,070
all right so here's the idea let's
pretend this is our main

198
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
pretend this is our main
 

199
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,629
pretend this is our main
track the main line we wanted to branch

200
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
track the main line we wanted to branch
 

201
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,069
track the main line we wanted to branch
off 10 different places

202
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
off 10 different places
 

203
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,349
off 10 different places
down the way some of these might be

204
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
down the way some of these might be
 

205
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,629
down the way some of these might be
hundreds or thousands of blocks away

206
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
hundreds or thousands of blocks away
 

207
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,830
hundreds or thousands of blocks away
right and we'll branch them off using a

208
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
right and we'll branch them off using a
 

209
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,749
right and we'll branch them off using a
t-junction like this so if it's

210
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759

 

211
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,030

if it's going like this it'll keep going

212
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
if it's going like this it'll keep going
 

213
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,030
if it's going like this it'll keep going
straight

214
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
straight
 

215
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,749
straight
if it's like this it will go this way

216
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
if it's like this it will go this way
 

217
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,230
if it's like this it will go this way
to the destination otherwise you'll just

218
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
to the destination otherwise you'll just
 

219
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,710
to the destination otherwise you'll just
keep going down the main track

220
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
keep going down the main track
 

221
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,909
keep going down the main track
okay now the problem is telling this

222
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
okay now the problem is telling this
 

223
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,110
okay now the problem is telling this
junction to switch

224
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
junction to switch
 

225
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,510
junction to switch
when we want it to we got to make it

226
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
when we want it to we got to make it
 

227
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,629
when we want it to we got to make it
ignore

228
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
ignore
 

229
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,230
ignore
but like we might have to make it ignore

230
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
but like we might have to make it ignore
 

231
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,670
but like we might have to make it ignore
nine of the junctions on the way and

232
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
nine of the junctions on the way and
 

233
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,350
nine of the junctions on the way and
then on the tenth one

234
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
then on the tenth one
 

235
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,550
then on the tenth one
have it switch and uh

236
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
have it switch and uh
 

237
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,230
have it switch and uh
that's kind of challenging so usually

238
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
that's kind of challenging so usually
 

239
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,590
that's kind of challenging so usually
the way people do this

240
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
the way people do this
 

241
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,270
the way people do this
and we might end up doing this also if

242
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
and we might end up doing this also if
 

243
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,830
and we might end up doing this also if
this doesn't work out too well

244
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
this doesn't work out too well
 

245
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,350
this doesn't work out too well
is you'll you'll have your selector pad

246
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
is you'll you'll have your selector pad
 

247
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,390
is you'll you'll have your selector pad
so we got 10 choices then we'll have

248
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
so we got 10 choices then we'll have
 

249
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,189
so we got 10 choices then we'll have
all our junction stuff all in one area

250
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
all our junction stuff all in one area
 

251
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,390
all our junction stuff all in one area
and it'll split into 10 different tracks

252
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
and it'll split into 10 different tracks
 

253
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,150
and it'll split into 10 different tracks
that's one way of doing it another way

254
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
that's one way of doing it another way
 

255
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,830
that's one way of doing it another way
is to have 10 separate

256
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
is to have 10 separate
 

257
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,029
is to have 10 separate
redstone wires running all the way down

258
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
redstone wires running all the way down
 

259
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,790
redstone wires running all the way down
or we could try to be fancy and get

260
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
or we could try to be fancy and get
 

261
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,830
or we could try to be fancy and get
one redstone wire with different length

262
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
one redstone wire with different length
 

263
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,310
one redstone wire with different length
pulses

264
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
pulses
 

265
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,510
pulses
going all the way down but what i really

266
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
going all the way down but what i really
 

267
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,110
going all the way down but what i really
want to do is make like a

268
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
want to do is make like a
 

269
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,150
want to do is make like a
self-intelligent track

270
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
self-intelligent track
 

271
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,710
self-intelligent track
that just knows this is where we want to

272
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
that just knows this is where we want to
 

273
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,590
that just knows this is where we want to
go

274
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
go
 

275
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,550
go
and we can actually do that if we use

276
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
and we can actually do that if we use
 

277
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,309
and we can actually do that if we use
two mine carts

278
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319

 

279
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,590

so how should we set this up i guess

280
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600

 

281
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,909

this is going to be really rough this

282
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
this is going to be really rough this
 

283
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,469
this is going to be really rough this
this test set up here

284
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
this test set up here
 

285
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,950
this test set up here
uh when once we actually do set up we

286
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
uh when once we actually do set up we
 

287
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,670
uh when once we actually do set up we
have to be

288
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
have to be
 

289
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,909
have to be
pretty specific about our timings and

290
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
pretty specific about our timings and
 

291
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,790
pretty specific about our timings and
everything

292
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800

 

293
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,150

okay so we'll have two mine carts

294
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
okay so we'll have two mine carts
 

295
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,469
okay so we'll have two mine carts
right and we're gonna use the time

296
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
right and we're gonna use the time
 

297
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,830
right and we're gonna use the time
between

298
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
between
 

299
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,390
between
one mine cart and the other one to to

300
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
one mine cart and the other one to to
 

301
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,510
one mine cart and the other one to to
send information

302
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
send information
 

303
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,230
send information
down the track to tell it when we want

304
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
down the track to tell it when we want
 

305
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,990
down the track to tell it when we want
to get off

306
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
to get off
 

307
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,309
to get off
that's the goal with this now the one

308
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
that's the goal with this now the one
 

309
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,390
that's the goal with this now the one
problem with this

310
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
problem with this
 

311
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,790
problem with this
an empty minecart does not move at the

312
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
an empty minecart does not move at the
 

313
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,070
an empty minecart does not move at the
same speed as one

314
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
same speed as one
 

315
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,110
same speed as one
that a player is riding in uh

316
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
that a player is riding in uh
 

317
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,110
that a player is riding in uh
so we'll have to put a mob in the second

318
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
so we'll have to put a mob in the second
 

319
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,309
so we'll have to put a mob in the second
minecart i'm thinking

320
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
minecart i'm thinking
 

321
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,350
minecart i'm thinking
i'm gonna use chickens for this just

322
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
i'm gonna use chickens for this just
 

323
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,629
i'm gonna use chickens for this just
because they're like the most portable

324
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
because they're like the most portable
 

325
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,469
because they're like the most portable
mob

326
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
mob
 

327
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,230
mob
they're easy to replace if they

328
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
they're easy to replace if they
 

329
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,790
they're easy to replace if they
disappear just throw a few eggs

330
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
disappear just throw a few eggs
 

331
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,390
disappear just throw a few eggs
you can get chicken

332
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400

 

333
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,390

all right

334
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400

 

335
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,550

so today i finally set up a proper

336
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
so today i finally set up a proper
 

337
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,550
so today i finally set up a proper
chicken farm in my world here

338
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
chicken farm in my world here
 

339
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,629
chicken farm in my world here
uh this whole time since i started my

340
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
uh this whole time since i started my
 

341
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,710
uh this whole time since i started my
let's play world i have not had

342
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
let's play world i have not had
 

343
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,230
let's play world i have not had
a chicken farm of any kind like i kinda

344
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
a chicken farm of any kind like i kinda
 

345
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,990
a chicken farm of any kind like i kinda
did by the channel farm

346
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
did by the channel farm
 

347
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,909
did by the channel farm
there's like there's been like one

348
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
there's like there's been like one
 

349
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,309
there's like there's been like one
chicken in the water for

350
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
chicken in the water for
 

351
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,830
chicken in the water for
forever um finally

352
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
forever um finally
 

353
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,990
forever um finally
decided to set up a temporary one by the

354
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
decided to set up a temporary one by the
 

355
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,270
decided to set up a temporary one by the
purple sheep i don't know if you know

356
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
purple sheep i don't know if you know
 

357
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,870
purple sheep i don't know if you know
that pen

358
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
that pen
 

359
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,589
that pen
today and it's just getting going but i

360
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
today and it's just getting going but i
 

361
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,430
today and it's just getting going but i
did get five eggs i'm really hoping we

362
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
did get five eggs i'm really hoping we
 

363
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,390
did get five eggs i'm really hoping we
get a chicken out of this

364
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
get a chicken out of this
 

365
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,670
get a chicken out of this
yes awesome quick

366
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
yes awesome quick
 

367
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,070
yes awesome quick
quick capture yes okay

368
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
quick capture yes okay
 

369
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,230
quick capture yes okay
we got our helper

370
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240

 

371
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,850

um

372
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:50,860
um
 

373
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,589
um
[Music]

374
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
[Music]
 

375
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,710
[Music]
right okay so the way i originally did

376
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
right okay so the way i originally did
 

377
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,430
right okay so the way i originally did
this

378
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
this
 

379
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,550
this
i only used one detector rail i'm

380
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
i only used one detector rail i'm
 

381
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,990
i only used one detector rail i'm
talking like a year ago

382
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
talking like a year ago
 

383
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,510
talking like a year ago
the way i did it originally i only used

384
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
the way i did it originally i only used
 

385
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,270
the way i did it originally i only used
one detector rail

386
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
one detector rail
 

387
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,189
one detector rail
basically i had to put it before the

388
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
basically i had to put it before the
 

389
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,869
basically i had to put it before the
t-junction

390
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879

 

391
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,350

so and let's get out our redstone i

392
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
so and let's get out our redstone i
 

393
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,869
so and let's get out our redstone i
basically made a switch

394
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
basically made a switch
 

395
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,629
basically made a switch
with different delays

396
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639

 

397
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,790

or kind of like a redstone fork

398
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
or kind of like a redstone fork
 

399
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,230
or kind of like a redstone fork
i should say so on one

400
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
i should say so on one
 

401
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,509
i should say so on one
one path the delay was

402
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
one path the delay was
 

403
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,149
one path the delay was
like actually no the first thing i had

404
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
like actually no the first thing i had
 

405
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,630
like actually no the first thing i had
to do

406
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
to do
 

407
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,350
to do
is set up a monostable circuit that's

408
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
is set up a monostable circuit that's
 

409
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,070
is set up a monostable circuit that's
the very first

410
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
the very first
 

411
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,269
the very first
thing um just

412
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
thing um just
 

413
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,070
thing um just
so that it's easier to create unique ids

414
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
so that it's easier to create unique ids
 

415
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,949
so that it's easier to create unique ids
with the delays

416
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959

 

417
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,870

this will all make sense once we get it

418
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
this will all make sense once we get it
 

419
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,269
this will all make sense once we get it
going don't worry

420
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
going don't worry
 

421
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,389
going don't worry
i hope um

422
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
i hope um
 

423
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,509
i hope um
so yeah monostable circuits we'll put it

424
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
so yeah monostable circuits we'll put it
 

425
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,949
so yeah monostable circuits we'll put it
over here

426
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959

 

427
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:15,829

do think that's i think that's right

428
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839

 

429
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,190

let's just i just want to see if it

430
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
let's just i just want to see if it
 

431
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,190
let's just i just want to see if it
flashes properly

432
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
flashes properly
 

433
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,710
flashes properly
i think i need to set it three yeah

434
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
i think i need to set it three yeah
 

435
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,910
i think i need to set it three yeah
set it to three

436
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920

 

437
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,310

there we go that's a monostable circuit

438
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
there we go that's a monostable circuit
 

439
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,310
there we go that's a monostable circuit
just creates a quick

440
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
just creates a quick
 

441
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,230
just creates a quick
quick pulse only one tick

442
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240

 

443
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,509

in delay okay

444
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
in delay okay
 

445
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,030
in delay okay
so you get the monostable circuit and

446
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
so you get the monostable circuit and
 

447
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,470
so you get the monostable circuit and
then you have to have a fork

448
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
then you have to have a fork
 

449
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,389
then you have to have a fork
of two different delays one of them

450
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
of two different delays one of them
 

451
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,230
of two different delays one of them
will be like instance another one will

452
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
will be like instance another one will
 

453
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,430
will be like instance another one will
be

454
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
be
 

455
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,870
be
the delay between our two mine carts so

456
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
the delay between our two mine carts so
 

457
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,150
the delay between our two mine carts so
just do this for now

458
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160

 

459
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,829

and then these go into an and gate

460
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
and then these go into an and gate
 

461
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,750
and then these go into an and gate
and it basically compares

462
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
and it basically compares
 

463
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,150
and it basically compares
if the timings are equal a current will

464
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
if the timings are equal a current will
 

465
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,870
if the timings are equal a current will
pass through

466
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
pass through
 

467
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,110
pass through
if they are not it will not pass through

468
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120

 

469
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,949

and then this would connect to the

470
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
and then this would connect to the
 

471
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,470
and then this would connect to the
junction

472
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
junction
 

473
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,630
junction
so we'll just we'll just do this for now

474
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
so we'll just we'll just do this for now
 

475
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,750
so we'll just we'll just do this for now
see how it lights up

476
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
see how it lights up
 

477
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,829
see how it lights up
and i do not know what delay we need

478
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839

 

479
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,190

um well let's see wait a sec

480
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
um well let's see wait a sec
 

481
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,350
um well let's see wait a sec
we'll just set it to a very short delay

482
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360

 

483
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,910

then we can control the the release time

484
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
then we can control the the release time
 

485
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,990
then we can control the the release time
of the second minecart from here by

486
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
of the second minecart from here by
 

487
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,509
of the second minecart from here by
a delay from this button

488
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
a delay from this button
 

489
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,829
a delay from this button
this is how we give each button a unique

490
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
this is how we give each button a unique
 

491
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,590
this is how we give each button a unique
id

492
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600

 

493
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,750

um again i'm putting this together very

494
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
um again i'm putting this together very
 

495
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,310
um again i'm putting this together very
rough

496
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
rough
 

497
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,150
rough
so it's not going to work the first time

498
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
so it's not going to work the first time
 

499
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,350
so it's not going to work the first time
i'll have to play with the timings

500
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
i'll have to play with the timings
 

501
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,190
i'll have to play with the timings
let's just give it a play like this and

502
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
let's just give it a play like this and
 

503
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,790
let's just give it a play like this and
see how it works

504
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
see how it works
 

505
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,630
see how it works
and that will send power to the track

506
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
and that will send power to the track
 

507
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,190
and that will send power to the track
and send off the second minecarts

508
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
and send off the second minecarts
 

509
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,710
and send off the second minecarts
power power one goes to those

510
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
power power one goes to those
 

511
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,350
power power one goes to those
okay so i'm gonna fool around with this

512
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
okay so i'm gonna fool around with this
 

513
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,949
okay so i'm gonna fool around with this
a bit and try to get the timings right

514
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
a bit and try to get the timings right
 

515
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,389
a bit and try to get the timings right
so it'll make sense

516
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399

 

517
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,710

i've made a few refinements to it to now

518
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
i've made a few refinements to it to now
 

519
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,310
i've made a few refinements to it to now
and i think i can demonstrate how it's

520
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
and i think i can demonstrate how it's
 

521
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,269
and i think i can demonstrate how it's
supposed to work

522
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
supposed to work
 

523
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,870
supposed to work
so i got a lever hooked up here to

524
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
so i got a lever hooked up here to
 

525
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,550
so i got a lever hooked up here to
do the same thing that the pressure or

526
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
do the same thing that the pressure or
 

527
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,750
do the same thing that the pressure or
that the detector rail does

528
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
that the detector rail does
 

529
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,190
that the detector rail does
so when you go over the detector rail

530
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
so when you go over the detector rail
 

531
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,670
so when you go over the detector rail
that's what happens

532
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
that's what happens
 

533
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,590
that's what happens
you see that torch goes off first and

534
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
you see that torch goes off first and
 

535
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,110
you see that torch goes off first and
then that one

536
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
then that one
 

537
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,389
then that one
as it goes through the delay

538
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399

 

539
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,069

now another important thing about this

540
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
now another important thing about this
 

541
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,389
now another important thing about this
monostable circuit is it's

542
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
monostable circuit is it's
 

543
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,590
monostable circuit is it's
like even if you keep this powered it

544
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
like even if you keep this powered it
 

545
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,430
like even if you keep this powered it
still only sends a pulse it doesn't stay

546
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
still only sends a pulse it doesn't stay
 

547
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,550
still only sends a pulse it doesn't stay
powered here

548
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
powered here
 

549
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,550
powered here
if it was to stay power it would always

550
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
if it was to stay power it would always
 

551
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,150
if it was to stay power it would always
trigger

552
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160

 

553
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,150

and these noteboxes tell us when it

554
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
and these noteboxes tell us when it
 

555
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,829
and these noteboxes tell us when it
triggers properly

556
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
triggers properly
 

557
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,430
triggers properly
that it would trigger the junction up

558
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
that it would trigger the junction up
 

559
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,030
that it would trigger the junction up
there

560
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
there
 

561
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,030
there
um so if i time it right though

562
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
um so if i time it right though
 

563
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,710
um so if i time it right though
if i send two pulses with the right

564
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
if i send two pulses with the right
 

565
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,350
if i send two pulses with the right
timing this one will trigger

566
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
timing this one will trigger
 

567
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,550
timing this one will trigger
which has no no effects then this one

568
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
which has no no effects then this one
 

569
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,550
which has no no effects then this one
will go then on the second

570
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
will go then on the second
 

571
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,470
will go then on the second
second time it goes over the rail this

572
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
second time it goes over the rail this
 

573
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,150
second time it goes over the rail this
one will trigger again

574
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
one will trigger again
 

575
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,430
one will trigger again
and if it matches up with this torch if

576
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
and if it matches up with this torch if
 

577
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,030
and if it matches up with this torch if
they both match at the same time then

578
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
they both match at the same time then
 

579
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,550
they both match at the same time then
it'll go through

580
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
it'll go through
 

581
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,230
it'll go through
and then also this will get triggered

582
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
and then also this will get triggered
 

583
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,269
and then also this will get triggered
again this side but that doesn't matter

584
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
again this side but that doesn't matter
 

585
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,629
again this side but that doesn't matter
so let's see if i can't time it right

586
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639

 

587
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,470

nope almost had it

588
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
nope almost had it
 

589
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,430
nope almost had it
there we go you see what's happening

590
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
there we go you see what's happening
 

591
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,110
there we go you see what's happening
there

592
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
there
 

593
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,150
there
not too late so

594
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
not too late so
 

595
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,550
not too late so
the timing has to be very very precise

596
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
the timing has to be very very precise
 

597
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,670
the timing has to be very very precise
and that's how we can control this

598
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
and that's how we can control this
 

599
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,670
and that's how we can control this
at several different spots just by

600
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
at several different spots just by
 

601
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,590
at several different spots just by
having different timings

602
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
having different timings
 

603
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,470
having different timings
uh there is one thing though you see i

604
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
uh there is one thing though you see i
 

605
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,910
uh there is one thing though you see i
have this set at four now so it's

606
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
have this set at four now so it's
 

607
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,310
have this set at four now so it's
actually a two tick

608
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
actually a two tick
 

609
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,550
actually a two tick
pulse instead of a one tick ideally we

610
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
pulse instead of a one tick ideally we
 

611
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,790
pulse instead of a one tick ideally we
want a one tick

612
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
want a one tick
 

613
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,710
want a one tick
but the problem we're having

614
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
but the problem we're having
 

615
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,190
but the problem we're having
if we set this to this this torch won't

616
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
if we set this to this this torch won't
 

617
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,389
if we set this to this this torch won't
go off it's too quick

618
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399

 

619
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,470

see that it just quickly flashes on and

620
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
see that it just quickly flashes on and
 

621
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,870
see that it just quickly flashes on and
on off the torch didn't change

622
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
on off the torch didn't change
 

623
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,949
on off the torch didn't change
sort of a limitation of a redstone torch

624
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
sort of a limitation of a redstone torch
 

625
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,030
sort of a limitation of a redstone torch
but there is a way to trick it

626
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
but there is a way to trick it
 

627
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,110
but there is a way to trick it
if you have a repeater

628
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
if you have a repeater
 

629
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,389
if you have a repeater
at one tick it won't work still didn't

630
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
at one tick it won't work still didn't
 

631
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,189
at one tick it won't work still didn't
change it he said it's the two though

632
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199

 

633
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,949

then it does and it's still only a one

634
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
then it does and it's still only a one
 

635
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,350
then it does and it's still only a one
tick pulse

636
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
tick pulse
 

637
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,829
tick pulse
it's kind of a trick so we can put that

638
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
it's kind of a trick so we can put that
 

639
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,590
it's kind of a trick so we can put that
at the start of this

640
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
at the start of this
 

641
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,189
at the start of this
like that connect it to both of these

642
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199

 

643
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,350

oh oh i didn't change it there we go

644
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
oh oh i didn't change it there we go
 

645
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,949
oh oh i didn't change it there we go
there we go so it changed so we want

646
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
there we go so it changed so we want
 

647
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,750
there we go so it changed so we want
the smallest possible number so we can

648
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
the smallest possible number so we can
 

649
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,230
the smallest possible number so we can
we don't have to use as much delay to

650
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
we don't have to use as much delay to
 

651
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,030
we don't have to use as much delay to
make it unique our code or our delay

652
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040

 

653
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,750

but anyway now there's also another

654
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
but anyway now there's also another
 

655
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,590
but anyway now there's also another
limitation here

656
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
limitation here
 

657
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,990
limitation here
these detector rails they stay powered

658
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
these detector rails they stay powered
 

659
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,829
these detector rails they stay powered
for about a second

660
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
for about a second
 

661
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,189
for about a second
so our second minecart has to trail at

662
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
so our second minecart has to trail at
 

663
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,870
so our second minecart has to trail at
least eight blocks behind

664
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:42,880
least eight blocks behind
 

665
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,870
least eight blocks behind
i don't know the exact number but

666
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
i don't know the exact number but
 

667
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,430
i don't know the exact number but
minecarts move 8 blocks per second

668
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
minecarts move 8 blocks per second
 

669
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,350
minecarts move 8 blocks per second
at max speed so that's the distance

670
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
at max speed so that's the distance
 

671
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,230
at max speed so that's the distance
we need i'm just going to change this

672
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
we need i'm just going to change this
 

673
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,629
we need i'm just going to change this
back to how it was

674
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
back to how it was
 

675
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,870
back to how it was
because i had it all synced here i'll

676
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
because i had it all synced here i'll
 

677
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,590
because i had it all synced here i'll
show you how it works so

678
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
show you how it works so
 

679
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,750
show you how it works so
our little helpers here we lost our

680
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
our little helpers here we lost our
 

681
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,710
our little helpers here we lost our
other chicken i had to make a new one

682
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
other chicken i had to make a new one
 

683
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,990
other chicken i had to make a new one
um so i would go first

684
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
um so i would go first
 

685
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,590
um so i would go first
chicken will follow behind

686
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
chicken will follow behind
 

687
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,629
chicken will follow behind
note that distance

688
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639

 

689
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,150

and it triggered

690
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160

 

691
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,550

if we change this timing just a little

692
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
if we change this timing just a little
 

693
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,230
if we change this timing just a little
bit it's not going to work so if we add

694
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
bit it's not going to work so if we add
 

695
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,829
bit it's not going to work so if we add
in another

696
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
in another
 

697
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,749
in another
repeater let's see if it works with this

698
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
repeater let's see if it works with this
 

699
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,310
repeater let's see if it works with this
just with one more tick

700
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
just with one more tick
 

701
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:41,030
just with one more tick
it might i'm not sure oh it still did

702
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
it might i'm not sure oh it still did
 

703
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,110
it might i'm not sure oh it still did
that's because this pulse is two ticks

704
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
that's because this pulse is two ticks
 

705
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,749
that's because this pulse is two ticks
so if we were to add one more i

706
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
so if we were to add one more i
 

707
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,189
so if we were to add one more i
don't think it'll work

708
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199

 

709
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,829

that's why we want that as small as

710
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839

 

711
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,949

possible

712
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959

 

713
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,470

so it shouldn't trigger i'm pretty sure

714
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480

 

715
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,509

oh okay

716
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519

 

717
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,189

i know when i tried it before like a

718
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
i know when i tried it before like a
 

719
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,949
i know when i tried it before like a
year ago i figured it out

720
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
year ago i figured it out
 

721
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,230
year ago i figured it out
to being a three to four tick

722
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
to being a three to four tick
 

723
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:23,829
to being a three to four tick
minimum difference between the ids

724
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
minimum difference between the ids
 

725
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,910
minimum difference between the ids
let's see if this one works

726
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920

 

727
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,670

still triggered wow maybe i'm doing

728
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
still triggered wow maybe i'm doing
 

729
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,430
still triggered wow maybe i'm doing
something wrong here

730
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440

 

731
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,350

if it doesn't if it does it again i know

732
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
if it doesn't if it does it again i know
 

733
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,509
if it doesn't if it does it again i know
i've done something wrong

734
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519

 

735
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:48,550

so we've added a four extra ticks

736
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560

 

737
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,310

okay that time it to go so yeah it's

738
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
okay that time it to go so yeah it's
 

739
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,990
okay that time it to go so yeah it's
about a four tick

740
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
about a four tick
 

741
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,189
about a four tick
buffer we need uh three ticks if we can

742
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
buffer we need uh three ticks if we can
 

743
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,430
buffer we need uh three ticks if we can
shorten this one more

744
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
shorten this one more
 

745
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,790
shorten this one more
and that's our minimum between ids so

746
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
and that's our minimum between ids so
 

747
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,710
and that's our minimum between ids so
for each button i need to add three

748
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
for each button i need to add three
 

749
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,309
for each button i need to add three
ticks to

750
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
ticks to
 

751
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,029
ticks to
the repeater so the first one would be

752
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
the repeater so the first one would be
 

753
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,429
the repeater so the first one would be
like

754
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
like
 

755
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,110
like
three for the id next one would be six

756
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
three for the id next one would be six
 

757
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,309
three for the id next one would be six
then the next button would be nine

758
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
then the next button would be nine
 

759
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,949
then the next button would be nine
and so forth all the way up to our tenth

760
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
and so forth all the way up to our tenth
 

761
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,270
and so forth all the way up to our tenth
button to code it

762
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
button to code it
 

763
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,029
button to code it
code the signal between the mine curts

764
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
code the signal between the mine curts
 

765
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,110
code the signal between the mine curts
yeah so the tough thing about this

766
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
yeah so the tough thing about this
 

767
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,029
yeah so the tough thing about this
though is gonna be

768
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
though is gonna be
 

769
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,150
though is gonna be
controlling the chickens um

770
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
controlling the chickens um
 

771
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,510
controlling the chickens um
making sure we distribute them through

772
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
making sure we distribute them through
 

773
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,230
making sure we distribute them through
the stations properly

774
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
the stations properly
 

775
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,549
the stations properly
or i might just try to set up set up a

776
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
or i might just try to set up set up a
 

777
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,789
or i might just try to set up set up a
big chicken farm get tons of eggs

778
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
big chicken farm get tons of eggs
 

779
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,549
big chicken farm get tons of eggs
and

780
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559

 

781
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,950

always get a chicken that way by

782
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
always get a chicken that way by
 

783
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,070
always get a chicken that way by
shooting

784
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
shooting
 

785
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,549
shooting
eggs out of dispenser into a mine carts

786
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
eggs out of dispenser into a mine carts
 

787
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,909
eggs out of dispenser into a mine carts
or something i don't know

788
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
or something i don't know
 

789
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,310
or something i don't know
we'll have to figure it out but maybe

790
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
we'll have to figure it out but maybe
 

791
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,110
we'll have to figure it out but maybe
we'll do something else now

792
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
we'll do something else now
 

793
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,510
we'll do something else now
oh yeah i forgot to say another idea i

794
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
oh yeah i forgot to say another idea i
 

795
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,230
oh yeah i forgot to say another idea i
had

796
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
had
 

797
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,150
had
was to use two detector rails instead of

798
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
was to use two detector rails instead of
 

799
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,430
was to use two detector rails instead of
just one

800
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
just one
 

801
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,350
just one
and have a monostable circuit for each

802
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
and have a monostable circuit for each
 

803
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,110
and have a monostable circuit for each
one

804
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
one
 

805
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,950
one
and an and gate still but i think that

806
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
and an and gate still but i think that
 

807
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,430
and an and gate still but i think that
would eliminate the need for

808
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
would eliminate the need for
 

809
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,510
would eliminate the need for
all this repeater business this initial

810
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
all this repeater business this initial
 

811
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,190
all this repeater business this initial
repeater business like we could get rid

812
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
repeater business like we could get rid
 

813
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,669
repeater business like we could get rid
of four repeaters doing that possibly

814
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
of four repeaters doing that possibly
 

815
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,710
of four repeaters doing that possibly
i'm not sure all right

816
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
i'm not sure all right
 

817
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,990
i'm not sure all right
let's try find something else to do

818
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
let's try find something else to do
 

819
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,909
let's try find something else to do
oh just a little correction here with

820
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
oh just a little correction here with
 

821
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,230
oh just a little correction here with
what i said uh you know that trick

822
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
what i said uh you know that trick
 

823
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,549
what i said uh you know that trick
of tricking the torch here it does not

824
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
of tricking the torch here it does not
 

825
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,070
of tricking the torch here it does not
work actually

826
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
work actually
 

827
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,510
work actually
uh this is at one it's going to be too

828
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
uh this is at one it's going to be too
 

829
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,870
uh this is at one it's going to be too
quick

830
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
quick
 

831
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,150
quick
to trigger it oh i actually did that

832
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
to trigger it oh i actually did that
 

833
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,630
to trigger it oh i actually did that
time

834
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640

 

835
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,470

oh i actually timed it right that's

836
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
oh i actually timed it right that's
 

837
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,150
oh i actually timed it right that's
amazing

838
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160

 

839
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,230

i saw it flicker that once yeah did that

840
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
i saw it flicker that once yeah did that
 

841
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,390
i saw it flicker that once yeah did that
time too

842
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
time too
 

843
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,070
time too
but yeah anyway it's actually extending

844
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
but yeah anyway it's actually extending
 

845
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,310
but yeah anyway it's actually extending
the pulse if i do it to two

846
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
the pulse if i do it to two
 

847
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,070
the pulse if i do it to two
it'll work but it's actually a longer

848
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
it'll work but it's actually a longer
 

849
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,830
it'll work but it's actually a longer
pulse and you can really see it if you

850
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
pulse and you can really see it if you
 

851
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,110
pulse and you can really see it if you
extend it to four

852
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120

 

853
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,950

yeah so i'll have to just set that at

854
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
yeah so i'll have to just set that at
 

855
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,230
yeah so i'll have to just set that at
four

856
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
four
 

857
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,630
four
it'll be a two tick pulse that's the

858
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
it'll be a two tick pulse that's the
 

859
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,909
it'll be a two tick pulse that's the
minimum i can do

860
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
minimum i can do
 

861
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,549
minimum i can do
and make this work i'll have to have a

862
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
and make this work i'll have to have a
 

863
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,029
and make this work i'll have to have a
but

864
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
but
 

865
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,230
but
a difference of four ticks per button

866
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
a difference of four ticks per button
 

867
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,270
a difference of four ticks per button
so one repeater which isn't too bad

868
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280

 

869
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,350

and yeah all right

870
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360

 

871
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,190

i guess the next part of trying to

872
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
i guess the next part of trying to
 

873
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,870
i guess the next part of trying to
finish this hub is

874
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
finish this hub is
 

875
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,230
finish this hub is
figuring out how we're going to do the

876
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
figuring out how we're going to do the
 

877
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,310
figuring out how we're going to do the
tunnels

878
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
tunnels
 

879
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,430
tunnels
uh we need something that's fairly easy

880
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
uh we need something that's fairly easy
 

881
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,630
uh we need something that's fairly easy
to reproduce

882
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
to reproduce
 

883
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,270
to reproduce
so i brought some blocks with us uh i

884
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
so i brought some blocks with us uh i
 

885
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,230
so i brought some blocks with us uh i
want it to be gas

886
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
want it to be gas
 

887
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,830
want it to be gas
proof definitely there's some areas are

888
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
proof definitely there's some areas are
 

889
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,430
proof definitely there's some areas are
gonna be like in the ground like this

890
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
gonna be like in the ground like this
 

891
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,029
gonna be like in the ground like this
and some areas are gonna be out in the

892
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
and some areas are gonna be out in the
 

893
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,870
and some areas are gonna be out in the
open

894
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
open
 

895
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,950
open
so i would like that to look good i'd

896
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
so i would like that to look good i'd
 

897
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,029
so i would like that to look good i'd
like to be able to see outside into the

898
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
like to be able to see outside into the
 

899
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,630
like to be able to see outside into the
nether

900
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
nether
 

901
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,630
nether
as i travel um

902
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
as i travel um
 

903
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,789
as i travel um
and i like three by three tunnels for

904
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
and i like three by three tunnels for
 

905
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,470
and i like three by three tunnels for
mine carts like this

906
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
mine carts like this
 

907
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,310
mine carts like this
it's a good size so

908
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
it's a good size so
 

909
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,390
it's a good size so
i think i'm gonna do iron bars for

910
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
i think i'm gonna do iron bars for
 

911
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,149
i think i'm gonna do iron bars for
looking out of although i am kind of

912
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
looking out of although i am kind of
 

913
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,270
looking out of although i am kind of
tempted about

914
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280

 

915
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,789

these although i don't think you can see

916
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
these although i don't think you can see
 

917
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,710
these although i don't think you can see
much through these can you

918
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720

 

919
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,390

yeah it's just a little crack

920
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
yeah it's just a little crack
 

921
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,630
yeah it's just a little crack
now that won't work okay we're gonna use

922
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
now that won't work okay we're gonna use
 

923
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:40,630
now that won't work okay we're gonna use
iron bars for the sides

924
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640

 

925
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,190

i also want it to be relatively zombie

926
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
i also want it to be relatively zombie
 

927
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,710
i also want it to be relatively zombie
pigmen proof

928
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
pigmen proof
 

929
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,590
pigmen proof
so need to try to prevent them from

930
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
so need to try to prevent them from
 

931
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,350
so need to try to prevent them from
spawning i would like them to be

932
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
spawning i would like them to be
 

933
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,230
spawning i would like them to be
lit up to the tunnels if possible so

934
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240

 

935
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,149

let's just play around with this idea a

936
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
let's just play around with this idea a
 

937
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,750
let's just play around with this idea a
bit

938
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
bit
 

939
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,430
bit
so if the tunnel is three by three we

940
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
so if the tunnel is three by three we
 

941
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,430
so if the tunnel is three by three we
need the

942
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
need the
 

943
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,350
need the
or if it's a three by three airspace we

944
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
or if it's a three by three airspace we
 

945
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,390
or if it's a three by three airspace we
need a five by five tunnel

946
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
need a five by five tunnel
 

947
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,789
need a five by five tunnel
like this

948
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799

 

949
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,430

okay iron bars on the sides maybe

950
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440

 

951
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,669

those would have to go three high

952
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679

 

953
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,110

it's gonna take a long time to build

954
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
it's gonna take a long time to build
 

955
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,789
it's gonna take a long time to build
this i can tell already

956
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
this i can tell already
 

957
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,390
this i can tell already
oh boy

958
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400

 

959
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,830

okay

960
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840

 

961
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,590

see iron bars here

962
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
see iron bars here
 

963
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,549
see iron bars here
oh yeah so uh we played our second game

964
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
oh yeah so uh we played our second game
 

965
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,630
oh yeah so uh we played our second game

though man
 

989
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,630
though man
we had our strategy all figured out but

990
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
we had our strategy all figured out but
 

991
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,149
we had our strategy all figured out but
uh

992
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
uh
 

993
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,630
uh
you know as kind of realized it after

994
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
you know as kind of realized it after
 

995
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,510
you know as kind of realized it after
the game but it was

996
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
the game but it was
 

997
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,669
the game but it was
really unlike us to go for a rush

998
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
really unlike us to go for a rush
 

999
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,430
really unlike us to go for a rush
strategy usually we're the guys

1000
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
strategy usually we're the guys
 

1001
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,590
strategy usually we're the guys
trying to lock down resources and

1002
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
trying to lock down resources and
 

1003
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,310
trying to lock down resources and
just muscle the team down but that's

1004
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,320
just muscle the team down but that's
 

1005
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,310
just muscle the team down but that's
exactly what happened to us

1006
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
exactly what happened to us
 

1007
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,909
exactly what happened to us
and we lost because of it very very

1008

this our power boosts we're going to

1024
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
this our power boosts we're going to
 

1025
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,170
this our power boosts we're going to
have it detect a rail

1026
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,180
have it detect a rail
 

1027

to power it

1036
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
to power it
 

1037
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,450

spawning we should have a block here
so maybe we'll use these if we do that

1046
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
so maybe we'll use these if we do that
 

1047

we don't really need iron bars that low

1048

1059
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,310

if we put a light here we'll have to put

1060
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
if we put a light here we'll have to put
 

1061
00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:02,870
if we put a light here we'll have to put
half slabs above

1062
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880

 

1063
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,549

this we could shape better so it looks

1064
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
this we could shape better so it looks
 

1065
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,310
this we could shape better so it looks
better from the outside using

1066
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
better from the outside using
 

1067
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,149
better from the outside using
stairs maybe

1068
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159

 

1069
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,430

actually we could put them there too

1070
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440

 

1071
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,830

and here

1072
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840

 

1073
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,310

and these stone stone bricks i have

1074
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
and these stone stone bricks i have
 

1075
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,070
and these stone stone bricks i have
plenty of cobbles so that they're not

1076
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
plenty of cobbles so that they're not
 

1077
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,669
plenty of cobbles so that they're not
hard for me to get

1078
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679

 

1079
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:40,789

yeah maybe something like this

1080
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799

 

1081
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,110

all right anyway it's going to be

1083
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,789
all right anyway it's going to be
something similar to this i might change

1084
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
something similar to this i might change
 

1085
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,070
something similar to this i might change
it a bit yet

1086
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
it a bit yet
 

1087
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,149

i do want to check out the anvils yet so

1088
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
i do want to check out the anvils yet so
 

1089
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,590
i do want to check out the anvils yet so
let's go do that and then we'll probably

1090
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:51,600
let's go do that and then we'll probably
 

1091
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,110
let's go do that and then we'll probably
call it an end for today

1092
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120

 

1093
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,789

okay so this is the first anvil i've

1094
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
okay so this is the first anvil i've
 

1095
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,029
okay so this is the first anvil i've
created i don't know a whole lot about

1096
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
created i don't know a whole lot about
 

1097
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,470
created i don't know a whole lot about
them i'm going to try

1098
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
them i'm going to try
 

1099
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,149
them i'm going to try
figure it out after this episode

1100
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
figure it out after this episode
 

1101
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,510
figure it out after this episode

dropping them on them
 

1119
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,950
dropping them on them
uh you can launch them with tnt a lot of

1120
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
uh you can launch them with tnt a lot of
 

1121
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,470
uh you can launch them with tnt a lot of

1128
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
purposes you can
 

1129
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,230
purposes you can
name stuff with them they found a way to

1130
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
name stuff with them they found a way to
 

1131

efficiency 4 do i have another

1154
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
efficiency 4 do i have another
 

1155
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,750
efficiency 4 do i have another
efficiency 4. i want to see if like if i

1156
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
efficiency 4. i want to see if like if i
 

1157
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,470
efficiency 4. i want to see if like if i
do efficiency 4

1158
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
do efficiency 4
 

1159
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,269
do efficiency 4
if it be if they become efficiency 5 or

1160
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
if it be if they become efficiency 5 or
 

1161
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,830
if it be if they become efficiency 5 or
something because that would be

1162

29 levels to repair it

1196
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:15,760

 

1197
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,710

now
 

1205
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,230
now
yeah i'm gonna read a little bit on this

1206
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240

 

1207
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,070

okay i think i get it a little bit

1208
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
okay i think i get it a little bit
 

1209
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,990
okay i think i get it a little bit
better now i'm still gonna have to

1210
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
better now i'm still gonna have to
 

1211
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,470
better now i'm still gonna have to
mess around with it a bit but yeah you

mess around with it a bit but yeah you
 

1213
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,230
mess around with it a bit but yeah you
can get a higher level like you can get

1214
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
can get a higher level like you can get
 

1215
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,990
can get a higher level like you can get
efficiency 5

1216
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
efficiency 5
 

1217
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,310
efficiency 5
which is awesome i love that

1218
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,320

 

1219
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,350

um i was kind of wondering if you can

1220
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
um i was kind of wondering if you can
 

1221
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,149
um i was kind of wondering if you can
get like

1222
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
get like
 

1223
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,630
get like
level 6 stuff but it almost looks like

1224
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
level 6 stuff but it almost looks like
 

1225
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,350
level 6 stuff but it almost looks like
you can't

1226
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
you can't
 

1227
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,470
you can't
like if you do two power five bows

1228
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
like if you do two power five bows
 

1229
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,230
like if you do two power five bows
it's still power five which is too bad

1230
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
it's still power five which is too bad
 

1231
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,990
it's still power five which is too bad
that would be really cool let's see

1232
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
that would be really cool let's see
 

1233
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,430
that would be really cool let's see
efficiency 5

1234
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440

 

1235
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,549

26 levels before too expensive

1236
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
26 levels before too expensive
 

1237
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,470
26 levels before too expensive
i think you want the damaged one in the

1238
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:14,480
i think you want the damaged one in the
 

1239
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,110
i think you want the damaged one in the
second slot

1240
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120

you might notice patterns though with my
videos like with my let's plays i try to

1320
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
videos like with my let's plays i try to
 

1321
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,549
videos like with my let's plays i try to
upload them

1322
