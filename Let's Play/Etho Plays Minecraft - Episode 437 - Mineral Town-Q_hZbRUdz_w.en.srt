just a little flat spot it's kind of
 

29
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,979
just a little flat spot it's kind of
cool so we can start incorporating those

30
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:48,989
cool so we can start incorporating those
 

31
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,979
cool so we can start incorporating those
at this base I tell you what we're doing

place a theme it needs a theme instead
 

61
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,039
place a theme it needs a theme instead
of just random building so we're gonna

62
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,049
of just random building so we're gonna
 

63
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,350
of just random building so we're gonna
go forward like a mining colony I think

64
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,360
go forward like a mining colony I think
 

65
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,660
go forward like a mining colony I think
like a little mountain mine silver mined

66
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:38,670
like a little mountain mine silver mined
 

67
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,499
like a little mountain mine silver mined
in the in the mountains not silver

in the in the mountains not silver
 

69
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,609
in the in the mountains not silver
though because there's no silver in this

70
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:43,619
though because there's no silver in this
 

71
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,120
though because there's no silver in this

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,050
yeah so we kind of got this this cool
 

95
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,890
yeah so we kind of got this this cool
cool area like part of the the building

96
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:18,900
cool area like part of the the building
 

97
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,510
cool area like part of the the building
is going to be outside in this open area

98
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,520
is going to be outside in this open area
 

99
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,040
is going to be outside in this open area
but a lot of it's also going to be

100
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,050
but a lot of it's also going to be
 

101
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,540
but a lot of it's also going to be
inside the mountain we're going to dig

102
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,550
inside the mountain we're going to dig
 

103
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,090
inside the mountain we're going to dig
like tunnels and stuff let me go get my

104
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,100
like tunnels and stuff let me go get my
 

105
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,150
like tunnels and stuff let me go get my
tea and tea and of course when I say dig

106
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
tea and tea and of course when I say dig
 

107
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,820
tea and tea and of course when I say dig
I mean T&D baby that's the only way to

108
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:31,830
I mean T&D baby that's the only way to
 

109
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,770
I mean T&D baby that's the only way to
go this is a really good way of doing

110
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:33,780
go this is a really good way of doing
 

111
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,610
go this is a really good way of doing
tunnels I found these two pieces do it

112
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:37,620
tunnels I found these two pieces do it
 

113
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,180
tunnels I found these two pieces do it
like that

114
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,190
like that
 

115
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,040
like that
sometimes you need to add a one or two

116
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,050
sometimes you need to add a one or two
 

117
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,380
sometimes you need to add a one or two
more if you place it a little too high

118
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:42,390
more if you place it a little too high
 

119
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,270
more if you place it a little too high
there and yeah it just digs a big area

120
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
there and yeah it just digs a big area
 

121
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,850
there and yeah it just digs a big area
now it's really good if we want to go

122
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:49,860
now it's really good if we want to go
 

123
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,100
now it's really good if we want to go
further just down to more pretty

124
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,110
further just down to more pretty
 

125
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,810
further just down to more pretty
efficient way of digging too like it

126
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:53,820
efficient way of digging too like it
 

127
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,280
efficient way of digging too like it
doesn't take too much TNT do that and

128
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,290
doesn't take too much TNT do that and
 

129
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,750
doesn't take too much TNT do that and
we'll have another big spot pretty

130
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:02,760
we'll have another big spot pretty
 

131
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,070
we'll have another big spot pretty
simple and then just clean it up so yeah

132
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,080
simple and then just clean it up so yeah
 

133
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,290
simple and then just clean it up so yeah
maybe to begin with here let's just try

134
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,300
maybe to begin with here let's just try
 

135
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,570
maybe to begin with here let's just try
to work out the basic look of our

136
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:11,580
to work out the basic look of our
 

137
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,580
to work out the basic look of our
tunnels how we want to do them the

138
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:13,590
tunnels how we want to do them the
 

139
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,490
tunnels how we want to do them the
mineshaft usually when I do tunnels in

140
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:16,500
mineshaft usually when I do tunnels in
 

141
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,170
mineshaft usually when I do tunnels in
this game I like to do these arches I

142
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,180
this game I like to do these arches I
 

143
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,720
this game I like to do these arches I
round it out it's kind of my thing you

144
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:20,730
round it out it's kind of my thing you
 

145
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,080
round it out it's kind of my thing you
know

146
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,090
know
 

147
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,890
know
but in mines like in the movie I saw in

148
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:24,900
but in mines like in the movie I saw in
 

149
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,930
but in mines like in the movie I saw in
like often in video games they have like

150
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:26,940
like often in video games they have like
 

151
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,810
like often in video games they have like
a brace I've noticed so maybe we will

152
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:29,820
a brace I've noticed so maybe we will
 

153
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,940
a brace I've noticed so maybe we will
try to mimic that I'll show you what I

154
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:31,950
try to mimic that I'll show you what I
 

155
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,920
try to mimic that I'll show you what I
mean

156
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:33,930
mean
 

157
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,070
mean
so usually oops we're going to mostly be

158
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,080
so usually oops we're going to mostly be
 

159
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,100
so usually oops we're going to mostly be
building out of wood too but usually

160
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,110
building out of wood too but usually
 

161
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,759
building out of wood too but usually
it'll go up straight logs you know like

162
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:43,769
it'll go up straight logs you know like
 

163
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,810
it'll go up straight logs you know like
so and then it'll cross over maybe or do

164
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:47,820
so and then it'll cross over maybe or do
 

165
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,020
so and then it'll cross over maybe or do
we even want to do that let's try it

166
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,030
we even want to do that let's try it
 

167
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,610
we even want to do that let's try it
cross over kind of like that so it's a

168
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:52,620
cross over kind of like that so it's a
 

169
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,500
cross over kind of like that so it's a
pretty straight look but the thing I

170
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,510
pretty straight look but the thing I
 

171
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,039
pretty straight look but the thing I
really want to try out here and also I'm

172
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,049
really want to try out here and also I'm
 

173
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,660
really want to try out here and also I'm
going to be building with dark oak

174
00:03:59,660 --> 00:03:59,670
going to be building with dark oak
 

175
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,970
going to be building with dark oak
I never build out a dark oak I thought I

176
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:01,980
I never build out a dark oak I thought I
 

177
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,520
I never build out a dark oak I thought I
tried it like with the logs it actually

178
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,530
tried it like with the logs it actually
 

179
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,960
tried it like with the logs it actually
goes pretty good with them I don't know

180
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:05,970
goes pretty good with them I don't know
 

181
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,300
goes pretty good with them I don't know
why I never use it but we could do

182
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,310
why I never use it but we could do
 

183
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,170
why I never use it but we could do
something like this this corner brace is

184
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,180
something like this this corner brace is
 

185
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,330
something like this this corner brace is
going to be a key detail I almost feel

186
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:17,340
going to be a key detail I almost feel
 

187
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,849
going to be a key detail I almost feel
like this needs to be wider though I'm

188
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:19,859
like this needs to be wider though I'm
 

189
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,920
like this needs to be wider though I'm
going to maybe space it two blocks wider

190
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:21,930
going to maybe space it two blocks wider
 

191
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,409
going to maybe space it two blocks wider
and my plan is to then have the rails

192
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:24,419
and my plan is to then have the rails
 

193
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,270
and my plan is to then have the rails
system like down the

194
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,280
system like down the
 

195
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,710
system like down the
the middle like this will probably go

196
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:27,720
the middle like this will probably go
 

197
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,460
the middle like this will probably go
for a double lane instead of a single

198
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:30,470
for a double lane instead of a single
 

199
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,230
for a double lane instead of a single
kind of like this all the way down

200
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,240
kind of like this all the way down
 

201
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,330
kind of like this all the way down
aha yes so something like this I think

202
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,340
aha yes so something like this I think
 

203
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,830
aha yes so something like this I think
it looks pretty good I got rid of the

204
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
it looks pretty good I got rid of the
 

205
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,300
it looks pretty good I got rid of the
logs on the top and I just put in some

206
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,310
logs on the top and I just put in some
 

207
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,270
logs on the top and I just put in some
slabs instead got the corner bracing I

208
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,280
slabs instead got the corner bracing I
 

209
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,700
slabs instead got the corner bracing I
think that looks pretty mineshaft II

210
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,710
think that looks pretty mineshaft II
 

211
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,070
think that looks pretty mineshaft II
right ah the only thing though it might

212
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
right ah the only thing though it might
 

213
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,290
right ah the only thing though it might
be a little wider than I want now it is

214
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,300
be a little wider than I want now it is
 

215
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,110
be a little wider than I want now it is
pretty open in here but that'll that

216
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,120
pretty open in here but that'll that
 

217
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,070
pretty open in here but that'll that
would probably work out pretty good

218
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,080
would probably work out pretty good
 

219
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,060
would probably work out pretty good
because we're gonna fill it up with

220
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,070
because we're gonna fill it up with
 

221
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,550
because we're gonna fill it up with
little details like logs on the ground

222
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
little details like logs on the ground
 

223
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,710
little details like logs on the ground
you know dirt on the ground stuff like

224
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
you know dirt on the ground stuff like
 

225
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,660
you know dirt on the ground stuff like
that just so it doesn't feel quite so

226
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:02,670
that just so it doesn't feel quite so
 

227
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,360
that just so it doesn't feel quite so
plain and empty I got to get used to to

228
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,370
plain and empty I got to get used to to
 

229
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,340
plain and empty I got to get used to to
shift-clicking like or middle clicking

230
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,350
shift-clicking like or middle clicking
 

231
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,210
shift-clicking like or middle clicking
you know to select stuff I keep

232
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,220
you know to select stuff I keep
 

233
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,700
you know to select stuff I keep
switching out manually so let's try add

234
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:13,710
switching out manually so let's try add
 

235
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,220
switching out manually so let's try add
some more details maybe we'll do log on

236
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,230
some more details maybe we'll do log on
 

237
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,909
some more details maybe we'll do log on
across like this connected together

238
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
across like this connected together
 

239
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,240
across like this connected together
maybe we'll do one down the middle kind

240
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,250
maybe we'll do one down the middle kind
 

241
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,510
maybe we'll do one down the middle kind
of like that that does give it a bit of

242
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:26,520
of like that that does give it a bit of
 

243
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,550
of like that that does give it a bit of
an arch feel that might not be a bad

244
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
an arch feel that might not be a bad
 

245
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,780
an arch feel that might not be a bad
thing though I do like my arches oh yeah

246
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:32,790
thing though I do like my arches oh yeah
 

247
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,710
thing though I do like my arches oh yeah
let's middle click and then maybe one

248
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
let's middle click and then maybe one
 

249
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,440
let's middle click and then maybe one
more being going across here or maybe

250
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,450
more being going across here or maybe
 

251
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,650
more being going across here or maybe
one lower even let's try one lower and

252
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:42,660
one lower even let's try one lower and
 

253
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,590
one lower even let's try one lower and
compare the two mmm I don't really want

254
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,600
compare the two mmm I don't really want
 

255
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,330
compare the two mmm I don't really want
it connecting to this brace I want it I

256
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,340
it connecting to this brace I want it I
 

257
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,080
it connecting to this brace I want it I
think I want it higher up yeah okay let

258
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,090
think I want it higher up yeah okay let
 

259
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,550
think I want it higher up yeah okay let
me let me do a little bit more here Oh

260
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,560
me let me do a little bit more here Oh
 

261
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,990
me let me do a little bit more here Oh
actually let's figure out the floor too

262
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,000
actually let's figure out the floor too
 

263
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,900
actually let's figure out the floor too
before I cut again so I brought a few

264
00:05:59,900 --> 00:05:59,910
before I cut again so I brought a few
 

265
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,250
before I cut again so I brought a few
blocks here that I thought would work

266
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,260
blocks here that I thought would work
 

267
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,480
blocks here that I thought would work
out pretty good we're going to use

268
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,490
out pretty good we're going to use
 

269
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,150
out pretty good we're going to use
mycelium maybe coarse dirts gonna be a

270
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,160
mycelium maybe coarse dirts gonna be a
 

271
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,340
mycelium maybe coarse dirts gonna be a
pretty big part of it and maybe

272
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,350
pretty big part of it and maybe
 

273
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,800
pretty big part of it and maybe
underneath the rails we'll try to do

274
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:09,810
underneath the rails we'll try to do
 

275
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,380
underneath the rails we'll try to do
some spruce wood just to give it some

276
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:12,390
some spruce wood just to give it some
 

277
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,140
some spruce wood just to give it some
more structure you know all right let's

278
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,150
more structure you know all right let's
 

279
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,990
more structure you know all right let's
clear out some grounds and then for the

280
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
clear out some grounds and then for the
 

281
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,390
clear out some grounds and then for the
walls I haven't really decided if we're

282
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
walls I haven't really decided if we're
 

283
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,620
walls I haven't really decided if we're
going to keep them stone or if we're

284
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:21,630
going to keep them stone or if we're
 

285
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,880
going to keep them stone or if we're
going to try to change them out with

286
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:22,890
going to try to change them out with
 

287
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,500
going to try to change them out with
another type of block like dirts or

288
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,510
another type of block like dirts or
 

289
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,920
another type of block like dirts or
gravel

290
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:26,930
gravel
 

291
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,940
gravel
let's do the floor first and we'll

292
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:28,950
let's do the floor first and we'll
 

293
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,909
let's do the floor first and we'll
figure it out okay yeah so down the

294
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
figure it out okay yeah so down the
 

295
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,630
figure it out okay yeah so down the
middle we don't want to make it totally

296
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:35,640
middle we don't want to make it totally
 

297
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,660
middle we don't want to make it totally
uniform let's see the middle is

298
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:39,670
uniform let's see the middle is
 

299
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,540
uniform let's see the middle is
here kind of like a pretty good amount

300
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:42,550
here kind of like a pretty good amount
 

301
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,280
here kind of like a pretty good amount
of spruce wood but not totally solid you

302
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,290
of spruce wood but not totally solid you
 

303
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,180
of spruce wood but not totally solid you
know kind of randomly span it a little

304
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,190
know kind of randomly span it a little
 

305
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,770
know kind of randomly span it a little
bit Oh ash is good like that not totally

306
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:52,780
bit Oh ash is good like that not totally
 

307
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,020
bit Oh ash is good like that not totally
random but fairly random okay and then

308
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,030
random but fairly random okay and then
 

309
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,910
random but fairly random okay and then
in these other spaces we'll put in some

310
00:06:59,910 --> 00:06:59,920
in these other spaces we'll put in some
 

311
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,580
in these other spaces we'll put in some
coarse dirts actually this is bad

312
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:05,590
coarse dirts actually this is bad
 

313
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,070
coarse dirts actually this is bad
that's that's a that's making a pattern

314
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
that's that's a that's making a pattern
 

315
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:16,070
that's that's a that's making a pattern
we don't want patterns okay that's no

316
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
we don't want patterns okay that's no
 

317
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,370
we don't want patterns okay that's no

horses yes all right we'll check those
out later all right guys so we got a

336
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,270
out later all right guys so we got a
 

337
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,120
out later all right guys so we got a
pretty good basic look going on here

338
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,130
pretty good basic look going on here
 

339
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,410
pretty good basic look going on here
good start to it I would say um yeah I

340
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:01,420
good start to it I would say um yeah I
 

341
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,240
good start to it I would say um yeah I
think I'm happy with this so I did put

342
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,250
think I'm happy with this so I did put
 

343
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,220
think I'm happy with this so I did put
the mycelium down I tried mixing in some

344
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,230
the mycelium down I tried mixing in some
 

345
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,170
the mycelium down I tried mixing in some
mushroom blocks just for a different

346
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:07,180
mushroom blocks just for a different
 

347
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,750
mushroom blocks just for a different
texture and I'm trying to decide how to

348
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:09,760
texture and I'm trying to decide how to
 

349
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,880
texture and I'm trying to decide how to
do the sides here so I tried just

350
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:11,890
do the sides here so I tried just
 

351
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,950
do the sides here so I tried just
putting fences in front like in front of

352
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:13,960
putting fences in front like in front of
 

353
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,840
putting fences in front like in front of
stone then I tried in front of gravel in

354
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:15,850
stone then I tried in front of gravel in
 

355
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,840
stone then I tried in front of gravel in
front of course dirtier and other ideas

356
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:18,850
front of course dirtier and other ideas
 

357
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,870
front of course dirtier and other ideas
not to do the fences just like randomly

358
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:21,880
not to do the fences just like randomly
 

359
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,390
not to do the fences just like randomly
put stuff on the ground like wood or for

360
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
put stuff on the ground like wood or for
 

361
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
put stuff on the ground like wood or for
things like that I'm not sure what I

362
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,410
things like that I'm not sure what I
 

363
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,900
things like that I'm not sure what I
liked the most or maybe we could just

364
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:27,910
liked the most or maybe we could just
 

365
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,480
liked the most or maybe we could just
alternate a little bit - oh man did you

366
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,490
alternate a little bit - oh man did you
 

367
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,719
alternate a little bit - oh man did you
see it did you notice we did something

368
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:36,729
see it did you notice we did something
 

369
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,690
see it did you notice we did something
crazy here we went one to the left and

370
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:39,700
crazy here we went one to the left and
 

371
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,570
crazy here we went one to the left and
one down with with this tunnel design

372
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:42,580
one down with with this tunnel design
 

373
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,170
one down with with this tunnel design
now that's I know it's nuts it's not

374
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:46,180
now that's I know it's nuts it's not
 

375
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,200
now that's I know it's nuts it's not
perfect we're adding in imperfection to

376
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,210
perfect we're adding in imperfection to
 

377
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,700
perfect we're adding in imperfection to
the tunnel and I think that's going to

378
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:50,710
the tunnel and I think that's going to
 

379
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,200
the tunnel and I think that's going to
be a key to making this an interesting

380
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,210
be a key to making this an interesting
 

381
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,490
be a key to making this an interesting
build if we just did it

382
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:53,500
build if we just did it
 

383
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,320
build if we just did it

every section here it's going to be a

386
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:57,580
every section here it's going to be a
 

387
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,700
every section here it's going to be a
pretty boring build in the end of thing

388
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,710
pretty boring build in the end of thing
 

389
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,260
pretty boring build in the end of thing
so I want to add little variations like

390
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,270
so I want to add little variations like
 

391
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,410
so I want to add little variations like
this into it and even like at the second

392
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,420
this into it and even like at the second
 

393
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,180
this into it and even like at the second
section here I was thinking it'd be kind

394
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,190
section here I was thinking it'd be kind
 

395
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,600
section here I was thinking it'd be kind
of cool if we add it in like a creek

396
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:09,610
of cool if we add it in like a creek
 

397
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,400
of cool if we add it in like a creek
that runs across you know and then like

398
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,410
that runs across you know and then like
 

399
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,450
that runs across you know and then like
they bridged over the water like a creek

400
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:14,460
they bridged over the water like a creek
 

401
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,120
they bridged over the water like a creek
from that side flowing this way might be

402
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,130
from that side flowing this way might be
 

403
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,700
from that side flowing this way might be
a cool little thing to do

404
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,710
a cool little thing to do
 

405
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,840
a cool little thing to do
just add a little more character to

406
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:21,850
just add a little more character to
 

407
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,820
just add a little more character to
different areas mm-hmm so something like

408
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:26,830
different areas mm-hmm so something like
 

409
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,470
different areas mm-hmm so something like
this is what I had in mind but I

410
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
this is what I had in mind but I
 

411
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,810
this is what I had in mind but I
reversed it so it comes down here goes

412
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:30,820
reversed it so it comes down here goes
 

413
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,090
reversed it so it comes down here goes
this way there was some redstone over

414
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,100
this way there was some redstone over
 

415
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,740
this way there was some redstone over
here so I wanted to be a little bit

416
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:34,750
here so I wanted to be a little bit
 

417
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,190
here so I wanted to be a little bit
careful about putting water in that area

418
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
careful about putting water in that area
 

419
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,590
careful about putting water in that area
we just bridged over top like so now

420
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:40,600
we just bridged over top like so now
 

421
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,050
we just bridged over top like so now
what we're going to do instead of doing

422
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,060
what we're going to do instead of doing
 

423
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,330
what we're going to do instead of doing
like tunnels everywhere what we're going

424
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:45,340
like tunnels everywhere what we're going
 

425
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,160
like tunnels everywhere what we're going
to do is have rooms every so often as

426
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,170
to do is have rooms every so often as
 

427
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,570
to do is have rooms every so often as
well so I'm going to open it up quite a

428
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:48,580
well so I'm going to open it up quite a
 

429
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,240
well so I'm going to open it up quite a
bit here got the TNT ready hopefully

430
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,250
bit here got the TNT ready hopefully
 

431
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,620
bit here got the TNT ready hopefully
this doesn't make a mess it's kind of

432
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:52,630
this doesn't make a mess it's kind of
 

433
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,660
this doesn't make a mess it's kind of
close to here OOP I think we did okay

434
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:57,670
close to here OOP I think we did okay
 

435
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,540
close to here OOP I think we did okay
there oh man

436
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:00,550
there oh man
 

437
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,440
there oh man
that made a big hole all right that's

438
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:04,450
that made a big hole all right that's
 

439
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,120
that made a big hole all right that's
good it looks like it goes up to the

440
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,130
good it looks like it goes up to the
 

441
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,300
good it looks like it goes up to the
surface here after all this tunnel like

442
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,310
surface here after all this tunnel like
 

443
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,260
surface here after all this tunnel like
this mountain

444
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,270
this mountain
 

445
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,630
this mountain
I checked out how far it goes and it's

446
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
I checked out how far it goes and it's
 

447
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,360
I checked out how far it goes and it's
insane it goes all the way you see the

448
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,370
insane it goes all the way you see the
 

449
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,310
insane it goes all the way you see the
opening at the end there like we're out

450
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:17,320
opening at the end there like we're out
 

451
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,980
opening at the end there like we're out
that Y 157 here there's just a giant

452
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:19,990
that Y 157 here there's just a giant
 

453
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,940
that Y 157 here there's just a giant
amount of land way up in the sky for us

454
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:23,950
amount of land way up in the sky for us
 

455
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,940
amount of land way up in the sky for us
to work with which is kind of cool but I

456
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:26,950
to work with which is kind of cool but I
 

457
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,520
to work with which is kind of cool but I
guess there's areas where it kind of

458
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,530
guess there's areas where it kind of
 

459
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,210
guess there's areas where it kind of
reaches outside like there okay so I'm

460
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:33,220
reaches outside like there okay so I'm
 

461
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,160
reaches outside like there okay so I'm
gonna maybe do a little bit more digging

462
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,170
gonna maybe do a little bit more digging
 

463
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,640
gonna maybe do a little bit more digging
and stuff here we should get a beacon

464
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:38,650
and stuff here we should get a beacon
 

465
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,120
and stuff here we should get a beacon
over here too that would be a good idea

466
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,130
over here too that would be a good idea
 

467
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,470
over here too that would be a good idea
yeah I'm gonna go get the iron to make a

468
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:43,480
yeah I'm gonna go get the iron to make a
 

469
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,300
yeah I'm gonna go get the iron to make a
beacon here I want to see if we can do

470
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,310
beacon here I want to see if we can do
 

471
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,680
beacon here I want to see if we can do
this portal trick to get back home

472
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:46,690
this portal trick to get back home
 

473
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,140
this portal trick to get back home
though so we're like minus 5000 Zed

474
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,150
though so we're like minus 5000 Zed
 

475
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,210
though so we're like minus 5000 Zed
right now let's see if it'll take us

476
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,220
right now let's see if it'll take us
 

477
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:57,150
right now let's see if it'll take us
back to near our spawn oh think it

478
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,160
back to near our spawn oh think it
 

479
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,560
back to near our spawn oh think it
worked where are we now - 600 okay so

480
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:01,570
worked where are we now - 600 okay so
 

481
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,840
worked where are we now - 600 okay so
it's like a rounding error it divides by

482
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:03,850
it's like a rounding error it divides by
 

483
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,350
it's like a rounding error it divides by
eight I believe

484
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,360
eight I believe
 

485
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,419
eight I believe
yeah it takes your coordinates divides

486
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:08,429
yeah it takes your coordinates divides
 

487
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,220
yeah it takes your coordinates divides
by eight I'm pretty sure and that's

488
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,230
by eight I'm pretty sure and that's
 

489
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,869
by eight I'm pretty sure and that's
where it puts you so we're not quite at

490
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:11,879
where it puts you so we're not quite at
 

491
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,699
where it puts you so we're not quite at
the man cave over here but we're pretty

492
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:13,709
the man cave over here but we're pretty
 

493
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,259
the man cave over here but we're pretty
close wait a minute I just found a witch

494
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:18,269
close wait a minute I just found a witch
 

495
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,850
close wait a minute I just found a witch
huts at 100 and minus 400 I think this

496
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:22,860
huts at 100 and minus 400 I think this
 

497
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,579
huts at 100 and minus 400 I think this
is pretty close to our base I've never

498
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:25,589
is pretty close to our base I've never
 

499
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:31,129
is pretty close to our base I've never
seen it before though aha I wonder if it

500
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:31,139
seen it before though aha I wonder if it
 

501
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,539
seen it before though aha I wonder if it
still works or if it's no longer

502
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:32,549
still works or if it's no longer
 

503
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,039
still works or if it's no longer
spawning them because there is a couple

504
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,049
spawning them because there is a couple
 

505
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,299
spawning them because there is a couple
changes in the game that might have

506
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:35,309
changes in the game that might have
 

507
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:44,509
changes in the game that might have
broke it okay very good so we got our

508
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:44,519
broke it okay very good so we got our
 

509
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,919
broke it okay very good so we got our
room taking shape here we've got a

510
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:45,929
room taking shape here we've got a
 

511
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,780
room taking shape here we've got a
little bit of space to work with try to

512
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:47,790
little bit of space to work with try to
 

513
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,329
little bit of space to work with try to
figure out what we want to do I did run

514
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:50,339
figure out what we want to do I did run
 

515
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,489
figure out what we want to do I did run
into some open area over here apparently

516
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:52,499
into some open area over here apparently
 

517
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:55,609
into some open area over here apparently
a lot of open area this is a really cool

518
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:55,619
a lot of open area this is a really cool
 

519
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:58,759
a lot of open area this is a really cool
spot too though like we might do some

520
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:58,769
spot too though like we might do some
 

521
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:00,470
spot too though like we might do some
scaffolding out on this on the side of

522
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
scaffolding out on this on the side of
 

523
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,789
scaffolding out on this on the side of
the mountain here that would be nice I

524
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:01,799
the mountain here that would be nice I
 

525
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,009
the mountain here that would be nice I
think ah but yeah let's try figure out

526
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:04,019
think ah but yeah let's try figure out
 

527
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,019
think ah but yeah let's try figure out
what we want to do here oh and I just

528
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:06,029
what we want to do here oh and I just
 

529
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,119
what we want to do here oh and I just
put that beacon up there for the time

530
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:08,129
put that beacon up there for the time
 

531
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,289
put that beacon up there for the time
being

532
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:09,299
being
 

533
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,400
being
find a better spot for it later okay so

534
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,410
find a better spot for it later okay so
 

535
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,710
find a better spot for it later okay so
I sort of want to dig like a little hole

536
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:15,720
I sort of want to dig like a little hole
 

537
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,669
I sort of want to dig like a little hole
down here

538
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:16,679
down here
 

539
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,859
down here
um maybe one two three four five five

540
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:21,869
um maybe one two three four five five
 

541
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:29,239
um maybe one two three four five five
blocks we'll leave from here and do some

542
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:29,249
blocks we'll leave from here and do some
 

543
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,249
blocks we'll leave from here and do some
things like this going up and then every

544
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:31,259
things like this going up and then every
 

545
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,119
things like this going up and then every
third one or so little do fences between

546
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:35,129
third one or so little do fences between
 

547
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,759
third one or so little do fences between
here alright and then down here this is

548
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:40,769
here alright and then down here this is
 

549
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:41,889
here alright and then down here this is
like where the holes going to be I guess

550
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:41,899
like where the holes going to be I guess
 

551
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,389
like where the holes going to be I guess
we'll start digging down we'll have

552
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
we'll start digging down we'll have
 

553
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,369
we'll start digging down we'll have
little pathways to get down here because

554
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:46,379
little pathways to get down here because
 

555
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,619
little pathways to get down here because
I want like tunnels branching off to

556
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:48,629
I want like tunnels branching off to
 

557
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,659
I want like tunnels branching off to
different places of the mountain here so

558
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:50,669
different places of the mountain here so
 

559
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,100
different places of the mountain here so
I want it to go down and then maybe

560
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,110
I want it to go down and then maybe
 

561
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,009
I want it to go down and then maybe
we'll have a tunnel that comes out lower

562
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:55,019
we'll have a tunnel that comes out lower
 

563
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,889
we'll have a tunnel that comes out lower
down on the mountain somewhere like down

564
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:57,899
down on the mountain somewhere like down
 

565
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,329
down on the mountain somewhere like down
there I don't know how that's going to

566
00:12:59,329 --> 00:12:59,339
there I don't know how that's going to
 

567
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,569
there I don't know how that's going to
work out exactly but we'll figure it out

568
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:01,579
work out exactly but we'll figure it out
 

569
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,879
work out exactly but we'll figure it out
I also wanted to do a thing here like

570
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:04,889
I also wanted to do a thing here like
 

571
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:10,909
I also wanted to do a thing here like
where we sort of make kind of like a

572
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:10,919
where we sort of make kind of like a
 

573
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,979
where we sort of make kind of like a
covering over top this area here like

574
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:12,989
covering over top this area here like
 

575
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:17,869
covering over top this area here like
have it go up at this angle and maybe a

576
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:17,879
have it go up at this angle and maybe a
 

577
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:32,600
have it go up at this angle and maybe a
room up at the top there would be

578
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:32,610

 

579
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,780

nope

580
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:33,790
nope
 

581
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,970
nope
logs are too bulky here let's put put

582
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:35,980
logs are too bulky here let's put put
 

583
00:13:35,980 --> 00:14:00,630
logs are too bulky here let's put put
some slabs in instead like us Oh awesome

584
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:00,640
some slabs in instead like us Oh awesome
 

585
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,430
some slabs in instead like us Oh awesome
so we got a couple more things built

586
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:02,440
so we got a couple more things built
 

587
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,990
so we got a couple more things built
here guys let me show you what's going

588
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
here guys let me show you what's going
 

589
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,330
here guys let me show you what's going
on so I did do this covering thing I

590
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,340
on so I did do this covering thing I
 

591
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,190
on so I did do this covering thing I
think it turned out pretty decently I'm

592
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,200
think it turned out pretty decently I'm
 

593
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,060
think it turned out pretty decently I'm
happy with it

594
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,070
happy with it
 

595
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,580
happy with it
ah it's kind of gives us a bit of a

596
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:11,590
ah it's kind of gives us a bit of a
 

597
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,710
ah it's kind of gives us a bit of a
sheltered feel like you don't want rocks

598
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:13,720
sheltered feel like you don't want rocks
 

599
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,850
sheltered feel like you don't want rocks
falling on our head you know um then I

600
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:17,860
falling on our head you know um then I
 

601
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,370
falling on our head you know um then I
was I was falling into that habit again

602
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:20,380
was I was falling into that habit again
 

603
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,290
was I was falling into that habit again
I was making things too symmetrical to

604
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,300
I was making things too symmetrical to
 

605
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,950
I was making things too symmetrical to
perfect and so I like move this log out

606
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:25,960
perfect and so I like move this log out
 

607
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,410
perfect and so I like move this log out
one block and then did this one kind of

608
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:28,420
one block and then did this one kind of
 

609
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,270
one block and then did this one kind of
want you to just so it's got a little

610
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:30,280
want you to just so it's got a little
 

611
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,030
want you to just so it's got a little
bit more variety to it same thing over

612
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
bit more variety to it same thing over
 

613
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,340
bit more variety to it same thing over
here experimented with another way of

614
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,350
here experimented with another way of
 

615
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,530
here experimented with another way of
doing like a retaining wall just doing

616
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:37,540
doing like a retaining wall just doing
 

617
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,640
doing like a retaining wall just doing
slabs instead of fences might be an idea

618
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:40,650
slabs instead of fences might be an idea
 

619
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,380
slabs instead of fences might be an idea
and then I was working on building like

620
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,390
and then I was working on building like
 

621
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,820
and then I was working on building like
a crane for like picking up the minerals

622
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:47,830
a crane for like picking up the minerals
 

623
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,280
a crane for like picking up the minerals
from down below here I have found out

624
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,290
from down below here I have found out
 

625
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,250
from down below here I have found out
I'm not very good at building these I

626
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:52,260
I'm not very good at building these I
 

627
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm not very good at building these I
don't know I don't know what's the trick

628
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,330
don't know I don't know what's the trick
 

629
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,800
don't know I don't know what's the trick
to them I'm just like randomly putting

630
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:01,810
to them I'm just like randomly putting
 

631
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,710
to them I'm just like randomly putting
stuff together hoping it looks good

632
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:03,720

and maybe around here we'll connect the
 

645
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,830
and maybe around here we'll connect the
load to it so we'll just do like a three

646
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:22,840
load to it so we'll just do like a three
 

647
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,740

by three half slab platform here we'll

648
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:25,750
by three half slab platform here we'll
 

649
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,410
by three half slab platform here we'll
load on some coal or or something make

650
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:28,420
load on some coal or or something make
 

651

it look like we're bringing it up

652
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,070

 

653
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,509

okay oops and then we'll connect rope

654
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
okay oops and then we'll connect rope
 

655
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,819
okay oops and then we'll connect rope
here the corners and somehow connected

656
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:40,829
here the corners and somehow connected
 

657
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:45,530
here the corners and somehow connected
to the middle rope um I saw a thing

658
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:45,540
to the middle rope um I saw a thing
 

659
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,840
to the middle rope um I saw a thing
somebody did once they like let's see if

660

I can copy it they had like a solid

662
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:49,949
I can copy it they had like a solid
 

663
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,749
I can copy it they had like a solid
block here and then I think they did

664
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:52,759
block here and then I think they did
 

665
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,620
block here and then I think they did
fence gates and opened it like that and

666
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:57,630
fence gates and opened it like that and
 

667
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,040
fence gates and opened it like that and
I guess they brought this up higher than

668
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,050
I guess they brought this up higher than
 

669
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,540
I guess they brought this up higher than
yeah kind of makes it look like it

670
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:02,550
yeah kind of makes it look like it

connects that way you take this out yeah
 

673
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,939
connects that way you take this out yeah
I think that's kind of cool uh oh he

674

994
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,450
pumpkins grow and because of that
 

995
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,880
pumpkins grow and because of that
there's no like redstone clocks running
