uh we're just hanging out with my
original base here

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
original base here
 

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,349
original base here
i've been working at laying the tnt

10
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
i've been working at laying the tnt
 

11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,790
i've been working at laying the tnt
charges for

12
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
charges for
 

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,269
charges for
the destruction of the island like we

14
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
the destruction of the island like we
 

15
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,550
the destruction of the island like we
planned

16
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
planned
 

17
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,830
planned
i got all the tunnels dug now and i was

18
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
i got all the tunnels dug now and i was
 

19
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,710
i got all the tunnels dug now and i was
laying charges

20
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
laying charges
 

21
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,630
laying charges
but it turns out that i did not have

22
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
but it turns out that i did not have
 

23
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,830
but it turns out that i did not have
enough tnt

24
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
enough tnt
 

25
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,190
enough tnt
so that's why i'm over here i've just

26
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
so that's why i'm over here i've just
 

27
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,709
so that's why i'm over here i've just
been working on stuff around this base

28
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
been working on stuff around this base
 

29
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,630
been working on stuff around this base
mostly just collecting resources at the

30
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
mostly just collecting resources at the
 

31
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,670
mostly just collecting resources at the
moment

32
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680

 

33
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,670

i've been working on doing colored wool

34
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
i've been working on doing colored wool
 

35
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,830
i've been working on doing colored wool
and stuff

36
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
and stuff
 

37
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,830

and every now and then i just come over
here and pick up

40
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
here and pick up
 

41
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,670
here and pick up
whatever gunpowder there is so that we

42
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
whatever gunpowder there is so that we
 

43
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,790
whatever gunpowder there is so that we
can make some more tnt

44
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
can make some more tnt
 

45
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,830
can make some more tnt
because at the moment i am out pretty

46
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
because at the moment i am out pretty
 

47
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,389
because at the moment i am out pretty
much

48
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
much
 

49
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,029
much
so in order to blow up that island we

50
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
so in order to blow up that island we
 

51
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,590
so in order to blow up that island we
need a lot more tnt i've placed about

52
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
need a lot more tnt i've placed about
 

53
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,469
need a lot more tnt i've placed about
400

54
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
400
 

55
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,630
400
so far and in total i expect

56
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
so far and in total i expect
 

57
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,030
so far and in total i expect
i'll need to place at least a thousand

58
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
i'll need to place at least a thousand
 

59
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,990
i'll need to place at least a thousand
to blow up

60
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
to blow up
 

61
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,870
to blow up
that island i actually did a

62
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
that island i actually did a
 

63
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,749
that island i actually did a
a test explosion and it turned out

64
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
a test explosion and it turned out
 

65
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,830
a test explosion and it turned out
really nice it's actually very cool

66
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
really nice it's actually very cool
 

67
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,310
really nice it's actually very cool
i think you guys are gonna like the

68
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
i think you guys are gonna like the
 

69
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,870
i think you guys are gonna like the
thing when it's all set up

70
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
thing when it's all set up
 

71
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,109
thing when it's all set up
it's going to be very cool explosion but

72
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
it's going to be very cool explosion but
 

73
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,630
it's going to be very cool explosion but
i don't know how long it's going to take

74
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
i don't know how long it's going to take
 

75
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,429
i don't know how long it's going to take
before we can

76
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
before we can
 

77
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,270
before we can
do that because getting gunpowder is

78
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
do that because getting gunpowder is
 

79
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,550
do that because getting gunpowder is
taking

80
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
taking
 

81
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,670
taking
quite a while it turns out

82
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
quite a while it turns out
 

83
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,870
quite a while it turns out
i've been collecting

84
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880

 

85
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,109

different dyes and wools

86
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119

 

87
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,270

i've been harvesting trees and stuff

88
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280

 

89
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,030

and i still have only made about one

90
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
and i still have only made about one
 

91
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,830
and i still have only made about one
stack of tnt since i got here and

92
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
stack of tnt since i got here and
 

93
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,510
stack of tnt since i got here and
[Applause]

94
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
[Applause]
 

95
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,709
[Applause]
it's going to take a while so maybe work

96
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
it's going to take a while so maybe work
 

97
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,510
it's going to take a while so maybe work
on

98
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
on
 

99
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,469
on
a project around here today

100
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
a project around here today
 

101
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,830
a project around here today
hmm well i know one simple project

102
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
hmm well i know one simple project
 

103
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,309
hmm well i know one simple project
i wanted to do is replace this black

104
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
i wanted to do is replace this black
 

105
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,110
i wanted to do is replace this black
wool

106
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
wool
 

107
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,390
wool
block with an actual coal block this is

108
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
block with an actual coal block this is
 

109
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,350
block with an actual coal block this is
what i have here

110
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
what i have here
 

111
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,790
what i have here
coal and now that we have pistons we can

112
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
coal and now that we have pistons we can
 

113
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,190
coal and now that we have pistons we can
actually do that so maybe

114
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
actually do that so maybe
 

115
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,430
actually do that so maybe
try to find a coal block somewhere

116
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
try to find a coal block somewhere
 

117
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,350
try to find a coal block somewhere
around here

118
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
around here
 

119
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,869
around here
and move it over

120
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879

 

121
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,750

there's some

122
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
there's some
 

123
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,670
there's some
so this might take a little while but

124
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
so this might take a little while but
 

125
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,949
so this might take a little while but
we'll see

126
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
we'll see
 

127
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,110
we'll see
how this goes it's sticky piston

128
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120

 

129
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,670

stick it there that won't work

130
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
stick it there that won't work
 

131
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,229
stick it there that won't work
stick it there

132
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239

 

133
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,430

move to one block

134
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440

 

135
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,350

um let's move it one more

136
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
um let's move it one more
 

137
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,630
um let's move it one more
get it out and open

138
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640

 

139
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,149

and then we want it three up

140
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
and then we want it three up
 

141
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,750
and then we want it three up
i know

142
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
i know
 

143
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,670
i know
so one two three four five

144
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
so one two three four five
 

145
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,910
so one two three four five
ouch

146
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920

 

147
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,190

oh too far

148
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
oh too far
 

149
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,710
oh too far
i should really be using a regular

150
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
i should really be using a regular
 

151
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,869
i should really be using a regular
piston for this

152
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879

 

153
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,789

and where's my levers

154
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799

 

155
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,509

okay moved it up one

156
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519

 

157
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,830

and one more

158
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

159
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,309

sweet

160
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
sweet
 

161
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:11,670
sweet
okay now to get it that way

162
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680

 

163
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,070

piston there and i'm going to stick a

164
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
piston there and i'm going to stick a
 

165
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,069
piston there and i'm going to stick a
block in

166
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079

 

167
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:29,510

inch it over that way

168
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
inch it over that way
 

169
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,870
inch it over that way
and you get the idea so 10 hours later

170
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
and you get the idea so 10 hours later
 

171
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,550
and you get the idea so 10 hours later
i'll have it in place

172
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560

 

173
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,150

five hours in it's almost in place

174
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
five hours in it's almost in place
 

175
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,110
five hours in it's almost in place
making record time here

176
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120

 

177
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,150

sweet just gotta move it two more blocks

178
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
sweet just gotta move it two more blocks

the other problem is this is wood here

354
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
the other problem is this is wood here
 

355
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,230
the other problem is this is wood here
and i'm using sandstone there so i need

356
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
and i'm using sandstone there so i need
 

357
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,670
and i'm using sandstone there so i need
to kind of

358
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
to kind of
 

359
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,670
to kind of
merge them together some way too

360
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680

 

361
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,949

and choose

362
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959

 

363
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,630

hmm i gotta figure out

364
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
hmm i gotta figure out
 

365
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,630
hmm i gotta figure out
i'll be back

366
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640

 

367
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,269

i decided i'm gonna try have a gradual

368
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
i decided i'm gonna try have a gradual
 

369
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,150
i decided i'm gonna try have a gradual
straight slope from here

370
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
straight slope from here
 

371
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,269
straight slope from here
three wide one two

372
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
three wide one two
 

373
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,470
three wide one two
three

374
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480

 

375
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,190

matches up with this and i'll probably

376
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
matches up with this and i'll probably
 

377
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,069
matches up with this and i'll probably
have like

378
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
have like
 

379
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,150
have like
railing on the side made out of fences

380
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
railing on the side made out of fences
 

381
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,829
railing on the side made out of fences
half slab

382
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839

 

383
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,150

and more sandstone

384
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160

 

385
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,389

i don't know

386
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
i don't know
 

387
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,990
i don't know
let's see how it looks

388
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000

 

389
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,910

and half slab

390
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920

 

391
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,030

hmm

392
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040

 

393
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,230

so we got that

394
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240

 

395
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,910

i wish they had sandstone stairs that

396
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
i wish they had sandstone stairs that
 

397
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,230
i wish they had sandstone stairs that
would be cool

398
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240

 

399
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,069

and

400
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079

 

401
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,790

i don't know maybe i'll try wood planks

402
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
i don't know maybe i'll try wood planks
 

403
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:06,949
i don't know maybe i'll try wood planks
and see how that looks

404
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959

 

405
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,550

you guys are probably like oh don't do

406
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
you guys are probably like oh don't do
 

407
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,629
you guys are probably like oh don't do
the wood planks no

408
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639

 

409
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,230

worst combination ever

410
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240

 

411
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,150

i need some kind of transition to the

412
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
i need some kind of transition to the
 

413
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,389
i need some kind of transition to the
wood planking so if i have both

414
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
wood planking so if i have both
 

415
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:33,430
wood planking so if i have both
you know

416
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440

 

417
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,990

i don't know

418
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000

 

419
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,430

and of course lighting is always a

420
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
and of course lighting is always a
 

421
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,949
and of course lighting is always a
problem for me

422
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959

 

423
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,389

yeah i think i'm okay with that i might

424
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
yeah i think i'm okay with that i might
 

425
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,069
yeah i think i'm okay with that i might
change the wood planking though

426
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
change the wood planking though
 

427
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,590
change the wood planking though
let me know what you guys think should i

428
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
let me know what you guys think should i
 

429
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:59,509
let me know what you guys think should i
use logs or something else

430
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519

 

431
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,590

maybe i'll try blend these in

432
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600

 

433
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:22,150

have a little transition here

434
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160

 

435
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:32,470

that's not bad

436
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480

 

437
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,190

yeah i can live with that for now anyway

438
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
yeah i can live with that for now anyway
 

439
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,949
yeah i can live with that for now anyway
uh if you guys got improvements let me

440
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
uh if you guys got improvements let me
 

441
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,430
uh if you guys got improvements let me
know

442
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440

 

443
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,670

oh another idea is to use glowstone

444
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
oh another idea is to use glowstone
 

445
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,150
oh another idea is to use glowstone
where these wood planks are

446
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
where these wood planks are
 

447
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,150
where these wood planks are
for light possibly

448
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160

 

449
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,990

or just have glowstone chandeliers or

450
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
or just have glowstone chandeliers or
 

451
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,189
or just have glowstone chandeliers or
something i don't know

452
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199

 

453
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,350

okay so we got some way of getting down

454
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
okay so we got some way of getting down
 

455
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,230
okay so we got some way of getting down
here now

456
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
here now
 

457
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,509
here now
um i may put the quit

458
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
um i may put the quit
 

459
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,590
um i may put the quit
kit thing over here since we have a big

460
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
kit thing over here since we have a big
 

461
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:14,829
kit thing over here since we have a big
solid block to work with i believe

462
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839

 

463
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,870

and

464
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
and
 

465
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:25,509
and
i'll clean this up more later

466
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519

 

467
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,750

yeah so probably i'll probably build a

468
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
yeah so probably i'll probably build a
 

469
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,949
yeah so probably i'll probably build a
quick kit here

470
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
quick kit here
 

471
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,350
quick kit here
and i may do it out of sandstone

472
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360

 

473
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,269

i decide i'm going to try place it here

474
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
i decide i'm going to try place it here
 

475
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,509
i decide i'm going to try place it here
after all so i got it kind of marked out

476
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
after all so i got it kind of marked out
 

477
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,030
after all so i got it kind of marked out
a little bit

478
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
a little bit
 

479
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,269
a little bit
there's going to be a wall here on the

480
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
there's going to be a wall here on the
 

481
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,189
there's going to be a wall here on the
outside

482
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199

 

483
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,069

it's going to be an opening here this is

484
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
it's going to be an opening here this is
 

485
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,509
it's going to be an opening here this is
where the items are going to be

486
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
where the items are going to be
 

487
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,269
where the items are going to be
that i collect right where this torch is

488
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
that i collect right where this torch is
 

489
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,550
that i collect right where this torch is
and inside this area

490
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
and inside this area
 

491
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,509
and inside this area
doesn't really matter how you shape this

492
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
doesn't really matter how you shape this
 

493
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,389
doesn't really matter how you shape this
all it is

494
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
all it is
 

495
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,750
all it is
is just going to be a bunch of

496
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
is just going to be a bunch of
 

497
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,590
is just going to be a bunch of
dispensers down in here

498
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
dispensers down in here
 

499
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,189
dispensers down in here
that are going to deliver the items to

500
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
that are going to deliver the items to
 

501
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,269
that are going to deliver the items to
me

502
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
me
 

503
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,790
me
so you can shape it however you want and

504
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
so you can shape it however you want and
 

505
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,949
so you can shape it however you want and
you can make it however big you want

506
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
you can make it however big you want
 

507
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,550
you can make it however big you want
but i'll probably have at least

508
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
but i'll probably have at least
 

509
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,189
but i'll probably have at least
at least 20 to 30 dispensers so i need a

510
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
at least 20 to 30 dispensers so i need a
 

511
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,230
at least 20 to 30 dispensers so i need a
bit of space

512
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
bit of space
 

513
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,910
bit of space
the more space i have the easier this is

514
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
the more space i have the easier this is
 

515
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,310
the more space i have the easier this is
going to be to set up

516
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
going to be to set up
 

517
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,030
going to be to set up
and i can do fancier wiring too if i

518
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
and i can do fancier wiring too if i
 

519
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,670
and i can do fancier wiring too if i
have more space

520
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
have more space
 

521
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,749
have more space
so see how to do this

522
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759

 

523
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,110

so i need at least

524
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120

 

525
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,310

a one block space from the outside wall

526
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
a one block space from the outside wall
 

527
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,430
a one block space from the outside wall
to run wire on and then i'll have

528
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
to run wire on and then i'll have
 

529
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,710
to run wire on and then i'll have
dispensers

530
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720

 

531
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,870

here and here for sure

532
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880

 

533
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,710

and probably

534
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
and probably
 

535
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,030
and probably
here here here

536
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040

 

537
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,509

copy it on the other side

538
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
copy it on the other side
 

539
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,110
copy it on the other side
like that and maybe like this

540
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
like that and maybe like this
 

541
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,910
like that and maybe like this
see how this works

542
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920

 

543
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,310

so of course another issue is the water

544
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320

 

545
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,350

actually i'm going to put a pressure

546
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
actually i'm going to put a pressure
 

547
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,790
actually i'm going to put a pressure
plate down where the items are going to

548
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
plate down where the items are going to
 

549
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,910
plate down where the items are going to
get delivered

550
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920

 

551
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,829

right here so the water doesn't spill

552
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
right here so the water doesn't spill
 

553
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,990
right here so the water doesn't spill
everywhere

554
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000

 

555
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,990

but if i place water here they're going

556
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
but if i place water here they're going
 

557
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,110
but if i place water here they're going
to create

558
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
to create
 

559
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,069
to create
still water so

560
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079

 

561
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:55,350

can't have that

562
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360

 

563
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:04,150

so we need to change this a bit

564
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
so we need to change this a bit
 

565
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:12,150
so we need to change this a bit
i might have to make it four wide

566
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160

 

567
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,829

open still water get rid of this still

568
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
open still water get rid of this still
 

569
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,470
open still water get rid of this still
water

570
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480

 

571
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,750

dead zone no good

572
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760

 

573
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,870

um

574
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880

 

575
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,669

oh it's raining i'll play around with

576
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
oh it's raining i'll play around with
 

577
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,470
oh it's raining i'll play around with
this water stream a bit

578
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
this water stream a bit
 

579
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,310
this water stream a bit
i might make it four or five wide we'll

580
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
i might make it four or five wide we'll
 

581
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,710
i might make it four or five wide we'll
see

582
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720

 

583
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280

actually you know what i should do

584
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,290
actually you know what i should do
 

585
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,830
actually you know what i should do
[Music]

586
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840

 

587
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,830

oh

588
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
oh
 

589
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,909
oh
you know that a lot of people don't

590
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
you know that a lot of people don't
 

591
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,430
you know that a lot of people don't
really think that timers for anything

592
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
really think that timers for anything
 

593
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,150
really think that timers for anything
but it does

594
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
but it does
 

595
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,430
but it does
actually help that tune

596
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
actually help that tune
 

597
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,870
actually help that tune
because i know it's time to pick up my

598
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
because i know it's time to pick up my
 

599
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,990
because i know it's time to pick up my
items then

600
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
items then
 

601
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,430
items then
and the whole reason i'm building around

602
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
and the whole reason i'm building around
 

603
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,270
and the whole reason i'm building around
here today is just so i can get

604
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
here today is just so i can get
 

605
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,350
here today is just so i can get
gunpowder

606
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
gunpowder
 

607
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,029
gunpowder
so it's important i listen for that

608
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
so it's important i listen for that
 

609
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,830
so it's important i listen for that
timer

610
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840

 

611
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,590

um yeah so i'm going to work on this a

612
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
um yeah so i'm going to work on this a
 

613
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,029
um yeah so i'm going to work on this a
bit off camera

614
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
bit off camera
 

615
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,029
bit off camera
and then we'll try get some more done

616
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039

 

617
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,190

okay so it was pretty pretty easy to fix

618
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
okay so it was pretty pretty easy to fix
 

619
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,150
okay so it was pretty pretty easy to fix
i just

620
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
i just
 

621
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,470
i just
did the same thing on this side and now

622
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
did the same thing on this side and now
 

623
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,549
did the same thing on this side and now
we have a perfect

624
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
we have a perfect
 

625
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,150
we have a perfect
water stream that doesn't take up much

626
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
water stream that doesn't take up much
 

627
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,190
water stream that doesn't take up much
space

628
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200

 

629
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,990

no dead zones of course i'd take a

630
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
no dead zones of course i'd take a
 

631
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,909
no dead zones of course i'd take a
dispenser out but that's not really a

632
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
dispenser out but that's not really a
 

633
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,190
dispenser out but that's not really a
problem because

634
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
problem because
 

635
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,110
problem because
now i can use this space here

636
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120

 

637
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,789

so i don't really lose anything by doing

638
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
so i don't really lose anything by doing
 

639
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,230
so i don't really lose anything by doing
that

640
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240

 

641
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,830

and same with over here

642
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840

 

643
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,029

spencer okay

644
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
spencer okay
 

645
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,430
spencer okay
so how many do we have so far there's

646
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
so how many do we have so far there's
 

647
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,190
so how many do we have so far there's
going to be multiple layers probably

648
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
going to be multiple layers probably
 

649
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,710
going to be multiple layers probably
you got 5 11 down

650
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
you got 5 11 down
 

651
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,630
you got 5 11 down
so that's that's pretty good

652
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640

 

653
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,710

try to get at least 22 or something

654
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
try to get at least 22 or something
 

655
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,830
try to get at least 22 or something
so then they'll be wiring all the way

656
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
so then they'll be wiring all the way
 

657
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,150
so then they'll be wiring all the way
around

658
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160

 

659
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,830

um

660
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840

 

661
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,350

doesn't matter that i'm using dirt here

662
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
doesn't matter that i'm using dirt here
 

663
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,669
doesn't matter that i'm using dirt here
you won't be able to

664
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
you won't be able to
 

665
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:44,230
you won't be able to
see this dirt that is a problem

666
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240

 

667
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,350

put that there temporarily oh that's

668
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
put that there temporarily oh that's
 

669
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,830
put that there temporarily oh that's
going to be a problem too

670
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:50,840

 

671
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,750

darn

672
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
darn
 

673
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,870
darn
hmm

674
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880

 

675
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,909

might have to move that uh five o'clock

676
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
might have to move that uh five o'clock
 

677
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,149
might have to move that uh five o'clock
over here

678
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
over here
 

679
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,190
over here
oof like

680
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200

 

681
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,310

well anyway it goes around

682
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
well anyway it goes around
 

683
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,830
well anyway it goes around
uh i do have buttons good

684
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840

 

685
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,510

and

686
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
and
 

687
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,710
and
i might have a button here

688
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720

 

689
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,830

press it activates all the dispensers

690
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
press it activates all the dispensers
 

691
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,990
press it activates all the dispensers
assuming

692
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
assuming
 

693
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,909
assuming
i can connect this

694
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919

 

695
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,669

the reason why i haven't changed this to

696
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
the reason why i haven't changed this to
 

697
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,070
the reason why i haven't changed this to
repeaters yet like a repeater

698
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
repeaters yet like a repeater
 

699
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,430
repeaters yet like a repeater
five o'clock or whatever is because they

700
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
five o'clock or whatever is because they
 

701
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,110
five o'clock or whatever is because they
glitch out so that's why i still like

702
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
glitch out so that's why i still like
 

703
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,149
glitch out so that's why i still like
using the old school

704
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
using the old school
 

705
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:56,789
using the old school
types of clocks

706
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799

 

707
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,350

yeah i'll just do that for now

708
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360

 

709
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,190

okay so that's one layer

710
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200

 

711
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:18,870

now to build it up

712
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880

 

713
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,630

play sandstone oh yeah one thing

714
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
play sandstone oh yeah one thing
 

715
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,470
play sandstone oh yeah one thing
i was going to mention see this glass

716
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
i was going to mention see this glass
 

717
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,630
i was going to mention see this glass
block here

718
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
block here
 

719
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,669
block here
for all my longtime viewers that is the

720
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
for all my longtime viewers that is the
 

721
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,750
for all my longtime viewers that is the
skylight i placed back in

722
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
skylight i placed back in
 

723
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,390
skylight i placed back in
i think episode 1 or something this

724
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
i think episode 1 or something this
 

725
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,750
i think episode 1 or something this
little glass block

726
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
little glass block
 

727
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,029
little glass block
got covered up buried underground and i

728
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
got covered up buried underground and i
 

729
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,669
got covered up buried underground and i
came across it digging this out

730
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
came across it digging this out
 

731
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,830
came across it digging this out
and i destroyed it so that was placed

732
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
and i destroyed it so that was placed
 

733
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,590
and i destroyed it so that was placed
over six months ago

734
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
over six months ago
 

735
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,830
over six months ago
that glass block

736
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840

 

737
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,310

um

738
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320

 

739
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,350

so we can go up a layer here

740
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360

 

741
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,470

probably use sandstone here

742
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
probably use sandstone here
 

743
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,669
probably use sandstone here
run wiring up to a second level

744
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679

 

745
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,070

getting some lag

746
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080

 

747
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:24,830

and

748
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840

 

749
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,350

hmm

750
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
hmm
 

751
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,710
hmm
more like can't remember if you have

752
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
more like can't remember if you have
 

753
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,830
more like can't remember if you have
a dispenser a block on top

754
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840

 

755
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,630

oops

756
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
oops
 

757
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,630
oops
block on top and you power the block on

758
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
block on top and you power the block on
 

759
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,190
block on top and you power the block on
top does it activate the dispenser

760
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
top does it activate the dispenser
 

761
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,549
top does it activate the dispenser
i kind of think it does

762
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559

 

763
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:57,870

let's try it out

764
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:57,880

 

765
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,590

[Music]

766
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
[Music]
 

767
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:07,590
[Music]
oh you gotta go get my hand on skin

768
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600

 

769
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,430

yeah okay so i might use that method

770
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
yeah okay so i might use that method
 

771
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,430
yeah okay so i might use that method
for powering the second layer

772
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440

 

773
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,270

i went ahead and started working on the

774
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
i went ahead and started working on the
 

775
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,590
i went ahead and started working on the
second layer here just because i'm

776
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
second layer here just because i'm
 

777
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,230
second layer here just because i'm
going over time kind of with this

778
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
going over time kind of with this
 

779
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,510
going over time kind of with this
episode so i want to

780
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
episode so i want to
 

781
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,350
episode so i want to
finish this up soon uh

782
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
finish this up soon uh
 

783
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,990
finish this up soon uh
decided to make a few changes here i'm

784
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
decided to make a few changes here i'm
 

785
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,029
decided to make a few changes here i'm
gonna get rid of

786
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
gonna get rid of
 

787
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,470
gonna get rid of
these edge dispensers

788
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480

 

789
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,149

or corner dispensers i guess

790
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159

 

791
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,830

and i'm going to have water there

792
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840

 

793
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,110

so there'll be water here and here like

794
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
so there'll be water here and here like
 

795
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,230
so there'll be water here and here like
that

796
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
that
 

797
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,909
that
actually i should check the streams make

798
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
actually i should check the streams make
 

799
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,789
actually i should check the streams make
sure they are okay

800
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
sure they are okay
 

801
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,390
sure they are okay
yep so i'm gonna take those out

802
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
yep so i'm gonna take those out
 

803
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,430
yep so i'm gonna take those out
and i'm gonna have a piston

804
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
and i'm gonna have a piston
 

805
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,590
and i'm gonna have a piston
thing here to shut off the water so that

806
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
thing here to shut off the water so that
 

807
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,710
thing here to shut off the water so that
when i

808
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
when i
 

809
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,390
when i
have to restock these dispensers

810
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
have to restock these dispensers
 

811
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,149
have to restock these dispensers
i won't have water pushing me around in

812
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
i won't have water pushing me around in
 

813
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,390
i won't have water pushing me around in
here and i'll have a lever out here to

814
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
here and i'll have a lever out here to
 

815
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,029
here and i'll have a lever out here to
control

816
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
control
 

817
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,630
control
the water to turn it on and off

818
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
the water to turn it on and off
 

819
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,549
the water to turn it on and off
because with this quick kit thing i'll

820
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
because with this quick kit thing i'll
 

821
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,590
because with this quick kit thing i'll
basically be able to use it nine times

822
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
basically be able to use it nine times
 

823
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,789
basically be able to use it nine times
because like for individual items like

824
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
because like for individual items like
 

825
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,789
because like for individual items like
pork chops you can only put nine in so

826
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
pork chops you can only put nine in so
 

827
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,190
pork chops you can only put nine in so
once

828
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200

 

829
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,549

once those nine are out you need to

830
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
once those nine are out you need to
 

831
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,350
once those nine are out you need to
restock it

832
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,360
restock it
 

833
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,029
restock it
so that

834
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
so that
 

835
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,470
so that
i'll wire these later

836
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480

 

837
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,310

go down one further sticky piston there

838
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
go down one further sticky piston there
 

839
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,830
go down one further sticky piston there
and here

840
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
and here
 

841
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,390
and here
it'll be a block above um

842
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
it'll be a block above um
 

843
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,990
it'll be a block above um
it's pretty easy wiring these dispensers

844
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
it's pretty easy wiring these dispensers
 

845
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,230
it's pretty easy wiring these dispensers
gonna have to have water all or not

846
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
gonna have to have water all or not
 

847
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,549
gonna have to have water all or not
water redstone you're gonna have to have

848
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
water redstone you're gonna have to have
 

849
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,710
water redstone you're gonna have to have
redstone all along the top here

850
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720

 

851
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,070

you won't be able to see any of this

852
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
you won't be able to see any of this
 

853
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,950
you won't be able to see any of this
wiring when it's done

854
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
wiring when it's done
 

855
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,510
wiring when it's done
this redstone will activate the second

856
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
this redstone will activate the second
 

857
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,750
this redstone will activate the second
row here

858
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
row here
 

859
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,470
row here
these ones will get activated because

860
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
these ones will get activated because
 

861
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,310
these ones will get activated because
the redstone's pointing at them

862
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
the redstone's pointing at them
 

863
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,549
the redstone's pointing at them
so that's good and we'll also have

864
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
so that's good and we'll also have
 

865
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,590
so that's good and we'll also have
some more dispensers

866
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
some more dispensers
 

867
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,630
some more dispensers
along the top here

868
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
along the top here
 

869
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,430
along the top here
maybe one here it's going to be a

870
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
maybe one here it's going to be a
 

871
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,190
maybe one here it's going to be a
glowstone in the center

872
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
glowstone in the center
 

873
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,830
glowstone in the center
in the ceiling to light this up a bit

874
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,840

 

875
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,390

too

876
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
too
 

877
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,350
too
like that um

878
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360

 

879
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,390

you know i think i can actually

880
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
you know i think i can actually
 

881
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,830
you know i think i can actually
put some here too

882
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840

 

883
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,430

i think they'll shoot the item into the

884
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,440
i think they'll shoot the item into the
 

885
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,950
i think they'll shoot the item into the
block but they'll fall

886
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
block but they'll fall
 

887
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,430
block but they'll fall
the item will fall through the dispenser

888
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440

 

889
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,870

actually i should probably try that

890
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880

 

891
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,310

put some cobble in there

892
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320

 

893
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,870

yeah it fell through i don't know if you

894
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
yeah it fell through i don't know if you
 

895
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,950
yeah it fell through i don't know if you
saw that

896
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960

 

897
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,870

all right it's cool and maybe

898
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
all right it's cool and maybe
 

899
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:33,590
all right it's cool and maybe
have two more at the top here

900
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600

 

901
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,830

like this run the wire a little bit

902
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840
like this run the wire a little bit
 

903
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,630
like this run the wire a little bit
further

904
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
further
 

905
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,269
further
oops just going to place a lever here

906
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
oops just going to place a lever here
 

907
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,710
oops just going to place a lever here
make sure the current runs all the way

908
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
make sure the current runs all the way
 

909
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,070
make sure the current runs all the way
it does not that's a problem

910
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
it does not that's a problem
 

911
00:26:52,080 --> 00:27:02,470
it does not that's a problem
but nothing a repeater can't solve

912
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480

 

913
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,990

i may put a repeater here i think that

914
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,000
i may put a repeater here i think that
 

915
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,310
i may put a repeater here i think that
would be safe

916
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320

 

917
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,430

right okay so be one more dispenser

918
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
right okay so be one more dispenser
 

919
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,470
right okay so be one more dispenser
here and this will be covered

920
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480

 

921
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,190

somehow put these here for now

922
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,200

 

923
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,470

something like this will be glowstone

924
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
something like this will be glowstone
 

925
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,510
something like this will be glowstone
above here for light

926
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520

 

927
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,190

and we can restock every single one of

928
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
and we can restock every single one of
 

929
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,590
and we can restock every single one of
these

930
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:41,600
these
 

931
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,669
these
because there are none are hidden behind

932
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
because there are none are hidden behind
 

933
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,470
because there are none are hidden behind
blocks or anything

934
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
blocks or anything
 

935
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,990
blocks or anything
and we'll have pistons

936
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
and we'll have pistons
 

937
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,430
and we'll have pistons
just mark them here and here

938
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
just mark them here and here
 

939
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,590
just mark them here and here
turn the water on and off

940
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600

 

941
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,630

okay so the idea is in some of these

942
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
okay so the idea is in some of these
 

943
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,269
okay so the idea is in some of these
dispensers i'll have

944
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:03,279

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,669
well probably probably three of these
will be

950
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
will be
 

951
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,269
will be
dedicated to the cooked pork chops

952
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
dedicated to the cooked pork chops

and there'll probably be a chest out

964
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
and there'll probably be a chest out
 

965
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,830
and there'll probably be a chest out
here too because i won't be able to

966
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
here too because i won't be able to
 

967

here too because i won't be able to
dispense

968

will only dispense one at a time at this
 

981
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,750
will only dispense one at a time at this
current setup or i may change the wiring

982
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
current setup or i may change the wiring
 

983
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,789
current setup or i may change the wiring
so that

984
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,799
so that
 

985
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,149
so that
maybe the top ones will dispense

986
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
maybe the top ones will dispense
 

987
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,870
maybe the top ones will dispense
like 4 8 or 16 of a certain block type
