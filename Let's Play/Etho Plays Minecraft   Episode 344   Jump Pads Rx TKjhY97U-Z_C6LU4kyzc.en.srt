i i've been testing this out so we got a

122
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
i i've been testing this out so we got a
 

123
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,430
i i've been testing this out so we got a
boat launcher here

124
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
boat launcher here
 

125
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,350
boat launcher here
uh these slime blocks if you're

126
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
uh these slime blocks if you're
 

127
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,670
uh these slime blocks if you're
wondering how high they launch you

128
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
wondering how high they launch you
 

129
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,949
wondering how high they launch you
if it's just you they'll launch you five

130
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
if it's just you they'll launch you five
 

131
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,670
if it's just you they'll launch you five
and seven

132
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
and seven
 

133
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,470
and seven
eighths of a block so that would be one

134
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
eighths of a block so that would be one
 

135
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,869
eighths of a block so that would be one
two

136
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
two
 

137
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,990
two
three four five you could get on top of

138
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
three four five you could get on top of
 

139
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,110
three four five you could get on top of
this block but you're just a little bit

140
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
this block but you're just a little bit
 

141
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,110
this block but you're just a little bit
short of six blocks it's five and seven

142
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
short of six blocks it's five and seven
 

143
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,070
short of six blocks it's five and seven
eighths

144
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
eighths
 

145
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,750
eighths
uh different entities though get

146
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
uh different entities though get
 

147
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,750
uh different entities though get
launched different amounts and boats

148
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
launched different amounts and boats
 

149
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,869
launched different amounts and boats
they get launched uh like

150
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
they get launched uh like
 

151
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,550
they get launched uh like
eight blocks like we could have this

152
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
eight blocks like we could have this
 

153
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,550
eight blocks like we could have this
water or this pad

154
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
water or this pad
 

155
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,589
water or this pad
two blocks lower i think anyway let's

156
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
two blocks lower i think anyway let's
 

157
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:03,990
two blocks lower i think anyway let's
let's go

158
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
let's go
 

159
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,670
let's go
for a ride

160
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680

 

161
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,390

so you see we got launched maybe a block

162
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
so you see we got launched maybe a block
 

163
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,990
so you see we got launched maybe a block
above the water here oh

164
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
above the water here oh
 

165
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,630
above the water here oh
snap we'll live we're good that wasn't

166

snap we'll live we're good that wasn't
 

167
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,390
snap we'll live we're good that wasn't
that far

168
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
that far
 

169
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,149
that far
that was pretty far is it gonna fall

170
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159

 

171
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,990

come on get off the path

172
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000

 

173
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,190

no it's not gonna fall stupid boat

174
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
no it's not gonna fall stupid boat
 

175
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,949
no it's not gonna fall stupid boat
bumper boats all right let's try this

176
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
bumper boats all right let's try this
 

177
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,910
bumper boats all right let's try this
out again

178
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
out again
 

179
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,470
out again
we'll have to uh knock this boat down so

180
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
we'll have to uh knock this boat down so
 

181
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,670
we'll have to uh knock this boat down so
let's go slow

182
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
let's go slow
 

183
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,670
let's go slow
very slow

184
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680

 

185
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,509

stupid boat whoa all right we got rid of

186
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
stupid boat whoa all right we got rid of
 

187
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:45,750
stupid boat whoa all right we got rid of
it

188
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
it
 

189
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,149
it
so this is our our water path it's it's

190
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
so this is our our water path it's it's
 

191
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,750
so this is our our water path it's it's
pretty nice

192
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
pretty nice
 

193
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,470
pretty nice
i really like how you can get different

194
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
i really like how you can get different
 

195
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,509
i really like how you can get different
angles

196
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
angles
 

197
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,309
angles
uh of the area as you cross these

198
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
uh of the area as you cross these
 

199
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,309
uh of the area as you cross these
bridges

200
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
bridges
 

201
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,070
bridges
turning around is a little tricky but

202
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
turning around is a little tricky but
 

203
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,270
turning around is a little tricky but
it's it's possible too

204
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280

 

205
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,990

all right so i think we'll put a tunnel

206
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
all right so i think we'll put a tunnel
 

207
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,750
all right so i think we'll put a tunnel
like a hole through the mountain over

208
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
like a hole through the mountain over
 

209
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,149
like a hole through the mountain over
there and then from that i'm not exactly

210
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
there and then from that i'm not exactly
 

211
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,750
there and then from that i'm not exactly
sure what we'll do

212
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
sure what we'll do
 

213
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,990
sure what we'll do
but i kind of like this you can drive it

214
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
but i kind of like this you can drive it
 

215
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,150
but i kind of like this you can drive it
off any anywhere you want to so as we

216
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
off any anywhere you want to so as we
 

217
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,789
off any anywhere you want to so as we
expand

218
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
expand
 

219
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,509
expand
our transportation network here we might

220
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
our transportation network here we might
 

221
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,270
our transportation network here we might
be able to like

222
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
be able to like
 

223
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,270
be able to like
fall down into a river below and have it

224
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
fall down into a river below and have it
 

225
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,590
fall down into a river below and have it
take us somewhere i don't know

226
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
take us somewhere i don't know
 

227
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,270
take us somewhere i don't know
with boats so there's so many

228
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
with boats so there's so many
 

229
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,030
with boats so there's so many
possibilities it's amazing

230
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040

 

231
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,670

there's like just one random floating

232
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
there's like just one random floating
 

233
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,270
there's like just one random floating
dirt block there i didn't place that

234
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
dirt block there i didn't place that
 

235
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,870
dirt block there i didn't place that
that was just there naturally

236
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
that was just there naturally
 

237
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,469
that was just there naturally
but it's driving me crazy we gotta get

238
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
but it's driving me crazy we gotta get
 

239
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,469
but it's driving me crazy we gotta get
rid of that thing there's like a few

240
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
rid of that thing there's like a few
 

241
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,390
rid of that thing there's like a few
other little pieces

242
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
other little pieces
 

243
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,030
other little pieces
probably should go too but anyway when i

244
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
probably should go too but anyway when i
 

245
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,670
probably should go too but anyway when i
fall down

246
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
fall down
 

247
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,590
fall down
this is where i usually end up in this

248
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
this is where i usually end up in this
 

249
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,430
this is where i usually end up in this
area here right

250
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
area here right
 

251
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,950
area here right
and as you can see it is really really

252
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
and as you can see it is really really
 

253
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,950
and as you can see it is really really
really tough to get back up because not

254
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
really tough to get back up because not
 

255
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,590
really tough to get back up because not
only is it super high up

256
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
only is it super high up
 

257
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,550
only is it super high up
but the way the clip is shaped it like

258
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
but the way the clip is shaped it like
 

259
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,990
but the way the clip is shaped it like
comes out this way so

260
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
comes out this way so
 

261
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,310
comes out this way so
it it blocks any ender pearls i do it's

262
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
it it blocks any ender pearls i do it's
 

263
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,510
it it blocks any ender pearls i do it's
not like i can just

264
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
not like i can just
 

265
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,310
not like i can just
uh mountain goat my way up it completely

266
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
uh mountain goat my way up it completely
 

267
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,790
uh mountain goat my way up it completely
blocks it so it's really tough

268
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
blocks it so it's really tough
 

269
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,110
blocks it so it's really tough
uh so we're going to focus on maybe some

270
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
uh so we're going to focus on maybe some
 

271
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,110
uh so we're going to focus on maybe some
ground

272
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
ground
 

273
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,830
ground
transportation i'm not sure if i'll use

274
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
transportation i'm not sure if i'll use
 

275
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,469
transportation i'm not sure if i'll use
it much but

276
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
it much but
 

277
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,550
it much but
i would like to have it regardless so

278
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
i would like to have it regardless so
 

279
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,790
i would like to have it regardless so
yeah let's just take a step back again

280
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
yeah let's just take a step back again
 

281
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,070
yeah let's just take a step back again
it's really tough to

282
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
it's really tough to
 

283
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,430
it's really tough to
plan paths out too but i noticed this

284
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
plan paths out too but i noticed this
 

285
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,469
plan paths out too but i noticed this
area here it

286
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
area here it
 

287
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,029
area here it
kind of like works its way up the

288
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
kind of like works its way up the
 

289
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,350
kind of like works its way up the
mountain up to like

290
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
mountain up to like
 

291
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,110
mountain up to like
there anyway and then we can probably

292
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
there anyway and then we can probably
 

293
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,870
there anyway and then we can probably
get over there and then up higher

294
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
get over there and then up higher
 

295
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,870
get over there and then up higher
and then make our way back there um

296
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
and then make our way back there um
 

297
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,230
and then make our way back there um
lots of mobs around here so the way we

298
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
lots of mobs around here so the way we
 

299
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,189
lots of mobs around here so the way we
should do this

300
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
should do this
 

301
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,150
should do this
i think i'm going to kind of straighten

302
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
i think i'm going to kind of straighten
 

303
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,270
i think i'm going to kind of straighten
this out a bit

304
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
this out a bit
 

305
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,710
this out a bit
yeah how high is this this is five

306
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
yeah how high is this this is five
 

307
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,150
yeah how high is this this is five
blocks

308
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160

 

309
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,110

i may regret this later i'm not sure i

310
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
i may regret this later i'm not sure i
 

311
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,629
i may regret this later i'm not sure i
want to be really careful whenever i do

312
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
want to be really careful whenever i do
 

313
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,070
want to be really careful whenever i do
terraforming

314
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
terraforming
 

315
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,790
terraforming
um but i'll have like a a proper wall

316
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
um but i'll have like a a proper wall
 

317
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,510
um but i'll have like a a proper wall
here not just

318
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
here not just
 

319
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,189
here not just
dirt wall like this all right

320
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
dirt wall like this all right
 

321
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,150
dirt wall like this all right
and then we're gonna have these uh jump

322
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
and then we're gonna have these uh jump
 

323
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,749
and then we're gonna have these uh jump
pads all over the place too is what i

324
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
pads all over the place too is what i
 

325
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,790
pads all over the place too is what i
want

326
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
want
 

327
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,309
want
so let's see

328
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
so let's see
 

329
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,990
so let's see
we get launched five blocks up so we can

330
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
we get launched five blocks up so we can
 

331
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,309
we get launched five blocks up so we can
do that and i think the limit is

332
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
do that and i think the limit is
 

333
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,909
do that and i think the limit is
was it two blocks away from a wall or

334
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
was it two blocks away from a wall or
 

335
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,230
was it two blocks away from a wall or
three blocks can't quite remember

336
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
three blocks can't quite remember
 

337
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,670
three blocks can't quite remember
but over here should work out okay

338
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
but over here should work out okay
 

339
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,029
but over here should work out okay
so we'll put down sticky piston

340
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
so we'll put down sticky piston
 

341
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,070
so we'll put down sticky piston
slime block and then there's only a few

342
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
slime block and then there's only a few
 

343
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,230
slime block and then there's only a few
blocks in the game that won't get moved

344
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
blocks in the game that won't get moved
 

345
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,590
blocks in the game that won't get moved
by the sticky piston uh you can do like

346
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
by the sticky piston uh you can do like
 

347
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,749
by the sticky piston uh you can do like
watermelon you can use pumpkins you can

348
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
watermelon you can use pumpkins you can
 

349
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,830
watermelon you can use pumpkins you can
use obsidian

350
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
use obsidian
 

351
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,909

leaves i think it's a choice between
 

353
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,790
leaves i think it's a choice between
leaves and

354
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
leaves and
 

355
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,790

those all around
and let's see let me do some pressure

364
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
and let's see let me do some pressure
 

365
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,870
and let's see let me do some pressure
plates i like the furnaces because

366
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
plates i like the furnaces because
 

367
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,629
plates i like the furnaces because
you have to use pressure plates or i

368
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
you have to use pressure plates or i
 

369
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,990
you have to use pressure plates or i
like to use pressure plates you don't

370
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
like to use pressure plates you don't
 

371
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,830
like to use pressure plates you don't
have to

372
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
have to
 

373
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,430

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
do is put a piece of redstone underneath
 

377
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,830
do is put a piece of redstone underneath
like there put another one on this side

378

00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759

 

385
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,070

uh through a hill somewhere and then go
 

453
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,949
uh through a hill somewhere and then go
on from there but it just kept going and

out
 

461
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,630
out
but it's like 40 or 50 blocks up yet so

462
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
but it's like 40 or 50 blocks up yet so
 

463

we got like 10 jump pads now let's see

472
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
we got like 10 jump pads now let's see
 

473
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,990
we got like 10 jump pads now let's see
if we can run the course it goes up

474
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
if we can run the course it goes up
 

475
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,350
if we can run the course it goes up
to about over there i think is where it

476
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
to about over there i think is where it
 

477
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,310
to about over there i think is where it
ends

478
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
ends
 

479
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,949
ends
right now we'll extend it more but yeah

try to make it look nice too

504
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
try to make it look nice too
 

505
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,070
try to make it look nice too
i'm just trying to get the functionality

506
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
i'm just trying to get the functionality
 

507
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,310
i'm just trying to get the functionality
all figured out first

508
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
all figured out first
 

509
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,829
all figured out first
and then if you want to go back down too

510
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
and then if you want to go back down too
 

511
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,350
and then if you want to go back down too
by the way

512
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
by the way
 

513
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:03,190
by the way
see if i if i can do this

514
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200

 

515
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,990

you can like run off i think oh no not

516
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
you can like run off i think oh no not
 

517
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,030
you can like run off i think oh no not
on that one

518
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
on that one
 

519
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,150
on that one
only on some of them yeah oh no

520
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
only on some of them yeah oh no
 

521
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,910
only on some of them yeah oh no
it didn't uh huh

522
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
it didn't uh huh
 

523
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,990
it didn't uh huh
when i ran down before i i hit the slime

524
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
when i ran down before i i hit the slime
 

525
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,949
when i ran down before i i hit the slime
block every time

526
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
block every time
 

527
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,870
block every time
this time i didn't

528
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880

 

529
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,509

okay so we're back up here again this is

530
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
okay so we're back up here again this is
 

531
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,190
okay so we're back up here again this is
like where we left off with our jump

532
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
like where we left off with our jump
 

533
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,069
like where we left off with our jump
pads

534
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
pads
 

535
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,790
pads
and i want to show you this so we have

536
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
and i want to show you this so we have
 

537
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,310
and i want to show you this so we have
this little

538
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
this little
 

539
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,910
this little
it's got to be maybe 10 blocks gap

540
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
it's got to be maybe 10 blocks gap
 

541
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,829
it's got to be maybe 10 blocks gap
we could put a bridge here or we could

542
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
we could put a bridge here or we could
 

543
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,389
we could put a bridge here or we could
try to jump it with something

544
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
try to jump it with something
 

545
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,230
try to jump it with something
i'm not sure what we'll do let me know

546
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
i'm not sure what we'll do let me know
 

547
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,230
i'm not sure what we'll do let me know
what you think

548
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
what you think
 

549
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,910
what you think
then we gotta try to figure out how to

550
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
then we gotta try to figure out how to
 

551
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,310
then we gotta try to figure out how to
get

552
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
get
 

553
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,590
get
up there how do we get back uh

554
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
up there how do we get back uh
 

555
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,670
up there how do we get back uh
up to the top of like where the portal

556
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
up to the top of like where the portal
 

557
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,430
up to the top of like where the portal
is is what we're trying to do here so

558
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
is is what we're trying to do here so
 

559
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,190
is is what we're trying to do here so
what path should we take

560
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
what path should we take
 

561
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,350
what path should we take
we could try go through that tunnel

562
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
we could try go through that tunnel
 

563
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,750
we could try go through that tunnel
there or

564
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
there or
 

565
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,790
there or
i wonder i i like uh hollowed this out

566
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
i wonder i i like uh hollowed this out
 

567
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,430
i wonder i i like uh hollowed this out
myself over here

568
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
myself over here
 

569
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,509
myself over here
um maybe even i wonder

570
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519

 

571
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,710

we could try to get like around and then

572
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
we could try to get like around and then
 

573
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,990
we could try to get like around and then
up here and then up there and i think

574
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
up here and then up there and i think
 

575
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,590
up here and then up there and i think
that would be close to the height we

576
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
that would be close to the height we
 

577
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,030
that would be close to the height we
need

578
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
need
 

579
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,350
need
uh or we could go across here i don't

580
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
uh or we could go across here i don't
 

581
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,190
uh or we could go across here i don't
know if there's any way to get back

582
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
know if there's any way to get back
 

583
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,550
know if there's any way to get back
if we go higher let's go check this out

584
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
if we go higher let's go check this out
 

585
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,750
if we go higher let's go check this out
oh oh man

586
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
oh oh man
 

587
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,949
oh oh man
stinking endermites

588
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959

 

589
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,430

there's not a lot of land here actually

590
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
there's not a lot of land here actually
 

591
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,269
there's not a lot of land here actually
oh man

592
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
oh man
 

593
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,069
oh man
i feel like we're on a tiny little three

594
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
i feel like we're on a tiny little three
 

595
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,269
i feel like we're on a tiny little three
wide

596
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
wide
 

597
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,870
wide
cliff thing yeah that's what we're

598
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
cliff thing yeah that's what we're
 

599
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,269
cliff thing yeah that's what we're
that's exactly what we're on here

600
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
that's exactly what we're on here
 

601
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,030
that's exactly what we're on here
oh man okay uh then it goes up to here

602
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
oh man okay uh then it goes up to here
 

603
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,870
oh man okay uh then it goes up to here
let's go up a little more

604
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
let's go up a little more
 

605
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,710
let's go up a little more
i wish we could see the portal where is

606
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
i wish we could see the portal where is
 

607
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,829
i wish we could see the portal where is
our portal

608
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839

 

609
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,430

um all right

610
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
um all right
 

611
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,069
um all right
let's take a look again so that's that's

612
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
let's take a look again so that's that's
 

613
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,389
let's take a look again so that's that's
at the bridge area there

614
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
at the bridge area there
 

615
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,509
at the bridge area there
oh there's the water road so that means

616
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
oh there's the water road so that means
 

617
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,350
oh there's the water road so that means
the portal is probably at that height so

618
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
the portal is probably at that height so
 

619
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,310
the portal is probably at that height so
that is actually

620
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
that is actually
 

621
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,790
that is actually
pretty close isn't it if we were to make

622
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
pretty close isn't it if we were to make
 

623
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,990
pretty close isn't it if we were to make
a tunnel through the mountain

624
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
a tunnel through the mountain
 

625
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,910
a tunnel through the mountain
there i bet it would go to the portal

626
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
there i bet it would go to the portal
 

627
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,269
there i bet it would go to the portal
that might work

628
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279

 

629
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,790

if we go let's see what kind of view we

630
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
if we go let's see what kind of view we
 

631
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,069
if we go let's see what kind of view we
got from the top here i don't know if

632
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
got from the top here i don't know if
 

633
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,150
got from the top here i don't know if
we're like uh

634
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
we're like uh
 

635
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,389
we're like uh
gonna stay on just one island here we

636
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
gonna stay on just one island here we
 

637
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,949
gonna stay on just one island here we
might go like build a little bit here a

638
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
might go like build a little bit here a
 

639
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,870
might go like build a little bit here a
little bit over there

640
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
little bit over there
 

641
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,790
little bit over there
kind of go go all over here because

642
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
kind of go go all over here because
 

643
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,629
kind of go go all over here because
there's so many good places to build

644
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
there's so many good places to build
 

645
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,030
there's so many good places to build
actually

646
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
actually
 

647
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,470
actually
let's just do one more enterprise oh

648
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
let's just do one more enterprise oh
 

649
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,430
let's just do one more enterprise oh
that might have been an overshot

650
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
that might have been an overshot
 

651
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,030
that might have been an overshot
it's not landing i'm gonna throw one

652
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
it's not landing i'm gonna throw one
 

653
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,509
it's not landing i'm gonna throw one
straight up because i have a feeling

654
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
straight up because i have a feeling
 

655
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,910
straight up because i have a feeling
yeah right down to the bottom

656
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920

 

657
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,350

oh man

658
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360

 

659
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,629

okay yeah i think i see what we should

660
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
okay yeah i think i see what we should
 

661
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,069
okay yeah i think i see what we should
do

662
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079

 

663
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,389

okay very good we actually have a way to

664
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
okay very good we actually have a way to
 

665
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,470
okay very good we actually have a way to
get back up here now if we

666
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
get back up here now if we
 

667
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,550
get back up here now if we
if we fall down like and we have no

668
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
if we fall down like and we have no
 

669
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,310
if we fall down like and we have no
ender pearls or anything

670
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
ender pearls or anything
 

671
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,030
ender pearls or anything
we can make it all the way back up uh so

672
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
we can make it all the way back up uh so
 

673
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,870
we can make it all the way back up uh so
we're gonna go give it a try let's uh

674
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
we're gonna go give it a try let's uh
 

675
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,949
we're gonna go give it a try let's uh
let's head on down

676
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
let's head on down
 

677
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,509
let's head on down
uh this thing i'm not sure if we're

678
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
uh this thing i'm not sure if we're
 

679
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,509
uh this thing i'm not sure if we're
keeping this or not yet

680
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
keeping this or not yet
 

681
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,190
keeping this or not yet
i tried it today and i actually had

682
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
i tried it today and i actually had
 

683
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,550
i tried it today and i actually had
trouble uh landing this jump again

684
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
trouble uh landing this jump again
 

685
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,069
trouble uh landing this jump again
yeah i don't know why i can't do it

686
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
yeah i don't know why i can't do it
 

687
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,629
yeah i don't know why i can't do it
today

688
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639

 

689
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,829

oh hey we got our vote back

690
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
oh hey we got our vote back
 

691
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,430
oh hey we got our vote back
oops totally loaded on things

692
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
oops totally loaded on things
 

693
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,949
oops totally loaded on things
okay and these

694
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
okay and these
 

695
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,470
okay and these
these water streams they all meet

696
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
these water streams they all meet
 

697
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,310
these water streams they all meet
together in this one spot

698
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
together in this one spot
 

699
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,350
together in this one spot
one two three four of them

700
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
one two three four of them
 

701
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,670
one two three four of them
uh where is it it's just up here isn't

702
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
uh where is it it's just up here isn't
 

703
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,389
uh where is it it's just up here isn't
it

704
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
it
 

705
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,230
it
yeah okay so we're going to try to do

706
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
yeah okay so we're going to try to do
 

707
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,389
yeah okay so we're going to try to do
this in one sprint without breaking it

708
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
this in one sprint without breaking it
 

709
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,670
this in one sprint without breaking it
if we can

710
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
if we can
 

711
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,110
if we can
so here we go

712
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120

 

713
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,590

man i love this it's so cool it's kind

714
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
man i love this it's so cool it's kind
 

715
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,790
man i love this it's so cool it's kind
of like a

716
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
of like a
 

717
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,590
of like a
slime blocked elevator but not quite

718
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600

 

719
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,030

a little more control to it alright this

720
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
a little more control to it alright this
 

721
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,350
a little more control to it alright this
is the new expansion

722
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360

 

723
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,150

oh broke the sprint i decided to do

724
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
oh broke the sprint i decided to do
 

725
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,590
oh broke the sprint i decided to do
stairs just for the end of it

726
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
stairs just for the end of it
 

727
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,350
stairs just for the end of it
i don't know i think it's fine

728
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
i don't know i think it's fine
 

729
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,790
i don't know i think it's fine
because i may build something up here

730
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
because i may build something up here
 

731
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,629
because i may build something up here
and i i want something a little bit

732
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
and i i want something a little bit
 

733
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,150
and i i want something a little bit
slower

734
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
slower
 

735
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,350
slower
comes out to here and then

736
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
comes out to here and then
 

737
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,990
comes out to here and then
uh might need another one or two over

738
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
uh might need another one or two over
 

739
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,790
uh might need another one or two over
here but it

740
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
here but it
 

741
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,910
here but it
the portal is just right over there

742
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
the portal is just right over there
 

743
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,350
the portal is just right over there
so that is pretty cool

744
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360

 

745
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,350

okay everyone so that's probably all we

746
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
okay everyone so that's probably all we
 

747
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,230
okay everyone so that's probably all we
will do at our new base for today

748
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
will do at our new base for today
 

749
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,470
will do at our new base for today
uh but we're gonna take a little time

750
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
uh but we're gonna take a little time
 

751
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,629
uh but we're gonna take a little time
here to experiment with some ideas for

752
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
here to experiment with some ideas for
 

753
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,870
here to experiment with some ideas for
future projects at our new base

754
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
future projects at our new base
 

755
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,910
future projects at our new base
uh we need to we mainly needed a big

756
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
uh we need to we mainly needed a big
 

757
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,790
uh we need to we mainly needed a big
flat spot so this is perfect

758
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
flat spot so this is perfect
 

759
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,069
flat spot so this is perfect
so all all our farms and all our stuff

760
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
so all all our farms and all our stuff
 

761
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,310
so all all our farms and all our stuff
at the new base i'm going to make a rule

762
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
at the new base i'm going to make a rule
 

763
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,389
at the new base i'm going to make a rule
that we have to use slime blocks

764
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
that we have to use slime blocks
 

765
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,269
that we have to use slime blocks
like for the farms so

766
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279

 

767
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,790

each farm is probably going to have

768
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
each farm is probably going to have
 

769
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,710
each farm is probably going to have
something unique to it but

770
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
something unique to it but
 

771
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,790
something unique to it but
if we can't think of any way to use

772
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
if we can't think of any way to use
 

773
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,670
if we can't think of any way to use
slime blocks at the very least

774
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
slime blocks at the very least
 

775
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,030
slime blocks at the very least
with the farms we can use them to

776
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
with the farms we can use them to
 

777
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,430
with the farms we can use them to
throw items around so let's try to set

778
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
throw items around so let's try to set
 

779
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,430
throw items around so let's try to set
that up

780
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
that up
 

781
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,230
that up
let's see let's get some dispensers

782
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
let's see let's get some dispensers
 

783
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,430
let's see let's get some dispensers
okay so if if there's items they'll be

784
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
okay so if if there's items they'll be
 

785
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,910
okay so if if there's items they'll be
into

786
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
into
 

787
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,310
into
the dispenser here and we'll set this up

788
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
the dispenser here and we'll set this up
 

789
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,829
the dispenser here and we'll set this up
so that the slime block

790
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
so that the slime block
 

791
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,350
so that the slime block
is one below i think like that

792
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
is one below i think like that
 

793
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,350
is one below i think like that
and it'll it'll go up and shoot the item

794
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
and it'll it'll go up and shoot the item
 

795
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,470
and it'll it'll go up and shoot the item
upwards

796
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
upwards
 

797
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,790
upwards
uh we'll have to frame this in

798
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
uh we'll have to frame this in
 

799
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,069
uh we'll have to frame this in
with some blocks

800
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079

 

801
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,069

okay so that'll go up and then we need

802
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
okay so that'll go up and then we need
 

803
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,790
okay so that'll go up and then we need
another sticky piston to shoot them

804
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
another sticky piston to shoot them
 

805
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,310
another sticky piston to shoot them
sideways

806
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320

 

807
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,430

like that no not like that move it one

808
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
like that no not like that move it one
 

809
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,430
like that no not like that move it one
forward

810
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
forward
 

811
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,870
forward
we'll try this we'll see if that works

812
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
we'll try this we'll see if that works
 

813
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,990
we'll try this we'll see if that works
yeah let's get rid of this one

814
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
yeah let's get rid of this one
 

815
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,389
yeah let's get rid of this one
okay so

816
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
okay so
 

817
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,550
okay so
probably need a one tick delay between

818
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
probably need a one tick delay between
 

819
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,790
probably need a one tick delay between
the two

820
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
the two
 

821
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,030
the two
um maybe we will do it like

822
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040

 

823
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,910

like oh wow my depth perception did you

824
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
like oh wow my depth perception did you
 

825
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,829
like oh wow my depth perception did you
see that that totally looked right to me

826
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
see that that totally looked right to me
 

827
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,629
see that that totally looked right to me
too

828
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
too
 

829
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,310
too
and it was way off um

830
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320

 

831
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,829

i'm gonna do this off camera how about

832
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
i'm gonna do this off camera how about
 

833
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,030
i'm gonna do this off camera how about
that we'll try it out

834
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040

 

835
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,110

yeah that was a good call because this

836
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
yeah that was a good call because this
 

837
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,949
yeah that was a good call because this
took a little while to work out after

838
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
took a little while to work out after
 

839
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,350
took a little while to work out after
all

840
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
all
 

841
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,909
all
uh there's it became more than i

842
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
uh there's it became more than i
 

843
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,350
uh there's it became more than i
expected

844
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
expected
 

845
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,110
expected
let's let's just put it at that but i'm

846
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
let's let's just put it at that but i'm
 

847
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,470
let's let's just put it at that but i'm
pretty happy with it

848
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
pretty happy with it
 

849
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,789
pretty happy with it
this will be our staple design for

850
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
this will be our staple design for
 

851
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,390
this will be our staple design for
launching items i think

852
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
launching items i think
 

853
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,350
launching items i think
for all time maybe i don't know we'll

854
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
for all time maybe i don't know we'll
 

855
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,909
for all time maybe i don't know we'll
see i don't know if we could improve it

856
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919

 

857
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,750

i don't know it might be possible to

858
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
i don't know it might be possible to
 

859
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,270
i don't know it might be possible to
lower this i never did try that

860
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
lower this i never did try that
 

861
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,630
lower this i never did try that
actually but anyway so

862
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
actually but anyway so
 

863
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,669
actually but anyway so
if this was in the ground it would

864
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
if this was in the ground it would
 

865
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:31,990
if this was in the ground it would
actually

866
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
actually
 

867
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,110
actually
be pretty pretty easy to hide it

868
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
be pretty pretty easy to hide it
 

869
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,669
be pretty pretty easy to hide it
all you would really see especially if

870
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
all you would really see especially if
 

871
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,950
all you would really see especially if
you

872
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
you
 

873
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,510
you
did this actually you can't put a block

874
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
did this actually you can't put a block
 

875
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,990
did this actually you can't put a block
there

876
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
there
 

877
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,029
there
unless it's a special type that doesn't

878
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
unless it's a special type that doesn't
 

879
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,870
unless it's a special type that doesn't
stick to everything these things they

880
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
stick to everything these things they
 

881
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,310
stick to everything these things they
like to stick to everything they're

882
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
like to stick to everything they're
 

883
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,510
like to stick to everything they're
really

884
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
really
 

885
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,590
really
they're really sticky you gotta be

886
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
they're really sticky you gotta be
 

887
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,430
they're really sticky you gotta be
really careful with them

888
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
really careful with them
 

889
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,390
really careful with them
uh anyway let's try it out so the idea

890
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
uh anyway let's try it out so the idea
 

891
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,350
uh anyway let's try it out so the idea
is

892
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
is
 

893
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,549
is
any item you oh did i not leave a space

894
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
any item you oh did i not leave a space
 

895
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,990
any item you oh did i not leave a space
for a hopper i guess i could put a

896
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
for a hopper i guess i could put a
 

897
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,669
for a hopper i guess i could put a
hopper here

898
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
hopper here
 

899
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,430
hopper here
to go into the dispenser yeah that's

900
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
to go into the dispenser yeah that's
 

901
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,870
to go into the dispenser yeah that's
fine never mind

902
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
fine never mind
 

903
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,510
fine never mind
uh the idea is you put an item into the

904
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
uh the idea is you put an item into the
 

905
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,350
uh the idea is you put an item into the
dispenser

906
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
dispenser
 

907
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,070
dispenser
and it shoots it out see if we did this

908
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
and it shoots it out see if we did this
 

909
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,630
and it shoots it out see if we did this
right

910
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640

 

911
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,110

where are they going or are they going

912
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
where are they going or are they going
 

913
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,710
where are they going or are they going
in the pool

914
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
in the pool
 

915
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,669
in the pool
that is terrible but yeah it does it one

916
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
that is terrible but yeah it does it one
 

917
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,470
that is terrible but yeah it does it one
by one

918
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480

 

919
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,070

it looks like they all go to the same

920
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
it looks like they all go to the same
 

921
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,510
it looks like they all go to the same
spot doesn't it

922
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
spot doesn't it
 

923
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,630
spot doesn't it
i thought it would be more random that's

924
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
i thought it would be more random that's
 

925
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,430
i thought it would be more random that's
good that they

926
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
good that they
 

927
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,950
good that they
that it's not random actually

928
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
that it's not random actually
 

929
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,110
that it's not random actually
oh that looks cool so items they get

930
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
oh that looks cool so items they get
 

931
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,150
oh that looks cool so items they get
launched way

932
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
launched way
 

933
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,470
launched way
farther than like players and and boats

934
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
farther than like players and and boats
 

935
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,510
farther than like players and and boats
and stuff

936
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520

 

937
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,029

let's see if the base of that is two

938
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
let's see if the base of that is two
 

939
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,549
let's see if the base of that is two
blocks up i kind of want to count how

940
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
blocks up i kind of want to count how
 

941
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,590
blocks up i kind of want to count how
far it actually

942
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
far it actually
 

943
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,669
far it actually
throws them

944
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679

 

945
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,950

if we if we made them land on ice they

946
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
if we if we made them land on ice they
 

947
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,789
if we if we made them land on ice they
would probably slide too which would be

948
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
would probably slide too which would be
 

949
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,150
would probably slide too which would be
cool

950
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
cool
 

951
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,789
cool
we got to get some of that that special

952
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
we got to get some of that that special
 

953
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,830
we got to get some of that that special
ice

954
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
ice
 

955
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,909
ice
uh that you can place pressure plates on

956
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
uh that you can place pressure plates on
 

957
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,470
uh that you can place pressure plates on
and stuff

958
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480

 

959
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,549

you gotta look for that spike dice biome

960
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
you gotta look for that spike dice biome
 

961
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,870
you gotta look for that spike dice biome
so yeah they're all landing right there

962
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
so yeah they're all landing right there
 

963
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,830
so yeah they're all landing right there
aren't they oh that is pretty cool

964
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
aren't they oh that is pretty cool
 

965
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,830
aren't they oh that is pretty cool
pretty cool uh here i'll do a little

966
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
pretty cool uh here i'll do a little
 

967
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,029
pretty cool uh here i'll do a little
overview in case you want to build this

968
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
overview in case you want to build this
 

969
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,830
overview in case you want to build this
yourself

970
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:27,840

 

971
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,110

okay and actually we should try tweak it

972
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
okay and actually we should try tweak it
 

973
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,150
okay and actually we should try tweak it
i never did do that

974
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
i never did do that
 

975
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,669
i never did do that
see if we can speed it up

976
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679

 

977
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,750

so it's got a built-in clock

978
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
so it's got a built-in clock
 

979
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,909
so it's got a built-in clock
that's two ticks quicker now looks like

980
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
that's two ticks quicker now looks like
 

981
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,430
that's two ticks quicker now looks like
it's working

982
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440

 

983
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,870

oh man it's going so fast

984
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
oh man it's going so fast
 

985
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,909
oh man it's going so fast
try wait was that what it was at

986
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:53,919

 

987
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,390

i think i think it was at that wasn't it

988
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400

 

989
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,950

still going

990
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960

 

991
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,590

no not anymore okay that's our limit

992
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
no not anymore okay that's our limit
 

993
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,950
no not anymore okay that's our limit
oh oh oh what did i do

994
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
oh oh oh what did i do
 

995
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,549
oh oh oh what did i do
what did i do i broke it

996
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
what did i do i broke it
 

997
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,830
what did i do i broke it
oh no oh i moved it forward not back

998
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
oh no oh i moved it forward not back
 

999
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,190
oh no oh i moved it forward not back
whoops

1000
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
whoops
 

1001
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,270
whoops
can we reset it there we go

1002
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
can we reset it there we go
 

1003
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,950
can we reset it there we go
let's throw some more items in

1004
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960

 

1005
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,270

yeah that's the max speed right there

1006
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280

 

1007
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,630

it's pretty quick actually

1008
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
it's pretty quick actually
 

1009
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,390
it's pretty quick actually
all right cool um

1010
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
all right cool um
 

1011
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,590
all right cool um
what else should we try with this

1012
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600

 

1013
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,870

okay i'm gonna count how far that is

1014
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
okay i'm gonna count how far that is
 

1015
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,110
okay i'm gonna count how far that is
oh and let's uh let's try put some eggs

1016
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
oh and let's uh let's try put some eggs
 

1017
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,549
oh and let's uh let's try put some eggs
in there and see what it does

1018
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
in there and see what it does
 

1019
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,789
in there and see what it does
see if it'll like hatch the chickens and

1020
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
see if it'll like hatch the chickens and
 

1021
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,549
see if it'll like hatch the chickens and
throw them away

1022
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
throw them away
 

1023
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,310
throw them away
that would be pretty cool for a chicken

1024
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
that would be pretty cool for a chicken
 

1025
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,390
that would be pretty cool for a chicken
farm actually

1026
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
farm actually
 

1027
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,549
farm actually
i counted it and it actually launches

1028
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
i counted it and it actually launches
 

1029
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,750
i counted it and it actually launches
the items

1030
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
the items
 

1031
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,830
the items
30 blocks which is not bad at all

1032
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
30 blocks which is not bad at all
 

1033
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,029
30 blocks which is not bad at all
not bad so of course you could put a

1034
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
not bad so of course you could put a
 

1035
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,870
not bad so of course you could put a
hopper over here

1036
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
hopper over here
 

1037
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,510
hopper over here
and uh collect the items then put them

1038
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
and uh collect the items then put them
 

1039

the farms we build
 

1043
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,990
the farms we build
um or if we wanted we could even

1044
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
um or if we wanted we could even
 

1045

um or if we wanted we could even
automatically send them back

1046
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
automatically send them back
 

1047

it dropped us down two blocks so it's

1070
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
it dropped us down two blocks so it's
 

1071
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:57,990
it dropped us down two blocks so it's
not

1072

not
 

1073
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,669

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
here
 

1119
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,950
here
they fall straight down to when they

1120
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
they fall straight down to when they
 

1121
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,190
they fall straight down to when they
lose their

1122
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
lose their
 

1123
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,590
lose their
their horizontal speed right so we we

1124
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
their horizontal speed right so we we
 

1125
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,149
their horizontal speed right so we we
could put that at the top

1126
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159
could put that at the top
 

1127
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,909
could put that at the top
of our mountains and they would just

1128
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
of our mountains and they would just
 

1129
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,990
of our mountains and they would just
like float down for

1130
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
like float down for
 

1131
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,190
like float down for
for a long time and we'll put in a place

1132
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
for a long time and we'll put in a place
 

1133
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,789
for a long time and we'll put in a place
where there's a lot of layers so we can

1134
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
where there's a lot of layers so we can
 

1135
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,390
where there's a lot of layers so we can
see them at different heights as they're

1136
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
see them at different heights as they're
 

1137
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,549
see them at different heights as they're
falling down

1138
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
falling down
 

1139
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,909
falling down
that could be pretty cool and then when

1140
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
that could be pretty cool and then when
 

1141
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,789
that could be pretty cool and then when
they get to the ground

1142
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
they get to the ground
 

1143
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,070
they get to the ground
i don't know what we'll do with them

everywhere and maybe some bits crumbling
 

1165
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,230
everywhere and maybe some bits crumbling
apart and then have some hidden

1166
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
apart and then have some hidden
 

1167
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,909
apart and then have some hidden
futuristic things aha
