guys wouldn't be able to tell a
 

27
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,670
guys wouldn't be able to tell a
difference between before the problem

28
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:46,680
difference between before the problem
 

29
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,160
difference between before the problem
and not we let we like pull the back to

30
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,170
and not we let we like pull the back to

and not we let we like pull the back to
the future here and went down an

32
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:50,489
the future here and went down an
 

33
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,540
the future here and went down an
alternate timeline so hopefully we can

34
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:53,550
alternate timeline so hopefully we can
 

35
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,930
alternate timeline so hopefully we can
get things fairly similar but yeah you

36
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:56,940

probably like Ito you should have made a
 

47
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,770
probably like Ito you should have made a
backup you fool that's what caused the

48
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:15,780
backup you fool that's what caused the
 

49

should make a backup of our world here
 

55
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,980
should make a backup of our world here

and while making the backup it corrupted
 

57
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,649
and while making the backup it corrupted
my files like the way I do it is I

58
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:27,659
my files like the way I do it is I
 

59
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,700
my files like the way I do it is I
right-click on on my folder my city my

60
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:31,710
right-click on on my folder my city my
 

61
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,030
right-click on on my folder my city my
save world here and I will 7-zip it and

62
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
save world here and I will 7-zip it and
 

63
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,499

then usually move it to another hard

64
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:36,509
then usually move it to another hard
 

65
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,210
then usually move it to another hard
drive every so often I'll put it on a

66
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:38,220
drive every so often I'll put it on a
 

67
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,819
drive every so often I'll put it on a
thumb drive in case the hard drive

68
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:40,829
thumb drive in case the hard drive
 

69
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,410
thumb drive in case the hard drive
crashes and I'll even upload it very

70
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,420
crashes and I'll even upload it very
 

71
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,880
crashes and I'll even upload it very
rarely for you guys but if like there

was a fire or something I could download
 

75
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,230
was a fire or something I could download
it myself and we'd have an online backup

76
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
it myself and we'd have an online backup
 

77
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,100
it myself and we'd have an online backup
- yeah while making the the backup 7-zip

78
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,110
- yeah while making the the backup 7-zip
 

79
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,480
- yeah while making the the backup 7-zip
decided to not only not zip up the file

80
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,490
decided to not only not zip up the file
 

81
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,619
decided to not only not zip up the file
but it deleted the original files for my

82
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:09,629
but it deleted the original files for my
 

83
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,290
but it deleted the original files for my
world here and corrupted them so

world here and corrupted them so
 

85
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,370
world here and corrupted them so
yeah anyways I'm going to hopefully get

86
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,380
yeah anyways I'm going to hopefully get
 

87
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,080
yeah anyways I'm going to hopefully get
things as good as I can here and then we

88
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,090
things as good as I can here and then we
 

89
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,440
things as good as I can here and then we
will get to our episode for today

90
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,450
will get to our episode for today
 

91
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,610
will get to our episode for today
alright guys well I think this was the

92
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:23,620
alright guys well I think this was the
 

93
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,770
alright guys well I think this was the
last thing we had to do on our list to

94
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:25,780
last thing we had to do on our list to
 

95
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,420
last thing we had to do on our list to
get things back the way they were in our

96
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,430
get things back the way they were in our
 

97
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,190
get things back the way they were in our
world so now we can start making some

98
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
world so now we can start making some
 

99
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,300
world so now we can start making some
progress might look a little different

100
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,310
progress might look a little different
 

101
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,270
progress might look a little different
but things are pretty close I think

102
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
but things are pretty close I think
 

103
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,320
but things are pretty close I think
that's what that's the great thing about

104
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,330
that's what that's the great thing about
 

105
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,870
that's what that's the great thing about
like being able to upload videos of my

106
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:39,880
like being able to upload videos of my
 

107
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,570
like being able to upload videos of my
world here if I ever have a problem I

108
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:42,580
world here if I ever have a problem I
 

109
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,580
world here if I ever have a problem I
can just like look at my own videos and

110
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,590
can just like look at my own videos and
 

111
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,370
can just like look at my own videos and
figure out okay the blocks or were like

112
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,380
figure out okay the blocks or were like
 

113
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:47,820
figure out okay the blocks or were like
that

114
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:47,830
that
 

115
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,310
that
so I can I in pause the video and build

116
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,320
so I can I in pause the video and build
 

117
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,170
so I can I in pause the video and build
something like exactly just from the

118
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,180
something like exactly just from the
 

119
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,240
something like exactly just from the
video so that's that's what I ended up

120
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,250
video so that's that's what I ended up
 

121
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,090
video so that's that's what I ended up
doing with this worked out pretty good

122
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,100
doing with this worked out pretty good
 

123
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,340
doing with this worked out pretty good
so now what I want to do is fill in this

124
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,350
so now what I want to do is fill in this
 

125
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,410
so now what I want to do is fill in this
big hole here we have because right now

126
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:01,420
big hole here we have because right now
 

127
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,870
big hole here we have because right now
if anything falls in these hoppers it's

128
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:03,880
if anything falls in these hoppers it's
 

129
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,510
if anything falls in these hoppers it's
going to jam up the furnaces below and

130
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:06,520
going to jam up the furnaces below and
 

131
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,750
going to jam up the furnaces below and
mess up our super smelter but even if a

132
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
mess up our super smelter but even if a
 

133
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
mess up our super smelter but even if a
zombie-like was to fall into this hole

134
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:11,770
zombie-like was to fall into this hole
 

135
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,260
zombie-like was to fall into this hole
he might land on the hoppers and then

136
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,270
he might land on the hoppers and then
 

137
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,540
he might land on the hoppers and then
burn up in the Sun his nam be flesh

138
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:15,550
burn up in the Sun his nam be flesh
 

139
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,600
burn up in the Sun his nam be flesh
falls into the hoppers and jams up a

140
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,610
falls into the hoppers and jams up a
 

141
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,580
falls into the hoppers and jams up a
furnace like so that's what could happen

142
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:20,590
furnace like so that's what could happen
 

143
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,750
furnace like so that's what could happen
right now so we got to really protect

144
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
right now so we got to really protect
 

145
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,780
right now so we got to really protect
them I'm going to cover it with slabs

them I'm going to cover it with slabs
 

147
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,370
them I'm going to cover it with slabs
and then put dirt over shot so I'm

148

and then put dirt over shot so I'm
 

149
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:36,510
and then put dirt over shot so I'm
blended into the frame okay so we're

150
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:36,520
blended into the frame okay so we're
 

151
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,770
blended into the frame okay so we're
going to take a look from the distance

152
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:37,780
going to take a look from the distance
 

153
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,580

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,310
midair
 

163
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,500
midair
so that was one side of the hole over

164
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,510
so that was one side of the hole over
 

165
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,210
so that was one side of the hole over
there and other side was over here and I

166
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,220
there and other side was over here and I
 

167
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,550
there and other side was over here and I
think you could hardly tell there was a

168
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
think you could hardly tell there was a
 

169
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
think you could hardly tell there was a
problem with the terrain here now right

170
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,570
problem with the terrain here now right
 

171
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,240
problem with the terrain here now right
like if we grew grass it would look

172
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,250
like if we grew grass it would look
 

173
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,860
like if we grew grass it would look

design for this building the interior of

180
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,400
design for this building the interior of
 

181
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,620
design for this building the interior of
it anyways but I think we can all agree

182
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:13,630
it anyways but I think we can all agree

it anyways but I think we can all agree
the outside of it is nasty right we got

184
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,470
the outside of it is nasty right we got
 

185
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,820
the outside of it is nasty right we got
to do something so I know guys I know

186
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:20,830
to do something so I know guys I know
 

187
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,680
to do something so I know guys I know
the reason you watch me is because I'm

188
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:22,690
the reason you watch me is because I'm
 

189
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,890
the reason you watch me is because I'm
such a great builder right I'm

190
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:25,900
such a great builder right I'm
 

191
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,210
such a great builder right I'm
struggling with this a little

192
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,220
struggling with this a little
 

193
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,380
struggling with this a little
it's uh who my plan was to put four

194
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,390
it's uh who my plan was to put four
 

195
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,660
it's uh who my plan was to put four
towers in the four corners right that

196
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:33,670
towers in the four corners right that
 

197
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,160
towers in the four corners right that
would be something really simple to do

198
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,170
would be something really simple to do
 

199
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,290
would be something really simple to do
like we would put a tower here tower on

200
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,300
like we would put a tower here tower on
 

201
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,000
like we would put a tower here tower on
the other side that'll fill up most of

202
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,010
the other side that'll fill up most of
 

203
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,620
the other side that'll fill up most of
the exterior of the building and then

204
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:40,630
the exterior of the building and then
 

205
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,290
the exterior of the building and then
we'll be done just got to fill in a

206
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,300
we'll be done just got to fill in a
 

207
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,630
we'll be done just got to fill in a
little bit on the wall here right I

208
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:45,640
little bit on the wall here right I
 

209
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,000
little bit on the wall here right I
tried using stone brick and wood and

210
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,010
tried using stone brick and wood and
 

211
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,980
tried using stone brick and wood and
stuff but I tore it all down it looked

212
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:49,990
stuff but I tore it all down it looked
 

213
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,900
stuff but I tore it all down it looked
bad so now we're going with the nether

214
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:51,910
bad so now we're going with the nether
 

215
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,810
bad so now we're going with the nether
brick look I didn't want to use Brown

216
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:54,820
brick look I didn't want to use Brown
 

217
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,550
brick look I didn't want to use Brown
though because if you have nether brick

218
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
though because if you have nether brick
 

219
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,770
though because if you have nether brick
in' and like brown clay there's no

220
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:58,780
in' and like brown clay there's no
 

221
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,930
in' and like brown clay there's no
bright block for your eyes to focus on

222
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:00,940
bright block for your eyes to focus on
 

223
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,000
bright block for your eyes to focus on
and it just looks bad so I switched over

224
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,010
and it just looks bad so I switched over
 

225
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,280
and it just looks bad so I switched over
to magma blocks and it looks bad but I'm

226
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,290
to magma blocks and it looks bad but I'm
 

227
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,600
to magma blocks and it looks bad but I'm
gonna I'm going to keep trying here I

228
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:09,610
gonna I'm going to keep trying here I
 

229
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,700
gonna I'm going to keep trying here I
think once we add some details to it

230
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:11,710
think once we add some details to it
 

231
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,860
think once we add some details to it
it'll actually be okay my plan is we're

232
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:16,870
it'll actually be okay my plan is we're
 

233
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,480
it'll actually be okay my plan is we're
going to put a flame on the top of these

234
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,490
going to put a flame on the top of these
 

235
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,500
going to put a flame on the top of these
towers like it will have a 3x3 thing of

236
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,510
towers like it will have a 3x3 thing of
 

237
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,020
towers like it will have a 3x3 thing of
magma blocks up here and then we'll put

238
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,030
magma blocks up here and then we'll put
 

239
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,010
magma blocks up here and then we'll put
flames on top of these and hopefully try

240
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,020
flames on top of these and hopefully try
 

241
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,750
flames on top of these and hopefully try
to make it look cool right or maybe

242
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:30,760
to make it look cool right or maybe
 

243
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,210
to make it look cool right or maybe
it'll even raise it in the middle here

244
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:32,220
it'll even raise it in the middle here
 

245
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,940
it'll even raise it in the middle here
have the middle a little bit higher give

246
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:35,950
have the middle a little bit higher give
 

247
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,520
have the middle a little bit higher give
it some more depth alright so then this

248
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:38,530
it some more depth alright so then this
 

249
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,960
it some more depth alright so then this
will come up here and then over here

250
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:41,970
will come up here and then over here
 

251
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,540
will come up here and then over here
alright so how do we make this look

252
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,550
alright so how do we make this look
 

253
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,460
alright so how do we make this look
better that is the question well we got

254
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,470
better that is the question well we got
 

255
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,430
better that is the question well we got
to add some variations to it stead of it

256
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:50,440
to add some variations to it stead of it
 

257
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,900
to add some variations to it stead of it
going completely straight up we should

258
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:51,910
going completely straight up we should
 

259
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,360
going completely straight up we should
probably change that right that's

260
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,370
probably change that right that's
 

261
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,210
probably change that right that's
probably the best I can do so we're

262
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:57,220
probably the best I can do so we're
 

263
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,530
probably the best I can do so we're
going to roll with that and you guys are

264
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:58,540
going to roll with that and you guys are
 

265
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,550
going to roll with that and you guys are
going to like it you're going to tell me

266
00:05:59,550 --> 00:05:59,560
going to like it you're going to tell me
 

267
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,790
going to like it you're going to tell me
how great it is right yeah let's try to

268
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
how great it is right yeah let's try to
 

269
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,860
how great it is right yeah let's try to
actually add some more stuff here too so

270
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:04,870
actually add some more stuff here too so
 

271
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,640
actually add some more stuff here too so
it's creeper no my imagination so it's

272
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:08,650
it's creeper no my imagination so it's
 

273
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,130
it's creeper no my imagination so it's
not totally plain like we'll do this do

274
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:14,140
not totally plain like we'll do this do
 

275
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,700
not totally plain like we'll do this do
something like that and then we got a

276
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:17,710
something like that and then we got a
 

277
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,340
something like that and then we got a
big flat area here let's let's throw in

278
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,350
big flat area here let's let's throw in
 

279
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,250
big flat area here let's let's throw in
some slabs or something try a little

some slabs or something try a little
 

281
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,940
some slabs or something try a little
design here and that and that okay how's

282
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:26,950
design here and that and that okay how's
 

283

we're going to take a walk around the
 

289
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,980
we're going to take a walk around the
building I think I got it all done now

290
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:43,990
building I think I got it all done now
 

291
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,760

298
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:55,300
right yeah so this is a very different
 

299
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,570
right yeah so this is a very different
building style than I've done before it

300
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:57,580
building style than I've done before it
 

301
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,360
building style than I've done before it
was actually a lot of fun to do very

302
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,370
was actually a lot of fun to do very
 

303
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,890
was actually a lot of fun to do very
dark though maybe I made it too dark

304
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:01,900
dark though maybe I made it too dark
 

305
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,200
dark though maybe I made it too dark
there's lots of nether brick in it you

306
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,210
there's lots of nether brick in it you
 

307
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,999
there's lots of nether brick in it you
might remember like the archway here had

308
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:06,009
might remember like the archway here had
 

309
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,679
might remember like the archway here had
some nether brick in it I changed that

310
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:07,689
some nether brick in it I changed that
 

311
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:10,290
some nether brick in it I changed that
to orange sandstone just to add some

312
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,300
to orange sandstone just to add some
 

313
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,689
to orange sandstone just to add some
more color to the building and I think

314
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:12,699
more color to the building and I think
 

315
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,010
more color to the building and I think
that highlights the entrance very nice

316
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,020
that highlights the entrance very nice
 

317
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,600
that highlights the entrance very nice
like this we've got the stairs nice and

318
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:15,610
like this we've got the stairs nice and
 

319
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,600
like this we've got the stairs nice and
bright Artois nice and bright you know I

320
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,610
bright Artois nice and bright you know I
 

321
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,420
bright Artois nice and bright you know I
love my arches and then I added a lot of

322
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,430
love my arches and then I added a lot of
 

323
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,269
love my arches and then I added a lot of
detail to the towers here there would be

324
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:24,279
detail to the towers here there would be
 

325
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,779
detail to the towers here there would be
over detailed but I kind of liked them

326
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:27,789
over detailed but I kind of liked them
 

327
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,670
over detailed but I kind of liked them
and I just copied like we have four

328
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
and I just copied like we have four
 

329
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,619
and I just copied like we have four
towers in total I just copied the design

330
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:31,629
towers in total I just copied the design
 

331
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,480
towers in total I just copied the design
to all of them so that's simplified the

332
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,490
to all of them so that's simplified the
 

333
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,980
to all of them so that's simplified the
building a lot here I just had to fill

334
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:34,990
building a lot here I just had to fill
 

335
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,829
building a lot here I just had to fill
in the wall here pretty much to finish

336
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:37,839
in the wall here pretty much to finish
 

337
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,890
in the wall here pretty much to finish
it up so just random nether brick

338
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:40,900
it up so just random nether brick
 

339
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,929
it up so just random nether brick
structure stuff nothing too exciting

340
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:42,939
structure stuff nothing too exciting
 

341
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,269
structure stuff nothing too exciting
here this side has like no orange which

342
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:45,279
here this side has like no orange which
 

343
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,839
here this side has like no orange which
is probably a mistake but like we got

344
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:48,849
is probably a mistake but like we got
 

345
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,029
is probably a mistake but like we got
the brown clay here that's being used on

346
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
the brown clay here that's being used on
 

347
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,820
the brown clay here that's being used on
the interior so I couldn't change that

348
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:52,830
the interior so I couldn't change that
 

349
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,639
the interior so I couldn't change that
unless I made the wall thicker but I

350
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:56,649
unless I made the wall thicker but I
 

351
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,570
unless I made the wall thicker but I
didn't want to do that either

352
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:57,580
didn't want to do that either
 

353
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,959
didn't want to do that either
aha and then there's this a little bit

354
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:00,969
aha and then there's this a little bit
 

355
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,369
aha and then there's this a little bit
on the back here I have to make

356
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:02,379
on the back here I have to make
 

357
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,240
on the back here I have to make
something random up with so decides

358
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,250
something random up with so decides
 

359
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,579
something random up with so decides
exactly the same we'll take a look from

360
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:08,589
exactly the same we'll take a look from
 

361
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:12,059
exactly the same we'll take a look from
from on top here too but yeah I think

362
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,069
from on top here too but yeah I think
 

363
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:14,450
from on top here too but yeah I think
our super smeltery building is done now

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:14,460
our super smeltery building is done now
 

365
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,829
our super smeltery building is done now
from a distance I think it looks okay to

366
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:16,839
from a distance I think it looks okay to
 

367
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,959
from a distance I think it looks okay to
like I'm okay with it look from up here

368
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:20,969
like I'm okay with it look from up here
 

369
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,969
like I'm okay with it look from up here
the flames look kind of cool but yeah

374
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:29,949
now it does stand out quite a bit
 

375
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,250
now it does stand out quite a bit
because like the area the terrain here

376
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,260
because like the area the terrain here
 

377
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,899
because like the area the terrain here
needs some work it's it doesn't really

378
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:33,909
needs some work it's it doesn't really
 

379
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,000
needs some work it's it doesn't really
go well with the green grass I think we

380
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,010
go well with the green grass I think we
 

381
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,050
go well with the green grass I think we
will do some more terraforming out here

382
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,060
will do some more terraforming out here
 

383
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,009
will do some more terraforming out here
and I didn't do anything with this

384
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:41,019
and I didn't do anything with this
 

385
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,509
and I didn't do anything with this
elevator yet I'm going to save that for

386
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:42,519
elevator yet I'm going to save that for
 

387
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,180
elevator yet I'm going to save that for
another day cuz like last time I tried

this

396
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,130
this
 

397
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,960
this
while running around here I was like

398
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:57,970
while running around here I was like
 

399
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,790
while running around here I was like
wait a minute why why did my character

400
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
wait a minute why why did my character
 

401
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,280
wait a minute why why did my character
just go up and now I did it - now did

402
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,290
just go up and now I did it - now did
 

403
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,650
just go up and now I did it - now did
well what's happening here there's like

404
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:05,660
well what's happening here there's like
 

405
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,480
well what's happening here there's like
some invisible blocks here like half

406
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,490
some invisible blocks here like half
 

407
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,510
some invisible blocks here like half
slabs and I don't know what they are

408
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:10,520
slabs and I don't know what they are
 

409
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,150
slabs and I don't know what they are
we're going to figure this out together

410
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
we're going to figure this out together
 

411
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,400
we're going to figure this out together
so updating them does not make them

412
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,410
so updating them does not make them
 

413
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,910
so updating them does not make them
appear I don't remember ever placing any

414
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:18,920
appear I don't remember ever placing any
 

415
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,680
appear I don't remember ever placing any
slabs here which is what really confuses

416
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:20,690
slabs here which is what really confuses
 

417
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:28,360
slabs here which is what really confuses
me oh it's a bed oh so is this gonna be

418
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,370
me oh it's a bed oh so is this gonna be
 

419
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:34,300

a red bed yeah red bed lime bed okay so

420
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,310
a red bed yeah red bed lime bed okay so
 

421
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:40,990
a red bed yeah red bed lime bed okay so
the old beds get converted then okay

422
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,000
the old beds get converted then okay
 

423
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,030
the old beds get converted then okay
that's a little weird yeah I guess our

424
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
that's a little weird yeah I guess our
 

425
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,710
that's a little weird yeah I guess our
enderpearl is still here from before so

426
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
enderpearl is still here from before so
 

427
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,870
enderpearl is still here from before so
we're gonna take a little break from the

428
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
we're gonna take a little break from the
 

429
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,810
we're gonna take a little break from the
building here guys do a couple random

430
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:49,820
building here guys do a couple random
 

431
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,810
building here guys do a couple random
random fun things there's something a

432
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:52,820
random fun things there's something a
 

433
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,270
random fun things there's something a
building in are amplified stranger I've

434
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,280
building in are amplified stranger I've
 

435
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,160
building in are amplified stranger I've
been wanting to check out for a while

436
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,170
been wanting to check out for a while
 

437
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,530
been wanting to check out for a while
and now we finally have a reason to we

438
00:09:59,530 --> 00:09:59,540
and now we finally have a reason to we
 

439
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,020
and now we finally have a reason to we
have ran out of flowers guys we're low

440
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,030
have ran out of flowers guys we're low
 

441
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,930
have ran out of flowers guys we're low
on flowers a long time ago we built a

442
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:04,940
on flowers a long time ago we built a
 

443
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,020
on flowers a long time ago we built a
flower farm here and we only used it

444
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,030
flower farm here and we only used it
 

445
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,160
flower farm here and we only used it
once because we got so many from it so

446
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,170
once because we got so many from it so
 

447
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,110
once because we got so many from it so
let's check this out I don't even

448
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,120
let's check this out I don't even
 

449
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,850
let's check this out I don't even
remember how it works or if it's even

450
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:18,860
remember how it works or if it's even
 

451
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,190
remember how it works or if it's even
going to work so I guess so you got a

452
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
going to work so I guess so you got a
 

453
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,930
going to work so I guess so you got a
hopper minecart running oh we got a

454
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:22,940
hopper minecart running oh we got a
 

455
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,300
hopper minecart running oh we got a
bunch of them running below these might

456
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,310
bunch of them running below these might
 

457
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,920
bunch of them running below these might
not work because there was a patch that

458
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:26,930
not work because there was a patch that
 

459
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,260
not work because there was a patch that
broke the hopper minecarts a while ago

460
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,270
broke the hopper minecarts a while ago
 

461
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,220
broke the hopper minecarts a while ago
we'll see I guess I never really

462
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,230
we'll see I guess I never really
 

463
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,740
we'll see I guess I never really
polished this up too well tonight oh I

464
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:35,750
polished this up too well tonight oh I
 

465
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,750
polished this up too well tonight oh I
think if there's any bone meal left I

466
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
think if there's any bone meal left I
 

467
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,340
think if there's any bone meal left I
think all we do got to do is flip this

468
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,350
think all we do got to do is flip this
 

469
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,600
think all we do got to do is flip this
lever right

470
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:41,610
lever right
 

471
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,680
lever right
yeah totally totally automatic contracts

472
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:45,690
yeah totally totally automatic contracts
 

473
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:55,740
yeah totally totally automatic contracts
where do they go oh there go oh my bad I

474
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:55,750
where do they go oh there go oh my bad I
 

475
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,360
where do they go oh there go oh my bad I
just realized the sound was really loud

476
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,370
just realized the sound was really loud
 

477
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,350
just realized the sound was really loud
so I turned it down here yeah this

478
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
so I turned it down here yeah this
 

479
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,810
so I turned it down here yeah this
flower firm doesn't work all that great

480
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:03,820
flower firm doesn't work all that great
 

481
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,430
flower firm doesn't work all that great
actually I noticed like the hopper

482
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
actually I noticed like the hopper
 

483
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,170
actually I noticed like the hopper
minecarts do not pick up the flowers

484
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:07,180
minecarts do not pick up the flowers
 

485
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,080
minecarts do not pick up the flowers
quick enough

486
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,090
quick enough
 

487
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,550
quick enough
like the stuff is just getting stuck up

488
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:11,560
like the stuff is just getting stuck up
 

489
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,110
like the stuff is just getting stuck up
here and the hopper mine cards are

490
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
here and the hopper mine cards are
 

491
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,290
here and the hopper mine cards are
picking up some of it but like

492
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,300
picking up some of it but like
 

493
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,700
picking up some of it but like
eventually most of this will just be

494
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:17,710
eventually most of this will just be
 

495
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,550
eventually most of this will just be
spawn right but we shut it off for maybe

496
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,560
spawn right but we shut it off for maybe
 

497
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,140
spawn right but we shut it off for maybe
it can't pick them up while it's running

498
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,150
it can't pick them up while it's running
 

499
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,130
it can't pick them up while it's running
you see the stuffs disappearing now yeah

500
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:29,140
you see the stuffs disappearing now yeah
 

501
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,920
you see the stuffs disappearing now yeah
I think maybe it just can't pick them up

502
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:31,930
I think maybe it just can't pick them up
 

503
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,130
I think maybe it just can't pick them up
while it's moving possibly because like

504
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,140
while it's moving possibly because like
 

505
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,360
while it's moving possibly because like
when I was running I didn't really see

506
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,370
when I was running I didn't really see
 

507
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,470
when I was running I didn't really see
any disappearing right I'm not sure how

508
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:43,480
any disappearing right I'm not sure how
 

509
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,870
any disappearing right I'm not sure how
full are these hopper minecarts I wish

510
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:45,880
full are these hopper minecarts I wish
 

511
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,470
full are these hopper minecarts I wish
we could click on them easily oh do they

512
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:49,480
we could click on them easily oh do they
 

513
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,950
we could click on them easily oh do they
unload oh they unload on this end too

514
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:51,960
unload oh they unload on this end too
 

515
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,010
unload oh they unload on this end too
okay that's where some of it might be

516
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,020
okay that's where some of it might be
 

517
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,180
okay that's where some of it might be
going then and they stay until they

518
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,190
going then and they stay until they
 

519
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,200
going then and they stay until they
empty right anyways I thought it would

520
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,210
empty right anyways I thought it would
 

521
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,790
empty right anyways I thought it would
be fun to check this out I totally

522
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:05,800
be fun to check this out I totally
 

523
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,540
be fun to check this out I totally
forgot how how it worked in everything

524
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:08,550
forgot how how it worked in everything
 

525
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,920
forgot how how it worked in everything

grabbed the Shanker box full flowers

528
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:12,640
grabbed the Shanker box full flowers
 

529
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,280
grabbed the Shanker box full flowers
here should last us for quite a while

530
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,290
here should last us for quite a while
 

531
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,280
here should last us for quite a while
again I use them for dyes but also just

532
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,290
again I use them for dyes but also just
 

533
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,130
again I use them for dyes but also just
for decoration and stuff too so another

534
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:20,140
for decoration and stuff too so another
 

535
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,410
for decoration and stuff too so another
thing I wanted to try today got the

536
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:22,420
thing I wanted to try today got the
 

537
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,290
thing I wanted to try today got the
water system working for the mushroom

538
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:25,300
water system working for the mushroom
 

539
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,570
water system working for the mushroom
farm I think haven't tested it so it

540
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:27,580
farm I think haven't tested it so it
 

541
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,330
farm I think haven't tested it so it
would be fun to do together so yeah each

542
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:30,340
would be fun to do together so yeah each
 

543
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,190
would be fun to do together so yeah each
of these dispensers has a water bucket

544
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,200
of these dispensers has a water bucket
 

545
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,740
of these dispensers has a water bucket
in and there's a wire that runs down the

546
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:34,750
in and there's a wire that runs down the
 

547
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,780
in and there's a wire that runs down the
middle here to the both side so there's

548
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:36,790
middle here to the both side so there's
 

549
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,120
middle here to the both side so there's
a dispenser on both sides with the water

550
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,130
a dispenser on both sides with the water
 

551
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,990
a dispenser on both sides with the water
bucket in an idea is like the closest

552
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,000
bucket in an idea is like the closest
 

553
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,750
bucket in an idea is like the closest
way for it to get down is one two blocks

554
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
way for it to get down is one two blocks
 

555
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,980
way for it to get down is one two blocks
over here while like to go over here 1 2

556
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:49,990
over here while like to go over here 1 2
 

557
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,730
over here while like to go over here 1 2
3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 so it's going to flow

558
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:54,740
3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 so it's going to flow
 

559
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,620
3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 so it's going to flow
directly down here and not spread all

560
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:56,630
directly down here and not spread all
 

561
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,340
directly down here and not spread all
over the place I hope if it spreads all

562
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,350
over the place I hope if it spreads all
 

563
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,600
over the place I hope if it spreads all
over the place it's going to destroy

564
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,610
over the place it's going to destroy
 

565
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,690
over the place it's going to destroy
some wiring and stuff probably okay so

566
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:04,700
some wiring and stuff probably okay so
 

567
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,400
some wiring and stuff probably okay so
to turn it on

568
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,410
to turn it on
 

569
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,410
to turn it on
we just need to press a button over here

570
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:08,420
we just need to press a button over here
 

571
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,949
we just need to press a button over here
and this runs all the way down here and

572
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:11,959
and this runs all the way down here and
 

573
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,990
and this runs all the way down here and
around and we'll see how much lag this

574
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
around and we'll see how much lag this
 

575
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
around and we'll see how much lag this
actually causes because it's going to be

576
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:15,770
actually causes because it's going to be
 

577
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,760
actually causes because it's going to be
pretty crazy I think okay just get a

578
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:18,770
pretty crazy I think okay just get a
 

579
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:24,370
pretty crazy I think okay just get a
button and here we go yeah I think we're

580
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,380
button and here we go yeah I think we're
 

581
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,930
button and here we go yeah I think we're
good all right

582
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:27,940
good all right
 

583
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,100
good all right
uh-huh and then we'll test the water

584
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,110
uh-huh and then we'll test the water
 

585
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,300
uh-huh and then we'll test the water
streams to make sure they actually work

586
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,310
streams to make sure they actually work
 

587
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,269
streams to make sure they actually work
to the way we want them to is it still

588
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:34,279
to the way we want them to is it still
 

589
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,000
to the way we want them to is it still
going

590
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,010
going
 

591
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,440
going
maybe the graphics oh yeah there they go

592
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,450
maybe the graphics oh yeah there they go
 

593
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,710
maybe the graphics oh yeah there they go
it takes a while for the graphic stuff

594
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
it takes a while for the graphic stuff
 

595
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,260
it takes a while for the graphic stuff
update I guess that actually looks

596
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,270
update I guess that actually looks
 

597
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,040
update I guess that actually looks
pretty cool right I like that

598
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,050
pretty cool right I like that
 

599
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,750
pretty cool right I like that
okay didn't feel much lag but I guess it

600
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
okay didn't feel much lag but I guess it
 

601
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,519
okay didn't feel much lag but I guess it
wasn't drying it that's why so these are

602
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:54,529
wasn't drying it that's why so these are
 

603
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,810
wasn't drying it that's why so these are
all kind of messed up because we're

604
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:55,820
all kind of messed up because we're
 

605
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,280
all kind of messed up because we're
having a wiring problem still but this

606
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,290
having a wiring problem still but this
 

607
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,720
having a wiring problem still but this
one looks like it's intact properly

608
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:58,730
one looks like it's intact properly
 

609
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,660
one looks like it's intact properly
though so does everything go to the hole

610
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:01,670
though so does everything go to the hole
 

611
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,060
though so does everything go to the hole
here that's what we want um looks like

612
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,070
here that's what we want um looks like
 

613
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,680
here that's what we want um looks like
looks like it's okay make sure

614
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:08,690
looks like it's okay make sure
 

615
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,410
looks like it's okay make sure
everything goes there there's no dead

616
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:11,420
everything goes there there's no dead
 

617
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,410
everything goes there there's no dead
spot so maybe here all that's a dead

618
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:14,420
spot so maybe here all that's a dead
 

619
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:23,380
spot so maybe here all that's a dead
spot Oh what who knew it's getting stuck

620
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,390
spot Oh what who knew it's getting stuck
 

621
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,440
spot Oh what who knew it's getting stuck
like deaf way halfway on the block

622
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,450

 

623
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:37,389

no no oh that's really bad darn so if

624
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:37,399
no no oh that's really bad darn so if
 

625
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,560
no no oh that's really bad darn so if
they come from this side they're all

626
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:38,570
they come from this side they're all
 

627
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,960
they come from this side they're all
going to get jammed because I did it on

628
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:40,970
going to get jammed because I did it on
 

629
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,519
going to get jammed because I did it on
an even number instead of an odd number

630
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:42,529
an even number instead of an odd number
 

631
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,389
an even number instead of an odd number
that was a big mistake we can fix that

632
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
that was a big mistake we can fix that
 

633
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,030
that was a big mistake we can fix that
but I'll have to add more dispensers

634
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,040
but I'll have to add more dispensers
 

635
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,769
but I'll have to add more dispensers
like if the if we add a dispenser there

636
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:50,779
like if the if we add a dispenser there
 

637
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,300
like if the if we add a dispenser there
and one right next to it then it would

638
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,310
and one right next to it then it would
 

639
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,540
and one right next to it then it would
work okay well I do want to do a little

640
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:55,550
work okay well I do want to do a little
 

641
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,980
work okay well I do want to do a little
bit more with this building today so

642
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:56,990
bit more with this building today so
 

643
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,970
bit more with this building today so
let's get back to it here I want to do a

644
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:00,980
let's get back to it here I want to do a
 

645
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,579
let's get back to it here I want to do a
bit of terraforming so we're going to

646
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:03,589
bit of terraforming so we're going to
 

647
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,680
bit of terraforming so we're going to
get rid of the grass here like probably

648
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:05,690
get rid of the grass here like probably
 

649
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,570
get rid of the grass here like probably
a distance of about

650
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:07,580
a distance of about
 

651
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,900
a distance of about
and ten or fifteen blocks all around the

652
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:10,910
and ten or fifteen blocks all around the
 

653
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,330
and ten or fifteen blocks all around the
structure I'd be replaced to grasp with

654
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:13,340
structure I'd be replaced to grasp with
 

655
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,820
structure I'd be replaced to grasp with
coarse dirt first and then we'll try to

656
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:15,830
coarse dirt first and then we'll try to
 

657
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,230
coarse dirt first and then we'll try to
mix in some other things like brown

658
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,240
mix in some other things like brown
 

659
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,260
mix in some other things like brown
concrete maybe concrete a little bit

660
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,270
concrete maybe concrete a little bit
 

661
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,230
concrete maybe concrete a little bit
cool maybe some other stuff some leaves

662
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,240
cool maybe some other stuff some leaves
 

663
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,930
cool maybe some other stuff some leaves
and and all that kind of stuff then on

664
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:25,940
and and all that kind of stuff then on
 

665
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,000
and and all that kind of stuff then on
the border of the coarse dirt here like

666
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,010
the border of the coarse dirt here like
 

667
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,430
the border of the coarse dirt here like
like way out here we'll try to build a

668
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,440
like way out here we'll try to build a
 

669
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,580
like way out here we'll try to build a
stone fence all around our smeltery

670
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:33,590
stone fence all around our smeltery
 

671
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,260
stone fence all around our smeltery
building and I think that'll blend it

672
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,270
building and I think that'll blend it
 

673
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,540
building and I think that'll blend it
into the Train nicely because the way it

674
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:37,550
into the Train nicely because the way it
 

675
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,210
into the Train nicely because the way it
is right now it sticks out like a sore

676
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:40,220
is right now it sticks out like a sore
 

677
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,460
is right now it sticks out like a sore
thumb right it doesn't really suit it so

678
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,470
thumb right it doesn't really suit it so
 

679
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,770
thumb right it doesn't really suit it so
we have to change the terrain and blend

680
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:44,780
we have to change the terrain and blend
 

681
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,740
we have to change the terrain and blend
it together with its surroundings so

682
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:47,750
it together with its surroundings so
 

683
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,330
it together with its surroundings so
yeah we'll see how it looks after we

684
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:49,340
yeah we'll see how it looks after we
 

685
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:56,320
yeah we'll see how it looks after we
change it here yeah okay so this is what

686
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,330
change it here yeah okay so this is what
 

687
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,060
change it here yeah okay so this is what
I was a little bit afraid of it doesn't

688
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,070
I was a little bit afraid of it doesn't
 

689
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,570
I was a little bit afraid of it doesn't
look too good just on its own the coarse

690
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:01,580
look too good just on its own the coarse
 

691
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,510
look too good just on its own the coarse
dirt is not enough all right it stands

692
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:04,520
dirt is not enough all right it stands
 

693
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,850
dirt is not enough all right it stands
out now the whole the whole area there

694
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:06,860
out now the whole the whole area there
 

695
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,490
out now the whole the whole area there
not just the building so we have to

696
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:09,500
not just the building so we have to
 

697
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,210
not just the building so we have to
transition it a little bit better I

698
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:12,220
transition it a little bit better I
 

699
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,260
transition it a little bit better I
thought I thought it would be an issue

700
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,270
thought I thought it would be an issue
 

701
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,540
thought I thought it would be an issue
that's why I have the fence in mind but

702
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:16,550
that's why I have the fence in mind but
 

703
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,860
that's why I have the fence in mind but
we'll probably have to do a little bit

704
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:17,870
we'll probably have to do a little bit
 

705
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,810
we'll probably have to do a little bit
more than just a fence we're going to

706
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:19,820
more than just a fence we're going to
 

707
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,450
more than just a fence we're going to
try to do a cobble fence and I'm just

708
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:22,460
try to do a cobble fence and I'm just
 

709
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,030
try to do a cobble fence and I'm just
going to spam cobblestone all along the

710
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
going to spam cobblestone all along the
 

711
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,760
going to spam cobblestone all along the
border here we will mix in some some

712
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:27,770
border here we will mix in some some
 

713
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,940
border here we will mix in some some
grass and stuff some greenery with this

714
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:30,950
grass and stuff some greenery with this
 

715
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,000
grass and stuff some greenery with this
little bit - we're going to do it like

716
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,010
little bit - we're going to do it like
 

717
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,290
little bit - we're going to do it like
we did the fence over there so just

718
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:35,300
we did the fence over there so just
 

719
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,270
we did the fence over there so just
cobblestone and then going to have some

720
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,280
cobblestone and then going to have some
 

721
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,830
cobblestone and then going to have some
stairs

722
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:38,840
stairs
 

723
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,410
stairs
a couple stone fences maybe some mossy

724
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:41,420
a couple stone fences maybe some mossy
 

725
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,730
a couple stone fences maybe some mossy
we'll mix them as well and just by

726
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:44,740
we'll mix them as well and just by
 

727
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,230
we'll mix them as well and just by
making little variations and stuff it

728
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,240
making little variations and stuff it
 

729
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,800
making little variations and stuff it
hopefully looks pretty good we don't

730
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,810
hopefully looks pretty good we don't
 

731
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,240
hopefully looks pretty good we don't
want it to be too tall though like we

732
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,250
want it to be too tall though like we
 

733
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,620
want it to be too tall though like we
don't want to block up the view of the

734
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:53,630
don't want to block up the view of the
 

735
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,550
don't want to block up the view of the
building how does I do this before I

736
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:57,560
building how does I do this before I
 

737
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,820
building how does I do this before I
think I remember I think I just spammed

738
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:00,830
think I remember I think I just spammed
 

739
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,710
think I remember I think I just spammed
it right I don't think I actually

740
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
it right I don't think I actually
 

741
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,180
it right I don't think I actually
thought about it too much i think i just

742
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,190
thought about it too much i think i just
 

743
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,699
thought about it too much i think i just
banned it and it worked so we'll try do

744
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:06,709
banned it and it worked so we'll try do
 

745
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,800
banned it and it worked so we'll try do
that here let's go through and do

746
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:08,810
that here let's go through and do
 

747
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:14,400
that here let's go through and do
different layers see how it looks okay

748
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,410
different layers see how it looks okay
 

749
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,500
different layers see how it looks okay
so I've been looking at this I don't

750
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,510
so I've been looking at this I don't
 

751
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,300
so I've been looking at this I don't
know I'll see what you guys say about it

752
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,310
know I'll see what you guys say about it
 

753
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,420
know I'll see what you guys say about it
I think it's okay

754
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:21,430
I think it's okay
 

755
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,130
I think it's okay
for the most part I am second-guessing

756
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,140
for the most part I am second-guessing
 

757
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,810
for the most part I am second-guessing
myself though like maybe we shouldn't

758
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:25,820
myself though like maybe we shouldn't
 

759
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,370
myself though like maybe we shouldn't
have done it out of cobblestone maybe

760
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:27,380
have done it out of cobblestone maybe
 

761
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,230
have done it out of cobblestone maybe
wood would have been a better choice

762
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,240
wood would have been a better choice
 

763
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,810
wood would have been a better choice
because the the brownish color of wood

764
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:31,820
because the the brownish color of wood
 

765
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,010
because the the brownish color of wood
would have went with the nether brick

766
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,020
would have went with the nether brick
 

767
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,110
would have went with the nether brick
nicely and it goes with grass nicely too

768
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
nicely and it goes with grass nicely too
 

769
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,160
nicely and it goes with grass nicely too
because it's an earth tone but maybe

770
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,170
because it's an earth tone but maybe
 

771
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,110
because it's an earth tone but maybe
eventually like if we build more stuff

772
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
eventually like if we build more stuff
 

773
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,450
eventually like if we build more stuff
around this area that the gray

774
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:43,460
around this area that the gray
 

775
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,760
around this area that the gray
cobblestone won't really stand out as

776
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:45,770
cobblestone won't really stand out as
 

777
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:53,200
cobblestone won't really stand out as
much I don't know like for example the

778
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,210
much I don't know like for example the
 

779
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,960
much I don't know like for example the
way we've been doing the paths in this

780
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:55,970
way we've been doing the paths in this
 

781
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,550
way we've been doing the paths in this
area kind of looks like this over here

782
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:57,560
area kind of looks like this over here
 

783
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,340
area kind of looks like this over here
right so this is a great color

784
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,350
right so this is a great color
 

785
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,930
right so this is a great color
eventually if we connect this up to this

786
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:01,940
eventually if we connect this up to this
 

787
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,470
eventually if we connect this up to this
area like we'll probably connect this

788
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:05,480
area like we'll probably connect this
 

789
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,250
area like we'll probably connect this
path to like that one over there

790
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:09,260
path to like that one over there
 

791
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,340
path to like that one over there
eventually and it'll run through here
