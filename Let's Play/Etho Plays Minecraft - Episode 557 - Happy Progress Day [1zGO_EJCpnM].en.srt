favorite spot
and uh for good reason it's right next

00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
and uh for good reason it's right next
 

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,710
and uh for good reason it's right next
to our storage room oh

12
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
to our storage room oh
 

13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,470
to our storage room oh
it's a fine storage room we use this

14
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
it's a fine storage room we use this
 

15
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,310
it's a fine storage room we use this
thing all the time you know it's got a

16
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
thing all the time you know it's got a
 

17
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,150
thing all the time you know it's got a
little bit of everything in so we just

18
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
little bit of everything in so we just
 

19
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,990
little bit of everything in so we just
pick up a couple stacks of whatever we

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
pick up a couple stacks of whatever we
 

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,349
pick up a couple stacks of whatever we
need and we're on our way

22
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
need and we're on our way
 

23
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,750
need and we're on our way
well after this episode i'm hoping that

24
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
well after this episode i'm hoping that
 

25
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,990
well after this episode i'm hoping that
might change a little bit because we got

26
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
might change a little bit because we got
 

27
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,030
might change a little bit because we got
a couple plans for the nexus today

28
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
a couple plans for the nexus today
 

29
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,870
a couple plans for the nexus today
i know we're done with the nexus but

30
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
i know we're done with the nexus but
 

31
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,389
i know we're done with the nexus but
we're never done with the nexus

32
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
we're never done with the nexus
 

33
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,630
we're never done with the nexus
if you think about what the nexus is

34
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
if you think about what the nexus is
 

35
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,910
if you think about what the nexus is
what are its pros

36
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
what are its pros
 

37
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,750
what are its pros
well it's a massive storage room it's

38
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
well it's a massive storage room it's
 

39
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,750
well it's a massive storage room it's
got a lot of storage space

40
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
got a lot of storage space
 

41
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,270
got a lot of storage space
that's something the man cave storage

42
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
that's something the man cave storage
 

43
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,350
that's something the man cave storage
room doesn't really have i've been kind

44
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
room doesn't really have i've been kind
 

45
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,430
room doesn't really have i've been kind
of getting around it by keeping stuff

46
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
of getting around it by keeping stuff
 

47
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,869
of getting around it by keeping stuff
stored in shulker boxes uh which works

48
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
stored in shulker boxes uh which works
 

49
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,150
stored in shulker boxes uh which works
but uses up a lot of shulker boxes right

50
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
but uses up a lot of shulker boxes right
 

51
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,310
but uses up a lot of shulker boxes right
uh the other thing this does great is

52
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
uh the other thing this does great is
 

53
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,069
uh the other thing this does great is
it's got an auto sorting system and

54
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
it's got an auto sorting system and
 

55
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,389
it's got an auto sorting system and
retrieval system but what it really

56
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
retrieval system but what it really
 

57
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,189
retrieval system but what it really
lacks what the nexus fails at is being

58
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
lacks what the nexus fails at is being
 

59
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,710
lacks what the nexus fails at is being
able to come in here

60
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
able to come in here
 

61
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,109
able to come in here
pick up items quickly and then get out

62
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
pick up items quickly and then get out
 

63
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,870
pick up items quickly and then get out
so i was thinking about it and we

64
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
so i was thinking about it and we
 

65
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,870
so i was thinking about it and we
actually have the perfect thing

66
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
actually have the perfect thing
 

67
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,550
actually have the perfect thing
to cover that weakness now we're going

68
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
to cover that weakness now we're going
 

69
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,990
to cover that weakness now we're going
to be installing the

70
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
to be installing the
 

71
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,030
to be installing the
ender chest storage system

72
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
ender chest storage system
 

73
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,429
ender chest storage system
in these wings on each side of the nexus

74
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
in these wings on each side of the nexus
 

75
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,630
in these wings on each side of the nexus
you know we didn't really know what to

76
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
you know we didn't really know what to
 

77
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,590
you know we didn't really know what to
do with these rooms

78
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
do with these rooms
 

79
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,230
do with these rooms
we have an unfinished roof in here and i

80
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
we have an unfinished roof in here and i
 

81
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,749
we have an unfinished roof in here and i
thought it would be perfect because they

82
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
thought it would be perfect because they
 

83
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,390
thought it would be perfect because they
need to go

84
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
need to go
 

85
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,950
need to go
like in the roof so that's what we're

86
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
like in the roof so that's what we're
 

87
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,550
like in the roof so that's what we're
going to be doing and they allow us to

88
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
going to be doing and they allow us to
 

89
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,870
going to be doing and they allow us to
pick up a little bit of everything

90
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
pick up a little bit of everything
 

91
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,350
pick up a little bit of everything
not just quickly but automatically

92
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360

 

93
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,350

so we're gonna be placing a shocker box

94
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
so we're gonna be placing a shocker box
 

95
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,789
so we're gonna be placing a shocker box
loading station where each of these

96
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
loading station where each of these
 

97
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,469
loading station where each of these
netherrack are that's where the shocker

98
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
netherrack are that's where the shocker
 

99
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,990
netherrack are that's where the shocker
box is gonna be

100
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
box is gonna be
 

101
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,870
box is gonna be
and we place five hoppers facing into

102
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
and we place five hoppers facing into
 

103
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,389
and we place five hoppers facing into
the shulker box

104
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
the shulker box
 

105
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,830
the shulker box
of course each hopper holds five

106
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
of course each hopper holds five
 

107
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,830
of course each hopper holds five
different items so five times five

108
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
different items so five times five
 

109
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,469
different items so five times five
that's 25 different items

110
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
that's 25 different items
 

111
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,789
that's 25 different items
we can potentially automatically refill

112
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
we can potentially automatically refill
 

113
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,230
we can potentially automatically refill
into a shulker box and

114
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
into a shulker box and
 

115
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,670
into a shulker box and
they hold 27 different items so

116
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
they hold 27 different items so
 

117
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,590
they hold 27 different items so
it's just about perfect right there's

118
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
it's just about perfect right there's
 

119
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,789
it's just about perfect right there's
two items that

120
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
two items that
 

121
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,469
two items that
we use least often we're not going to be

122
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
we use least often we're not going to be
 

123
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,550
we use least often we're not going to be
able to automatically refill

124
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
able to automatically refill
 

125
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,949
able to automatically refill
but otherwise we can cover like every

126
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
but otherwise we can cover like every
 

127
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,470
but otherwise we can cover like every
item in the game

128
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
item in the game
 

129
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,630
item in the game
probably with 16 of these stations so

130
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
probably with 16 of these stations so
 

131
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,229
probably with 16 of these stations so
eight on this side eight on the other

132
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
eight on this side eight on the other
 

133
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,270
eight on this side eight on the other
side

134
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
side
 

135
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,790
side
and above each hopper we're going to

136
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
and above each hopper we're going to
 

137
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,550
and above each hopper we're going to
place a double chest to automatically

138
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
place a double chest to automatically
 

139
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,790
place a double chest to automatically
refill the hopper

140
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
refill the hopper
 

141
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,710
refill the hopper
and so we can have like quite a bit of

142
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
and so we can have like quite a bit of
 

143
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,229
and so we can have like quite a bit of
stock here actually

144
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
stock here actually
 

145
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,309
stock here actually
and there we go it's pretty much all set

146
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
and there we go it's pretty much all set
 

147
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,309
and there we go it's pretty much all set
up so the the tricky part of this is not

148
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
up so the the tricky part of this is not
 

149
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,190
up so the the tricky part of this is not
setting up the

150
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
setting up the
 

151
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,509
setting up the
storage system it's filling it that's

152
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
storage system it's filling it that's
 

153
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,949
storage system it's filling it that's
what's gonna take the most time here

154
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
what's gonna take the most time here
 

155
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,630
what's gonna take the most time here
now i'll probably be doing most of this

156
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
now i'll probably be doing most of this
 

157
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,470
now i'll probably be doing most of this
off camera but just to give you an idea

158
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
off camera but just to give you an idea
 

159
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,309
off camera but just to give you an idea
of what's involved in stocking that

160
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
of what's involved in stocking that
 

161
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,630
of what's involved in stocking that
thing

162
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
thing
 

163
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,190
thing
initially it's great when it's all done

164
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
initially it's great when it's all done
 

165
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,750
initially it's great when it's all done
it's gonna be

166
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
it's gonna be
 

167
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,670
it's gonna be
so amazing but to initially stock it

168
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
so amazing but to initially stock it
 

169
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,270
so amazing but to initially stock it
does take quite a bit of time we gotta

170
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
does take quite a bit of time we gotta
 

171
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,309
does take quite a bit of time we gotta
get like

172
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
get like
 

173
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,509
get like
12 stacks of each item in each category

174
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
12 stacks of each item in each category
 

175
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,630
12 stacks of each item in each category
so one category

176
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
so one category
 

177
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,550
so one category
another stuff we gotta get like 12

178
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
another stuff we gotta get like 12
 

179
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,790
another stuff we gotta get like 12
stacks of each of these things

180
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
stacks of each of these things
 

181
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,790
stacks of each of these things
so either we collect it from what we

182
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
so either we collect it from what we
 

183
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,670
so either we collect it from what we
have on hand or we gotta farm it

184
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
have on hand or we gotta farm it
 

185
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,350
have on hand or we gotta farm it
i'm sure we got some of those things but

186
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
i'm sure we got some of those things but
 

187
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,030
i'm sure we got some of those things but
we're gonna have to farm some of them as

188
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
we're gonna have to farm some of them as
 

189
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,750
we're gonna have to farm some of them as
well

190
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
well
 

191
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,350
well
what's in here actually let's check our

192
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
what's in here actually let's check our
 

193
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,790
what's in here actually let's check our
bulk storage i think this is all

194
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
bulk storage i think this is all
 

195
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,949
bulk storage i think this is all
pumpkins

196
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
pumpkins
 

197
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,790
pumpkins
oh actually yeah that's one of the

198
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
oh actually yeah that's one of the
 

199
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,149
oh actually yeah that's one of the
things we need

200
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
things we need
 

201
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,710
things we need
oh okay so we can easily get 12 stacks

202
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
oh okay so we can easily get 12 stacks
 

203
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,070
oh okay so we can easily get 12 stacks
of those no problem

204
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
of those no problem
 

205
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,309
of those no problem
let's check out what we got in here so

206
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
let's check out what we got in here so
 

207
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,910
let's check out what we got in here so
we have netherrack

208
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
we have netherrack
 

209
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,710
we have netherrack
uh let's see that's 12 stacks there good

210
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
uh let's see that's 12 stacks there good
 

211
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,509
uh let's see that's 12 stacks there good
good

212
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
good
 

213
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,830
good
this is a lot of moving stuff around too

214
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
this is a lot of moving stuff around too
 

215
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,670
this is a lot of moving stuff around too
uh looks like we got some of these not

216
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
uh looks like we got some of these not
 

217
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:31,990
uh looks like we got some of these not
quite

218
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
quite
 

219
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,830
quite
enough though and what's that snow

220
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
enough though and what's that snow
 

221
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,030
enough though and what's that snow
don't need to know we need the black

222
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
don't need to know we need the black
 

223
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,110
don't need to know we need the black
stone though 12 stacks of these

224
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
stone though 12 stacks of these
 

225
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,789
stone though 12 stacks of these
i think a lot of the nether stuff we

226
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
i think a lot of the nether stuff we
 

227
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,710
i think a lot of the nether stuff we
have in our piglin trading system so we

228
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
have in our piglin trading system so we
 

229
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,149
have in our piglin trading system so we
should check that out too

230
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
should check that out too
 

231
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,990
should check that out too
all right so we ran around a bit here

232
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
all right so we ran around a bit here
 

233
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,430
all right so we ran around a bit here
and we got some things to drop

234
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
and we got some things to drop
 

235
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,830
and we got some things to drop
off so now we got to pick one of these

236
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
off so now we got to pick one of these
 

237
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,550
off so now we got to pick one of these
stations

238
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
stations
 

239
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,630
stations
for the nether stuff so let's let's just

240
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
for the nether stuff so let's let's just
 

241
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,149
for the nether stuff so let's let's just
say this one here

242
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
say this one here
 

243
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,149
say this one here
and then i like to kind of group it into

244
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
and then i like to kind of group it into
 

245
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,309
and then i like to kind of group it into
things of five if i can as well

246
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
things of five if i can as well
 

247
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,949
things of five if i can as well
so if we look at this easily quartz can

248
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
so if we look at this easily quartz can
 

249
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,470
so if we look at this easily quartz can
go into a group of five the five

250
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
go into a group of five the five
 

251
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,910
go into a group of five the five
different types of quartz

252
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
different types of quartz
 

253
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,350
different types of quartz
five different types of black stone

254
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
five different types of black stone
 

255
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,350
five different types of black stone
should go into their own hopper

256
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
should go into their own hopper
 

257
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,030
should go into their own hopper
and then we just uh drop them in here

258
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040

 

259
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,710

like that and now we have somewhere to

260
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
like that and now we have somewhere to
 

261
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,710
like that and now we have somewhere to
actually unload the black stone we

262
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
actually unload the black stone we
 

263
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,670
actually unload the black stone we
collected

264
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
collected
 

265
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,909
collected
this is the crack stuff and then i'll

266
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
this is the crack stuff and then i'll
 

267
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,670
this is the crack stuff and then i'll
just make a line like this

268
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
just make a line like this
 

269
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,590
just make a line like this
and then fill her up

270
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600

 

271
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,749

and as much as i would love to get this

272
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
and as much as i would love to get this
 

273
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,350
and as much as i would love to get this
all finished today there's just no way

274
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
all finished today there's just no way
 

275
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,790
all finished today there's just no way
that's gonna happen there's so much to

276
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
that's gonna happen there's so much to
 

277
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,590
that's gonna happen there's so much to
do here

278
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
do here
 

279
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,070
do here
uh but we almost got the nether stuff

280
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
uh but we almost got the nether stuff
 

281
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,350
uh but we almost got the nether stuff
thing filled

282
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
thing filled
 

283
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,710
thing filled
this is also kind of good because it's

284
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
this is also kind of good because it's
 

285
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,870
this is also kind of good because it's
gonna show us weaknesses in our current

286
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
gonna show us weaknesses in our current
 

287
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,189
gonna show us weaknesses in our current
world like what items aren't we really

288
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
world like what items aren't we really
 

289
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,070
world like what items aren't we really
able to get

290
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
able to get
 

291
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,990
able to get
so i did go to the piglet trading system

292
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
so i did go to the piglet trading system
 

293
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,430
so i did go to the piglet trading system
and it was empty like

294
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
and it was empty like
 

295
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,030
and it was empty like
i've i've taken all the stuff out of

296
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
i've i've taken all the stuff out of
 

297
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,710
i've i've taken all the stuff out of
there previously i guess

298
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
there previously i guess
 

299
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,310
there previously i guess
so we don't have crying obsidian we

300
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
so we don't have crying obsidian we
 

301
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,390
so we don't have crying obsidian we
don't have blackstone at the moment

302
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
don't have blackstone at the moment
 

303
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,710
don't have blackstone at the moment
and quartz we gotta set up villager

304
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
and quartz we gotta set up villager
 

305
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,749
and quartz we gotta set up villager
trading for that

306
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
trading for that
 

307
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,670
trading for that
this is our total like quartz supply

308
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
this is our total like quartz supply
 

309
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,350
this is our total like quartz supply
right now so

310
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
right now so
 

311
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,990
right now so
it's pretty pathetic aha so even though

312
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
it's pretty pathetic aha so even though
 

313
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,830
it's pretty pathetic aha so even though
that's not fully loaded at the moment we

314
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
that's not fully loaded at the moment we
 

315
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,430
that's not fully loaded at the moment we
can still use it it's just kind of nice

316
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
can still use it it's just kind of nice
 

317
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,029
can still use it it's just kind of nice
to get 12 stacks of everything

318
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
to get 12 stacks of everything
 

319
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,790
to get 12 stacks of everything
to begin with it saves a lot of work so

320
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
to begin with it saves a lot of work so
 

321
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,710
to begin with it saves a lot of work so
if we want to top off our nether stuff

322
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
if we want to top off our nether stuff
 

323
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,629
if we want to top off our nether stuff
box we just go under here

324
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
box we just go under here
 

325
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,230
box we just go under here
and throw it in and now it's going to

326
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
and throw it in and now it's going to
 

327
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,230
and throw it in and now it's going to
automatically fill up with stuff

328
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
automatically fill up with stuff
 

329
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,350
automatically fill up with stuff
the other thing we're going to be doing

330
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
the other thing we're going to be doing
 

331
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,430
the other thing we're going to be doing
with the nexus though if we look

332
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
with the nexus though if we look
 

333
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,469
with the nexus though if we look
in what's what's being stored in there

334
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
in what's what's being stored in there
 

335
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,550
in what's what's being stored in there
honestly there's a lot of stuff we don't

336
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
honestly there's a lot of stuff we don't
 

337
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,469
honestly there's a lot of stuff we don't
need to store

338
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
need to store
 

339
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,189
need to store
here's a perfect example uh maybe when

340
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
here's a perfect example uh maybe when
 

341
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,350
here's a perfect example uh maybe when
uh the bundles come out i don't know but

342
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
uh the bundles come out i don't know but
 

343
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,749
uh the bundles come out i don't know but
like

344
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
like
 

345
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,390
like
leads rabbit hide yeah we probably don't

346
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
leads rabbit hide yeah we probably don't
 

347
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,670
leads rabbit hide yeah we probably don't
need to actually store that

348
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
need to actually store that
 

349
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,629
need to actually store that
there's probably zero in the system um

350
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
there's probably zero in the system um
 

351
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,189
there's probably zero in the system um
so

352
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
so
 

353
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,950
so
food as well probably we're gonna remove

354
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
food as well probably we're gonna remove
 

355
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,710
food as well probably we're gonna remove
that from the list and then we're gonna

356
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
that from the list and then we're gonna
 

357
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,270
that from the list and then we're gonna
add

358
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
add
 

359
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,870
add
some of the things we're missing in here

360
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
some of the things we're missing in here
 

361
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,029
some of the things we're missing in here
like we put this all together i think

362
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
like we put this all together i think
 

363
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,270
like we put this all together i think
back in 1.9 or something and there's so

364
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
back in 1.9 or something and there's so
 

365
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,110
back in 1.9 or something and there's so
many new blocks in the game

366
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
many new blocks in the game
 

367
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,189
many new blocks in the game
like pretty much everything in here

368
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
like pretty much everything in here
 

369
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,029
like pretty much everything in here
isn't being stored in the nexus so i

370
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
isn't being stored in the nexus so i
 

371
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,350
isn't being stored in the nexus so i
gotta go through the menu and like redo

372
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
gotta go through the menu and like redo
 

373
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,029
gotta go through the menu and like redo
all the item filters and stuff we have

374
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
all the item filters and stuff we have
 

375
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,870
all the item filters and stuff we have
so this will actually be more useful

376
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
so this will actually be more useful
 

377
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,029
so this will actually be more useful
okay well this is gonna be a bit tricky

378
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
okay well this is gonna be a bit tricky
 

379
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,870
okay well this is gonna be a bit tricky
i've been working it out here though and

380
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
i've been working it out here though and
 

381
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,230
i've been working it out here though and
i think we got a list

382
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
i think we got a list
 

383
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,150
i think we got a list
figured out this is the stuff i would

384
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
figured out this is the stuff i would
 

385
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,150
figured out this is the stuff i would
like to add to the nexus the things that

386
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
like to add to the nexus the things that
 

387
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,189
like to add to the nexus the things that
are missing

388
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
are missing
 

389
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,710
are missing
and it's uh it's uh oh we don't have

390
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
and it's uh it's uh oh we don't have
 

391
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,550
and it's uh it's uh oh we don't have
enough space

392
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
enough space
 

393
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,710
enough space
and we don't even have glazed terracotta

394
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
and we don't even have glazed terracotta
 

395
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,629
and we don't even have glazed terracotta
and concrete on that

396
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
and concrete on that
 

397
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,230
and concrete on that
um that would add another 48 items so

398
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
um that would add another 48 items so
 

399
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,749
um that would add another 48 items so
we're gonna have to make some sacrifices

400
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
we're gonna have to make some sacrifices
 

401
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,990
we're gonna have to make some sacrifices
here because we only have room for 256

402
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
here because we only have room for 256
 

403
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,909
here because we only have room for 256
different items now for some of these

404
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
different items now for some of these
 

405
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,990
different items now for some of these
like redstone for example

406
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
like redstone for example
 

407
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,350
like redstone for example
i've added in redstone blocks so rather

408
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
i've added in redstone blocks so rather
 

409
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,950
i've added in redstone blocks so rather
than just storing redstone dust we're

410
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
than just storing redstone dust we're
 

411
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,790
than just storing redstone dust we're
going to switch over to

412
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
going to switch over to
 

413
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,550
going to switch over to
redstone blocks because it's more

414
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
redstone blocks because it's more
 

415
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,110
redstone blocks because it's more
compact and same with a lot of other

416
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
compact and same with a lot of other
 

417
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,230
compact and same with a lot of other
things like

418
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
things like
 

419
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,909
things like
iron gold lapis coal emeralds

420
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
iron gold lapis coal emeralds
 

421
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,670
iron gold lapis coal emeralds
bone blocks you know rather than just

422
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
bone blocks you know rather than just
 

423
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,350
bone blocks you know rather than just
having i think we only have

424
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
having i think we only have
 

425
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,110
having i think we only have
an individual thing here we're going to

426
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
an individual thing here we're going to
 

427
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,390
an individual thing here we're going to
store it compressed because that makes

428
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
store it compressed because that makes
 

429
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,110
store it compressed because that makes
more sense

430
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
more sense
 

431
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,589
more sense
oh snappers all right well we've been at

432
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
oh snappers all right well we've been at
 

433
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,510
oh snappers all right well we've been at
this for a few hours now

434
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
this for a few hours now
 

435
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,350
this for a few hours now
and uh just doing the spring cleaning

436
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
and uh just doing the spring cleaning
 

437
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,629
and uh just doing the spring cleaning
you know things are starting to get

438
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
you know things are starting to get
 

439
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,150
you know things are starting to get
organized

440
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
organized
 

441
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,430
organized
it's like when you go to a restaurant

442
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
it's like when you go to a restaurant
 

443
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,189
it's like when you go to a restaurant
and they hand you the menu and and you

444
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
and they hand you the menu and and you
 

445
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,870
and they hand you the menu and and you
go to grab it and it's like oh there's

446
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
go to grab it and it's like oh there's
 

447
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,629
go to grab it and it's like oh there's
something sticky on here

448
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
something sticky on here
 

449
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,029
something sticky on here
some jam or something worse maybe even

450
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
some jam or something worse maybe even
 

451
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,629
some jam or something worse maybe even
oh it's so gross

452
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
oh it's so gross
 

453
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,390
oh it's so gross
why don't they watch the menus get new

454
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
why don't they watch the menus get new
 

455
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,110
why don't they watch the menus get new
menus well the nexus finally has a new

456
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
menus well the nexus finally has a new
 

457
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,629
menus well the nexus finally has a new
menu guys look at this

458
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
menu guys look at this
 

459
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,150
menu guys look at this
so uh got rid of all the useless stuff

460
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
so uh got rid of all the useless stuff
 

461
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,749
so uh got rid of all the useless stuff
well it's not useless but it's like

462
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
well it's not useless but it's like
 

463
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,350
well it's not useless but it's like
seldom used so we got rid of all the

464
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
seldom used so we got rid of all the
 

465
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,270
seldom used so we got rid of all the
stairs slabs fences

466
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
stairs slabs fences
 

467
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,990
stairs slabs fences
that uh we weren't really using before

468
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
that uh we weren't really using before
 

469
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,670
that uh we weren't really using before
by all the highly processed stuff we

470
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
by all the highly processed stuff we
 

471
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,830
by all the highly processed stuff we
don't need we got rid of planks

472
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
don't need we got rid of planks
 

473
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,790
don't need we got rid of planks
um just storing the logs instead and

474
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
um just storing the logs instead and
 

475
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,189
um just storing the logs instead and
like

476
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
like
 

477
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,189
like
detector rails activator rails we don't

478
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
detector rails activator rails we don't
 

479
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,390
detector rails activator rails we don't
need those stored

480
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
need those stored
 

481
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,029
need those stored
um so i tried to get the the more

482
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
um so i tried to get the the more
 

483
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,390
um so i tried to get the the more
useless stuff out of here

484
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,590
got most of our nether slabbed out now
and uh

648
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
and uh
 

649
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,829
and uh
yeah we just head down here we got an

650
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
yeah we just head down here we got an
 

651
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,509
yeah we just head down here we got an
auto sorting system for it and stuff

652
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
auto sorting system for it and stuff
 

653
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,190
auto sorting system for it and stuff
here as well

654
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
here as well
 

655
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,509
here as well
walk up to them smack them with the

656
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
walk up to them smack them with the
 

657
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,509
walk up to them smack them with the
sword and we get tons of bones tons of

658
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
sword and we get tons of bones tons of
 

659
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,150
sword and we get tons of bones tons of
gold

660
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
gold
 

661
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,069
gold
so we're gonna be starting a new project

662
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
so we're gonna be starting a new project
 

663
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,110
so we're gonna be starting a new project
today right next to this thing

664
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
today right next to this thing
 

665
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,350
today right next to this thing
we are going to be building a gold farm

666
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
we are going to be building a gold farm
 

667
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,509
we are going to be building a gold farm
whoa now before you guys freak out at me

668
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
whoa now before you guys freak out at me
 

669
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,389
whoa now before you guys freak out at me
and you're like etho

670
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
and you're like etho
 

671
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,230
and you're like etho
another gold farm what is that number

672
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
another gold farm what is that number
 

673
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,829
another gold farm what is that number
four number five

674
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
four number five
 

675
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,389
four number five
uh the truth is we really do need a a

676
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
uh the truth is we really do need a a
 

677
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,870
uh the truth is we really do need a a
gold farm though like this goon farm

678
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
gold farm though like this goon farm
 

679
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,790
gold farm though like this goon farm
is mostly just an iron farm we get a

680
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
is mostly just an iron farm we get a
 

681
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,790
is mostly just an iron farm we get a
trickle of gold from it but it hasn't

682
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
trickle of gold from it but it hasn't
 

683
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,110
trickle of gold from it but it hasn't
been

684
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
been
 

685
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,829
been
enough we can afk at it but i usually

686
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
enough we can afk at it but i usually
 

687
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,430
enough we can afk at it but i usually
don't like the apk in my world

688
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
don't like the apk in my world
 

689
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,389
don't like the apk in my world
so in general we're kind of running out

690
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
so in general we're kind of running out
 

691
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,190
so in general we're kind of running out
of gold

692
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
of gold
 

693
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,430
of gold
uh like even today to the to do that

694
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
uh like even today to the to do that
 

695
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,509
uh like even today to the to do that
villager thing we used like a stack of

696
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
villager thing we used like a stack of
 

697
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,470
villager thing we used like a stack of
uh

698
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
uh
 

699
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,590
uh
gold blocks and now we're out again

700
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
gold blocks and now we're out again
 

701
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,350
gold blocks and now we're out again
and i it's been like weeks of collecting

702
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
and i it's been like weeks of collecting
 

703
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,710
and i it's been like weeks of collecting
that so

704
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
that so
 

705
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,550
that so
the problem is all the gold farms we've

706
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
the problem is all the gold farms we've
 

707
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,990
the problem is all the gold farms we've
got we have operational

708
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
got we have operational
 

709
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,550
got we have operational
are above the bedrock ceiling and the

710
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
are above the bedrock ceiling and the
 

711
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,230
are above the bedrock ceiling and the
higher you place a mob farm in your

712
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
higher you place a mob farm in your
 

713
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,310
higher you place a mob farm in your
world the worse your rates are because

714
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
world the worse your rates are because
 

715
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,069
world the worse your rates are because
if it's trying to place

716
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
if it's trying to place
 

717
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,910
if it's trying to place
a mob like spawn a mob up at the

718
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
a mob like spawn a mob up at the
 

719
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,750
a mob like spawn a mob up at the
platform there it checks all the air

720
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
platform there it checks all the air
 

721
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,949
platform there it checks all the air
space below

722
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
space below
 

723
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,550
space below
that and tries to place mobs there as

724
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
that and tries to place mobs there as
 

725
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,670
that and tries to place mobs there as
well and most of the time it's going to

726
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
well and most of the time it's going to
 

727
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,470
well and most of the time it's going to
fail so you very rarely actually get

728
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
fail so you very rarely actually get
 

729
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,470
fail so you very rarely actually get
a mob spawning there but if you build a

730
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
a mob spawning there but if you build a
 

731
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,310
a mob spawning there but if you build a
farm under the ceiling it's a little bit

732
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
farm under the ceiling it's a little bit
 

733
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,430
farm under the ceiling it's a little bit
more tricky

734
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
more tricky
 

735
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,670
more tricky
you gotta like spawn proof your nether

736
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
you gotta like spawn proof your nether
 

737
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,949
you gotta like spawn proof your nether
if you do that

738
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
if you do that
 

739
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,030
if you do that
um you'll get better rates though the

740
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
um you'll get better rates though the
 

741
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,870
um you'll get better rates though the
ultimate is to remove the bedrock

742
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
ultimate is to remove the bedrock
 

743
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,389
ultimate is to remove the bedrock
ceiling and build it way down at the

744
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
ceiling and build it way down at the
 

745
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,590
ceiling and build it way down at the
bottom of the world

746
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
bottom of the world
 

747
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,910
bottom of the world
but that is like very tricky and i don't

748
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
but that is like very tricky and i don't
 

749
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,670
but that is like very tricky and i don't
have the energy for that today

750
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
have the energy for that today
 

751
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,910
have the energy for that today
so the plan is to build it right next to

752
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
so the plan is to build it right next to
 

753
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,829
so the plan is to build it right next to
our wither skeleton farm here like

754
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
our wither skeleton farm here like
 

755
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,509
our wither skeleton farm here like
right over here is going to be the

756
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
right over here is going to be the
 

757
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,670
right over here is going to be the
killing chamber hopefully

758
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
killing chamber hopefully
 

759
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,750
killing chamber hopefully
and then we can kind of use both of them

760
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
and then we can kind of use both of them
 

761
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,949
and then we can kind of use both of them
at the same time

762
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
at the same time
 

763
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,269
at the same time
maybe but we'll see we'll add like on

764
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
maybe but we'll see we'll add like on
 

765
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,110
maybe but we'll see we'll add like on
off switches to both of them as well

766
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
off switches to both of them as well
 

767
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,629
off switches to both of them as well
all right well i guess let's get into

768
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
all right well i guess let's get into
 

769
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,389
all right well i guess let's get into
building this thing so i did bring some

770
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
building this thing so i did bring some
 

771
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,389
building this thing so i did bring some
supplies over we got some glass from

772
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
supplies over we got some glass from
 

773
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,470
supplies over we got some glass from
those villagers so i didn't have to

774
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
those villagers so i didn't have to
 

775
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,190
those villagers so i didn't have to
farm sand or anything that was nice and

776
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
farm sand or anything that was nice and
 

777
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,590
farm sand or anything that was nice and
i

778
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
i
 

779
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,430
i
got a bunch of magma blocks back when we

780
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
got a bunch of magma blocks back when we
 

781
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,150
got a bunch of magma blocks back when we
were filling the nexus up there

782
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
were filling the nexus up there
 

783
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,069
were filling the nexus up there
so i think we have pretty much

784
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
so i think we have pretty much
 

785
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,190
so i think we have pretty much
everything we need

786
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
everything we need
 

787
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,870
everything we need
now we want to build this gold farm as

788
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
now we want to build this gold farm as
 

789
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,870
now we want to build this gold farm as
close to the wither skeleton farm as

790
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
close to the wither skeleton farm as
 

791
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,910
close to the wither skeleton farm as
possible

792
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
possible
 

793
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,670
possible
so it's convenient but we also don't

794
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
so it's convenient but we also don't
 

795
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,910
so it's convenient but we also don't
want it to interfere with each other so

796
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
want it to interfere with each other so
 

797
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,069
want it to interfere with each other so
the way their skeleton spawning pad

798
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
the way their skeleton spawning pad
 

799
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,550
the way their skeleton spawning pad
is at the dirt there we're gonna go four

800
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
is at the dirt there we're gonna go four
 

801
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,110
is at the dirt there we're gonna go four
blocks

802
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
blocks
 

803
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,350
blocks
from that and uh we're gonna build the

804
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
from that and uh we're gonna build the
 

805
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,870
from that and uh we're gonna build the
killing chamber first it's gonna be a

806
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:14,880
killing chamber first it's gonna be a
 

807
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,790
killing chamber first it's gonna be a
bit confusing until we

808
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
bit confusing until we
 

809
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,829
bit confusing until we
uh actually get the whole thing done

810
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
uh actually get the whole thing done
 

811
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,990
uh actually get the whole thing done
probably

812
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
probably
 

813
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,350
probably
but i think this is going to be our ring

814
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
but i think this is going to be our ring
 

815
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,870
but i think this is going to be our ring
we're going to try drop the pig lens

816
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
we're going to try drop the pig lens
 

817
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,790
we're going to try drop the pig lens
into a three by three area

818
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
into a three by three area
 

819
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,069
into a three by three area
and then over here will be three pistons

820
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
and then over here will be three pistons
 

821
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,590
and then over here will be three pistons
to collect the drops together

822
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
to collect the drops together
 

823
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,710
to collect the drops together
into the middle we're going to try to

824
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
into the middle we're going to try to
 

825
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,190
into the middle we're going to try to
get it all into a one by one area

826
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
get it all into a one by one area
 

827
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,430
get it all into a one by one area
then we'll have a piston on the side

828
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
then we'll have a piston on the side
 

829
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,310
then we'll have a piston on the side
here

830
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
here
 

831
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,069
here
and a piston over here and

832
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
and a piston over here and
 

833
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,310
and a piston over here and
then let's get three more on this side

834
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
then let's get three more on this side
 

835
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,069
then let's get three more on this side
and i think that will push all the drops

836
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
and i think that will push all the drops
 

837
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,430
and i think that will push all the drops
to the center then

838
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
to the center then
 

839
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,710
to the center then
so yeah we're gonna build a bunch of

840
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
so yeah we're gonna build a bunch of
 

841
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,710
so yeah we're gonna build a bunch of
spawning platforms up above here

842
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
spawning platforms up above here
 

843
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,389
spawning platforms up above here
for the piglens to drop down and we'll

844
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
for the piglens to drop down and we'll
 

845
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,550
for the piglens to drop down and we'll
drop them into the three by three area

846
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
drop them into the three by three area
 

847
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,110
drop them into the three by three area
onto hay bales hey bales reduce fall

848
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
onto hay bales hey bales reduce fall
 

849
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,910
onto hay bales hey bales reduce fall
damage

850
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
damage
 

851
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,949
damage
so they will hopefully not die from the

852
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
so they will hopefully not die from the
 

853
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,389
so they will hopefully not die from the
drop we're gonna want to kill them with

854
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
drop we're gonna want to kill them with
 

855
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,189
drop we're gonna want to kill them with
looting

856
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
looting
 

857
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,710
looting
is the idea behind this whole farm we're

858
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
is the idea behind this whole farm we're
 

859
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,629
is the idea behind this whole farm we're
not going to make an afk farm

860
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
not going to make an afk farm
 

861
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,150
not going to make an afk farm
uh we want to use the looting sword so

862
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
uh we want to use the looting sword so
 

863
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,069
uh we want to use the looting sword so
they actually drop the gold ingots and

864
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
they actually drop the gold ingots and
 

865
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,110
they actually drop the gold ingots and
we'll be able to get gold

866
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
we'll be able to get gold
 

867
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,189
we'll be able to get gold
very quickly from this i just went ahead

868
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
very quickly from this i just went ahead
 

869
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,470
very quickly from this i just went ahead
and placed a bunch of blocks here so we

870
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
and placed a bunch of blocks here so we
 

871
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,870
and placed a bunch of blocks here so we
could do the redstone quickly together

872
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
could do the redstone quickly together
 

873
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,949
could do the redstone quickly together
idea is we're gonna try trigger these

874
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
idea is we're gonna try trigger these
 

875
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,110
idea is we're gonna try trigger these
three pistons and those three pistons

876
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
three pistons and those three pistons
 

877
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,590
three pistons and those three pistons
first together and then we'll trigger

878
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
first together and then we'll trigger
 

879
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,829
first together and then we'll trigger
these two side ones afterwards

880
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
these two side ones afterwards
 

881
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,990
these two side ones afterwards
um so the drops will get collected over

882
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
um so the drops will get collected over
 

883
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,990
um so the drops will get collected over
here and here and then push to the

884
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
here and here and then push to the
 

885
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,870
here and here and then push to the
center

886
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
center
 

887
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,030
center
um so to do that we want a little bit

888
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
um so to do that we want a little bit
 

889
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,710
um so to do that we want a little bit
extra delay on the side pistons we'll go

890
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
extra delay on the side pistons we'll go
 

891
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,670
extra delay on the side pistons we'll go
for three ticks

892
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
for three ticks
 

893
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,069
for three ticks
these ones will be a one tick and same

894
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
these ones will be a one tick and same
 

895
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:36,949
these ones will be a one tick and same
deal over here

896
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
deal over here
 

897
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,910
deal over here
three ticks and then we run redstone all

898
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
three ticks and then we run redstone all
 

899
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,189
three ticks and then we run redstone all
combined together here

900
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
combined together here
 

901
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,790
combined together here
down here oop run underneath over to

902
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
down here oop run underneath over to
 

903
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,069
down here oop run underneath over to
here to the other side

904
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
here to the other side
 

905
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,590
here to the other side
and i'm trapped uh oh that wasn't in the

906
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
and i'm trapped uh oh that wasn't in the
 

907
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,629
and i'm trapped uh oh that wasn't in the
plan

908
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
plan
 

909
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,790
plan
oh i almost fell in the lava there run

910
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
oh i almost fell in the lava there run
 

911
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,269
oh i almost fell in the lava there run
it around and then again three more

912
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
it around and then again three more
 

913
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,350
it around and then again three more
pistons to the back here so now in the

914
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
pistons to the back here so now in the
 

915
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,710
pistons to the back here so now in the
the redstone gets triggered all the

916
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
the redstone gets triggered all the
 

917
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,629
the redstone gets triggered all the
pistons will go together

918
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
pistons will go together
 

919
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,629
pistons will go together
oh i missed the piece there okay all

920
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
oh i missed the piece there okay all
 

921
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,310
oh i missed the piece there okay all
good and then uh over

922
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
good and then uh over
 

923
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,670
good and then uh over
down here uh what we're gonna do is i

924
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
down here uh what we're gonna do is i
 

925
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:07,990
down here uh what we're gonna do is i
think

926
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
think
 

927
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,389
think
two ticks we'll have a sticky piston

928
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
two ticks we'll have a sticky piston
 

929
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,470
two ticks we'll have a sticky piston
over here and the drops are going to be

930
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
over here and the drops are going to be
 

931
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,990
over here and the drops are going to be
falling here right so we're going to

932
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
falling here right so we're going to
 

933
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,269
falling here right so we're going to
drop them onto an

934
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
drop them onto an
 

935
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,910
drop them onto an
ender chest because ender chests don't

936
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
ender chest because ender chests don't
 

937
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,189
ender chest because ender chests don't
get moved by uh

938
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
get moved by uh
 

939
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,550
get moved by uh
slime blocks or honey blocks um

940
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
slime blocks or honey blocks um
 

941
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,030
slime blocks or honey blocks um
here we go all right so our items are

942
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
here we go all right so our items are
 

943
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,389
here we go all right so our items are
gonna fall on the the ender chest and

944
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
gonna fall on the the ender chest and
 

945
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,710
gonna fall on the the ender chest and
then we're gonna push them with honey

946
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720

 

947
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,389

so after the honey block pushes the

948
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
so after the honey block pushes the
 

949
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,990
so after the honey block pushes the
items off the ender chest here we're

950
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
items off the ender chest here we're
 

951
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,829
items off the ender chest here we're
gonna have another sticky piston with a

952
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
gonna have another sticky piston with a
 

953
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,189
gonna have another sticky piston with a
slime block

954
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
slime block
 

955
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,910
slime block
i think down here is where we want it

956
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
i think down here is where we want it
 

957
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,430
i think down here is where we want it
and that'll push them

958
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
and that'll push them
 

959
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,189
and that'll push them
down an ice path or something into our

960
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
down an ice path or something into our
 

961
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,030
down an ice path or something into our
item filters all right well if the

962
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
item filters all right well if the
 

963
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,790
item filters all right well if the
piston noises weren't bad enough before

964
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
piston noises weren't bad enough before
 

965
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,470
piston noises weren't bad enough before
we're going to be adding a few more here

966
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
we're going to be adding a few more here
 

967
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,389
we're going to be adding a few more here
so i built a hopper clock right next to

968
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
so i built a hopper clock right next to
 

969
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,230
so i built a hopper clock right next to
this thing and we're gonna connect it up

970
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
this thing and we're gonna connect it up
 

971
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,350
this thing and we're gonna connect it up
we got eight items inside there and

972
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
we got eight items inside there and
 

973
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,949
we got eight items inside there and
we'll have a redstone torch on the side

974
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
we'll have a redstone torch on the side
 

975
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,389
we'll have a redstone torch on the side
you see that pulses every time it

976
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
you see that pulses every time it
 

977
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,069
you see that pulses every time it
triggers

978
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
triggers
 

979
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,230
triggers
i i guess every second time yeah and

980
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
i i guess every second time yeah and
 

981
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,870
i i guess every second time yeah and
then uh we'll go to observer

982
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
then uh we'll go to observer
 

983
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,990
then uh we'll go to observer
and now these should start firing there

984
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
and now these should start firing there
 

985
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,710
and now these should start firing there
we go

986
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
we go
 

987
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,749
we go
and now any items on the three by three

988
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
and now any items on the three by three
 

989
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,269
and now any items on the three by three
area here should get combined together

990
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
area here should get combined together
 

991
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,710
area here should get combined together
and drop down the center

992
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
and drop down the center
 

993
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,710
and drop down the center
onto our ender chest and then they'll

994
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
onto our ender chest and then they'll
 

995
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,829
onto our ender chest and then they'll
get moved by the honey block on the next

996
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
get moved by the honey block on the next
 

997
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,790
get moved by the honey block on the next
cycle

998
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
cycle
 

999
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,910
cycle
if it actually worked oh no

1000
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
if it actually worked oh no
 

1001
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,790
if it actually worked oh no
what's wrong why are you no pushing oh i

1002
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
what's wrong why are you no pushing oh i
 

1003
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,150
what's wrong why are you no pushing oh i
left a glass block underneath yeah you

1004
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
left a glass block underneath yeah you
 

1005
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,350
left a glass block underneath yeah you
got to make sure nothing's sticking to

1006
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
got to make sure nothing's sticking to
 

1007
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,870
got to make sure nothing's sticking to
it i'll probably have to put the glazed

1008
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
it i'll probably have to put the glazed
 

1009
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,389
it i'll probably have to put the glazed
terracotta next to it oh you

1010
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
terracotta next to it oh you
 

1011
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,150
terracotta next to it oh you
saw it get the shot into the lava there

1012
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
saw it get the shot into the lava there
 

1013
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,670
saw it get the shot into the lava there
though so that'll be

1014
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
though so that'll be
 

1015
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,990
though so that'll be
for the future we'll we'll set that up

1016
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
for the future we'll we'll set that up
 

1017
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,189
for the future we'll we'll set that up
uh whoa

1018
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
uh whoa
 

1019
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,670
uh whoa
for now let's just work on the platforms

1020
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
for now let's just work on the platforms
 

1021
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,870
for now let's just work on the platforms
next

1022
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
next
 

1023
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,910
next
uh oh yeah and also

1024
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
uh oh yeah and also
 

1025
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,749
uh oh yeah and also
i think we're gonna have a column of

1026
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
i think we're gonna have a column of
 

1027
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,749
i think we're gonna have a column of
glass down the center like built all the

1028
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
glass down the center like built all the
 

1029
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,350
glass down the center like built all the
way up

1030
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
way up
 

1031
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,749
way up
glass in the center glass on the sides

1032
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
glass in the center glass on the sides
 

1033
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,710
glass in the center glass on the sides
in the very

1034
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
in the very
 

1035
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,350
in the very
center we got to make sure baby piglets

1036
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
center we got to make sure baby piglets
 

1037
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,949
center we got to make sure baby piglets
don't fall down there

1038
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
don't fall down there
 

1039
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,390
don't fall down there
so we're gonna try sneaking and rod

1040
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
so we're gonna try sneaking and rod
 

1041
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,990
so we're gonna try sneaking and rod
and items should be able to fit between

1042
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
and items should be able to fit between
 

1043
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,829
and items should be able to fit between
that still but the baby big ones won't

1044
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
that still but the baby big ones won't
 

1045
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,510
that still but the baby big ones won't
and it also gives a little bit of extra

1046
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
and it also gives a little bit of extra
 

1047
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,270
and it also gives a little bit of extra
lighting oh wait a second one other

1048
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
lighting oh wait a second one other
 

1049
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,870
lighting oh wait a second one other
thing i forgot about we also have to be

1050
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
thing i forgot about we also have to be
 

1051
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,230
thing i forgot about we also have to be
able to kill them right so we're gonna

1052
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
able to kill them right so we're gonna
 

1053
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,150
able to kill them right so we're gonna
leave a one by one hole here

1054
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
leave a one by one hole here
 

1055
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,429
leave a one by one hole here
uh and then we're gonna carpet over this

1056
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
uh and then we're gonna carpet over this
 

1057
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,069
uh and then we're gonna carpet over this
try hide our redstone if we can uh and

1058
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
try hide our redstone if we can uh and
 

1059
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,590
try hide our redstone if we can uh and
then we'll just like go in

1060
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
then we'll just like go in
 

1061
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,590
then we'll just like go in
like this and swing our sword at the the

1062
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
like this and swing our sword at the the
 

1063
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,590
like this and swing our sword at the the
pigment in here okay so next up here

1064
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
pigment in here okay so next up here
 

1065
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,270
pigment in here okay so next up here
we're gonna be building this glass tube

1066
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
we're gonna be building this glass tube
 

1067
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,070
we're gonna be building this glass tube
24 blocks up because mobs can't spawn

1068
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
24 blocks up because mobs can't spawn
 

1069
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,909
24 blocks up because mobs can't spawn
within 24 blocks of your player

1070
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
within 24 blocks of your player
 

1071
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,750
within 24 blocks of your player
cool cool so we got our tube built and

1072
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
cool cool so we got our tube built and
 

1073
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,830
cool cool so we got our tube built and
now we're gonna fill the space between

1074
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
now we're gonna fill the space between
 

1075
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,150
now we're gonna fill the space between
the top of our tube and the ceiling

1076
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
the top of our tube and the ceiling
 

1077
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,549
the top of our tube and the ceiling
with magma block platforms for spawning

1078
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
with magma block platforms for spawning
 

1079
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,590
with magma block platforms for spawning
in the zombie pigmen

1080
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
in the zombie pigmen
 

1081
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,750
in the zombie pigmen
so i decided let's go to the top of this

1082
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
so i decided let's go to the top of this
 

1083
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,950
so i decided let's go to the top of this
first

1084
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
first
 

1085
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,909
first
all the way up to the ceiling and this

1086
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
all the way up to the ceiling and this
 

1087
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,590
all the way up to the ceiling and this
is the pattern i'm going to go for it

1088
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
is the pattern i'm going to go for it
 

1089
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,590
is the pattern i'm going to go for it
doesn't really matter too much the shape

1090
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
doesn't really matter too much the shape
 

1091
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,029
doesn't really matter too much the shape
and whatever you do but i like this

1092
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039
and whatever you do but i like this
 

1093
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,430
and whatever you do but i like this
pattern because we can put

1094
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
pattern because we can put
 

1095
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,150
pattern because we can put
dispensers above these holes and drop

1096
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
dispensers above these holes and drop
 

1097
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,909
dispensers above these holes and drop
lava down to light up the platform

1098
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
lava down to light up the platform
 

1099
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,950
lava down to light up the platform
enough where

1100
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
enough where
 

1101
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,710
enough where
zombie pigmen won't be able to spawn and

1102
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
zombie pigmen won't be able to spawn and
 

1103
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,830
zombie pigmen won't be able to spawn and
then you can have an on off switch for

1104
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840

 

1105
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,150

it

1106
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160

 

1107
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,070

oh snap okay so there's one thing we

1108
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
oh snap okay so there's one thing we
 

1109
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,830
oh snap okay so there's one thing we
don't have that we got to get here still

1110
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
don't have that we got to get here still
 

1111
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,990
don't have that we got to get here still
uh turtle eggs we need turtle eggs for

1112
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
uh turtle eggs we need turtle eggs for
 

1113
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,390
uh turtle eggs we need turtle eggs for
the zombie pigmen to chase

1114
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
the zombie pigmen to chase
 

1115
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,870
the zombie pigmen to chase
they're pretty easy to get it i'm not

1116
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
they're pretty easy to get it i'm not
 

1117
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,549
they're pretty easy to get it i'm not
mistaken so you you beat them to sea

1118
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
mistaken so you you beat them to sea
 

1119
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,909
mistaken so you you beat them to sea
grass

1120
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919
grass
 

1121
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,430
grass
they scoot around on the beach for a

1122
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
they scoot around on the beach for a
 

1123
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,990
they scoot around on the beach for a
little bit

1124
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000

 

1125
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,070

there we go yes okay we got some turtle

1126
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
there we go yes okay we got some turtle
 

1127
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,830
there we go yes okay we got some turtle
eggs and then you can just feed them

1128
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
eggs and then you can just feed them
 

1129
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,909
eggs and then you can just feed them
again i think

1130
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
again i think
 

1131
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,549
again i think
like right away and steal these ones

1132
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
like right away and steal these ones
 

1133
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,830
like right away and steal these ones
it's a great system

1134
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840

 

1135
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,350

you know what this is actually a pretty

1136
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
you know what this is actually a pretty
 

1137
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,590
you know what this is actually a pretty
big project

1138
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
big project
 

1139
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,029
big project
it's one of those ones it's like oh i

1140
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
it's one of those ones it's like oh i
 

1141
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,310
it's one of those ones it's like oh i
just got to build a bunch of platforms

1142
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
just got to build a bunch of platforms
 

1143
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,270
just got to build a bunch of platforms
how hard could that be

1144
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
how hard could that be
 

1145
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,350
how hard could that be
right well i ended up mining a bunch of

1146
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
right well i ended up mining a bunch of
 

1147
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,789
right well i ended up mining a bunch of
space around the platform and the

1148
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
space around the platform and the
 

1149
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,510
space around the platform and the
ceiling there five blocks out all around

1150
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
ceiling there five blocks out all around
 

1151
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,909
ceiling there five blocks out all around
and then uh even though it's a simple

1152
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
and then uh even though it's a simple
 

1153
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,870
and then uh even though it's a simple
repeating pattern

1154
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
repeating pattern
 

1155
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,870
repeating pattern
it's just a lot of blocks to place when

1156
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
it's just a lot of blocks to place when
 

1157
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,310
it's just a lot of blocks to place when
it comes down to it

1158
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
it comes down to it
 

1159
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,990
it comes down to it
so we just got this center thing to

1160
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
so we just got this center thing to
 

1161
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,830
so we just got this center thing to
finish up and then it's done

1162
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
finish up and then it's done
 

1163
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,789
finish up and then it's done
so i think we got about 20 platforms in

1164
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
so i think we got about 20 platforms in
 

1165
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,909
so i think we got about 20 platforms in
total though i think we're going to

1166
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
total though i think we're going to
 

1167
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,350
total though i think we're going to
start the trapdoors

1168
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
start the trapdoors
 

1169
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,390
start the trapdoors
here and then we just hop on and stack

1170
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
here and then we just hop on and stack
 

1171
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,870
here and then we just hop on and stack
up to the top oh we're at the top okay

1172
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
up to the top oh we're at the top okay
 

1173
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,590
up to the top oh we're at the top okay
here's the fun part now

1174
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
here's the fun part now
 

1175
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,470
here's the fun part now
i love doing this oh this is so

1176
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
i love doing this oh this is so
 

1177
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,870
i love doing this oh this is so
satisfying i don't know why

1178
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
satisfying i don't know why
 

1179
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,950
satisfying i don't know why
good stuff so we got the trapdoors all

1180
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
good stuff so we got the trapdoors all
 

1181
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,310
good stuff so we got the trapdoors all
the way up the center now

1182
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
the way up the center now
 

1183
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,190
the way up the center now
on all four sides these trick the zombie

1184
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
on all four sides these trick the zombie
 

1185
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,070
on all four sides these trick the zombie
pigmen into

1186
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
pigmen into
 

1187
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,070
pigmen into
walking off the edge here and they also

1188
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
walking off the edge here and they also
 

1189
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,909
walking off the edge here and they also
protect the eggs

1190
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
protect the eggs
 

1191
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,270
protect the eggs
um making sure nobody can get to them

1192
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
um making sure nobody can get to them
 

1193
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,110
um making sure nobody can get to them
so the other thing we gotta do now is

1194
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
so the other thing we gotta do now is
 

1195
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,710
so the other thing we gotta do now is
just put the eggs in so we're at the top

1196
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
just put the eggs in so we're at the top
 

1197
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,230
just put the eggs in so we're at the top
of the ceiling

1198
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
of the ceiling
 

1199
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,630
of the ceiling
you can skip every other platform so

1200
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
you can skip every other platform so
 

1201
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,230
you can skip every other platform so
we're gonna go go down one

1202
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
we're gonna go go down one
 

1203
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,350
we're gonna go go down one
and you wanna place them at the

1204
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
and you wanna place them at the
 

1205
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,870
and you wanna place them at the
head level so i'm gonna put a glass

1206
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
head level so i'm gonna put a glass
 

1207
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,470
head level so i'm gonna put a glass
block here and then

1208
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
block here and then
 

1209
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,430
block here and then
one egg over here and now the the

1210
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440
one egg over here and now the the
 

1211
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,350
one egg over here and now the the
platform above this platform

1212
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
platform above this platform
 

1213
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,590
platform above this platform
i think they all can see that egg then

1214
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
i think they all can see that egg then
 

1215
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,110
i think they all can see that egg then
we can go down

1216
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120

 

1217
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,549

oh yeah by the way if you if you're

1218
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
oh yeah by the way if you if you're
 

1219
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,909
oh yeah by the way if you if you're
walking on magma blocks you can use a

1220
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:19,919
walking on magma blocks you can use a
 

1221
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,350
walking on magma blocks you can use a
fire resistant potion

1222
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
fire resistant potion
 

1223
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,710
fire resistant potion
old shift or frost walker to stop taking

1224
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
old shift or frost walker to stop taking
 

1225
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,430
old shift or frost walker to stop taking
damage

1226
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
damage
 

1227
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,430
damage
so we're gonna skip this platform or go

1228
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
so we're gonna skip this platform or go
 

1229
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,470
so we're gonna skip this platform or go
go down another one

1230
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480

 

1231
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,230

i can carefully light your wings help

1232
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
i can carefully light your wings help
 

1233
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,909
i can carefully light your wings help
out a lot here and then we're gonna do

1234
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
out a lot here and then we're gonna do
 

1235
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,590
out a lot here and then we're gonna do
another one over here head level again

1236
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
another one over here head level again
 

1237
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,750
another one over here head level again
and then they should see that pretty

1238
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
and then they should see that pretty
 

1239
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,990
and then they should see that pretty
pretty quickly yeah there they go

1240
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
pretty quickly yeah there they go
 

1241
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,590
pretty quickly yeah there they go
bunch of fools oh snappers all right we

1242
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
bunch of fools oh snappers all right we
 

1243
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,270
bunch of fools oh snappers all right we
got it pretty much all done here we just

1244
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
got it pretty much all done here we just
 

1245
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,549
got it pretty much all done here we just
got to do the

1246
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
got to do the
 

1247
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,029
got to do the
uh sorting system in that for it's the

1248
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
uh sorting system in that for it's the
 

1249
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,990
uh sorting system in that for it's the
collection system

1250
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
collection system
 

1251
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,549
collection system
but everything else is working we did

1252
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
but everything else is working we did
 

1253
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,669
but everything else is working we did
add uh

1254
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
add uh
 

1255
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,510
add uh
an on off switch for the wither skeleton

1256
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
an on off switch for the wither skeleton
 

1257
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,270
an on off switch for the wither skeleton
farm so it's off right now

1258
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
farm so it's off right now
 

1259
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,270
farm so it's off right now
we just have lava pouring down and

1260
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
we just have lava pouring down and
 

1261
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,149
we just have lava pouring down and
lighting up the layers there

1262
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
lighting up the layers there
 

1263
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,070
lighting up the layers there
this is a bit of a mess at the moment

1264
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080

 

1265
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,110

but uh it's working pretty good

1266
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
but uh it's working pretty good
 

1267
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,029
but uh it's working pretty good
so we just stand here smack them with

1268
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
so we just stand here smack them with
 

1269
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,630
so we just stand here smack them with
the sword and they fall down at a pretty

1270
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
the sword and they fall down at a pretty
 

1271
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,390
the sword and they fall down at a pretty
good rate

1272
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
good rate
 

1273
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,909
good rate
they're all pretty much a one hit kill

1274
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
they're all pretty much a one hit kill
 

1275
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,669
they're all pretty much a one hit kill
with our sword

1276
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
with our sword
 

1277
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,070
with our sword
and as far as i can tell none of them

1278
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
and as far as i can tell none of them
 

1279
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,430
and as far as i can tell none of them
are getting stuck on the platform up

1280
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
are getting stuck on the platform up
 

1281
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,070
are getting stuck on the platform up
there which is

1282
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
there which is
 

1283
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,270
there which is
which is awesome now we have one little

1284
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
which is awesome now we have one little
 

1285
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,590
which is awesome now we have one little
problem to work out

1286
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
problem to work out
 

1287
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,270
problem to work out

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
it turns out the baby
 

1289
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,029
it turns out the baby
pigmen can still fit through that middle

00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
pigmen can still fit through that middle
 

1291
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,110
pigmen can still fit through that middle
middle uh end rod right i switched out

1292
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
middle uh end rod right i switched out
 

1293
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,549
middle uh end rod right i switched out
with a chain because i kept actually

1294
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
with a chain because i kept actually
 

1295
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,230
with a chain because i kept actually
hitting it

1296
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
hitting it
 

1297
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,669
hitting it
um yeah we're getting good rates

1298
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
um yeah we're getting good rates
 

1299
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,110
um yeah we're getting good rates
so i'm pretty happy with that we can

1300
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
so i'm pretty happy with that we can
 

1301
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,870
so i'm pretty happy with that we can
stand here and get xp

1302
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
stand here and get xp
 

1303
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,430
stand here and get xp
no problem but the thing is the the

1304
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
no problem but the thing is the the
 

1305
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,830
no problem but the thing is the the
little guys are getting through

1306
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840

 

1307
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,390

and well

1308
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400

 

1309
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,390

yeah i don't know what to do about them

1310
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
yeah i don't know what to do about them
 

1311
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,909
yeah i don't know what to do about them
i think it might because all the piston

1312
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
i think it might because all the piston
 

1313
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,590
i think it might because all the piston
heads are extended at the same time

1314
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
heads are extended at the same time
 

1315
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,190
heads are extended at the same time
maybe if we

1316
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
maybe if we
 

1317
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,789
maybe if we
alternate them a little bit we won't

1318
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
alternate them a little bit we won't
 

1319
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,950
alternate them a little bit we won't
have this the issue

1320
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960

 

1321
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,990

like we set these repeaters all the way

1322
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
like we set these repeaters all the way
 

1323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,950
like we set these repeaters all the way
to eight or something

1324
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
to eight or something
 

1325
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,430
to eight or something
and maybe it'll stop squeezing through

1326
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440

 

1327
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,789

currently my best idea um let's kill

1328
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
currently my best idea um let's kill
 

1329
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,149
currently my best idea um let's kill
these guys

1330
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
these guys
 

1331
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,070
these guys
it is like non-stop picking up all the

1332
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
it is like non-stop picking up all the
 

1333
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,990
it is like non-stop picking up all the
swords

1334
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
swords
 

1335
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,590
swords
and uh the idea is we're gonna launch

1336
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
and uh the idea is we're gonna launch
 

1337
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,110
and uh the idea is we're gonna launch
the items up here and then launch them

1338
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
the items up here and then launch them
 

1339
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,830
the items up here and then launch them
to the right

1340
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
to the right
 

1341
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,190
to the right
and then they'll go through some item

1342
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
and then they'll go through some item
 

1343
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,350
and then they'll go through some item
filters we can't just send this stuff

1344
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
filters we can't just send this stuff
 

1345
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,029
filters we can't just send this stuff
into a hopper because we're collecting

1346
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,039
into a hopper because we're collecting
 

1347
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,750
into a hopper because we're collecting
it way

1348
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
it way
 

1349
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,470
it way
way way too quickly like probably five

1350
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
way way too quickly like probably five
 

1351
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,990
way way too quickly like probably five
or six times hopper speed at least

1352
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
or six times hopper speed at least
 

1353
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,390
or six times hopper speed at least
and we're gonna want to set up some

1354
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
and we're gonna want to set up some
 

1355
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,230
and we're gonna want to set up some
smelters for the swords it's definitely

1356
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
smelters for the swords it's definitely
 

1357
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,549
smelters for the swords it's definitely
worth smelting those down for the gold

1358
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
worth smelting those down for the gold
 

1359
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,510
worth smelting those down for the gold
i can't hit these guys there we go

in the world so apparently there was a
 

1415
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,590
in the world so apparently there was a
double spawner

1416
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
double spawner
 

1417
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,750
double spawner
double skeleton spawner underneath the

00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
double skeleton spawner underneath the
 

1419
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,430
double skeleton spawner underneath the
windmill like directly under it

1420

windmill like directly under it
 

1421
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,870

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,789
other one oh it's over here i
i guess they're kind of spaced out apart

1426
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
i guess they're kind of spaced out apart
 

1427

guys have also mentioned there's not a
 

1435
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,870
guys have also mentioned there's not a
double spawner not a triple spawner

1436
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
double spawner not a triple spawner
 

1437
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,549
double spawner not a triple spawner
not a quad spawner but five spawners

1438
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
not a quad spawner but five spawners
 

1439
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,269
not a quad spawner but five spawners
all in one location somewhere around our

1440
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
all in one location somewhere around our
 

1441
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,710
all in one location somewhere around our
pumpkin farm here so we're gonna try

1442
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
pumpkin farm here so we're gonna try
 

1443

i think this might be it actually so

1562
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:49,760
i think this might be it actually so
 

1563
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,710
i think this might be it actually so
we're at 500-ish

1564
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
we're at 500-ish
 

1565
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,630
we're at 500-ish
at this zombie spawner we got a saddle

1566
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
at this zombie spawner we got a saddle
 

1567
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,909
at this zombie spawner we got a saddle
i'll take it

1568
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:55,919
i'll take it
 

1569
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,310
i'll take it
um we go down the stairs here this took

1570
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
um we go down the stairs here this took
 

1571
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,750
um we go down the stairs here this took
me a while to find them all

1572
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760

 

1573
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,510

so this is 5 14 5 18.

1574
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
so this is 5 14 5 18.
 

1575
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,590
so this is 5 14 5 18.
they have to be within 32 blocks of each

1576
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
they have to be within 32 blocks of each
 

1577
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,029
they have to be within 32 blocks of each
other otherwise they're too far apart

1578
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
other otherwise they're too far apart
 

1579
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,149
other otherwise they're too far apart
and then 521 down here so that's

1580
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
and then 521 down here so that's
 

1581
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,630
and then 521 down here so that's
definitely within range right

1582
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
definitely within range right
 

1583
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,350
definitely within range right
21 blocks and the other ones over here

1584
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
21 blocks and the other ones over here
 

1585
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,070
21 blocks and the other ones over here
so that's five spawners so three of them

1586
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
so that's five spawners so three of them
 

1587
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,389
so that's five spawners so three of them
are cave spiders one's a skelly

1588
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:26,399
are cave spiders one's a skelly
 

1589
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,470
are cave spiders one's a skelly
and one's a zombie cool cool well we

1590
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
and one's a zombie cool cool well we
 

1591
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,630
and one's a zombie cool cool well we
found it so the pumpkin farm's over here

1592
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
found it so the pumpkin farm's over here
 

1593
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,070
found it so the pumpkin farm's over here
and it was actually a bit further

1594
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
and it was actually a bit further
 

1595
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,990
and it was actually a bit further
away than i expected it is all the way

1596
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
away than i expected it is all the way
 

1597
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,909
away than i expected it is all the way
over here

1598
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
over here
 

1599
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,029
over here
this is the zombie spawner

1600
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
this is the zombie spawner
 

1601
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,870
this is the zombie spawner
