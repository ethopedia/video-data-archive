00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
that's uh probably not worth featuring
 

51
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,549
that's uh probably not worth featuring
in an episode but it's probably worth

52
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
in an episode but it's probably worth
 

53
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,110
in an episode but it's probably worth
mentioning so i wanted to like compile a

54
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
mentioning so i wanted to like compile a
 

55
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,189
mentioning so i wanted to like compile a
bunch of those together uh-huh yeah so

here we go everybody what's etho been up
 

59
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,670
here we go everybody what's etho been up
to well the first project i tackled was

60
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
to well the first project i tackled was
 

61
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,830
to well the first project i tackled was
over at the amplified base because that

62
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
over at the amplified base because that
 

63
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,830
over at the amplified base because that
is the closest flower forest in our

64
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
is the closest flower forest in our
 

65
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,590
is the closest flower forest in our
world and we needed to make a new flower

66
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
world and we needed to make a new flower
 

67
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,429
world and we needed to make a new flower
farm because our old flower farm really

68
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
farm because our old flower farm really
 

69
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,670
farm because our old flower farm really
wasn't working too well anymore not only

70
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
wasn't working too well anymore not only
 

71
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,510
wasn't working too well anymore not only
because the redstone was outdated but

72
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
because the redstone was outdated but
 

73
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,670
because the redstone was outdated but
because uh we've gotten new flowers in

74
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
because uh we've gotten new flowers in
 

75
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,510
because uh we've gotten new flowers in
the game in the recent updates like the

76
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
the game in the recent updates like the
 

77
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,149
the game in the recent updates like the
lily of the valley cornflower blues we

78
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
lily of the valley cornflower blues we
 

79
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,670
lily of the valley cornflower blues we
had no way of generating those in our

80
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
had no way of generating those in our
 

81
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,630
had no way of generating those in our
world

82
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
world
 

83
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,310
world
and another thing that's changed over

84
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
and another thing that's changed over
 

85
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,310
and another thing that's changed over
time is like where the flowers generate

86
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
time is like where the flowers generate
 

87
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,789
time is like where the flowers generate
in flower forests has changed

88
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
in flower forests has changed
 

89
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,390
in flower forests has changed
and i couldn't even get alliums anymore

90
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
and i couldn't even get alliums anymore
 

91
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,230
and i couldn't even get alliums anymore
because they didn't generate in the same

92
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
because they didn't generate in the same
 

93
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,190
because they didn't generate in the same
spot anymore uh so i've just been

94
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
spot anymore uh so i've just been
 

95
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,030
spot anymore uh so i've just been
whittling down our stockpile of flowers

96
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
whittling down our stockpile of flowers
 

97
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,030
whittling down our stockpile of flowers
over time here and we've kind of ran out

98
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
over time here and we've kind of ran out
 

99
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,870
over time here and we've kind of ran out
we needed a new flower farm set up we

100
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
we needed a new flower farm set up we
 

101
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,389
we needed a new flower farm set up we
were able to set up farms for most the

102
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
were able to set up farms for most the
 

103
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,149
were able to set up farms for most the
flowers in the game just by setting up

104
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
flowers in the game just by setting up
 

105
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,550
flowers in the game just by setting up
four of my seven by seven flower farms i

106
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
four of my seven by seven flower farms i
 

107
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,710
four of my seven by seven flower farms i
really like these because uh they're

108
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
really like these because uh they're
 

109
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,190
really like these because uh they're
quick they're efficient but

110
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
quick they're efficient but
 

111
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,429
quick they're efficient but
especially i can build one in under five

112
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
especially i can build one in under five
 

113
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,109
especially i can build one in under five
minutes they're super simple

114
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
minutes they're super simple
 

115
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,429
minutes they're super simple
um if the space is cleared out already

116
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
um if the space is cleared out already
 

117
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,510
um if the space is cleared out already
now you might notice we put the flower

118
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
now you might notice we put the flower
 

119
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,229
now you might notice we put the flower
farms underground what's that about well

120
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
farms underground what's that about well
 

121
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,990
farms underground what's that about well
i searched the whole surface of our

122
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
i searched the whole surface of our
 

123
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,309
i searched the whole surface of our
flower forest like a 300 by 300 area i

124
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
flower forest like a 300 by 300 area i
 

125
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,229
flower forest like a 300 by 300 area i
could not find lily of the valleys

126
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
could not find lily of the valleys
 

127
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,070
could not find lily of the valleys
anywhere i spent over an hour looking

128
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
anywhere i spent over an hour looking
 

129
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,350
anywhere i spent over an hour looking
for those things

130
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
for those things
 

131
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,110
for those things
i even went up in the sky and checked a

132
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
i even went up in the sky and checked a
 

133
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,030
i even went up in the sky and checked a
bunch of spots couldn't find them it

134
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
bunch of spots couldn't find them it
 

135
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,630
bunch of spots couldn't find them it
always goes lily of the valley than

136
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
always goes lily of the valley than
 

137
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,710
always goes lily of the valley than
cornflower blue than the oxide daisies

138
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
cornflower blue than the oxide daisies
 

139
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,229
cornflower blue than the oxide daisies
so i ended up checking underground and

140
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
so i ended up checking underground and
 

141
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,910
so i ended up checking underground and
that's where we eventually found some

142
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
that's where we eventually found some
 

143
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,910
that's where we eventually found some
and that's where we set up our farms

144
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
and that's where we set up our farms
 

145
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,670
and that's where we set up our farms
so then after the flower farms were

146
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
so then after the flower farms were
 

147
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,350
so then after the flower farms were
built i went on a bit of a dye

148
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
built i went on a bit of a dye
 

149
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,949
built i went on a bit of a dye
collection spree i wanted to fill up

150
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
collection spree i wanted to fill up
 

151
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,949
collection spree i wanted to fill up
that new building in sandy city all the

152
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
that new building in sandy city all the
 

153
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,710
that new building in sandy city all the
barrels with the dyes so that they would

154
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
barrels with the dyes so that they would
 

155
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,470
barrels with the dyes so that they would
be readily available because that's the

156
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
be readily available because that's the
 

157
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,070
be readily available because that's the
main reason we needed the flower farm

158
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
main reason we needed the flower farm
 

159
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,390
main reason we needed the flower farm
was to get more dyes and for the next

160
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
was to get more dyes and for the next
 

161
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,470

00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
caves caverns we've been working on
 

165
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,509
caves caverns we've been working on
underground

166
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519

will end up wasting a whole bunch of

will end up wasting a whole bunch of
 

175
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,830
will end up wasting a whole bunch of
time just going back and forth between

00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
time just going back and forth between
 

177
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,070
time just going back and forth between
the project and it won't be nearly as

178
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
the project and it won't be nearly as
 

179
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,509
the project and it won't be nearly as
fun either because you'll dread every

fun either because you'll dread every
 

181
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,270
fun either because you'll dread every
time you have to go pick up something

right so we had that long tunnel from

184
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
right so we had that long tunnel from
 

185
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,990
right so we had that long tunnel from
the man cave to the cavern but we didn't

186
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
the man cave to the cavern but we didn't
 

187
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,589
the man cave to the cavern but we didn't
really have any other way to getting to

188
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
really have any other way to getting to
 

189
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,830
really have any other way to getting to
it i wanted a direct access with an

190
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
it i wanted a direct access with an
 

191
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,190
it i wanted a direct access with an
elevator just

192
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
elevator just
 

193
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,589
elevator just
in the area as well that way if we ever

194
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
in the area as well that way if we ever
 

195
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,750
in the area as well that way if we ever
need to transport animals or if we just

196
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
need to transport animals or if we just
 

197
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,430
need to transport animals or if we just
need to pick up something

198
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
need to pick up something
 

199
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,110
need to pick up something
from somewhere other than the man cave

200
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
from somewhere other than the man cave
 

201
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,110
from somewhere other than the man cave
it would be a lot easier i got the

202
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
it would be a lot easier i got the
 

203
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,949
it would be a lot easier i got the
elevator mostly finished but then i

204
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
elevator mostly finished but then i
 

205
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,869
elevator mostly finished but then i
realized we didn't have enough ice left

206
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
realized we didn't have enough ice left
 

207
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,630
realized we didn't have enough ice left
to fill in the bubble column on it and

208
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
to fill in the bubble column on it and
 

209
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,030
to fill in the bubble column on it and
we'd have to go get more so we paid a

210
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
we'd have to go get more so we paid a
 

211
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,869
we'd have to go get more so we paid a
visit to the ice farm and it's been a

212
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
visit to the ice farm and it's been a
 

213
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,949
visit to the ice farm and it's been a
very long time since i lasted a harvest

214
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
very long time since i lasted a harvest
 

215
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,990
very long time since i lasted a harvest
because

216
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
because
 

217
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,630
because
i made the farm like ridiculously big

218
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
i made the farm like ridiculously big
 

219
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,390
i made the farm like ridiculously big
that like i hardly ever need to get more

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
that like i hardly ever need to get more
 

221
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,789

finished harvesting all the ice we went
 

247
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,229
finished harvesting all the ice we went
back to finish up the bubble vader we

back to finish up the bubble vader we
 

249
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,229
back to finish up the bubble vader we
were working on we just put in two

blocks of ice all the way up and then
 

253
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,750
blocks of ice all the way up and then
broke some of it most of it actually

yeah so speaking of uh never finishing a
 

325
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,990
yeah so speaking of uh never finishing a
project i noticed uh while i was in the

326
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
project i noticed uh while i was in the
 

327
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,150
project i noticed uh while i was in the
area i was looking over at the nexus and

328
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
area i was looking over at the nexus and
 

329
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,990
area i was looking over at the nexus and
the roof on it was kind of blocky

330
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
the roof on it was kind of blocky
 

331

lanterns were just kind of sticking out
on the top and i got thinking maybe we

336
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
on the top and i got thinking maybe we
 

337
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,590
on the top and i got thinking maybe we
should try round it out just real quick

338
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
should try round it out just real quick
 

339
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,710
should try round it out just real quick
um so

340
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
um so
 

341
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,870
um so

doors and then for the dark prismarine
 

345
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,029
doors and then for the dark prismarine
on the sides it was also pretty blocky

346
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
on the sides it was also pretty blocky
 

347
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,950
on the sides it was also pretty blocky
looking so i just put some stairs and

348
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
looking so i just put some stairs and
 

349
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,150
looking so i just put some stairs and
slabs

slabs
around it to try smooth things out to be

352
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
around it to try smooth things out to be
 

353
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,469
around it to try smooth things out to be
honest with you there's a couple things

354
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
honest with you there's a couple things
 

355
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,990
honest with you there's a couple things
around the nexus that don't look quite

356
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
around the nexus that don't look quite
 

357
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,909
around the nexus that don't look quite
right one of those uh scars is the

358
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
right one of those uh scars is the
 

359
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,070
right one of those uh scars is the
bamboozler just this nether brick and

360
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
bamboozler just this nether brick and
 

361
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,350
bamboozler just this nether brick and
glass thing

362
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
glass thing
 

363
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,029
glass thing
i should build something over top of

364
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
i should build something over top of
 

365
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,070
i should build something over top of
this at some point but uh until then i

366
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
this at some point but uh until then i
 

367
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,230
this at some point but uh until then i
figured i would just uh switch out some

368
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
figured i would just uh switch out some
 

369
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,749
figured i would just uh switch out some
of the materials so it would be easier

370
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
of the materials so it would be easier
 

371
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,870
of the materials so it would be easier
on the eyes

372
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
on the eyes
 

373
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,870
on the eyes
we got this old blacksmith building out

374
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
we got this old blacksmith building out
 

375
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,710
we got this old blacksmith building out
by the wheat farm which never really got

376
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
by the wheat farm which never really got
 

377
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,189
by the wheat farm which never really got
finished and the funny thing is i think

378
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
finished and the funny thing is i think
 

379
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,390
finished and the funny thing is i think
we built this before the path next to it

380
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
we built this before the path next to it
 

381
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,469
we built this before the path next to it
right and then we put the path in and i

382
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
right and then we put the path in and i
 

383
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,390
right and then we put the path in and i
never connected the path up to the old

384
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
never connected the path up to the old
 

385
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,270
never connected the path up to the old
house or there's even a path by the

386
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
house or there's even a path by the
 

387
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,270
house or there's even a path by the
course fruit farm which this kind of

388
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
course fruit farm which this kind of
 

389
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,110
course fruit farm which this kind of
ends as well so i figured let's

390
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
ends as well so i figured let's
 

391
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,189
ends as well so i figured let's
extend the path that way we will bust

392
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
extend the path that way we will bust
 

393
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,590
extend the path that way we will bust
down the fence and uh connect all three

394
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
down the fence and uh connect all three
 

395
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,749
down the fence and uh connect all three
together and just make our world look a

396
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
together and just make our world look a
 

397
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,070
together and just make our world look a
little bit more united after that i kind

398
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
little bit more united after that i kind
 

399
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,830
little bit more united after that i kind
of felt like doing a bit of a mindless

400
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
of felt like doing a bit of a mindless
 

401
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,150
of felt like doing a bit of a mindless
mining you know how it is sometimes

402
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
mining you know how it is sometimes
 

403
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,990
mining you know how it is sometimes
you're watching tv or whatever you don't

404
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
you're watching tv or whatever you don't
 

405

really want to think about anything but

406
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
really want to think about anything but
 

407
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,189
really want to think about anything but
you want to do something

408
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
you want to do something
 

409
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,510
you want to do something
so i went over to the pillager outpost

410
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
so i went over to the pillager outpost
 

411
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,270
so i went over to the pillager outpost
and there's this big chunk of land i

412
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
and there's this big chunk of land i
 

413
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,390
and there's this big chunk of land i
needed to

414
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
needed to
 

415
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,990
needed to
mine out because some of the pillagers

416
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
mine out because some of the pillagers
 

417
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,150
mine out because some of the pillagers
were still spawning on there the idea is

418
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
were still spawning on there the idea is
 

419
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,589
were still spawning on there the idea is
we're going to hopefully make this into

420
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
we're going to hopefully make this into
 

421
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,990
we're going to hopefully make this into
a raid farm eventually

422
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
a raid farm eventually
 

423
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,710
a raid farm eventually
but uh until then this was a little

424
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
but uh until then this was a little
 

425
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,390
but uh until then this was a little
problem that needed to get finished on

426
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
problem that needed to get finished on
 

427
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,629
problem that needed to get finished on
it i had this idea as well that i wanted

428
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
it i had this idea as well that i wanted
 

429
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,110
it i had this idea as well that i wanted
to run by you guys because i hate

430
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
to run by you guys because i hate
 

431
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,270
to run by you guys because i hate
absolutely hate moving beacons in this

432
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
absolutely hate moving beacons in this
 

433
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,510
absolutely hate moving beacons in this
game like it's one of my most dreaded

434
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
game like it's one of my most dreaded
 

435
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,150
game like it's one of my most dreaded
things i've resorted to using tnt

436
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
things i've resorted to using tnt
 

437
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,909
things i've resorted to using tnt
sometimes to clear them

438
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
sometimes to clear them
 

439
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,670
sometimes to clear them
and i thought why don't they make it so

440
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
and i thought why don't they make it so
 

441
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,670
and i thought why don't they make it so
that you can put tnt in a beacon and

442
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
that you can put tnt in a beacon and
 

443
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,469
that you can put tnt in a beacon and
that unlocks a self-destruct option

444
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
that unlocks a self-destruct option
 

445
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,070
that unlocks a self-destruct option
is that a good idea or is that like too

446
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
is that a good idea or is that like too
 

447
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,870
is that a good idea or is that like too
much for vanilla and then finally i went

448
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
much for vanilla and then finally i went
 

449
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,029
much for vanilla and then finally i went
back to the caverns again this time i

450
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
back to the caverns again this time i
 

451
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,029
back to the caverns again this time i
wanted to get started on the triple

452
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
wanted to get started on the triple
 

453
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,270
wanted to get started on the triple
amethyst we found we want to make them

454
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
amethyst we found we want to make them
 

455
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,430
amethyst we found we want to make them
into a farm so that we can just hit a

456
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
into a farm so that we can just hit a
 

457
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,670
into a farm so that we can just hit a
button and automatically collect all the

458
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
button and automatically collect all the
 

459
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,510
button and automatically collect all the
crystals just by having the pistons

460
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
crystals just by having the pistons
 

461
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,869
crystals just by having the pistons
break them for us

462
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
break them for us
 

463
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,270
break them for us
uh the problem is

464
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
uh the problem is
 

465
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,350
uh the problem is
this is like the most annoying farm to

466
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
this is like the most annoying farm to
 

467
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,029
this is like the most annoying farm to
build in the game if you've ever done it

468
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
build in the game if you've ever done it
 

469
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,430
build in the game if you've ever done it
before it's tedious it's tricky every

470
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
before it's tedious it's tricky every
 

471
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,270
before it's tedious it's tricky every
single one has to be made differently

472
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
single one has to be made differently
 

473
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,670
single one has to be made differently
and there's a lot of like puzzle solving

474
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
and there's a lot of like puzzle solving
 

475
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,550
and there's a lot of like puzzle solving
as you go with it and that my friends is

476
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
as you go with it and that my friends is
 

477
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,070
as you go with it and that my friends is
what ethos been up to

479
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,150

okay so the experiment is over that's

480
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
okay so the experiment is over that's
 

481
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,749
okay so the experiment is over that's
all the footage i had saved on my hard

482
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
all the footage i had saved on my hard
 

483
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,830
all the footage i had saved on my hard
drive guys i got through it all and now

484
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
drive guys i got through it all and now
 

485
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,909
drive guys i got through it all and now
we stop and we analyze what how did that

486
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
we stop and we analyze what how did that
 

487
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,270
we stop and we analyze what how did that
go what do you guys think about the

488
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
go what do you guys think about the
 

489
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,270
go what do you guys think about the
episode so far hmm

490
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
episode so far hmm
 

491
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,950
episode so far hmm
you probably noticed it was a little bit

492
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
you probably noticed it was a little bit
 

493
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,469
you probably noticed it was a little bit
different huh

494
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
different huh
 

495
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,230
different huh
there's a reason for that is because i

496
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
there's a reason for that is because i
 

497
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,469
there's a reason for that is because i
was uh testing something out i've never

498
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
was uh testing something out i've never
 

499
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,270
was uh testing something out i've never
done an episode like with a big chunk of

500
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
done an episode like with a big chunk of
 

501
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,070
done an episode like with a big chunk of
post commentary i just i wanted to see

502
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
post commentary i just i wanted to see
 

503
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,749
post commentary i just i wanted to see
what it would be like you know i i

504
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
what it would be like you know i i
 

505
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,269
what it would be like you know i i
wanted to challenge myself a little bit

506
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
wanted to challenge myself a little bit
 

507
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,430
wanted to challenge myself a little bit
today and just see if it was better what

508
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
today and just see if it was better what
 

509
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,190
today and just see if it was better what
was good about it what was bad so i

510
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
was good about it what was bad so i
 

511
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,469
was good about it what was bad so i
think it's good for showing a lot of

512
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
think it's good for showing a lot of
 

513
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,870
think it's good for showing a lot of
information i think the episode loses a

514
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
information i think the episode loses a
 

515
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,389
information i think the episode loses a
bit of heart though doesn't it so the

516
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
bit of heart though doesn't it so the
 

517
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,470
bit of heart though doesn't it so the
nor the way i normally record if you

518
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
nor the way i normally record if you
 

519
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,750
nor the way i normally record if you
don't know

520
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
don't know
 

521
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,230
don't know
is also a little bit weird i generally

522
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
is also a little bit weird i generally
 

523
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,269
is also a little bit weird i generally
will

524
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
will
 

525
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,590
will
uh do something in game here i'll record

526
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
uh do something in game here i'll record
 

527
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,190
uh do something in game here i'll record
a single clip

528
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
a single clip
 

529
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,870
a single clip
and then i go straight to editing with

530
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
and then i go straight to editing with
 

531
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,269
and then i go straight to editing with
that one clip and i'll i'll attach it to

532
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
that one clip and i'll i'll attach it to
 

533
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,190
that one clip and i'll i'll attach it to
the the end of the video

534
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
the the end of the video
 

535
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,870
the the end of the video
and try get it as polished as i can

536
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
and try get it as polished as i can
 

537
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,030
and try get it as polished as i can
sometimes i forgot to say something or i

538
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
sometimes i forgot to say something or i
 

539
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,190
sometimes i forgot to say something or i
i mess up my words so then i go back

540
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
i mess up my words so then i go back
 

541
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,949
i mess up my words so then i go back
into the game and then i record the next

542
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
into the game and then i record the next
 

543
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,630
into the game and then i record the next
clip and i'll remember to say that thing

544
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
clip and i'll remember to say that thing
 

545
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,949
clip and i'll remember to say that thing
i i forgot to say or that i messed up

546
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
i i forgot to say or that i messed up
 

547
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,150
i i forgot to say or that i messed up
and then uh

548
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
and then uh
 

549
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,829
and then uh
i'll do the best i can with that clip

550
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
i'll do the best i can with that clip
 

551
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,430
i'll do the best i can with that clip
and i'll just attach to the end again

552
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
and i'll just attach to the end again
 

553
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,230
and i'll just attach to the end again
and somehow it makes a video

554
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
and somehow it makes a video
 

555
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,630
and somehow it makes a video
a patchwork style video uh-huh uh the

556
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
a patchwork style video uh-huh uh the
 

557
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,310
a patchwork style video uh-huh uh the
other thing i was kind of curious about

558
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
other thing i was kind of curious about
 

559
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,710
other thing i was kind of curious about
is what style of video was going to take

560
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
is what style of video was going to take
 

561
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,470
is what style of video was going to take
me longer to do and funny enough they

562
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
me longer to do and funny enough they
 

563
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,750
me longer to do and funny enough they
kind of worked out to take about the

564
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
kind of worked out to take about the
 

565
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,430
kind of worked out to take about the
same amount of time

566
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
same amount of time
 

567
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,790
same amount of time
so the downside of real-time commentary

568
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
so the downside of real-time commentary
 

569
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,870
so the downside of real-time commentary
is i end up cutting out a lot of what i

570
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
is i end up cutting out a lot of what i
 

571
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,710
is i end up cutting out a lot of what i
say and it just goes to waste right uh

572
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
say and it just goes to waste right uh
 

573
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,070
say and it just goes to waste right uh
also

574
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
also
 

575
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,509
also
um

576
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
um
 

577
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,030
um
like when i'm doing stuff in game like

578
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
like when i'm doing stuff in game like
 

579
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,710
like when i'm doing stuff in game like
what i'm doing right now

580
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
what i'm doing right now
 

581
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,310
what i'm doing right now
i have a hard time thinking and doing

582
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
i have a hard time thinking and doing
 

583
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,430
i have a hard time thinking and doing
the thing i'm

584
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
the thing i'm
 

585
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,389
the thing i'm
working on and i work very slowly so i

586
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
working on and i work very slowly so i
 

587
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,470
working on and i work very slowly so i
can get stuff done super fast and

588
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
can get stuff done super fast and
 

589
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,389
can get stuff done super fast and
efficiently in game

590
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
efficiently in game
 

591
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,310
efficiently in game
if i'm just focused on doing that and

592
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
if i'm just focused on doing that and
 

593
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,030
if i'm just focused on doing that and
not commentating at the same time

594
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
not commentating at the same time
 

595
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,269
not commentating at the same time
and like stopping every few minutes to

596
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
and like stopping every few minutes to
 

597
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,790
and like stopping every few minutes to
give you a progress update and talk

598
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
give you a progress update and talk
 

599
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,310
give you a progress update and talk
about decisions and that kind of stuff

600
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
about decisions and that kind of stuff
 

601
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,550
about decisions and that kind of stuff
that all takes time that adds up

602
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
that all takes time that adds up
 

603
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,430
that all takes time that adds up
uh post commentary you know exactly

604
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
uh post commentary you know exactly
 

605
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,350
uh post commentary you know exactly
what you're doing right so you know

606
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
what you're doing right so you know
 

607
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,430
what you're doing right so you know
what's gonna happen in the episode

608
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
what's gonna happen in the episode
 

609
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,190
what's gonna happen in the episode
and you can nail the commentary almost

610
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
and you can nail the commentary almost
 

611
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,870
and you can nail the commentary almost
perfectly

612
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
perfectly
 

613
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,430
perfectly
uh right on the first time right because

614
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
uh right on the first time right because
 

615
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,790
uh right on the first time right because
you know what's happened already what

616
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
you know what's happened already what
 

617
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,829
you know what's happened already what
you're trying to say and do

618
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
you're trying to say and do
 

619
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,750
you're trying to say and do
the downside is editing took forever

620
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
the downside is editing took forever
 

621
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,150
the downside is editing took forever
on this on this episode so i think uh

622
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
on this on this episode so i think uh
 

623
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,550
on this on this episode so i think uh
it's about the same actually

624
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
it's about the same actually
 

625
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,069
it's about the same actually
anyways you guys said to remove the

626
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
anyways you guys said to remove the
 

627
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,150
anyways you guys said to remove the
guard on the the lava farm here the

628
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
guard on the the lava farm here the
 

629
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,269
guard on the the lava farm here the
other day

630
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
other day
 

631
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,670
other day
and also i asked about the amplified

632
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
and also i asked about the amplified
 

633
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,110
and also i asked about the amplified
terrain should we

634
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
terrain should we
 

635
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,110
terrain should we
go for amplified terrain or the new

636
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
go for amplified terrain or the new
 

637
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,150
go for amplified terrain or the new
style

638
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
style
 

639
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,110
style
and uh it was a close uh

640
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
and uh it was a close uh
 

641
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,710
and uh it was a close uh
close vote i would say but i think a

642
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
close vote i would say but i think a
 

643
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,949
close vote i would say but i think a
slightly more of you said keep amplified

644
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
slightly more of you said keep amplified
 

645
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,829
slightly more of you said keep amplified
so

646
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
so
 

647
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,670
so
that is the plan for now but we might

648
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
that is the plan for now but we might
 

649
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,190
that is the plan for now but we might
change it in the future

650
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
change it in the future
 

651
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,590
change it in the future
anyways let's move on here so

652
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600

 

653
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,389

thank you rabbit

654
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
thank you rabbit
 

655
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,590
thank you rabbit
i i forgot i had my carrots out um

656
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
i i forgot i had my carrots out um
 

657
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,630
i i forgot i had my carrots out um
something i do every update is uh

658
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
something i do every update is uh
 

659
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,150
something i do every update is uh
i'll say what's broken in the world

660
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
i'll say what's broken in the world
 

661
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,910
i'll say what's broken in the world
because stuff breaks every single update

662
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
because stuff breaks every single update
 

663
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,069
because stuff breaks every single update
right so as you know we've gotten new

664
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
right so as you know we've gotten new
 

665
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,670
right so as you know we've gotten new
caves under the world

666
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
caves under the world
 

667
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,069
caves under the world
that means a lot of my mob farms have

668
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
that means a lot of my mob farms have
 

669
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,430
that means a lot of my mob farms have
been affected

670
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
been affected
 

671
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,230
been affected
including our general like zombie

672
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
including our general like zombie
 

673
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,710
including our general like zombie
skeleton creeper farm here it still

674
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
skeleton creeper farm here it still
 

675
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,389
skeleton creeper farm here it still
works it's just way slower than it used

676
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
works it's just way slower than it used
 

677
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,670
works it's just way slower than it used
to be

678
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
to be
 

679
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,910
to be
and that means eventually

680
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
and that means eventually
 

681
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,670
and that means eventually
i'm probably gonna run out of like tnt

682
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
i'm probably gonna run out of like tnt
 

683
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,670
i'm probably gonna run out of like tnt
and stuff if i don't make a new one or

684
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
and stuff if i don't make a new one or
 

685
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,590
and stuff if i don't make a new one or
fix this one i probably gotta look

686
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
fix this one i probably gotta look
 

687
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,110
fix this one i probably gotta look
underground just to see how my caves

688
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
underground just to see how my caves
 

689
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,190
underground just to see how my caves
need to be lit up i might not try to

690
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
need to be lit up i might not try to
 

691
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,350
need to be lit up i might not try to
save this i'm not sure yet instead i'm

692
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
save this i'm not sure yet instead i'm
 

693
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,190
save this i'm not sure yet instead i'm
kind of leaning towards like going to a

694
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
kind of leaning towards like going to a
 

695
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,030
kind of leaning towards like going to a
new area and setting up a creeper farm

696
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
new area and setting up a creeper farm
 

697
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,030
new area and setting up a creeper farm
like if we make a new base sometime

698
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
like if we make a new base sometime
 

699
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,030
like if we make a new base sometime
that'll be a project i would like to do

700
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
that'll be a project i would like to do
 

701
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,269
that'll be a project i would like to do
and get like a nice efficient uh source

702
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
and get like a nice efficient uh source
 

703
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,750
and get like a nice efficient uh source
of gunpowder this is our current stash

704
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
of gunpowder this is our current stash
 

705
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,990
of gunpowder this is our current stash
of like tnt and gunpowder though and

706
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
of like tnt and gunpowder though and
 

707
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,509
of like tnt and gunpowder though and
we're still getting a trickle from that

708
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
we're still getting a trickle from that
 

709
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,150
we're still getting a trickle from that
so it'll last a while i'm sure another

710
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
so it'll last a while i'm sure another
 

711
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,910
so it'll last a while i'm sure another
one of our mob farms that got hit by the

712
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
one of our mob farms that got hit by the
 

713
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,590
one of our mob farms that got hit by the
1.18 update is our guardian farm so it's

714
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
1.18 update is our guardian farm so it's
 

715
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,870
1.18 update is our guardian farm so it's
not faring

716
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
not faring
 

717
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,829
not faring
as badly as the hostile mob farm

718
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
as badly as the hostile mob farm
 

719
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,150
as badly as the hostile mob farm
um it's actually doing okay but it's

720
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
um it's actually doing okay but it's
 

721
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,790
um it's actually doing okay but it's
definitely slower than it used to be

722
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
definitely slower than it used to be
 

723
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,030
definitely slower than it used to be
with all the unlit caves underneath the

724
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
with all the unlit caves underneath the
 

725
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,110
with all the unlit caves underneath the
thing is with our hostile mob farm that

726
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
thing is with our hostile mob farm that
 

727
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,829
thing is with our hostile mob farm that
we just looked at

728
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
we just looked at
 

729
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,870
we just looked at
oh it only has maybe 500 spawning spaces

730
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
oh it only has maybe 500 spawning spaces
 

731
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,870
oh it only has maybe 500 spawning spaces
well this one has got like several

732
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
well this one has got like several
 

733
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,710
well this one has got like several
thousand with this big volume of water

734
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
thousand with this big volume of water
 

735
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,430
thousand with this big volume of water
right so the ratio of spawning spaces to

736
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
right so the ratio of spawning spaces to
 

737
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,670
right so the ratio of spawning spaces to
the unlit caves isn't as bad and it's

738
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
the unlit caves isn't as bad and it's
 

739
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,829
the unlit caves isn't as bad and it's
still working

740
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
still working
 

741
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,509
still working
okay uh but i definitely want to try

742
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
okay uh but i definitely want to try
 

743
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,350
okay uh but i definitely want to try
save this because we put a lot of work

744
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
save this because we put a lot of work
 

745
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,590
save this because we put a lot of work
to into making this as well as the mural

746
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
to into making this as well as the mural
 

747
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,829
to into making this as well as the mural
back here and i would hate for us to

748
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
back here and i would hate for us to
 

749
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,590
back here and i would hate for us to
like just say goodbye to this you know

750
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
like just say goodbye to this you know
 

751
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,790
like just say goodbye to this you know
so uh yeah i'm gonna go and try light up

752
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
so uh yeah i'm gonna go and try light up
 

753
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,629
so uh yeah i'm gonna go and try light up
the caves under here at some point now

754
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
the caves under here at some point now
 

755
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,230
the caves under here at some point now
there's another really bad thing about

756
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
there's another really bad thing about
 

757
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,389
there's another really bad thing about
the 1.18 update uh performance has

758
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
the 1.18 update uh performance has
 

759
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,310
the 1.18 update uh performance has
gotten quite a bit worse you might even

760
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
gotten quite a bit worse you might even
 

761
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,629
gotten quite a bit worse you might even
see some

762
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
see some
 

763
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,470
see some
loss of frame rate as i'm walking around

764
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
loss of frame rate as i'm walking around
 

765
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,389
loss of frame rate as i'm walking around
sandy city here so especially around the

766
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
sandy city here so especially around the
 

767
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,870
sandy city here so especially around the
man cave and around sandy city

768
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
man cave and around sandy city
 

769
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,190
man cave and around sandy city
it's extremely laggy in my world i think

770
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
it's extremely laggy in my world i think
 

771
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,430
it's extremely laggy in my world i think
maybe because of the map wall and just

772
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
maybe because of the map wall and just
 

773
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,829
maybe because of the map wall and just
we have a lot of stuff here right so

774
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
we have a lot of stuff here right so
 

775
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,710
we have a lot of stuff here right so
i've had to resort from going to 12

776
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
i've had to resort from going to 12
 

777
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,829
i've had to resort from going to 12
chunks

778
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
chunks
 

779
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,710
chunks
render distance i used to play on 17.

780
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
render distance i used to play on 17.
 

781
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,790
render distance i used to play on 17.
that seems to fix the problem but we

782
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
that seems to fix the problem but we
 

783
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,949
that seems to fix the problem but we
can't see as far um

784
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
can't see as far um
 

785
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,430
can't see as far um
and it's kind of a double whammy because

786
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
and it's kind of a double whammy because
 

787
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,430
and it's kind of a double whammy because
uh another thing that kind of broke this

788
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
uh another thing that kind of broke this
 

789
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,389
uh another thing that kind of broke this
update is the end reporter we had set up

790
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
update is the end reporter we had set up
 

791
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,230
update is the end reporter we had set up
now it still works everything functions

792
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
now it still works everything functions
 

793
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,470
now it still works everything functions
exactly the same as before

794
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
exactly the same as before
 

795
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,110
exactly the same as before
uh the difference is

796
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
uh the difference is
 

797
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,550
uh the difference is
you might have saw in the patch notes

798
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
you might have saw in the patch notes
 

799
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,829
you might have saw in the patch notes
they changed the way chunks load in this

800
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839
they changed the way chunks load in this
 

801
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,069
they changed the way chunks load in this
1.18 it used to load in a square around

802
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
1.18 it used to load in a square around
 

803
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,189
1.18 it used to load in a square around
the player

804
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199
the player
 

805
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,910
the player
and they changed it to a circle

806
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
and they changed it to a circle
 

807
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,550
and they changed it to a circle
and i had this set up in just the way

808
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
and i had this set up in just the way
 

809
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,350
and i had this set up in just the way
where

810
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
where
 

811
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,110
where
we would teleport to the very corner of

812
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
we would teleport to the very corner of
 

813
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,230
we would teleport to the very corner of
the square that was loaded if we had 17

814
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
the square that was loaded if we had 17
 

815
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,590
the square that was loaded if we had 17
chunks

816
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
chunks
 

817
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,350
chunks
rendered the more chunks we render the

818
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
rendered the more chunks we render the
 

819
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,590
rendered the more chunks we render the
further we can teleport

820
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
further we can teleport
 

821
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,710
further we can teleport
um

822
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
um
 

823
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,030
um
but because it's a circle now even at 17

824
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
but because it's a circle now even at 17
 

825
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,949
but because it's a circle now even at 17
chunks render

826
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959

i can't teleport to the next station

828
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
i can't teleport to the next station
 

829
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,350
i can't teleport to the next station
it's unloaded right now which kind of

830
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
it's unloaded right now which kind of
 

831
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,949
it's unloaded right now which kind of
stinks i think i would have to go way up

832
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
stinks i think i would have to go way up
 

833
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,829
stinks i think i would have to go way up
like maybe even 22 wouldn't be enough

834
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
like maybe even 22 wouldn't be enough
 

835
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,750
like maybe even 22 wouldn't be enough
we'll see here

836
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760

 

837
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,910

oh now it went

838
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
oh now it went
 

839
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,710
oh now it went
okay

840
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
okay
 

841
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,550
okay
anyways the end reporters need some work

842
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
anyways the end reporters need some work
 

843
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,310
anyways the end reporters need some work
now because of that i'll probably have

844
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
now because of that i'll probably have
 

845
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,629
now because of that i'll probably have
to have an in-between station now

846
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
to have an in-between station now
 

847
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,910
to have an in-between station now
thankfully that's pretty much all the

848
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
thankfully that's pretty much all the
 

849
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,430
thankfully that's pretty much all the
problems i've had with the update not

850
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
problems i've had with the update not
 

851
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,509
problems i've had with the update not
too bad i just gotta go caving and

852
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
too bad i just gotta go caving and
 

853
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,790
too bad i just gotta go caving and
everything will be pretty much back to

854
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
everything will be pretty much back to
 

855
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,030
everything will be pretty much back to
normal build another end reporter

856
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
normal build another end reporter
 

857
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,629

previously if you loaded a chunk at a
 

865
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,269
previously if you loaded a chunk at a
certain x and z coordinate it would load

certain x and z coordinate it would load
 

867
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,949
certain x and z coordinate it would load
everything from the bottom of the world

uh in this update they seem to manage it
 

873
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,550
uh in this update they seem to manage it
quite well they only load a certain

quite well they only load a certain
 

875

amount and
 

877
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,910
amount and
like right now what's our frame rate

878
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
like right now what's our frame rate
 

879
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,470
like right now what's our frame rate
we're getting 91 frames while recording

i'm not affected by the lag up there uh

898
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759
i'm not affected by the lag up there uh
 

899
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,350
i'm not affected by the lag up there uh
you know what i just realized i never

900
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
you know what i just realized i never
 

901
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,069
you know what i just realized i never
showed you guys the amethyst farm

902
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
showed you guys the amethyst farm
 

903
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,470
showed you guys the amethyst farm
aha let's check this thing out so this

904
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
aha let's check this thing out so this
 

905
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,389
aha let's check this thing out so this
is where we're sitting right now now i

906
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
is where we're sitting right now now i
 

907
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,150
is where we're sitting right now now i
said there was three of them and i got

908
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
said there was three of them and i got
 

909
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,710
said there was three of them and i got
one of them converted over

910
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
one of them converted over
 

911
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,310
one of them converted over
and then i got tired of working on this

912
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
and then i got tired of working on this
 

913
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,470
and then i got tired of working on this
thing uh so this took three or four

914
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
thing uh so this took three or four
 

915
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,350
thing uh so this took three or four
hours just to get one of them done i did

916
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
hours just to get one of them done i did
 

917
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,670
hours just to get one of them done i did
get started on a second one and it's

918
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
get started on a second one and it's
 

919
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,110
get started on a second one and it's
kind of funny

920
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
kind of funny
 

921
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,870
kind of funny
like i watch other people's uh let's

922
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
like i watch other people's uh let's
 

923

like i watch other people's uh let's
plays every so often right and i've

924
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
plays every so often right and i've
 

925
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,230
plays every so often right and i've
noticed like whenever somebody's working

926
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
noticed like whenever somebody's working
 

927
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,629
noticed like whenever somebody's working
on an amethyst farm they'll be all

928
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
on an amethyst farm they'll be all
 

929
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,230
on an amethyst farm they'll be all
excited like before they start it and

930
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
excited like before they start it and
 

931
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,910
excited like before they start it and
then after when they show it off they're

932
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
then after when they show it off they're
 

933
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,710
then after when they show it off they're
like

934

like
 

935
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,550
like
all right guys i got the amethyst farm

936
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
all right guys i got the amethyst farm
 

937
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,710
all right guys i got the amethyst farm
done

938
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
done
 

939
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,509

it's just this absolute dread after you
 

941
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,189
it's just this absolute dread after you
work on it for a while because this is

942
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
work on it for a while because this is
 

943
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,230
work on it for a while because this is
so so difficult and time consuming

944
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
so so difficult and time consuming
 

945
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,310
so so difficult and time consuming
uh and tedious and stuff but yeah this

946
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
uh and tedious and stuff but yeah this
 

947
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,430
uh and tedious and stuff but yeah this
is where we're at with the second

948
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
is where we're at with the second
 

949
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,670
is where we're at with the second
crystal right now and i've discovered

950
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
crystal right now and i've discovered
 

951
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,189
crystal right now and i've discovered
there's not just three here there's

952
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
there's not just three here there's
 

953
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,910
there's not just three here there's
actually six of these geodes

954
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
actually six of these geodes
 

955
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,189
actually six of these geodes
that i'm going to want to convert over

956
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
that i'm going to want to convert over
 

957
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,949
that i'm going to want to convert over
eventually not today though no no no

958
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
eventually not today though no no no
 

959
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,269
eventually not today though no no no
i've had enough

960
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
i've had enough
 

961
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,430
i've had enough
uh so with this first one though i

962
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
uh so with this first one though i
 

963
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,189
uh so with this first one though i
actually got it to work with the water

964
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
actually got it to work with the water
 

965
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,310
actually got it to work with the water
streams

966
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
streams
 

967
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,470
streams
uh which is kind of cool like you should

968
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
uh which is kind of cool like you should
 

969
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,509
uh which is kind of cool like you should
probably build these with hoppers

970
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
probably build these with hoppers
 

971
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,509
probably build these with hoppers
why is there

972
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
why is there
 

973
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,350
why is there
i missed the spot apparently

974
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
i missed the spot apparently
 

975
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,910
i missed the spot apparently
actually i should put one more there aha

976
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920
actually i should put one more there aha
 

977
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,430
actually i should put one more there aha
let's go inside let's check this out so

978
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
let's go inside let's check this out so
 

979
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,110
let's go inside let's check this out so
you can see we got wiring all over the

980
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
you can see we got wiring all over the
 

981
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,550
you can see we got wiring all over the
top here

982
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
top here
 

983
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,629
top here
i found it's good to have like a mix of

984
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
i found it's good to have like a mix of
 

985
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,030
i found it's good to have like a mix of
like redstone dust and observers

986
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
like redstone dust and observers
 

987
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,470
like redstone dust and observers
observers are great if you need to run

988
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
observers are great if you need to run
 

989
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,630
observers are great if you need to run
the signal down somewhere

990
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
the signal down somewhere
 

991
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,390
the signal down somewhere
all right let's go in here

992
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
all right let's go in here
 

993
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,789
all right let's go in here
and you can see all the pistons so like

994
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
and you can see all the pistons so like
 

995
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,789
and you can see all the pistons so like
the idea is the piston will extend here

996
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
the idea is the piston will extend here
 

997
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,230
the idea is the piston will extend here
and break the crystal when it's fully

998
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
and break the crystal when it's fully
 

999
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,309
and break the crystal when it's fully
grown it'll drop it into the water and

1000
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
grown it'll drop it into the water and
 

1001
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,669
grown it'll drop it into the water and
then it all kind of gets collected

1002
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
then it all kind of gets collected
 

1003
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,470
then it all kind of gets collected
together and i divided the geode into

1004
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
together and i divided the geode into
 

1005
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,990
together and i divided the geode into
halves

1006
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
halves
 

1007
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,909
halves
so everything on this layer kind of gets

1008
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
so everything on this layer kind of gets
 

1009
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,189
so everything on this layer kind of gets
collected together

1010
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
collected together
 

1011
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,029
collected together
by the water streams

1012
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
by the water streams
 

1013
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,870
by the water streams
and then some of it will flow over the

1014
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
and then some of it will flow over the
 

1015
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,230
and then some of it will flow over the
side here down to the second layer

1016
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
side here down to the second layer
 

1017
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,909
side here down to the second layer
we got some more crystals up above here

1018
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
we got some more crystals up above here
 

1019
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,950
we got some more crystals up above here
you can see

1020
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
you can see
 

1021
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,150
you can see
and these ones get collected all

1022
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
and these ones get collected all
 

1023
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,830
and these ones get collected all
together in uh

1024
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
together in uh
 

1025
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,310
together in uh
water streams i got some more

1026
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
water streams i got some more
 

1027
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,870
water streams i got some more
channels hidden over there

1028
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
channels hidden over there
 

1029
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,870
channels hidden over there
right so no matter where the crystal

1030
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
right so no matter where the crystal
 

1031
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,470
right so no matter where the crystal
lands

1032
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
lands
 

1033
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,950
lands
in this area it should eventually end up

1034
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
in this area it should eventually end up
 

1035
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,669
in this area it should eventually end up
going down the tube here

1036
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
going down the tube here
 

1037
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,590
going down the tube here
uh-huh so that was kind of tricky to

1038
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
uh-huh so that was kind of tricky to
 

1039
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,110
uh-huh so that was kind of tricky to
work out

1040
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
work out
 

1041
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,669
work out
uh but it's it's working good as far as

1042
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
uh but it's it's working good as far as
 

1043
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,669
uh but it's it's working good as far as
i can tell then if we go down here this

1044
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
i can tell then if we go down here this
 

1045
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,830
i can tell then if we go down here this
is like a nice path that goes up to the

1046
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
is like a nice path that goes up to the
 

1047
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,669
is like a nice path that goes up to the
elevator on the outside is where we're

1048
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
elevator on the outside is where we're
 

1049
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,950
elevator on the outside is where we're
at right now

1050
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
at right now
 

1051
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,510
at right now
uh as far as how to harvest this thing

1052
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
uh as far as how to harvest this thing
 

1053
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,430
uh as far as how to harvest this thing
right now i just got a

1054
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
right now i just got a
 

1055
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,110
right now i just got a
redstone signal here now the crystals

1056
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
redstone signal here now the crystals
 

1057
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,950
redstone signal here now the crystals
grow very slowly

1058
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
grow very slowly
 

1059
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,630
grow very slowly
and it didn't look like many were ready

1060
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
and it didn't look like many were ready
 

1061
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,669
and it didn't look like many were ready
in there so i don't know if we're gonna

1062
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
in there so i don't know if we're gonna
 

1063
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,430
in there so i don't know if we're gonna
get anything actually

1064
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
get anything actually
 

1065
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,430
get anything actually
oh we got a few

1066
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
oh we got a few
 

1067
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,510
oh we got a few
you gotta leave it sit for like

1068
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
you gotta leave it sit for like
 

1069
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,950
you gotta leave it sit for like
at least an hour though i think before

1070
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
at least an hour though i think before
 

1071
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,150
at least an hour though i think before
you'll get many

1072
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
you'll get many
 

1073
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,909
you'll get many
that's cool we got a couple here

1074
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
that's cool we got a couple here
 

1075
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,430
that's cool we got a couple here
and we can use these to make the tinted

1076
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
and we can use these to make the tinted
 

1077
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,710
and we can use these to make the tinted
glass and

1078
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
glass and
 

1079
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,070
glass and
like if it's a full harvest i'm sure

1080
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
like if it's a full harvest i'm sure
 

1081
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,710
like if it's a full harvest i'm sure
we'll get at least the stack but uh yeah

1082
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
we'll get at least the stack but uh yeah
 

1083
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,710
we'll get at least the stack but uh yeah
it wasn't ready now the cool thing is

1084
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
it wasn't ready now the cool thing is
 

1085
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,070
it wasn't ready now the cool thing is
because i've been spending so much time

1086
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
because i've been spending so much time
 

1087
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,390
because i've been spending so much time
working on this farm right the tree farm

1088
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
working on this farm right the tree farm
 

1089
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,390
working on this farm right the tree farm
was able to run for quite a few hours uh

1090
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
was able to run for quite a few hours uh
 

1091
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,070
was able to run for quite a few hours uh
but i ran out of boatmeal so it's kind

1092
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
but i ran out of boatmeal so it's kind
 

1093
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,150
but i ran out of boatmeal so it's kind
of shut down for now i gotta go get more

1094
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
of shut down for now i gotta go get more
 

1095
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,669
of shut down for now i gotta go get more
but we got uh

1096
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
but we got uh
 

1097
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,830
but we got uh
a couple of shulkers of oak wood and

1098
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
a couple of shulkers of oak wood and
 

1099
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,909
a couple of shulkers of oak wood and
like several stacks of rooted dirt at

1100
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
like several stacks of rooted dirt at
 

1101
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,909
like several stacks of rooted dirt at
this point so we got to we got the

1102
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
this point so we got to we got the
 

1103
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,270
this point so we got to we got the
rooted dirt if we ever want to build

1104
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
rooted dirt if we ever want to build
 

1105
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,350
rooted dirt if we ever want to build
with it now which is awesome now i just

1106
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
with it now which is awesome now i just
 

1107
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,190
with it now which is awesome now i just
moved the beacon down here got that set

1108
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
moved the beacon down here got that set
 

1109
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,110
moved the beacon down here got that set
up and i'm going to be mining out a bit

1110
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
up and i'm going to be mining out a bit
 

1111
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,110
up and i'm going to be mining out a bit
of land so there was an awesome

1112
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
of land so there was an awesome
 

1113
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,870
of land so there was an awesome
suggestion in the comments of last

noteblock tune i think would be cool so

1146
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
noteblock tune i think would be cool so
 

1147
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,110
noteblock tune i think would be cool so
i'm working on setting that up now so i

1148
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
i'm working on setting that up now so i
 

1149
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,870
i'm working on setting that up now so i
i've been experimenting as well with the

1150
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
i've been experimenting as well with the
 

1151
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,630
i've been experimenting as well with the
whole mosque to get rid of deep slate

1152
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
whole mosque to get rid of deep slate
 

1153
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,230
whole mosque to get rid of deep slate
you do need to mine out the top layer

1154
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
you do need to mine out the top layer
 

1155
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,270
you do need to mine out the top layer
here

1156
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
here
 

1157
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,669
here
right and then if you have uh some moss

1158
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
right and then if you have uh some moss
 

1159
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,430
right and then if you have uh some moss
and bonemeal

1160
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
and bonemeal
 

1161
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,350
and bonemeal
you can speed up the the layers below

1162
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
you can speed up the the layers below
 

1163
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,270
you can speed up the the layers below
that but you do need you do need to

1164
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
that but you do need you do need to
 

1165
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,510
that but you do need you do need to
remove at least one layer it won't grow

1166
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
remove at least one layer it won't grow
 

1167
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,830
remove at least one layer it won't grow
sideways it only grows downward

1168
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
sideways it only grows downward
 

1169
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,909
sideways it only grows downward
so then we can just do that

1170
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
so then we can just do that
 

1171
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,750
so then we can just do that
and then it's so much faster to remove

1172
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
and then it's so much faster to remove
 

1173
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,990
and then it's so much faster to remove
the the next layers

1174
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
the the next layers
 

1175
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,590
the the next layers
and get rid of that and then if you want

1176
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
and get rid of that and then if you want
 

1177
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,990
and get rid of that and then if you want
you can spread it again

1178
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
you can spread it again
 

1179
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,149
you can spread it again
so that's pretty cool that helps a lot

1180
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
so that's pretty cool that helps a lot
 

1181
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,350
so that's pretty cool that helps a lot
okay so it's a little bit tight down

1182
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
okay so it's a little bit tight down
 

1183
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,870
okay so it's a little bit tight down
here but we got a little bit of space to

1184
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
here but we got a little bit of space to
 

1185
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,950
here but we got a little bit of space to
get started i tried to

1186

get started i tried to
center that end and that and between the

1188
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
center that end and that and between the
 

1189
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,350
center that end and that and between the
three geodes up above and then if we

1190
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
three geodes up above and then if we
 

1191
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,270
three geodes up above and then if we
need more space cleared out we're going

1192
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
need more space cleared out we're going

notebox in minecraft they're very

1256
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
notebox in minecraft they're very
 

1257
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,350
notebox in minecraft they're very
limited on their range it only covers

1258
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
limited on their range it only covers
 

1259
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,789
limited on their range it only covers
two octaves

1260
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799

 

1261
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,950

and then it gets it starts over

1262
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
and then it gets it starts over
 

1263
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,870
and then it gets it starts over
so that's 24 notes

1264
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
so that's 24 notes

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
12 notes per octave what is an octave
 

1267
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,350
12 notes per octave what is an octave
okay so we click this note block seven

1268
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
okay so we click this note block seven
 

1269
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,510
okay so we click this note block seven
times and it's a c sharp

1270
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
times and it's a c sharp
 

1271
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,430
times and it's a c sharp
and then i copied that over here

1272
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
and then i copied that over here
 

1273
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,870
and then i copied that over here
it's also the same

1274
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
it's also the same
 

1275
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,190
it's also the same
all right so to go up an octave is the

1276
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
all right so to go up an octave is the
 

1277
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,909
all right so to go up an octave is the
same as uh right clicking this 12 times

1278
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
same as uh right clicking this 12 times
 

1279
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,669
same as uh right clicking this 12 times
so it runs through all the notes

1280
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
so it runs through all the notes
 

1281
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,750
so it runs through all the notes
basically so is it c sharp right now

1282
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
basically so is it c sharp right now
 

1283
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,870
basically so is it c sharp right now
let's do that so if we add one

1284
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
let's do that so if we add one
 

1285
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,149
let's do that so if we add one
it's a d

1286
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
it's a d
 

1287
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,190
it's a d
d sharp e f f sharp g g sharp a

1288
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
d sharp e f f sharp g g sharp a
 

1289
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,710
d sharp e f f sharp g g sharp a
a sharp b

1290
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
a sharp b
 

1291
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,830
a sharp b
c

1292
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
c
 

1293
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,669
c
c sharp all right so that's our twelfth

1294
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:05,679
c sharp all right so that's our twelfth
 

1295
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,830
c sharp all right so that's our twelfth
time now when we compare them

1296
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840

 

1297
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,390

it kind of sounds similar right they're

1298
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
it kind of sounds similar right they're
 

1299
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,870
it kind of sounds similar right they're
both c sharps but this one's one octave

1300
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
both c sharps but this one's one octave
 

1301
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,830
both c sharps but this one's one octave
higher an octave is when you double the

1302
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
higher an octave is when you double the
 

1303
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,510
higher an octave is when you double the
frequency when you go up an octave

1304
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
frequency when you go up an octave
 

1305
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,350
frequency when you go up an octave
you're doubling the frequency if you're

1306
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
you're doubling the frequency if you're
 

1307
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,110
you're doubling the frequency if you're
going down an octave you're cutting the

1308
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
going down an octave you're cutting the
 

1309
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,350
going down an octave you're cutting the
frequency in half so our brain kind of

1310
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
frequency in half so our brain kind of
 

1311
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,710
frequency in half so our brain kind of
interprets it

1312
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
interprets it
 

1313
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,789
interprets it
as the same note

1314
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
as the same note
 

1315
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,549
as the same note
even though it's a higher pitch but it

1316
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
even though it's a higher pitch but it
 

1317
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,110
even though it's a higher pitch but it
has similar characteristics right

1318
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,120
has similar characteristics right
 

1319
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,549
has similar characteristics right
yeah so if i'm understanding things

1320
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
yeah so if i'm understanding things
 

1321
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,430
yeah so if i'm understanding things
right

1322
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
right
 

1323
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,510
right
if you go up an octave

1324
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
if you go up an octave
 

1325
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,669
if you go up an octave
you're doubling the frequency of a sound

1326
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
you're doubling the frequency of a sound
 

1327
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,549
you're doubling the frequency of a sound
wave

1328
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
wave
 

1329
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,430
wave
right

1330
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
right
 

1331
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,950
right
so you have twice as many waves hitting

1332
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
so you have twice as many waves hitting
 

1333
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,950
so you have twice as many waves hitting
you but half of the time they're lining

1334
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
you but half of the time they're lining
 

1335
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,470
you but half of the time they're lining
up perfectly

1336
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
up perfectly
 

1337
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,470
up perfectly
with the octave below that so that's why

1338
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
with the octave below that so that's why
 

1339
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,190
with the octave below that so that's why
they sound similar to you right they're

1340
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
they sound similar to you right they're
 

1341
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,590
they sound similar to you right they're
lining up actually while if you shift

1342
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
lining up actually while if you shift
 

1343
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,029
lining up actually while if you shift
the notes over

1344
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
the notes over
 

1345
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,549
the notes over
by just a few then they're not going to

1346
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
by just a few then they're not going to
 

1347
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,390
by just a few then they're not going to
line up and that's why different notes

1348
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
line up and that's why different notes
 

1349
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,310
line up and that's why different notes
sound different

1350
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
sound different
 

1351
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,990
sound different
does that make sense i hope i hope i

1352
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
does that make sense i hope i hope i
 

1353
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,510
does that make sense i hope i hope i
said that right

1354
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
said that right
 

1355
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,870
said that right
so that's useful to know about the

1356
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880
so that's useful to know about the
 

1357
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,549
so that's useful to know about the
octaves because if you see someone

1358
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
octaves because if you see someone
 

1359
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,909
octaves because if you see someone
playing a piano or whatever you have

1360
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
playing a piano or whatever you have
 

1361
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,710
playing a piano or whatever you have
notes on someone uh tabs of a piano or

1362
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
notes on someone uh tabs of a piano or
 

1363
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,789
notes on someone uh tabs of a piano or
whatever you search online for that and

1364
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
whatever you search online for that and
 

1365
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,390
whatever you search online for that and
you want the song

1366
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
you want the song
 

1367
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,549
you want the song
but it looks like it's an octave or two

1368
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
but it looks like it's an octave or two
 

1369
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,870
but it looks like it's an octave or two
over or three or four you are allowed to

1370
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:18,880
over or three or four you are allowed to
 

1371
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,390
over or three or four you are allowed to
shift octaves like add 12 notes or 24 or

1372
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
shift octaves like add 12 notes or 24 or
 

1373
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,230
shift octaves like add 12 notes or 24 or
36 or whatever

1374
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
36 or whatever
 

1375
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,390
36 or whatever
okay or subtract

1376
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
okay or subtract
 

1377
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,230
okay or subtract
uh the other thing that i found very

1378
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
uh the other thing that i found very
 

1379
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,149
uh the other thing that i found very
confusing about music is the whole flat

1380
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
confusing about music is the whole flat
 

1381
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,230
confusing about music is the whole flat
and sharp system

1382
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
and sharp system
 

1383
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,950
and sharp system
uh so basically a flat you minus one on

1384
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
uh so basically a flat you minus one on
 

1385
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,510
uh so basically a flat you minus one on
a notes a sharp u plus one okay so let's

1386
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
a notes a sharp u plus one okay so let's
 

1387
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,350
a notes a sharp u plus one okay so let's
say you have a c

1388
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
say you have a c
 

1389
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,590
say you have a c
six right clicks on the note block right

1390
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
six right clicks on the note block right
 

1391
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,669
six right clicks on the note block right
a c flat you minus one

1392
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
a c flat you minus one
 

1393
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,669
a c flat you minus one
so it's only five

1394
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
so it's only five
 

1395
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,230
so it's only five
uh right clicks or if you have a c sharp

1396
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
uh right clicks or if you have a c sharp
 

1397
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,470
uh right clicks or if you have a c sharp
as we saw before plus one

1398
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
as we saw before plus one
 

1399
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,230
as we saw before plus one
it's a seven now where this gets

1400
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
it's a seven now where this gets
 

1401
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,310
it's a seven now where this gets
confusing is sometimes you'll be reading

1402
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
confusing is sometimes you'll be reading
 

1403
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,950
confusing is sometimes you'll be reading
notes and you'll have a b okay that's

1404
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
notes and you'll have a b okay that's
 

1405
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,190
notes and you'll have a b okay that's
five that makes sense you minus one for

1406
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
five that makes sense you minus one for
 

1407
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,230
five that makes sense you minus one for
a flat

1408
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
a flat
 

1409
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,710
a flat
as a four right clicks on the note block

1410
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,720
as a four right clicks on the note block
 

1411
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,390
as a four right clicks on the note block
wait a minute a b sharp is a six then

1412
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
wait a minute a b sharp is a six then
 

1413
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,549
wait a minute a b sharp is a six then
and a c is a six

1414
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
and a c is a six
 

1415
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,310
and a c is a six
what's the deal here

1416
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
what's the deal here
 

1417
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,390
what's the deal here
why don't they just write it as one

1418
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
why don't they just write it as one
 

1419
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,230
why don't they just write it as one
thing yeah i'm just gonna assume

1420
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
thing yeah i'm just gonna assume
 

1421
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,750
thing yeah i'm just gonna assume
somebody in the comments is gonna

1422
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
somebody in the comments is gonna
 

1423
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,750
somebody in the comments is gonna
explain this way better than i ever

1424
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
explain this way better than i ever
 

1425
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,950
explain this way better than i ever
could why

1426
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
could why
 

1427
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,470
could why
they don't just use

1428
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
they don't just use
 

1429
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,310
they don't just use
one letter to represent the same thing

1430
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
one letter to represent the same thing
 

1431
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,430
one letter to represent the same thing
right

1432
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
right
 

1433
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,510

i think the idea is it's helpful to

1434
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
i think the idea is it's helpful to
 

1435
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,149
i think the idea is it's helpful to
stick to the letter in use in a song

1436
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
stick to the letter in use in a song
 

1437
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,630
stick to the letter in use in a song
because it shows how

1439

and they'll be playing on the left side

1470
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
and they'll be playing on the left side
 

1471

1473
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,830

editing or slow it down

1590
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
editing or slow it down
 

1591
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,070
editing or slow it down
if i ever had to do it in game i would

1592
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,080
if i ever had to do it in game i would
 

1593
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,830
if i ever had to do it in game i would
try to pick a song that had

1594
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
try to pick a song that had
 

1595
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,470
try to pick a song that had
a good matching tempo um

1596
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
a good matching tempo um
 

1597
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,149
a good matching tempo um
sometimes you get lucky and it you can

1598
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
sometimes you get lucky and it you can
 

1599
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,830
sometimes you get lucky and it you can
just do it with repeaters sometimes you

1600
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
just do it with repeaters sometimes you
 

1601
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,830
just do it with repeaters sometimes you
might need to use like minecart tracks

1602
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:23,840
might need to use like minecart tracks
 

1603
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,710
might need to use like minecart tracks
and detector rails or walking over

1604
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
and detector rails or walking over
 

1605
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,149
and detector rails or walking over
pressure plates

1606
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
pressure plates
 

1607
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,909
pressure plates
things that have like in-between timings

1608
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:29,919
things that have like in-between timings
 

1609
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,350
things that have like in-between timings
to repeaters

1610
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
to repeaters
 

1611
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,510
to repeaters
um yeah

1612
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,520
um yeah
 

1613
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,430
um yeah
i think for this one though so usually

1614
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
i think for this one though so usually
 

1615
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,789
i think for this one though so usually
what i'll do is i'll do a little sample

1616
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
what i'll do is i'll do a little sample
 

1617
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,909
what i'll do is i'll do a little sample
of the song

1618
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919

 

1619
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,830

way too slow right so that's good

1620
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
way too slow right so that's good
 

1621
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,230
way too slow right so that's good
because i don't really want this timing

1622
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
because i don't really want this timing
 

1623
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,029
because i don't really want this timing
i think i can get away with just the

1624
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
i think i can get away with just the
 

1625
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,909
i think i can get away with just the
sort of the defaults

1626
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919
sort of the defaults
 

1627
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,430
sort of the defaults
where the minimum

1628
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
where the minimum
 

1629
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,110
where the minimum
note timing is just one tick on the

1630
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
note timing is just one tick on the
 

1631
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,070
note timing is just one tick on the
repeater that's kind of what you want

1632
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
repeater that's kind of what you want
 

1633
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,510
repeater that's kind of what you want
okay so

1634
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520

 

1635
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,789

i think this one's supposed to be at

1636
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
i think this one's supposed to be at
 

1637
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,389
i think this one's supposed to be at
five

1638
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399

 

1639
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,070

so it's a little bit faster than like

1640
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
so it's a little bit faster than like
 

1641
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,350
so it's a little bit faster than like
what we heard in noteblock studio

1642
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360
what we heard in noteblock studio
 

1643
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,630
what we heard in noteblock studio
but i think it's close enough that we

1644
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
but i think it's close enough that we
 

1645
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,549
but i think it's close enough that we
can get away with it okay having a

1646
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
can get away with it okay having a
 

1647
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,909
can get away with it okay having a
little bit of trouble with this one it

1648
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
little bit of trouble with this one it
 

1649
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,190
little bit of trouble with this one it
turns out uh it's okay

1650
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,200
turns out uh it's okay
 

1651
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,830
turns out uh it's okay

um some of the timings are actually off

um some of the timings are actually off
 

1655
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,789
um some of the timings are actually off
i realized and now it's all built and if

00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
i realized and now it's all built and if
 

1657
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,630
i realized and now it's all built and if
i want to change it i have to like start

1658
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
i want to change it i have to like start
 

1659
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,149
i want to change it i have to like start
over so that's one thing you got to

1660
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:30,159
over so that's one thing you got to
 

1661
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,669
over so that's one thing you got to
really watch out for

1662
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
really watch out for
 

1663
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,549
really watch out for
uh the other thing is

uh the other thing is
 

1665
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,389
uh the other thing is
and if i try to change it i'm gonna have

1666
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:36,399
and if i try to change it i'm gonna have
 

1667
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,630
and if i try to change it i'm gonna have
to deal with the repeater timings not

1668
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
to deal with the repeater timings not
 

1669
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,149
to deal with the repeater timings not
matching up too well

1670
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
matching up too well
 

1671
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,990
matching up too well
and go with a different method and i

1672
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
and go with a different method and i
 

1673
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,950
and go with a different method and i
don't really want to do that so

1674
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
don't really want to do that so
 

1675
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,389
don't really want to do that so

1711
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,510
this is supposed to be bass but it's
piano so that really throws off the

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520
piano so that really throws off the
 

1713
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,669
piano so that really throws off the
sound of the song and on that note you

1714
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
sound of the song and on that note you
 

1715
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,990
sound of the song and on that note you
definitely want to try play your songs

definitely want to try play your songs
 

1717

definitely want to try play your songs

many times as you're building them
 

1719
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,350
many times as you're building them
because it's very easy to make a mistake

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,750

good length to it now we could we could
 

1741
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,750
good length to it now we could we could
make it more fancy and add the clicks

make it more fancy and add the clicks
 

1743
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,510
make it more fancy and add the clicks

it's very difficult to make endings in
minecraft series

1862

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,149
minecraft series
uh just by the nature of the game it's a

1864
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
uh just by the nature of the game it's a
 

1865
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,789
uh just by the nature of the game it's a
sandbox game with no real proper ending

1869
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,350
um
except for the dragon fight

1870
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360

1877
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,830
ending like that so

1939
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,950
like a few of them every single one so i
would have to spawn in

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
would have to spawn in
 

1941
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,669
would have to spawn in
a bajillion items to wrap up the series
