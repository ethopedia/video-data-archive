project like it's the small details I
 

149
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,710
project like it's the small details I
find boring but just hashing out the

150
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:55,720
find boring but just hashing out the
 

151
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,470
find boring but just hashing out the
idea and all that is the fun part to

152
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
idea and all that is the fun part to
 

153
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,230
idea and all that is the fun part to
begin with but there is a lot of

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,130
satisfaction actually finishing a
 

157
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,970
satisfaction actually finishing a
project while if you constantly start

158
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:05,980
project while if you constantly start
 

159
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,940

180
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
got some floors down over here and I
 

181
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,510
got some floors down over here and I
redid the wiring I decided to use my old

182
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:46,520
redid the wiring I decided to use my old
 

183
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,310
redid the wiring I decided to use my old
old wiring design the original which is

184
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,320
old wiring design the original which is
 

185
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,890
old wiring design the original which is
two blocks wider as I said but it's

186
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:53,900
two blocks wider as I said but it's
 

187
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
two blocks wider as I said but it's
going to work a lot better and it's a

188
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:55,910
going to work a lot better and it's a
 

189
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,900
going to work a lot better and it's a
lot easier to do so this is all this is

190
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:58,910
lot easier to do so this is all this is
 

191
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,320
lot easier to do so this is all this is
all the wiring down here in the middle

192
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,330
all the wiring down here in the middle
 

193
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:08,110
all the wiring down here in the middle
and I've got I have to put a top on this

194
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,120
and I've got I have to put a top on this
 

195
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,900
and I've got I have to put a top on this
still but we have the filling thing up

196

these as I let this thing run it's going
 

293
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,030
these as I let this thing run it's going
to take a long time now because it takes

294
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,040
to take a long time now because it takes
 

295
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,320
to take a long time now because it takes
20 or now 40 seconds each set of three

296
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,330
20 or now 40 seconds each set of three
 

297
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,300
20 or now 40 seconds each set of three
potions you make so it does take a long

298
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,310
potions you make so it does take a long
 

299
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,210
potions you make so it does take a long
time to fill up this chest but when that

300
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,220
time to fill up this chest but when that
 

301
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,860
time to fill up this chest but when that
fills up then this one's going to start

302
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:08,870
fills up then this one's going to start
 

303
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,620
fills up then this one's going to start
filling up of speed potions that are

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,650
eight minutes but they're not the splash
potions this one will fill up then with

308
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:17,660
potions this one will fill up then with
 

309
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,360

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:43,970
just finishing up what was left in the
 

329
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,840
just finishing up what was left in the
system so you can see there's no water

330
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:46,850
system so you can see there's no water
 

331
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,580
system so you can see there's no water
bottles in here because it ran out but

slimes in this room so when I redo it
 

389
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,770
slimes in this room so when I redo it
I'll have to put half slabs down

390
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:16,780
I'll have to put half slabs down
 

391
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,570
I'll have to put half slabs down
somewhere but - oh oh what is this I'm

will give me more space to work on the

402
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,230
will give me more space to work on the
 

403
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,280
will give me more space to work on the
entrance for this thing here not not too

come up with anything go through here I
 

411
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,090
come up with anything go through here I
have it shut down at the moment because

412
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,100
have it shut down at the moment because
 

413
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,970
have it shut down at the moment because
I ran out of nether warts and this

414
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:50,980
I ran out of nether warts and this

backside I was considering putting a
 

417
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,030
backside I was considering putting a
ladder in the back here to get up on top

418

it's access to the water bottle

420
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,450
it's access to the water bottle

refilling thing but you know

422
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:02,680
refilling thing but you know
 

423
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,439
refilling thing but you know
since we're having so many of these

424
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:04,449
since we're having so many of these
 

425
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,829
since we're having so many of these
things in this room it's probably worth

426
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
things in this room it's probably worth
 

427
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,109
things in this room it's probably worth
me making a system just for making

428
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:10,119
me making a system just for making
 

429
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,179
me making a system just for making
awkward potions so that's what we're

430
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:12,189
awkward potions so that's what we're
 

431
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,470
awkward potions so that's what we're
going to do instead instead of having

432
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:13,480
going to do instead instead of having
 

433
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,449
going to do instead instead of having
one of these brewing stands dedicated to

434
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:15,459
one of these brewing stands dedicated to
 

435
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,179
one of these brewing stands dedicated to
awkward potions I'm going to have mine

436
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:18,189

carts running around the top is building

438
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,110
carts running around the top is building
 

439
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,379
carts running around the top is building
feeding awkward potions to each of these

440
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:22,389
feeding awkward potions to each of these
 

441
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,090
feeding awkward potions to each of these
things instead of just straight water

442
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,100
things instead of just straight water
 

443
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,359
things instead of just straight water
bottles so one of the things we're going

444
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,369
bottles so one of the things we're going
 

445
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,090
bottles so one of the things we're going
to have to add into this build because

446
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,100
to have to add into this build because
 

447
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,090
to have to add into this build because
of that is a section dedicated to making

448
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,100
of that is a section dedicated to making
 

449
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,889
of that is a section dedicated to making
awkward potions probably lots of them

450
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:34,899
awkward potions probably lots of them
 

451
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,410
awkward potions probably lots of them
and a minecart system nets that

452
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:37,420
and a minecart system nets that
 

453
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,639
and a minecart system nets that
distributes them throughout the whole

454
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:38,649
distributes them throughout the whole
 

455
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:45,749
distributes them throughout the whole
place what else do we want to do I want

478
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
time constantly every part of my world
 

479
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,160
time constantly every part of my world
that's the big downfall of living

480
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,170
that's the big downfall of living
 

481
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,989
that's the big downfall of living
underground okay

482
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:26,999
underground okay
 

483
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,730
underground okay
so a long time ago I made a tutorial for

484
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:29,740
so a long time ago I made a tutorial for
 

485
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,009
so a long time ago I made a tutorial for
another word farm which I never ended up

486
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:32,019
another word farm which I never ended up
 

487
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,590
another word farm which I never ended up
building anywhere and I've always wanted

488
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:34,600
building anywhere and I've always wanted
 

489
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,720
building anywhere and I've always wanted
to so let's let's try to incorporate

490
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:36,730
to so let's let's try to incorporate
 

491
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,499
to so let's let's try to incorporate
that it's it's just a really small

492
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:40,509
that it's it's just a really small
 

493
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,780
that it's it's just a really small
simple thing to it's like I think it was

494
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:42,790
simple thing to it's like I think it was
 

495
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,860
simple thing to it's like I think it was
a bunch of slow sand

496
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:43,870
a bunch of slow sand
 

497
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,470
a bunch of slow sand
I might lower it even I'm not sure and

498
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
I might lower it even I'm not sure and
 

499
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,819
I might lower it even I'm not sure and
we'll put oops it was like a piston that

500
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:53,829
we'll put oops it was like a piston that
 

501
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:57,269
we'll put oops it was like a piston that
pushes a slow sand which makes all the

502
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
pushes a slow sand which makes all the
 

503
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,199
pushes a slow sand which makes all the
nether wart pop off then at the other

504
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:01,209
nether wart pop off then at the other
 

505
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:02,879
nether wart pop off then at the other
end there's a smart piston that pushes

506
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:02,889
end there's a smart piston that pushes
 

507
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:07,410
end there's a smart piston that pushes
it back right away

508
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:07,420

 

509
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:14,829

so that gets covered up we will have to

510
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:14,839
so that gets covered up we will have to
 

511
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,170
so that gets covered up we will have to
have a button here probably

512
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:19,180

 

513
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,230

I'll give this inventory nice and full

514
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
I'll give this inventory nice and full
 

515
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,800
I'll give this inventory nice and full
okay so that will push this alright and

516
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:29,810
okay so that will push this alright and
 

517
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,759
okay so that will push this alright and
then after after a second I think we

518
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:33,769
then after after a second I think we
 

519
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,129
then after after a second I think we
want to push this back because this

520
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:36,139
want to push this back because this
 

521
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,019
want to push this back because this
piston stays extended for a second we

522
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:38,029
piston stays extended for a second we
 

523
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,930
piston stays extended for a second we
can't push it back till it retracts

524
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:39,940
can't push it back till it retracts
 

525
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,650
can't push it back till it retracts
unless we set this up as a monostable to

526
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:44,660
unless we set this up as a monostable to
 

527
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,150
unless we set this up as a monostable to
activate this piston then we could push

528
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
activate this piston then we could push
 

529
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:55,720
activate this piston then we could push
it back a lot quicker sure all right

530
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:55,730
it back a lot quicker sure all right
 

531
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,949
it back a lot quicker sure all right
this is a slow part let's put a bunch of

532
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
this is a slow part let's put a bunch of
 

533
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:07,509
this is a slow part let's put a bunch of
stairs above here okay do I want it in

534
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
stairs above here okay do I want it in
 

535
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,699
stairs above here okay do I want it in
yeah I think I do want in give me a sec

536
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:09,709
yeah I think I do want in give me a sec
 

537
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,650
yeah I think I do want in give me a sec
I'll work on this and I'll show you it

538
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:11,660
I'll work on this and I'll show you it
 

539
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,269
I'll work on this and I'll show you it
afterwards okay so I got the farm set up

540
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:16,279
afterwards okay so I got the farm set up
 

541
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,809
afterwards okay so I got the farm set up
here I got one on each side each of

542
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:19,819
here I got one on each side each of
 

543
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,360
here I got one on each side each of
these has room for 10 netherwart so

544
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,370
these has room for 10 netherwart so
 

545
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,100
these has room for 10 netherwart so
that's 20 total we might want to make

546
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,110
that's 20 total we might want to make
 

547
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,670
that's 20 total we might want to make
some more farms in other places this is

548
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
some more farms in other places this is
 

549
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,490
some more farms in other places this is
kind of a mix of decoration and for

550
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:30,500
kind of a mix of decoration and for
 

551
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,740
kind of a mix of decoration and for
function helps to break up the room a

552
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:32,750
function helps to break up the room a
 

553
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,569
function helps to break up the room a
bit having and add some color to it so

554
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:37,579
bit having and add some color to it so
 

555
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,420
bit having and add some color to it so
the way it works piston pushes that

556
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,430
the way it works piston pushes that
 

557
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,550
the way it works piston pushes that
right then we have another piston over

558
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
right then we have another piston over
 

559
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,139
right then we have another piston over
here which pushes it back this is a

560
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:44,149
here which pushes it back this is a
 

561
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,280
here which pushes it back this is a
smart piston over there and a smart

562
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,290
smart piston over there and a smart
 

563
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,069
smart piston over there and a smart
piston is basically a name I made up for

564
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:51,079
piston is basically a name I made up for
 

565
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,030
piston is basically a name I made up for
Pistons a long time ago which indicates

566
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
Pistons a long time ago which indicates
 

567
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Pistons a long time ago which indicates
that they're intelligent enough to know

568
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,050
that they're intelligent enough to know
 

569
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,720
that they're intelligent enough to know
when a block is in front of them and to

570
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:58,730
when a block is in front of them and to
 

571
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:05,050
when a block is in front of them and to
automatically push it back so kind of

572
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,060
automatically push it back so kind of
 

573
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,850
automatically push it back so kind of
goes like that you pick up the nether

574
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:06,860
goes like that you pick up the nether
 

575
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,710
goes like that you pick up the nether
wart and replant it as you walk by you

576
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
wart and replant it as you walk by you
 

577
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,329
wart and replant it as you walk by you
have to walk on the slow sand

578
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:10,339
have to walk on the slow sand
 

579
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,550
have to walk on the slow sand
oops you don't have to walk on the

580
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
oops you don't have to walk on the
 

581
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,110
oops you don't have to walk on the
slowest end with this farm design which

582
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,120
slowest end with this farm design which
 

583
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,160
slowest end with this farm design which
is nice it's a straight line so this is

584
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,170
is nice it's a straight line so this is
 

585
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,620
is nice it's a straight line so this is
a smart piston setup

586
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:19,630
a smart piston setup
 

587
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:26,140
a smart piston setup
if let's just snag one of these if a

588
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,150
if let's just snag one of these if a
 

589
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,260
if let's just snag one of these if a
block goes above this redstone torch it

590
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,270
block goes above this redstone torch it
 

591
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,020
block goes above this redstone torch it
will send power to this dust and then I

592
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,030
will send power to this dust and then I
 

593
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,150
will send power to this dust and then I
have a nine tick delay here because we

594
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
have a nine tick delay here because we
 

595
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,250
have a nine tick delay here because we
need to give time for that other piston

596
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,260
need to give time for that other piston
 

597
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,010
need to give time for that other piston
to retract before this one extends so

598
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,020
to retract before this one extends so
 

599
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,580
to retract before this one extends so
watch what happens so your computer's

600
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:42,590
watch what happens so your computer's
 

601
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,280
watch what happens so your computer's
light up and then that goes and it

602
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,290
light up and then that goes and it
 

603
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,730
light up and then that goes and it
pushes all the blocks to the left

604
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:47,740
pushes all the blocks to the left
 

605
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,250
pushes all the blocks to the left
wow that grew really fast yeah that's

606
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,260
wow that grew really fast yeah that's
 

607
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,730
wow that grew really fast yeah that's
cool

608
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:54,740
cool
 

609
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,380
cool
and of course we got lights on the top

610
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,390
and of course we got lights on the top
 

611
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,260
and of course we got lights on the top
here which help help that too looks and

612
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,270
here which help help that too looks and
 

613
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,060
here which help help that too looks and
also light up the ground here I am

614
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,070
also light up the ground here I am
 

615
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,740
also light up the ground here I am
considering making some changes with

616
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:02,750
considering making some changes with
 

617
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,310
considering making some changes with
this so I might want to lower this slow

618
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
this so I might want to lower this slow
 

619
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,340
this so I might want to lower this slow
send down one block because it doesn't

620
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,350
send down one block because it doesn't
 

621
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,820
send down one block because it doesn't
look very nice I don't know what do you

622
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:12,830
look very nice I don't know what do you
 

623
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,910
look very nice I don't know what do you
guys think does it does it add to the

624
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
guys think does it does it add to the
 

625
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,240
guys think does it does it add to the
room or does it take away from the room

626
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,250
room or does it take away from the room
 

627
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,090
room or does it take away from the room
if I lower it I kind of need to add half

628
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,100
if I lower it I kind of need to add half
 

629
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,770
if I lower it I kind of need to add half
slabs or something here to prevent me

630
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:23,780
slabs or something here to prevent me
 

631
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,220
slabs or something here to prevent me
from from walking on it though like if

632
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,230
from from walking on it though like if
 

633
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,810
from from walking on it though like if
this is down one block I don't want to

634
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:28,820
this is down one block I don't want to
 

635
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,460
this is down one block I don't want to
walk on the slow sand that's the

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,470
walk on the slow sand that's the
 

637
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,330
walk on the slow sand that's the
advantage of having it up place it is

638
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,340
advantage of having it up place it is
 

639
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,670
advantage of having it up place it is
and of course if I have half slabs up

640
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:36,680
and of course if I have half slabs up

here I can have lights up there I'll
have to put them on the side somewhere

644

have to put them on the side somewhere
 

645
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,990
have to put them on the side somewhere

I'm considering for this room I'm
dreading making a ceiling for it like if

676
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:28,820
dreading making a ceiling for it like if
 

677
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,780
dreading making a ceiling for it like if
I make a huge ceiling it's going to be

678
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,790
I make a huge ceiling it's going to be
 

679
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,980
I make a huge ceiling it's going to be
it's going to take me a long time to

680
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:32,990
it's going to take me a long time to
 

681
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,550
it's going to take me a long time to
finish

682
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:33,560
finish
 

683
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,120
finish
project so what I might do instead I

684
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,130
project so what I might do instead I
 

685
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,690
project so what I might do instead I
might cheap out and just put half slabs

686
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:40,700
might cheap out and just put half slabs
 

687
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,540
might cheap out and just put half slabs
over the top like this and then hang

688
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:43,550
over the top like this and then hang
 

689
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,920
over the top like this and then hang
lighting it in the ceiling as well

690
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:44,930
lighting it in the ceiling as well
 

691
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,500
lighting it in the ceiling as well
because I need to get rid of these

692
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:46,510
because I need to get rid of these
 

693
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,600
because I need to get rid of these
torches and places like here if we could

694
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:49,610
torches and places like here if we could
 

695
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,030
torches and places like here if we could
just have a light above close to the

696
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,040
just have a light above close to the
 

697
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,440
just have a light above close to the
ground that would work too let's see

698
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,450
ground that would work too let's see
 

699
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,390
ground that would work too let's see
what this looks like if we do do it a

700
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
what this looks like if we do do it a
 

701
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,040
what this looks like if we do do it a
little ways and of course if you guys

702
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,050
little ways and of course if you guys
 

703
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:10,000
little ways and of course if you guys
have ideas let me know um this is just a

704
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,010
have ideas let me know um this is just a
 

705
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,250
have ideas let me know um this is just a
way to simplify doing the ceiling all

706
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,260
way to simplify doing the ceiling all
 

707
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,810
way to simplify doing the ceiling all
right how does that look I could live

708
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:19,820
right how does that look I could live
 

709
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,230
right how does that look I could live
with that

710
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240

 

711
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,670

doesn't even have to be half slabs I can

712
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:24,680
doesn't even have to be half slabs I can
 

713
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,220
doesn't even have to be half slabs I can
add a pattern to it if I want to use

714
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,230
add a pattern to it if I want to use
 

715
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,620
add a pattern to it if I want to use
pillars or even a different block type I

716
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:29,630
pillars or even a different block type I
 

717
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,400
pillars or even a different block type I
might use this clay instead of this I

718
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,410
might use this clay instead of this I
 

719
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,170
might use this clay instead of this I
think I should use something with

720
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:35,180
think I should use something with
 

721
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,870
think I should use something with
colorant above instead of it instead of

722
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:37,880
colorant above instead of it instead of
 

723
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,810
colorant above instead of it instead of
this actually yeah okay well moving on

724
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:43,820

730
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,510
have a plan that we're going to check
 

731
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,400
have a plan that we're going to check
out Wilson our good friend I haven't

732
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,410

735
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,540
forgotten about you so one thing we have
with Wilson is his hunger and the way

736
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:01,550
with Wilson is his hunger and the way
 

737
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,150
with Wilson is his hunger and the way
that's going to work as I've explained

738
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
that's going to work as I've explained
 

739
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,760
that's going to work as I've explained
many times before but over over time

740
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:06,770
many times before but over over time
 

741
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,280
many times before but over over time
he's going to constantly lose hunger

742
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,290
he's going to constantly lose hunger
 

743
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,200
he's going to constantly lose hunger
points so this is going to slowly drain

744
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,210
points so this is going to slowly drain
 

745
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,140
points so this is going to slowly drain
down based on time at a constant rate

746
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,150
down based on time at a constant rate
 

747
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,370
down based on time at a constant rate
and the thing is we also have this

748
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:18,380
and the thing is we also have this
 

749
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,080
and the thing is we also have this
happiness stat and that needs to

750
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,090
happiness stat and that needs to
 

751
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,380
happiness stat and that needs to
decrease some house as well and I don't

752
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,390
decrease some house as well and I don't
 

753
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,540
decrease some house as well and I don't
exactly want them to both decrease the

754
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,550
exactly want them to both decrease the
 

755
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,710
exactly want them to both decrease the
same way if they both decrease by time

756
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
same way if they both decrease by time
 

757
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,900
same way if they both decrease by time
it's it's almost like not worth having

758
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:31,910
it's it's almost like not worth having
 

759
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,850
it's it's almost like not worth having
another stat point happiness should be

760
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:33,860
another stat point happiness should be
 

761
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,820
another stat point happiness should be
different than hunger loss happiness

762
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:36,830
different than hunger loss happiness
 

763
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,110
different than hunger loss happiness
loss should be different from hunger

764
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,120
loss should be different from hunger
 

765
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,750
loss should be different from hunger
loss somehow so one idea I had is making

766
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
loss somehow so one idea I had is making
 

767
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,770
loss somehow so one idea I had is making
Wilson sort of self-aware like when I'm

768
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:46,780
Wilson sort of self-aware like when I'm
 

769
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,840
Wilson sort of self-aware like when I'm
in the area his happiness will go up

770
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:48,850
in the area his happiness will go up
 

771
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,960
in the area his happiness will go up
because he's glad I'm around home and if

772
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:51,970
because he's glad I'm around home and if
 

773
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,790
because he's glad I'm around home and if
I'm off somewheres else in my world I

774
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:53,800
I'm off somewheres else in my world I
 

775
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,830
I'm off somewheres else in my world I
want is happiness to slowly go down

776
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
want is happiness to slowly go down
 

777
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,960
want is happiness to slowly go down
maybe over time it's still kind of

778
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:00,970
maybe over time it's still kind of
 

779
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,290
maybe over time it's still kind of
similar to to the hunger because it's

780
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:04,300
similar to to the hunger because it's
 

781
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,720
similar to to the hunger because it's
going to be based on time but it's it's

782
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:06,730
going to be based on time but it's it's
 

783
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,700
going to be based on time but it's it's
also based on where I am in the world

784
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:08,710
also based on where I am in the world
 

785
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,840
also based on where I am in the world
and the way I'm gonna do that we're

786
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:12,850
and the way I'm gonna do that we're
 

787
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,220
and the way I'm gonna do that we're
gonna have to hop into a creative world

788
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,230
gonna have to hop into a creative world
 

789
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,990

guys well I got a few things I want to
 

795
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,590
guys well I got a few things I want to
show you as you may know I have quite

796
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
show you as you may know I have quite
 

797
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,480
show you as you may know I have quite
the interest in unloaded chunks lately

798
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:27,490
the interest in unloaded chunks lately
 

799
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,070
the interest in unloaded chunks lately
and the things you can do with them and

800
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,080
and the things you can do with them and
 

801
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,020
and the things you can do with them and
I'm going to show you some of those and

802
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,030
I'm going to show you some of those and
 

803
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm going to show you some of those and
also how we're going to use these with

804
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,010
also how we're going to use these with
 

805
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,600
also how we're going to use these with
Wilson so first up we have a redstone

806
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,610
Wilson so first up we have a redstone
 

807
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,210
Wilson so first up we have a redstone
clock here and every time it goes every

808
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:39,220
clock here and every time it goes every
 

809
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,940
clock here and every time it goes every
second here it says redstone because of

810
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:41,950
second here it says redstone because of
 

811
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,530
second here it says redstone because of
this command block and we are at about

812
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:45,540
this command block and we are at about
 

813
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,920
this command block and we are at about
1600 X and 0 Z so we're quite a ways

814
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:49,930
1600 X and 0 Z so we're quite a ways
 

815
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,370
1600 X and 0 Z so we're quite a ways
away from spawn at the moment now if we

816
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:53,380
away from spawn at the moment now if we
 

817
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,890
away from spawn at the moment now if we
if we teleport to 0 0 that clock keeps

818
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:58,900
if we teleport to 0 0 that clock keeps
 

819
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
if we teleport to 0 0 that clock keeps
running even though it's in an unloaded

820
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:00,910
running even though it's in an unloaded
 

821
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,120
running even though it's in an unloaded
chunk the chunk stays loaded to a

822
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,130
chunk the chunk stays loaded to a
 

823
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,020
chunk the chunk stays loaded to a
certain extent because of that clock not

824
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,030
certain extent because of that clock not
 

825
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,670
certain extent because of that clock not
everything works like it doesn't a

826
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:08,680
everything works like it doesn't a
 

827
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,450
everything works like it doesn't a
normal loaded chunk like random block

828
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:12,460
normal loaded chunk like random block
 

829
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,150
normal loaded chunk like random block
updates no longer occur so so like wheat

830
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,160
updates no longer occur so so like wheat
 

831
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,330
updates no longer occur so so like wheat
won't grow or trees won't grow or a

832
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:18,340
won't grow or trees won't grow or a
 

833
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,210
won't grow or trees won't grow or a
burnt-out redstone torch won't turn

834
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,220
burnt-out redstone torch won't turn
 

835
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,010
burnt-out redstone torch won't turn
itself back on that kind of stuff

836
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,020
itself back on that kind of stuff
 

837
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,930
itself back on that kind of stuff
doesn't happen but like redstone keeps

838
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:24,940
doesn't happen but like redstone keeps
 

839
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,610
doesn't happen but like redstone keeps
happening a good guy and we can control

840
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:29,620
happening a good guy and we can control
 

841
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,190
happening a good guy and we can control
things with the redstone even like if we

842
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,200
things with the redstone even like if we
 

843
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,040
things with the redstone even like if we
if we head back there let's change our

844
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,050
if we head back there let's change our
 

845
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,570
if we head back there let's change our
time time set 0 yeah I got it right if

846
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:39,580
time time set 0 yeah I got it right if
 

847
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,130
time time set 0 yeah I got it right if
we head back here we have the Spencer

848
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,140
we head back here we have the Spencer
 

849
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,860
we head back here we have the Spencer
full of TNT here we can activate

850
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:46,870
full of TNT here we can activate
 

851
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,920
full of TNT here we can activate
dispensers or a number of other redstone

852
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:49,930
dispensers or a number of other redstone
 

853
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:56,400
dispensers or a number of other redstone
devices let's get ready to go back ok go

854
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,410
devices let's get ready to go back ok go
 

855
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,200
devices let's get ready to go back ok go
forward

856
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,210
forward
 

857
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,880
forward
okay I don't want to mess this up

858
00:21:59,880 --> 00:21:59,890
okay I don't want to mess this up
 

859
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,040
okay I don't want to mess this up
because I want to leave as soon as it

860
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,050
because I want to leave as soon as it
 

861
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,100
because I want to leave as soon as it
starts going okay so the next one we go

862
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,110
starts going okay so the next one we go
 

863
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,120
starts going okay so the next one we go
got press up twice okay so we can hang

864
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,130
got press up twice okay so we can hang
 

865
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,010
got press up twice okay so we can hang
out here for a while and meanwhile

866
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,020
out here for a while and meanwhile
 

867
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,660
out here for a while and meanwhile
that's sending pulses to the dispenser

868
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:15,670
that's sending pulses to the dispenser
 

869
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,370
that's sending pulses to the dispenser
we had three stacks of TNT in there when

870
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:17,380
we had three stacks of TNT in there when
 

871
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,770
we had three stacks of TNT in there when
we left now we can even go in the nether

872
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:19,780
we left now we can even go in the nether
 

873
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,370
we left now we can even go in the nether
here and it's still running hey everyone

874
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,380

 

875
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,210

so pretty cool however what is not

876
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,220
so pretty cool however what is not
 

877
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,840
so pretty cool however what is not
happening is that TNT entity that's that

878
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:33,850
happening is that TNT entity that's that
 

879
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,490
happening is that TNT entity that's that
gets created when the dispenser shoots

880
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:35,500
gets created when the dispenser shoots
 

881
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,290
gets created when the dispenser shoots
out the TNT that is not being processed

882
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:37,300
out the TNT that is not being processed
 

883
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,110
out the TNT that is not being processed
so when we return we're going to have

884
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
so when we return we're going to have
 

885
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,770
so when we return we're going to have
like dozens and dozens of TNT all going

886
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:43,780
like dozens and dozens of TNT all going
 

887
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,570
like dozens and dozens of TNT all going
off at the exact same time here well

888
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:45,580
off at the exact same time here well
 

889
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,250
off at the exact same time here well
probably one's going to go off and then

890
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:47,260
probably one's going to go off and then
 

891
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,200
probably one's going to go off and then
at under is going to go off because we

892
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,210
at under is going to go off because we
 

893
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,120
at under is going to go off because we
saw one you out already so let's return

894
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,130

 

895
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,590

all right hope this doesn't blow

896
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
all right hope this doesn't blow
 

897
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,320
all right hope this doesn't blow
anything up oh okay well you see I

898
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,330
anything up oh okay well you see I
 

899
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,470
anything up oh okay well you see I
wasn't quite full oh and look at that it

900
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
wasn't quite full oh and look at that it
 

901
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,000
wasn't quite full oh and look at that it
just missed everything I said up here

902
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,010
just missed everything I said up here
 

903
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,190
just missed everything I said up here
that was beautiful

904
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
that was beautiful
 

905
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,250
that was beautiful
okay so one of my plans with Wilson is

906
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:11,260
okay so one of my plans with Wilson is
 

907
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,910
okay so one of my plans with Wilson is
to have a clock running similar to this

908
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:13,920
to have a clock running similar to this
 

909
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,980
to have a clock running similar to this
so that when I leave the area stuff with

910
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:16,990
so that when I leave the area stuff with
 

911
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,930
so that when I leave the area stuff with
Wilson is still happening it like he's

912
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:18,940
Wilson is still happening it like he's
 

913
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,810
Wilson is still happening it like he's
still he's still losing hunger as I'm

914
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:21,820
still he's still losing hunger as I'm
 

915
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,600
still he's still losing hunger as I'm
outside of the loaded chunk area um

916
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,610
outside of the loaded chunk area um
 

917
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,520
outside of the loaded chunk area um
so I can be off far far away and he's

918
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,530
so I can be off far far away and he's
 

919
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,050
so I can be off far far away and he's
still losing hunger points and he can

920
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,060
still losing hunger points and he can
 

921
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,870
still losing hunger points and he can
still you can still process everything

922
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:33,880
still you can still process everything
 

923
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,770
still you can still process everything
right another chunk loader design I saw

924
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:37,780
right another chunk loader design I saw
 

925
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,250
right another chunk loader design I saw
this was made by simply Sark is he

926
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:41,260
this was made by simply Sark is he
 

927
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,740
this was made by simply Sark is he
figured out you can just have to hoppers

928
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:43,750
figured out you can just have to hoppers
 

929
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,460
figured out you can just have to hoppers
stitch between two chunks so we're

930
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,470
stitch between two chunks so we're
 

931
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,470
stitch between two chunks so we're
between chunks right now look at the

932
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:49,480
between chunks right now look at the
 

933
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,360
between chunks right now look at the
z-coordinate it's a negative zero if I'm

934
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,370
z-coordinate it's a negative zero if I'm
 

935
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,450
z-coordinate it's a negative zero if I'm
here and it's a positive zero if I'm

936
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:54,460
here and it's a positive zero if I'm
 

937
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,300
here and it's a positive zero if I'm
here so right down this line is a chunk

938
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,310
here so right down this line is a chunk
 

939
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,780
here so right down this line is a chunk
of boundary right here so this items

940
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,790
of boundary right here so this items
 

941
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,580
of boundary right here so this items
bouncing back and forth between the

942
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:02,590
bouncing back and forth between the
 

943
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,430
bouncing back and forth between the
hoppers and that's going to go to a man

944
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
hoppers and that's going to go to a man
 

945
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,230
hoppers and that's going to go to a man
block that says say hoppers so when we

946
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,240
block that says say hoppers so when we
 

947
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,410
block that says say hoppers so when we
leave I find this I don't know if it

948
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:10,420
leave I find this I don't know if it
 

949
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,730
leave I find this I don't know if it
always works the

950
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:11,740
always works the
 

951
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,090
always works the
secede yeah I haven't been able to get

952
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,100
secede yeah I haven't been able to get
 

953
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,919
secede yeah I haven't been able to get
this one to work

954
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:15,929
this one to work
 

955
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:22,380
this one to work
but I know for a while it was okay so

956
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,390
but I know for a while it was okay so
 

957
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,190
but I know for a while it was okay so
that one's a little more finicky 1600

958
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,200
that one's a little more finicky 1600
 

959
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,340
that one's a little more finicky 1600
and the world's not loading um

960
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,350
and the world's not loading um
 

961
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,400
and the world's not loading um
one second what do I do i press at three

962
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,410
one second what do I do i press at three
 

963
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,740
one second what do I do i press at three
a now I might have to reload here this

964
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:40,750
a now I might have to reload here this
 

965
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,530
a now I might have to reload here this
is pretty bad i over teleported the game

966
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:46,540
is pretty bad i over teleported the game
 

967
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,340
is pretty bad i over teleported the game
didn't like that okay one sec all right

968
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,350
didn't like that okay one sec all right
 

969
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,710
didn't like that okay one sec all right
we're back I don't know why that happens

970
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
we're back I don't know why that happens
 

971
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,380
we're back I don't know why that happens
but sometimes the world just refuses to

972
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:55,390
but sometimes the world just refuses to
 

973
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,120
but sometimes the world just refuses to
load like that you have to real aughh

974
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,130
load like that you have to real aughh
 

975
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,140
load like that you have to real aughh
but I did get this hopper one working so

976
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,150
but I did get this hopper one working so
 

977
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,299
but I did get this hopper one working so
let's try it see if we can show it

978
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:03,309
let's try it see if we can show it
 

979
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:08,760
let's try it see if we can show it
didn't work go back there we go okay

980
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:08,770
didn't work go back there we go okay
 

981
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,910
didn't work go back there we go okay
it's working it doesn't always work same

982
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:11,920
it's working it doesn't always work same
 

983
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,260
it's working it doesn't always work same
with the redstone one that sometimes

984
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,270
with the redstone one that sometimes
 

985
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,240
with the redstone one that sometimes
doesn't work but you can see we're by

986
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,250
doesn't work but you can see we're by
 

987
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,980
doesn't work but you can see we're by
the portal here which is at 0-0 so that

988
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:18,990
the portal here which is at 0-0 so that
 

989
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,230
the portal here which is at 0-0 so that
those two hoppers way out at like 1600

990
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
those two hoppers way out at like 1600
 

991
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,450
those two hoppers way out at like 1600
are definitely in unloaded chunks but

992
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:24,460
are definitely in unloaded chunks but
 

993
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,880
are definitely in unloaded chunks but
the chunks are getting forced loaded by

994
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:26,890
the chunks are getting forced loaded by
 

995
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,220
the chunks are getting forced loaded by
the hoppers because it's passing an item

996
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:29,230
the hoppers because it's passing an item
 

997
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,310
the hoppers because it's passing an item
in between two chunks and so it's

998
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
in between two chunks and so it's
 

999
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,680
in between two chunks and so it's
keeping them keeping them working to a

1000
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:34,690
keeping them keeping them working to a
 

1001
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,010
keeping them keeping them working to a
certain extent but not everything is is

1002
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,020
certain extent but not everything is is
 

1003
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,360
certain extent but not everything is is
working in that or in the in the chunk

1004
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,370
working in that or in the in the chunk
 

1005
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,210
working in that or in the in the chunk
so entities like this mine cart stops

1006
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:45,220
so entities like this mine cart stops
 

1007
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,480
so entities like this mine cart stops
moving once I leave if we have an item

1008
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:48,490
moving once I leave if we have an item
 

1009
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,340
moving once I leave if we have an item
on the ground it's not going to de-spawn

1010
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,350
on the ground it's not going to de-spawn
 

1011
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,340
on the ground it's not going to de-spawn
when I leave even though the chunk is

1012
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,350
when I leave even though the chunk is
 

1013
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,060
when I leave even though the chunk is
being loaded to a certain extent by this

1014
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,070
being loaded to a certain extent by this
 

1015
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,880
being loaded to a certain extent by this
just entities don't get processed like

1016
00:25:59,880 --> 00:25:59,890
just entities don't get processed like
 

1017
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,230
just entities don't get processed like
if I throw an ender pearl it's going to

1018
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,240
if I throw an ender pearl it's going to
 

1019
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,610
if I throw an ender pearl it's going to
stop moving until I come back

1020
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:04,620
stop moving until I come back
 

1021
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,470
stop moving until I come back
um maybe I'll try to show that and

1022
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:09,480
um maybe I'll try to show that and
 

1023
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,290
um maybe I'll try to show that and
hopefully the hopper thing stays loaded

1024
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:12,300
hopefully the hopper thing stays loaded
 

1025
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,580
hopefully the hopper thing stays loaded
throw it right by the hoppers

1026
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:16,590
throw it right by the hoppers
 

1027
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,330
throw it right by the hoppers
okay let's get good ready to move oh and

1028
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:21,340
okay let's get good ready to move oh and
 

1029
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,879
okay let's get good ready to move oh and
the hoppers didn't the hoppers stop

1030
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:23,889
the hoppers didn't the hoppers stop
 

1031
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:28,379
the hoppers didn't the hoppers stop
started okay it's still falling you see

1032
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:28,389
started okay it's still falling you see
 

1033
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:31,169
started okay it's still falling you see
the hoppers running but when we return

1034
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:31,179
the hoppers running but when we return
 

1035
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:35,129
the hoppers running but when we return
the enderpearls gonna reload and we're

1036
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:35,139
the enderpearls gonna reload and we're
 

1037
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:37,999
the enderpearls gonna reload and we're
going to get teleported somewhere aerial

1038
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:38,009
going to get teleported somewhere aerial
 

1039
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:41,460
going to get teleported somewhere aerial
so even though these were running the

1040
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:41,470
so even though these were running the
 

1041
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,979
so even though these were running the
enderpearl wasn't moving so there's a

1042
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:43,989
enderpearl wasn't moving so there's a
 

1043
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:45,470
enderpearl wasn't moving so there's a
demonstration

1044
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:45,480
demonstration
 

1045
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,169
demonstration
so to summarize my plan basically I'm

1046
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:49,179
so to summarize my plan basically I'm
 

1047
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:51,690
so to summarize my plan basically I'm
going to have one of these clocks that

1048
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:51,700
going to have one of these clocks that
 

1049
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,419
going to have one of these clocks that
keeps the chunks loaded or hopefully

1050
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:54,429
keeps the chunks loaded or hopefully
 

1051
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:58,049
keeps the chunks loaded or hopefully
does and then a minecart or some other

1052
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,059
does and then a minecart or some other
 

1053
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:00,779
does and then a minecart or some other
entity that's doing something that we

1054
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:00,789
entity that's doing something that we
 

1055
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,820
entity that's doing something that we
can detect it's it's moving or doing

1056
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:02,830
can detect it's it's moving or doing
 

1057
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,060
can detect it's it's moving or doing
whatever if the clock is running and the

1058
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,070
whatever if the clock is running and the
 

1059
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,820
whatever if the clock is running and the
minecart is not moving that means I'm

1060
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:08,830
minecart is not moving that means I'm
 

1061
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,609
minecart is not moving that means I'm
far away from Wilson the chunks unloaded

1062
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:11,619
far away from Wilson the chunks unloaded
 

1063
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:15,659
far away from Wilson the chunks unloaded
if the clock is running and the minecart

1064
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:15,669
if the clock is running and the minecart
 

1065
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,669
if the clock is running and the minecart
is moving that means I'm close to Wilson

1066
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
is moving that means I'm close to Wilson
 

1067
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,289
is moving that means I'm close to Wilson
so that's that's about it so that's how

1068
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:22,299
so that's that's about it so that's how
 

1069
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:25,499
so that's that's about it so that's how
I'm going to determine if Wilson should

1070
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:25,509
I'm going to determine if Wilson should
 

1071
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:28,739
I'm going to determine if Wilson should
gain or lose happiness if if I'm close

1072
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:28,749
gain or lose happiness if if I'm close
 

1073
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:30,479
gain or lose happiness if if I'm close
to Wilson he'll gain happiness if I'm

1074
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:30,489
to Wilson he'll gain happiness if I'm
 

1075
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:33,090
to Wilson he'll gain happiness if I'm
far away he'll he'll get sad and he'll

1076
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,100
far away he'll he'll get sad and he'll
 

1077
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,950
far away he'll he'll get sad and he'll
lose happiness and this guy just wrecked

1078
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:37,960
lose happiness and this guy just wrecked
 

1079
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,470
lose happiness and this guy just wrecked
me he got me down to three arts and

1080
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
me he got me down to three arts and
 

1081
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,989
me he got me down to three arts and
before he finished me off he decided

1082
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:42,999
before he finished me off he decided
 

1083
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:45,749
before he finished me off he decided
he's gonna move and get a closer shot

1084
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:45,759
he's gonna move and get a closer shot
 

1085
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,680
he's gonna move and get a closer shot
and he got stuck haha

1086
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:48,690
and he got stuck haha
 

1087
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,299
and he got stuck haha
but anyway it's it's that time again

1088
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:51,309
but anyway it's it's that time again
 

1089
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,669
but anyway it's it's that time again
everyone time to call it an end for the

1090
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
everyone time to call it an end for the
 

1091
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,220
everyone time to call it an end for the
