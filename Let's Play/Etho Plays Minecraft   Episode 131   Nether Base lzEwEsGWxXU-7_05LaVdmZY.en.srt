he figured out that if he got glowstone

20
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
he figured out that if he got glowstone
 

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,790
he figured out that if he got glowstone
above

22
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
above
 

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,910
above
that's the netherwarts below the

24
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
that's the netherwarts below the
 

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,350
that's the netherwarts below the
glowstone will

26
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
glowstone will
 

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,670
glowstone will
break off so this one broke off here

28
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
break off so this one broke off here
 

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,950
break off so this one broke off here
directly above is glowstone

30
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
directly above is glowstone
 

31
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,430
directly above is glowstone
but one next to it one one block this

32
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
but one next to it one one block this
 

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,110
but one next to it one one block this
way is this one

34
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
way is this one
 

35
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,189
way is this one
if you place one next to it it doesn't

36
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
if you place one next to it it doesn't
 

37
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,349
if you place one next to it it doesn't
break off so

38
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
break off so
 

39
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,670
break off so
i guess that's it he also said lava

40
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
i guess that's it he also said lava
 

41
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,590
i guess that's it he also said lava
natural lava will do it i haven't tried

42
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
natural lava will do it i haven't tried
 

43
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,510
natural lava will do it i haven't tried
that and i probably won't

44
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
that and i probably won't
 

45
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,429
that and i probably won't
um he also said the glowstone has to be

46
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
um he also said the glowstone has to be
 

47
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,590
um he also said the glowstone has to be
naturally there like the game generation

48
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
naturally there like the game generation
 

49
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,270
naturally there like the game generation
code has to have it there

50
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
code has to have it there
 

51
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,710
code has to have it there
but we're going to try to play some and

52
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
but we're going to try to play some and
 

53
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,469
but we're going to try to play some and
see what happens too

54
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479

 

55
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,030

enchantment time here we go

56
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
enchantment time here we go
 

57
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,149
enchantment time here we go
yeah i'll take it

58
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159

 

59
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,830

all right so we got some natural

60
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
all right so we got some natural
 

61
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,590
all right so we got some natural
glowstone up there that was generated

62
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
glowstone up there that was generated
 

63
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,950
glowstone up there that was generated
with the map

64
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
with the map
 

65
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,910
with the map
and we will try to do this test before a

66
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
and we will try to do this test before a
 

67
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,310
and we will try to do this test before a
whole bunch of gas get here

68
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
whole bunch of gas get here
 

69
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,670
whole bunch of gas get here
but uh so again like right above here

70
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
but uh so again like right above here
 

71
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,510
but uh so again like right above here
there's no glowstone

72
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
there's no glowstone
 

73
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,190
there's no glowstone
so it doesn't pop out of the ground

74
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
so it doesn't pop out of the ground
 

75
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,350
so it doesn't pop out of the ground
would you get out of here if we go

76
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
would you get out of here if we go
 

77
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,749
would you get out of here if we go
one block over it does pop out of the

78
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
one block over it does pop out of the
 

79
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,350
one block over it does pop out of the
ground

80
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
ground
 

81
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,149
ground
so that still seems to be true uh now

82
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
so that still seems to be true uh now
 

83
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,510
so that still seems to be true uh now
what we'll do is we'll

84
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
what we'll do is we'll
 

85
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,550
what we'll do is we'll
i brought some glowstone with me

86
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
i brought some glowstone with me
 

87
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,709
i brought some glowstone with me
as much as i hate placing it here we are

88
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
as much as i hate placing it here we are
 

89
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,270
as much as i hate placing it here we are
going to

90
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
going to
 

91
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,110
going to
we're going to try overlap a section

92
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
we're going to try overlap a section
 

93
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,949
we're going to try overlap a section
that already has glowstone and then put

94
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
that already has glowstone and then put
 

95
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,910
that already has glowstone and then put
some

96
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
some
 

97
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,270
some
where there is none as well so let's do

98
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
where there is none as well so let's do
 

99
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,670
where there is none as well so let's do
it

100
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
it
 

101
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,949
it
i guess right over here

102
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959

 

103
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,990

well we'll maybe only place nine or so

104
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
well we'll maybe only place nine or so
 

105
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,470
well we'll maybe only place nine or so
okay so we'll put it over here has to be

106
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
okay so we'll put it over here has to be
 

107
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,390
okay so we'll put it over here has to be
far enough away for this

108
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
far enough away for this
 

109
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,670
far enough away for this
test because if it's if it's close

110
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
test because if it's if it's close
 

111
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,830
test because if it's if it's close
uh the light from it will prevent it

112
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
uh the light from it will prevent it
 

113
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,790
uh the light from it will prevent it
from popping out anyway

114
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
from popping out anyway
 

115
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,750
from popping out anyway
so there let's try that out ouch

116
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760

 

117
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,910

get rid of this dirt if we can

118
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
get rid of this dirt if we can
 

119
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,750
get rid of this dirt if we can
we got some mushrooms growing on the

120
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
we got some mushrooms growing on the
 

121
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,110
we got some mushrooms growing on the
glowstone up there too that's kind of

122
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
glowstone up there too that's kind of
 

123
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,589
glowstone up there too that's kind of
cool

124
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599

 

125
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,830

okay gotta go higher

126
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840

 

127
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,869

higher

128
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
higher
 

129
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,149
higher
there we go

130
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159

 

131
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,990

all right so where does it overlap right

132
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
all right so where does it overlap right
 

133
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,830
all right so where does it overlap right
right above us here's an overlapping

134
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
right above us here's an overlapping
 

135
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,910
right above us here's an overlapping
area

136
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920

 

137
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,390

so that's natural and self-placed

138
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
so that's natural and self-placed
 

139
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,830
so that's natural and self-placed
glowstone oh it just disappeared

140
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
glowstone oh it just disappeared
 

141
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,229
glowstone oh it just disappeared
on its own that's never happened before

142
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
on its own that's never happened before
 

143
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,910
on its own that's never happened before
maybe it grew it probably grew that's

144
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
maybe it grew it probably grew that's
 

145
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,430
maybe it grew it probably grew that's
why it disappeared

146
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440

 

147
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,350

okay so it is popping out

148
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360

 

149
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,789

and then let's above our own glowstone

150
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
and then let's above our own glowstone
 

151
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,149
and then let's above our own glowstone
um no glowstone there so that shouldn't

152
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
um no glowstone there so that shouldn't
 

153
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,229
um no glowstone there so that shouldn't
pop out

154
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
pop out
 

155
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,149
pop out
but right here

156
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159

 

157
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,710

doesn't pop out and that's glowstone we

158
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
doesn't pop out and that's glowstone we
 

159
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,229
doesn't pop out and that's glowstone we
placed ourselves so it

160
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
placed ourselves so it
 

161
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,589
placed ourselves so it
has to be generated with

162
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
has to be generated with
 

163
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,789
has to be generated with
map for it to do that for whatever

164
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
map for it to do that for whatever
 

165
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,949
map for it to do that for whatever
reason i have no idea why

166
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959

 

167
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,229

all right everybody so the new plan is

168
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
all right everybody so the new plan is
 

169
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,550
all right everybody so the new plan is
to move our nether base to this area

170
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
to move our nether base to this area
 

171
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,590
to move our nether base to this area
here to this

172
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
here to this
 

173
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,509
here to this
new fortress we found because we have

174
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
new fortress we found because we have
 

175
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,950
new fortress we found because we have
the two blaze spawners

176
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
the two blaze spawners
 

177
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,629
the two blaze spawners
we got that one over there and this one

178
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
we got that one over there and this one
 

179
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,350
we got that one over there and this one
over here so we're going to have an

180
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
over here so we're going to have an
 

181
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,990
over here so we're going to have an
excellent

182
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
excellent
 

183
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,510
excellent
xp farm very shortly i'm going to

184
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
xp farm very shortly i'm going to
 

185
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,189
xp farm very shortly i'm going to
start building that today

186
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199

 

187
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,390

um i'll do most of it off camera because

188
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
um i'll do most of it off camera because
 

189
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,870
um i'll do most of it off camera because
you've

190
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
you've
 

191
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,150
you've
you guys have seen how to build it

192
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
you guys have seen how to build it
 

193
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,990
you guys have seen how to build it
already i have a tutorial on it too if

194
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
already i have a tutorial on it too if
 

195
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,590
already i have a tutorial on it too if
you want to check it out

196
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
you want to check it out
 

197
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,550
you want to check it out
as do other people they have there's

198
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
as do other people they have there's
 

199
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,189
as do other people they have there's
lots of blaze farm tutorials out there

200
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
lots of blaze farm tutorials out there
 

201
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,230
lots of blaze farm tutorials out there
uh what i'm gonna do

202
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
uh what i'm gonna do
 

203
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,670
uh what i'm gonna do
the good thing is i have these fire

204
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
the good thing is i have these fire
 

205
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,270
the good thing is i have these fire
resistant potions this time

206
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
resistant potions this time
 

207
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,270
resistant potions this time
but what we'll do is uh

208
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280

 

209
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,590

i like there's two options i could try

210
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
i like there's two options i could try
 

211
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,670
i like there's two options i could try
to get both

212
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
to get both
 

213
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,510
to get both
try connect both of them together so the

214
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
try connect both of them together so the
 

215
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,590
try connect both of them together so the
blades end up in one holding area in the

216
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
blades end up in one holding area in the
 

217
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,590
blades end up in one holding area in the
middle or something

218
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
middle or something
 

219
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,590
middle or something
or i could have two separate holding

220
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
or i could have two separate holding
 

221
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,430
or i could have two separate holding
areas

222
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
areas
 

223
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,029
areas
having one is better obviously but

224
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
having one is better obviously but
 

225
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,590
having one is better obviously but
i think i'm gonna do two separate ones

226
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
i think i'm gonna do two separate ones
 

227
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,469
i think i'm gonna do two separate ones
because they're so far apart

228
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
because they're so far apart
 

229
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,150
because they're so far apart
would just be a lot simpler that way

230
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
would just be a lot simpler that way
 

231
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,710
would just be a lot simpler that way
and otherwise you got to make the blaze

232
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
and otherwise you got to make the blaze
 

233
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,230
and otherwise you got to make the blaze
travel like

234
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
travel like
 

235
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,590
travel like
10 blocks to the center which uh would

236
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
10 blocks to the center which uh would
 

237
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,189
10 blocks to the center which uh would
take a lot of pistons

238
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
take a lot of pistons
 

239
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,070
take a lot of pistons
to do quickly or it'll take them a long

240
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
to do quickly or it'll take them a long
 

241
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,189
to do quickly or it'll take them a long
time to find their way on their own

242
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
time to find their way on their own
 

243
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,469
time to find their way on their own
um so i'll have two separate holding

244
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
um so i'll have two separate holding
 

245
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,990
um so i'll have two separate holding
areas but i'm only going to use

246
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
areas but i'm only going to use
 

247
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,990
areas but i'm only going to use
one i'm going to connect them both

248
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
one i'm going to connect them both
 

249
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,830
one i'm going to connect them both
together with the same redstone

250
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
together with the same redstone
 

251
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,110
together with the same redstone
circuitry

252
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
circuitry
 

253
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,510
circuitry
okay so i'm going to get started here

254
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
okay so i'm going to get started here
 

255
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,390
okay so i'm going to get started here
hopefully all goes well i'll see you in

256
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
hopefully all goes well i'll see you in
 

257
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,909
hopefully all goes well i'll see you in
a little bit i might do

258
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
a little bit i might do
 

259
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,270
a little bit i might do
i might show you a few clips of me

260
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
i might show you a few clips of me
 

261
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,870
i might show you a few clips of me
building it too

262
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880

 

263
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,070

all right everybody i'm going to give

264
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
all right everybody i'm going to give
 

265
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,150
all right everybody i'm going to give
you a little update here what's going on

266
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
you a little update here what's going on
 

267

you a little update here what's going on
we got them disabled i managed to do it

268
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
we got them disabled i managed to do it
 

269
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,909
we got them disabled i managed to do it
without dying

270
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
without dying
 

271
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,990
without dying
it wasn't wasn't all that difficult

272
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
it wasn't wasn't all that difficult
 

273
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,430
it wasn't wasn't all that difficult
i ran out of potions so i should have

274
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
i ran out of potions so i should have
 

275
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,270
i ran out of potions so i should have
brought more but

276
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
brought more but
 

277
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,469
brought more but
i was i was able to deal with them still

278
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
i was i was able to deal with them still
 

279
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,230
i was i was able to deal with them still
they are at the same height these

280
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
they are at the same height these
 

281
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,150
they are at the same height these
spawners and they are the same x

282
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
spawners and they are the same x
 

283
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,590
spawners and they are the same x
coordinate so they're perfectly aligned

284
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
coordinate so they're perfectly aligned
 

285
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,710
coordinate so they're perfectly aligned
it'll be uh really easy to

286
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
it'll be uh really easy to
 

287
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,590
it'll be uh really easy to
connect them together because of that

288
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
connect them together because of that
 

289
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,870
connect them together because of that
and

290
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
and
 

291
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,430
and
never did count the block distance one

292
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
never did count the block distance one
 

293
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,390

it's not bad

302
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120

 

303
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,710

so i've just been clearing out area

304
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
so i've just been clearing out area
 

305
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,230
so i've just been clearing out area
around them and

306
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
around them and
 

307
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,390
around them and
between them to do myself some working

308
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
between them to do myself some working
 

309
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,909
between them to do myself some working
area here

doing the fast mining trick with iron

312
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
doing the fast mining trick with iron

picks

314
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
picks
 

315
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,309
picks
i guess they're quick enough to do it

316
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
i guess they're quick enough to do it
 

317
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,510
i guess they're quick enough to do it
otherwise it's uh

318
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520

 

319
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,830

it's a lot slower mining

320
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840

 

321
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,550

it's really easy to do it with

322
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560

 

323
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,670

with iron picks here it's nice uh i was

324
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
with iron picks here it's nice uh i was
 

325
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,309
with iron picks here it's nice uh i was
also looking at the comments

also looking at the comments
for last episode and it seems the reason

for last episode and it seems the reason
i'm having that issue with

i'm having that issue with

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,710
i'm having that issue with

have that problem
 

343
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,629
have that problem
uh if i go to new areas that are

i shouldn't have that problem but

00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
i shouldn't have that problem but
 

349
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,430
i shouldn't have that problem but
there's no way of me fixing it without

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
there's no way of me fixing it without
 

351
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,029
there's no way of me fixing it without
using mcedit which i

00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
using mcedit which i
 

353
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,710
using mcedit which i
probably won't do that would

354
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
probably won't do that would
 

355

can't go wrong with it really

406
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
can't go wrong with it really
 

407
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,710
can't go wrong with it really
um i'll have to be careful though with

408
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
um i'll have to be careful though with
 

409
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,190
um i'll have to be careful though with
gas

410
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
gas
 

411
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,030
gas
because they can blow sandstone up with

412
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
because they can blow sandstone up with
 

413
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,550
because they can blow sandstone up with
their fireballs so i'll have to

414
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
their fireballs so i'll have to
 

415
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,750
their fireballs so i'll have to
gas proof this area but i think as long

416
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
gas proof this area but i think as long
 

417
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,670
gas proof this area but i think as long
as i put a half slab or something every

418
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
as i put a half slab or something every
 

419
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,550
as i put a half slab or something every
five by five area on the ground they

420
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
five by five area on the ground they
 

421
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,070
five by five area on the ground they
shouldn't be able to spawn

422
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
shouldn't be able to spawn
 

423
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,110
shouldn't be able to spawn
even if i have a big open area here

424
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
even if i have a big open area here
 

425
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,170
even if i have a big open area here
i think it's five by five pretty sure

426
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,180
i think it's five by five pretty sure
 

427
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,550
i think it's five by five pretty sure

okay moving on

430
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040

 

431
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,949

the only issue with sandstone of course

432
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
the only issue with sandstone of course
 

433
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,630
the only issue with sandstone of course
is it's a little bit more work to gather

434
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
is it's a little bit more work to gather
 

435
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,949
is it's a little bit more work to gather
it

436
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
it
 

437
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,790
it
but yeah even that's fun

438
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
but yeah even that's fun
 

439
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,630
but yeah even that's fun
i want to try this run by thing see if

440
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
i want to try this run by thing see if
 

441
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,110
i want to try this run by thing see if
we can do it oh

442
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
we can do it oh
 

443
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,790
we can do it oh
uh interrupts darn

444
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
uh interrupts darn
 

445
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,150
uh interrupts darn
it gets in the way of the pitch as you

446
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
it gets in the way of the pitch as you
 

447
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:00,550
it gets in the way of the pitch as you
run by i was hoping that would work

448
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560

 

449
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,310

oh well i can still do it from a

450
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
oh well i can still do it from a
 

451
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,230
oh well i can still do it from a
distance like this too

452
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240

 

453
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,550

i think there we go

454
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560

 

455
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,350

too far away

456
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360

 

457
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,430

yeah so this should keep me set for a

458
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
yeah so this should keep me set for a
 

459
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,190
yeah so this should keep me set for a
long time again

460
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200

 

461
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,949

and here's another update of the build

462
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
and here's another update of the build
 

463
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,470
and here's another update of the build
it's going really well

464
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
it's going really well
 

465
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,069
it's going really well
uh area is getting huge it's a big open

466
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
uh area is getting huge it's a big open
 

467
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,550
uh area is getting huge it's a big open
room now still got to go down a few more

468
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
room now still got to go down a few more
 

469
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,430
room now still got to go down a few more
blocks

470
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
blocks
 

471
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,790
blocks
to finish this up uh but really it's not

472
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
to finish this up uh but really it's not
 

473
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,790
to finish this up uh but really it's not
taking that long to mine out using the

474
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
taking that long to mine out using the
 

475
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,750
taking that long to mine out using the
quick mining trick another rack breaks

476
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
quick mining trick another rack breaks
 

477
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,829
quick mining trick another rack breaks
very quickly

478
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839

 

479
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,030

so it's got a little ways to go here

480
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
so it's got a little ways to go here
 

481
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,190
so it's got a little ways to go here
and then we can start doing something

482
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
and then we can start doing something
 

483
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,269
and then we can start doing something
else i probably won't set these up

484
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
else i probably won't set these up
 

485
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,430
else i probably won't set these up
fully today i just want the frame done

486
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
fully today i just want the frame done
 

487
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,949
fully today i just want the frame done
and then we will start doing something

488
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
and then we will start doing something
 

489
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:08,870
and then we will start doing something
with the netherworts

490
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880

 

491
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,710

and there we go

492
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720

 

493
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,829

all right i'll see you in a bit

494
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
all right i'll see you in a bit
 

495
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,509
all right i'll see you in a bit
all right so we got the frames pretty

496
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
all right so we got the frames pretty
 

497
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,269
all right so we got the frames pretty
much done here

498
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
much done here
 

499
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,710
much done here
they're looking pretty epic in my

500
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
they're looking pretty epic in my
 

501
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,990
they're looking pretty epic in my
opinion they're going to be nice when

502
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
opinion they're going to be nice when
 

503
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,269
opinion they're going to be nice when
they're all polished up and finished

504
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
they're all polished up and finished
 

505
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,310
they're all polished up and finished
i like them really really large though

506
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320

 

507
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,069

that's quite a height took a long time

508
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
that's quite a height took a long time
 

509
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,790
that's quite a height took a long time
to set this up a few hours

510
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
to set this up a few hours
 

511
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,230
to set this up a few hours
but now what i want to do

512
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
but now what i want to do
 

513
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,269
but now what i want to do
is kind of hook them together at the

514
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
is kind of hook them together at the
 

515
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,389
is kind of hook them together at the
ground here

516
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
ground here
 

517
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,430
ground here
so the blades will be up here thinking

518
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
so the blades will be up here thinking
 

519
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,550
so the blades will be up here thinking
i'll put glowstone

520
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
i'll put glowstone
 

521
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,790
i'll put glowstone
right here these two blocks for sure

522
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
right here these two blocks for sure
 

523
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,590
right here these two blocks for sure
or maybe here maybe these four blocks i

524
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
or maybe here maybe these four blocks i
 

525
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,710
or maybe here maybe these four blocks i
don't know

526
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
don't know
 

527
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,030
don't know
uh i'll have it four wide here

528
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
uh i'll have it four wide here
 

529
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,750
uh i'll have it four wide here
instead of just too wide the buttons and

530
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
instead of just too wide the buttons and
 

531
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,430
instead of just too wide the buttons and
the levers aren't going to go down here

532
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
the levers aren't going to go down here
 

533
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,829
the levers aren't going to go down here
though

534
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
though
 

535
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,110
though
like in the other one we will have them

536
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
like in the other one we will have them
 

537
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,190
like in the other one we will have them
in the middle somewhere the controls for

538
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
in the middle somewhere the controls for
 

539
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,550
in the middle somewhere the controls for
these two farms because they're going to

540
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
these two farms because they're going to
 

541
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,069
these two farms because they're going to
be linked together

542
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079

 

543
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,430

so that's what we'll do to me it feels

544
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
so that's what we'll do to me it feels
 

545
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,269
so that's what we'll do to me it feels
like this is a good viewing distance of

546
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
like this is a good viewing distance of
 

547
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,990
like this is a good viewing distance of
the blaze

548
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
the blaze
 

549
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,269
the blaze
to get a nice look so we'll start making

550
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
to get a nice look so we'll start making
 

551
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:25,829
to get a nice look so we'll start making
this go

552
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
this go
 

553
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,590
this go
up here i guess try half slabs first

554
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
up here i guess try half slabs first
 

555
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,389
up here i guess try half slabs first
and then

556
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
and then
 

557
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,990
and then
do it like that maybe we'll try wooden

558
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
do it like that maybe we'll try wooden
 

559
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,870
do it like that maybe we'll try wooden
stairs

560
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
stairs
 

561
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,910
stairs
here so i'm going to be using

562
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
here so i'm going to be using
 

563
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,069
here so i'm going to be using
wood in this build a little bit and

564
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
wood in this build a little bit and
 

565
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,590
wood in this build a little bit and
hopefully everything will be fine there

566
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
hopefully everything will be fine there
 

567
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,829
hopefully everything will be fine there
won't catch fire or something stupid

568
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839

 

569
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,629

uh thinking like having a circle or

570
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
uh thinking like having a circle or
 

571
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,990
uh thinking like having a circle or
something in the center here

572
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
something in the center here
 

573
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,190
something in the center here
again on this side uh one

574
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
again on this side uh one
 

575
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,910
again on this side uh one
two three blocks and then we go up

576
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920

 

577
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,190

is it three or is it four it's four okay

578
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200

 

579
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,110

one two three over here

580
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
one two three over here
 

581
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,030
one two three over here
we'll just see how they meet together if

582
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
we'll just see how they meet together if
 

583
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,590
we'll just see how they meet together if
we do that

584
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600

 

585
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,990

yeah no that's not going to work

586
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
yeah no that's not going to work
 

587
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,590
yeah no that's not going to work
stairs need to be steeper

588
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600

 

589
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,389

because i want to go down a hole here to

590
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
because i want to go down a hole here to
 

591
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,990
because i want to go down a hole here to
get to the blaze that way we're just a

592
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
get to the blaze that way we're just a
 

593
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,629
get to the blaze that way we're just a
little bit closer to the spawner

594
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
little bit closer to the spawner
 

595
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,629
little bit closer to the spawner
if we're like at this level here instead

596
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
if we're like at this level here instead
 

597
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,990
if we're like at this level here instead
of

598
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
of
 

599
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,829
of
two or three blocks lower it'll be

600
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839

 

601
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,550

better

602
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
better
 

603
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,470
better
yeah this might seem a little random but

604
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
yeah this might seem a little random but
 

605
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,310
yeah this might seem a little random but
i went mining i took a

606
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
i went mining i took a
 

607
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,150
i went mining i took a
building break to go mining because i'm

608
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
building break to go mining because i'm
 

609
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,829
building break to go mining because i'm
looking for

610
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
looking for
 

611
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,030
looking for
redstone ore the actual blocks i got

612
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
redstone ore the actual blocks i got
 

613
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,470
redstone ore the actual blocks i got
silk touch with me that's how i'm

614
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
silk touch with me that's how i'm
 

615
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,189
silk touch with me that's how i'm
getting them and i keep finding diamonds

616
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
getting them and i keep finding diamonds
 

617
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:23,670
getting them and i keep finding diamonds
so i thought i'd share

618
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680

 

619
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,910

621
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,230
got so many like seriously i'm never i'm
not going to use them

622
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
not going to use them
 

623
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,990
not going to use them
probably have 150 now

624
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000

 

625
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,629

and i keep getting more so yeah you can

get
 

629
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,310
get
the actual ore with silk touch

630
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
the actual ore with silk touch
 

631
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,470
the actual ore with silk touch
which is awesome i'm going to try to do

632
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,480
which is awesome i'm going to try to do
 

633
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,750
which is awesome i'm going to try to do
a bud switch thing at the blaze farm

634
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
a bud switch thing at the blaze farm
 

635
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,509
a bud switch thing at the blaze farm
uh will be pretty cool if i can get it

636
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
uh will be pretty cool if i can get it
 

637
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,710
uh will be pretty cool if i can get it
working well

638
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
working well
 

639
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,310
working well
well i'll see you there just about done

640
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
well i'll see you there just about done
 

641
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,949
well i'll see you there just about done
mining

642
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
mining
 

643
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,150
mining
here

644
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160

 

645
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,590

i just want to make sure that this

646
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
i just want to make sure that this
 

647
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,590
i just want to make sure that this
actually works because i had one person

648
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
actually works because i had one person
 

649
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,389
actually works because i had one person
tell me

650
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
tell me
 

651
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,230
tell me
that these redstone ores don't light up

652
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
that these redstone ores don't light up
 

653
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,470
that these redstone ores don't light up
after you pick them up with silk touch

654
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
after you pick them up with silk touch
 

655
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,150
after you pick them up with silk touch
but that is not true they do still light

656
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
but that is not true they do still light
 

657
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,990
but that is not true they do still light
up so

658
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
up so
 

659
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,310
up so
you can use these for bud switches and

660
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
you can use these for bud switches and
 

661
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,670
you can use these for bud switches and
if i flip this up

662
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
if i flip this up
 

663
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,269
if i flip this up
if i unpower the piston this will

664
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
if i unpower the piston this will
 

665
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,550
if i unpower the piston this will
retract when this stops glowing

666
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
retract when this stops glowing
 

667
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,949
retract when this stops glowing
so i'm going to try and make some stairs

668
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
so i'm going to try and make some stairs
 

669
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,069
so i'm going to try and make some stairs
using this i don't know how it's going

670
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
using this i don't know how it's going
 

671
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,269
using this i don't know how it's going
to turn out or if

672
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
to turn out or if
 

673
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,389
to turn out or if
it's a good idea but we'll see

674
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399

 

675
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,150

yes i was just trying to think of a cool

676
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
yes i was just trying to think of a cool
 

677
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,910
yes i was just trying to think of a cool
way of doing these little pits here

678
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
way of doing these little pits here
 

679
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,110
way of doing these little pits here
like instead of using stairs i thought

680
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
like instead of using stairs i thought
 

681
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,829
like instead of using stairs i thought
it might be neat to have

682
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
it might be neat to have
 

683
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,350
it might be neat to have
redstone ore blocks here and

684
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
redstone ore blocks here and
 

685
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,829
redstone ore blocks here and
here and instead of stairs this will be

686
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
here and instead of stairs this will be
 

687
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,990
here and instead of stairs this will be
a wall a steep wall

688
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000

 

689
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,749

doing this more for the challenge

690
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759

 

691
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,189

and then when you walk on these

692
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
and then when you walk on these
 

693
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,949
and then when you walk on these
they will glow a piston below will push

694
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
they will glow a piston below will push
 

695
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,870
they will glow a piston below will push
them up one block

696
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
them up one block
 

697
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,990
them up one block
and then they'll be

698
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000

 

699
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,509

i don't know they'll be a stair or

700
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
i don't know they'll be a stair or
 

701
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,509
i don't know they'll be a stair or
something over here

702
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
something over here
 

703
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,069
something over here
and you'll be able to walk up it

704
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079

 

705
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,749

i don't know uh this we will change a

706
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
i don't know uh this we will change a
 

707
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,749
i don't know uh this we will change a
little bit

708
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759

 

709
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,430

try find something that looks good here

710
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
try find something that looks good here
 

711
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,870
try find something that looks good here
too so we need at least some lighting

712
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
too so we need at least some lighting
 

713
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,949
too so we need at least some lighting
near here so i'm going to put down some

714
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
near here so i'm going to put down some
 

715
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,949
near here so i'm going to put down some
glowstone

716
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959

 

717
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,030

uh i don't like to put the glowstone on

718
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
uh i don't like to put the glowstone on
 

719
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,550
uh i don't like to put the glowstone on
like where this pad is because when the

720
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
like where this pad is because when the
 

721
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,150
like where this pad is because when the
pistons move around it changes the

722
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
pistons move around it changes the
 

723
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,509
pistons move around it changes the
lighting

724
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
lighting
 

725
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,509
lighting
and that kind of causes leg

726
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519

 

727
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,189

um maybe maybe

728
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
um maybe maybe
 

729
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,710
um maybe maybe
we'll do a two by two there and

730
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
we'll do a two by two there and
 

731
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,870
we'll do a two by two there and
try some sandstone around it half slabs

732
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
try some sandstone around it half slabs
 

733
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:14,710
try some sandstone around it half slabs
this whole bottom area maybe

734
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720

 

735
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,870

okay probably won't use half slabs we'll

736
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
okay probably won't use half slabs we'll
 

737
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,990
okay probably won't use half slabs we'll
do full blocks

738
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000

 

739
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,630

it's just a little bit too strange

740
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640

 

741
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,150

and you can't use pressure plates for

742
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
and you can't use pressure plates for
 

743
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,549
and you can't use pressure plates for
this either because if a piston pushes

744
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
this either because if a piston pushes
 

745
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,070
this either because if a piston pushes
the block up with the pressure plate on

746
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
the block up with the pressure plate on
 

747
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,070
the block up with the pressure plate on
it the pressure plate's gonna

748
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
it the pressure plate's gonna
 

749
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,390
it the pressure plate's gonna
just pop off so

750
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400

 

751
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,549

redstone ore has a few tricks you can do

752
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
redstone ore has a few tricks you can do
 

753
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,549
redstone ore has a few tricks you can do
with it that you can't do with

754
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
with it that you can't do with
 

755
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,870
with it that you can't do with
any other way

756
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
any other way
 

757
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,190
any other way
okay so

758
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200

 

759
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,390

something like that i suppose

760
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400

 

761
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,830

you'll be able to see the blaze pretty

762
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
you'll be able to see the blaze pretty
 

763
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,150
you'll be able to see the blaze pretty
easy at this height i think if you go

764
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
easy at this height i think if you go
 

765
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,750
easy at this height i think if you go
one higher

766
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
one higher
 

767
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,630
one higher
it gets challenging the piston kind of

768
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
it gets challenging the piston kind of
 

769
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,470
it gets challenging the piston kind of
blocks your view a little bit more

770
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480

 

771
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,150

yeah it's not bad either

772
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160

 

773
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,390

alright so this is the challenging part

774
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
alright so this is the challenging part
 

775
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,150
alright so this is the challenging part
now uh we're gonna have to

776
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
now uh we're gonna have to
 

777
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,549
now uh we're gonna have to
figure out

778
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559

 

779
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,830

how to hook up the pistons to make it do

780
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840

 

781
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,669

that

782
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
that
 

783
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,390
that
this could take me a while so obviously

784
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
this could take me a while so obviously
 

785
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,070
this could take me a while so obviously
take this out if you pick these up when

786
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
take this out if you pick these up when
 

787
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,590
take this out if you pick these up when
they're glowing

788
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
they're glowing
 

789
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,270
they're glowing
they still show up in your inventory as

790
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
they still show up in your inventory as
 

791
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,630
they still show up in your inventory as
regular

792
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
regular
 

793
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,350
regular
redstone ore not like glowing redstone

794
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
redstone ore not like glowing redstone
 

795
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,470
redstone ore not like glowing redstone
or anything like that

796
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480

 

797
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,310

so definitely have a sticky piston below

798
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320

 

799
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,510

um

800
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520

 

801
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,470

obviously a simple thing you could do to

802
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
obviously a simple thing you could do to
 

803
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,270
obviously a simple thing you could do to
make the lift

804
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
make the lift
 

805
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,470
make the lift
is just have this

806
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
is just have this
 

807
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,110
is just have this
powered oops not like that

808
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120

 

809
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,710

the one one block above that if this was

810
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
the one one block above that if this was
 

811
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,669
the one one block above that if this was
if this block here is powered this will

812
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
if this block here is powered this will
 

813
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,310
if this block here is powered this will
just pop

814
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
just pop
 

815
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,549
just pop
up when you walk on it

816
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559

 

817
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,950

but it won't ever retract unless you

818
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
but it won't ever retract unless you
 

819
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:32,070
but it won't ever retract unless you
unpower this

820
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080

 

821
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,590

all right give me a minute to play

822
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
all right give me a minute to play
 

823
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,110
all right give me a minute to play
around with this and we'll see what

824
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
around with this and we'll see what
 

825
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,549
around with this and we'll see what
happens i might just ditch the whole

826
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
happens i might just ditch the whole
 

827
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,710
happens i might just ditch the whole
idea i don't know yet

828
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720

 

829
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,710

yeah so i thought about it some more and

830
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
yeah so i thought about it some more and
 

831
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,150
yeah so i thought about it some more and
i decided i'm not going to use these

832
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
i decided i'm not going to use these
 

833
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,870
i decided i'm not going to use these
after all

834
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
after all
 

835
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,029
after all
these redstone ore blocks because it's

836
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
these redstone ore blocks because it's
 

837
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,390
these redstone ore blocks because it's
just it's just

838
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
just it's just
 

839
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,870
just it's just
too much work for such a simple effect

840
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
too much work for such a simple effect
 

841
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,590
too much work for such a simple effect
you would

842
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
you would
 

843
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,669
you would
i think you would need to use a t flip

844
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
i think you would need to use a t flip
 

845
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,669
i think you would need to use a t flip
flop for them

846
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
flop for them
 

847
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,990
flop for them
that's a lot of wiring and stuff for

848
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
that's a lot of wiring and stuff for
 

849
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,870
that's a lot of wiring and stuff for
such a

850
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
such a
 

851
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,350
such a
such a small effect and then you'd have

852
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,360
such a small effect and then you'd have
 

853
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,390
such a small effect and then you'd have
to try

854
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
to try
 

855
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,549
to try
make the blocks match the stone look of

856
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
make the blocks match the stone look of
 

857
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,549
make the blocks match the stone look of
the redstone war

858
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
the redstone war
 

859
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,590
the redstone war
and there's probably better ways of

860
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
and there's probably better ways of
 

861
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,310
and there's probably better ways of
doing this

862
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320

 

863
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,909

one thing i tried here that i thought

864
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
one thing i tried here that i thought
 

865
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,230
one thing i tried here that i thought
would be so cool if it worked is i

866
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
would be so cool if it worked is i
 

867
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,190
would be so cool if it worked is i
i have half slabs over top the redstone

868
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
i have half slabs over top the redstone
 

869
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,149
i have half slabs over top the redstone
ore i was hoping like if you walked over

870
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
ore i was hoping like if you walked over
 

871
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,470
ore i was hoping like if you walked over
these half slabs it would still trigger

872
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
these half slabs it would still trigger
 

873
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,470
these half slabs it would still trigger
the redstone ore below and make it glow

874
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
the redstone ore below and make it glow
 

875
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,590
the redstone ore below and make it glow
but it doesn't work because if that

876
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
but it doesn't work because if that
 

877
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,230
but it doesn't work because if that
worked

878
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
worked
 

879
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,270
worked
you could completely

880
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
you could completely
 

881
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,990
you could completely
completely hide your trigger which would

882
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
completely hide your trigger which would
 

883
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,950
completely hide your trigger which would
be awesome

884
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
be awesome
 

885
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,110
be awesome
because i know in the past if you had

886
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,120
because i know in the past if you had
 

887
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,870
because i know in the past if you had
half slabs over ice or something you

888
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
half slabs over ice or something you
 

889
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,310
half slabs over ice or something you
would still get the slippery

890
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
would still get the slippery
 

891
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,830
would still get the slippery
effect walking on the half slab so i was

892
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:46,840
effect walking on the half slab so i was
 

893
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,149
effect walking on the half slab so i was
hoping

894
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
hoping
 

895
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,230
hoping
it would work with the redstone or two

896
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
it would work with the redstone or two
 

897
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,750
it would work with the redstone or two
that you could

898
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
that you could
 

899
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,510
that you could
you would somehow be touching the block

900
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
you would somehow be touching the block
 

901
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,510
you would somehow be touching the block
as you walk over it but

902
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
as you walk over it but
 

903
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,029
as you walk over it but
it doesn't seem to work too bad

904
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
it doesn't seem to work too bad
 

905
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,549
it doesn't seem to work too bad
um yeah

906
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
um yeah
 

907
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,590
um yeah
so the reason i want like a steep

908
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
so the reason i want like a steep
 

909
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,029
so the reason i want like a steep
staircase or steep r rise here is

910
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
staircase or steep r rise here is
 

911
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,710
staircase or steep r rise here is
because i want

912
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
because i want
 

913
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,430
because i want
at least a seven wide walkway in the

914
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
at least a seven wide walkway in the
 

915
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,710
at least a seven wide walkway in the
middle here just

916
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
middle here just
 

917
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,590
middle here just
just for a good feel to this thing and

918
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
just for a good feel to this thing and
 

919
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,149
just for a good feel to this thing and
when i

920
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
when i
 

921
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,990
when i
ran the stairs before there was like a

922
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
ran the stairs before there was like a
 

923
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,149
ran the stairs before there was like a
three or five block wide

924
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
three or five block wide
 

925
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,390
three or five block wide
walkway which just would look really

926
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
walkway which just would look really
 

927
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,029
walkway which just would look really
silly

928
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039

 

929
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,870

so i could run the stairs this way or

930
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
so i could run the stairs this way or
 

931
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,430
so i could run the stairs this way or
something

932
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
something
 

933
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,789
something
instead of this way

934
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
instead of this way
 

935
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,390
instead of this way
or just make them really steep i don't

936
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
or just make them really steep i don't
 

937
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,149
or just make them really steep i don't
know

938
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
know
 

939
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,510
know
we'll figure it out but um we should

940
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
we'll figure it out but um we should
 

941
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,190
we'll figure it out but um we should
mess around with some netherward stuff

942
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
mess around with some netherward stuff
 

943
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,710
mess around with some netherward stuff
again

944
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
again
 

945
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,070
again
because i wanted to

946
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080

 

947
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,510

get into making that farm sometime soon

948
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
get into making that farm sometime soon
 

949
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,990
get into making that farm sometime soon
so i'm gonna get set up here and we'll

950
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
so i'm gonna get set up here and we'll
 

951
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,710
so i'm gonna get set up here and we'll
do some

952
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
do some
 

953
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,590
do some
more experiments and try to figure out a

954
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
more experiments and try to figure out a
 

955
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,430
more experiments and try to figure out a
farm design that will

956
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
farm design that will
 

957
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,190
farm design that will
be pretty cool

958
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200

 

959
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,750

so the first idea i had this is probably

960
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
so the first idea i had this is probably
 

961
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,870
so the first idea i had this is probably
the one i'm most likely to use

962
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
the one i'm most likely to use
 

963
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,750
the one i'm most likely to use
you'll have these rows of slow sand with

964
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
you'll have these rows of slow sand with
 

965
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,669
you'll have these rows of slow sand with
pistons on each end

966
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679

 

967
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,990

you could make these up to 12 blocks

968
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
you could make these up to 12 blocks
 

969
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,070
you could make these up to 12 blocks
wide

970
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
wide
 

971
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,070
wide
and then we'll put some more over here i

972
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
and then we'll put some more over here i
 

973
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,669
and then we'll put some more over here i
think

974
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
think
 

975
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,390
think
i think we got 10 blocks wide right now

976
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
i think we got 10 blocks wide right now
 

977
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,870
i think we got 10 blocks wide right now
let's make it 11.

978
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880

 

979
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,870

because that's a nice weird odd number

980
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
because that's a nice weird odd number
 

981
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,510
because that's a nice weird odd number
okay and then you would have your

982
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
okay and then you would have your
 

983
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,230
okay and then you would have your
netherwork

984
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
netherwork
 

985
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,830
netherwork
all along i don't know if this is going

986
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
all along i don't know if this is going
 

987
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,710
all along i don't know if this is going
to work or not

988
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
to work or not
 

989
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,510
to work or not
i'm worried that the drops will fall

990
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
i'm worried that the drops will fall
 

991
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,710
i'm worried that the drops will fall
through the blocks

992
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
through the blocks
 

993
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,350
through the blocks
as they get pushed the idea is

994
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
as they get pushed the idea is
 

995
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,950
as they get pushed the idea is
you would have a row of redstone wire

996
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
you would have a row of redstone wire
 

997
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,070
you would have a row of redstone wire
on both ends as well

998
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080

 

999
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,630

like so and then

1000
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
like so and then
 

1001
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,029
like so and then
we'll just put levers there for now but

1002
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
we'll just put levers there for now but
 

1003
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,990
we'll just put levers there for now but
the idea is

1004
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
the idea is
 

1005
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,830
the idea is
uh when the pistons extend

1006
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
uh when the pistons extend
 

1007
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,070
uh when the pistons extend
all these blocks will get moved and all

1008
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
all these blocks will get moved and all
 

1009
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,110
all these blocks will get moved and all
the

1010
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
the
 

1011
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,909
the
nether wart on them will get uprooted

1012
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919

 

1013
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,120

let's try it

1014
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,130
let's try it
 

1015
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,590
let's try it
[Music]

1016
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600

 

1017
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,230

okay first of all i had that in the

1018
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
okay first of all i had that in the
 

1019
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,950
okay first of all i had that in the
wrong place

1020
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
wrong place
 

1021
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,830
wrong place
and second of all they didn't get

1022
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840
and second of all they didn't get
 

1023
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,390
and second of all they didn't get
uprooted

1024
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400

 

1025
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,510

darn it darn it darn it darn it

1026
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520
darn it darn it darn it darn it
 

1027
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,029
darn it darn it darn it darn it
uh that was unexpected

1028
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
uh that was unexpected
 

1029
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,590
uh that was unexpected
so what you could probably do is if you

1030
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
so what you could probably do is if you
 

1031
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,350
so what you could probably do is if you
had

1032
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
had
 

1033
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,390
had
a strip in between of something

1034
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
a strip in between of something
 

1035
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,590
a strip in between of something
that isn't slow sand

1036
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
that isn't slow sand
 

1037
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,870
that isn't slow sand
like so then it would probably

1038
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
like so then it would probably
 

1039
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,750
like so then it would probably
cause them to break maybe hopefully

1040
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760

 

1041
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,230

yeah there we go um so every

1042
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240

 

1043
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,630

every second block you'd have to do that

1044
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:22,640

 

1045
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,950

it's one possibility i was hoping that

1046
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
it's one possibility i was hoping that
 

1047
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,470
it's one possibility i was hoping that
would work better

1048
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480

 

1049
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,070

let's try it one more time make sure

1050
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
let's try it one more time make sure
 

1051
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,430
let's try it one more time make sure
these pop off

1052
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
these pop off
 

1053
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,710
these pop off
forgot to release that

1054
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720

 

1055
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,830

oh yeah and we'll want to make sure

1056
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840

 

1057
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,470

oh okay now they popped off

1058
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
oh okay now they popped off
 

1059
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,990
oh okay now they popped off
i'm gonna have to rewatch that video see

1060
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
i'm gonna have to rewatch that video see
 

1061
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,110
i'm gonna have to rewatch that video see
what happened there

1062
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120

 

1063
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,750

aha i got it figured out this is kind of

1064
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
aha i got it figured out this is kind of
 

1065
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,590
aha i got it figured out this is kind of
cool if you have

1066
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
cool if you have
 

1067
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,909
cool if you have
them in rows like this you're able to

1068
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
them in rows like this you're able to
 

1069
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,350
them in rows like this you're able to
move the slow sand beneath them

1070
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
move the slow sand beneath them
 

1071
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,110
move the slow sand beneath them
it can shift and they'll be in the same

1072
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,120
it can shift and they'll be in the same
 

1073
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,750
it can shift and they'll be in the same
spot

1074
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760

 

1075
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,190

at i thinking maybe it was uh

1076
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
at i thinking maybe it was uh
 

1077
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,029
at i thinking maybe it was uh
maybe i had glowstone above or something

1078
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
maybe i had glowstone above or something
 

1079
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,710
maybe i had glowstone above or something
but no

1080
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720

 

1081
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,430

so what you need to do oh now they broke

1082
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440

 

1083
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,029

why are netherworts so confusing

1084
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
why are netherworts so confusing
 

1085
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:37,909
why are netherworts so confusing
i wonder why they broke that time

1086
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919

 

1087
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,430

the idea is you would you'd hit a button

1088
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440
the idea is you would you'd hit a button
 

1089
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,909
the idea is you would you'd hit a button
and the pistons would extend then a few

1090
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
and the pistons would extend then a few
 

1091
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:44,950
and the pistons would extend then a few
seconds or

1092
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
seconds or
 

1093
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,590
seconds or
a few moments later that set of pistons

1094
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
a few moments later that set of pistons
 

1095
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,549
a few moments later that set of pistons
would extend and

1096
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
would extend and
 

1097
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,470
would extend and
put the soil back into place the slow

1098
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
put the soil back into place the slow
 

1099
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,830
put the soil back into place the slow
sand and then you could replant

1100
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:54,840

 

1101
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,870

everything

1102
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
everything
 

1103
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,669
everything
i wonder why they popped off

1104
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679

 

1105
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,230

okay but here's the thing uh you can

1106
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
okay but here's the thing uh you can
 

1107
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,190
okay but here's the thing uh you can
make them break

1108
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
make them break
 

1109
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,789
make them break
if you have a block next to them

1110
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
if you have a block next to them
 

1111
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,950
if you have a block next to them
and that block can be nether warts so if

1112
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
and that block can be nether warts so if
 

1113
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,870
and that block can be nether warts so if
this is solid

1114
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:16,880

 

1115
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,470

when you shift it to the left for

1116
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
when you shift it to the left for
 

1117
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,390
when you shift it to the left for
example so this

1118
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
example so this
 

1119
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,310
example so this
let's say if this netherward here gets

1120
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
let's say if this netherward here gets
 

1121
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,269
let's say if this netherward here gets
shifted to the left

1122
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:25,279
shifted to the left
 

1123
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,070
shifted to the left
it's going to get it's going to hit this

1124
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
it's going to get it's going to hit this
 

1125
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,149
it's going to get it's going to hit this
block here this netherwart and that will

1126
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
block here this netherwart and that will
 

1127
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,830
block here this netherwart and that will
tell it to uproot

1128
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
tell it to uproot
 

1129
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,830
tell it to uproot
but if this is an airspace that won't

1130
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840

 

1131
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,830

happen

1132
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
happen
 

1133
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,950
happen
which is kind of strange so if you want

1134
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
which is kind of strange so if you want
 

1135
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,350
which is kind of strange so if you want
to use this method which is a good

1136
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
to use this method which is a good
 

1137
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,710
to use this method which is a good
chance we will

1138
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
chance we will
 

1139
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,110
chance we will
uh we'll have to make sure we plant the

1140
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
uh we'll have to make sure we plant the
 

1141
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,269
uh we'll have to make sure we plant the
whole area it has to be solid filled

1142
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
whole area it has to be solid filled
 

1143
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,909
whole area it has to be solid filled
you can't just plant one here one there

1144
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
you can't just plant one here one there
 

1145
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:54,870
you can't just plant one here one there
type thing

1146
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
type thing
 

1147
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,070
type thing
has to be solid

1148
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080

 

1149
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,350

so that's one idea for design let's see

1150
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
so that's one idea for design let's see
 

1151
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,909
so that's one idea for design let's see
we might

1152
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
we might
 

1153
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,070
we might
consider a few more

1154
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
consider a few more
 

1155
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,909
consider a few more
here's another another wart farm i

1156
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
here's another another wart farm i
 

1157
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,669
here's another another wart farm i
thought was pretty cool i saw this in a

1158
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
thought was pretty cool i saw this in a
 

1159
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,710
thought was pretty cool i saw this in a
video by uh

1160
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:11,720
video by uh
 

1161
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,110
video by uh
jl2579 today uh

1162
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
jl2579 today uh
 

1163
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,070
jl2579 today uh
so he had this is just a terrible

1164
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
so he had this is just a terrible
 

1165
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,310
so he had this is just a terrible
looking prototype of his

1166
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
looking prototype of his
 

1167
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,630
looking prototype of his
but he had the slow sand with the

1168
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:24,640
but he had the slow sand with the
 

1169
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,230
but he had the slow sand with the
fence gates in between so you plant the

1170
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
fence gates in between so you plant the
 

1171
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,470
fence gates in between so you plant the
netherwart on the

1172
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
netherwart on the
 

1173
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,310
netherwart on the
slow sand of course

1174
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
slow sand of course
 

1175
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,389
slow sand of course
you need these two high walls of

1176
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399
you need these two high walls of
 

1177
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,510
you need these two high walls of
whatever block

1178
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
whatever block
 

1179
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,510
whatever block
you want

1180
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:38,520
you want
 

1181
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,029
you want
[Music]

1182
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039

 

1183
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,710

like that and then when you're ready to

1184
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
like that and then when you're ready to
 

1185
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,630
like that and then when you're ready to
harvest you

1186
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
harvest you
 

1187
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,029
harvest you
you shift them over and what happens is

1188
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
you shift them over and what happens is
 

1189
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,110
you shift them over and what happens is
uh

1190
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
uh
 

1191
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,070
uh
this this is pretty cool

1192
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080

 

1193
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,750
