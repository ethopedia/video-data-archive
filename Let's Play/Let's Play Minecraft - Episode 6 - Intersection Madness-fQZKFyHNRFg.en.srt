00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:04,140
hello my fellow Minecrafters etho here
 

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,160
hello my fellow Minecrafters etho here
with episode 6 and this episode we are

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,170
with episode 6 and this episode we are
 

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,280
with episode 6 and this episode we are
going to be doing something special

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,290
going to be doing something special
 

7
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,080
going to be doing something special
something out of the ordinary we are

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,090
something out of the ordinary we are
 

9
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,530
something out of the ordinary we are
going to visit my private world world 2

10
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:15,540
going to visit my private world world 2
 

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,090
going to visit my private world world 2
and the reason for this I spent about 3

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,100
and the reason for this I spent about 3
 

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,429
and the reason for this I spent about 3
hours today working on a new

14
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
hours today working on a new
 

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,040
hours today working on a new
intersection for the etes transportation

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,050
intersection for the etes transportation
 

17
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,270
intersection for the etes transportation
system and this is what it looks like so

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
system and this is what it looks like so
 

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,080
system and this is what it looks like so
I built for small roads the test it's

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,090
I built for small roads the test it's
 

21
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,400
I built for small roads the test it's
and one of them is a bit longer right

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,410
and one of them is a bit longer right
 

23
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,139
and one of them is a bit longer right
now we're inside the intersection and we

24
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:50,149
now we're inside the intersection and we
 

25
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:56,470
now we're inside the intersection and we
are going to take it for a test drive

26
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480

 

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,310

all right here we go

28
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
all right here we go
 

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,200
all right here we go
arms and legs inside the boat at all

30
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,210
arms and legs inside the boat at all
 

31
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:11,140
arms and legs inside the boat at all
times whoo

32
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,150

 

33
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,670

and then we can exit the boat you're

34
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
and then we can exit the boat you're
 

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,620
and then we can exit the boat you're
left it goes back to the dispenser up in

36
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:21,630
left it goes back to the dispenser up in
 

37
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,630
left it goes back to the dispenser up in
the stack and if we want we can ride one

38
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
the stack and if we want we can ride one
 

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,410
the stack and if we want we can ride one
back and same thing happens over here

40
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:35,420
back and same thing happens over here
 

41
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,990
back and same thing happens over here
this door stops us because we are on top

42
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,000
this door stops us because we are on top
 

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,470
this door stops us because we are on top
of a pressure plate right now and this

44
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:42,480
of a pressure plate right now and this
 

45
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,390
of a pressure plate right now and this
door here is in case someone else

46
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,400
door here is in case someone else
 

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,020
door here is in case someone else
arrives while we're waiting here so the

48
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,030
arrives while we're waiting here so the
 

49
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,650
arrives while we're waiting here so the
boats don't crash together and when you

50
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:51,660
boats don't crash together and when you
 

51
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,390
boats don't crash together and when you
exit the boat both of those doors open

52
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:55,400
exit the boat both of those doors open
 

53
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,840
exit the boat both of those doors open
it goes underneath into the dispenser

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:58,850
it goes underneath into the dispenser
 

55
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,870
it goes underneath into the dispenser
and there's a pressure plate under this

56
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
and there's a pressure plate under this
 

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,980
and there's a pressure plate under this
boat so when you hop on this door opens

58
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:08,990

 

59
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,940

just like that

60
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:13,950

 

61
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,820

and these pressure plates are hooked to

62
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:19,830
and these pressure plates are hooked to
 

63
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,839
and these pressure plates are hooked to
this door and the reason for that is so

64
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:23,849
this door and the reason for that is so
 

65
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,040
this door and the reason for that is so
when you arrive here it's going to

66
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,050
when you arrive here it's going to
 

67
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,070
when you arrive here it's going to
release a boat to make up for the one

68
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
release a boat to make up for the one
 

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,420
release a boat to make up for the one
you just took from over here and that

70
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,430
you just took from over here and that
 

71
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,309
you just took from over here and that
happens on both sides and the reason for

72
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:37,319
happens on both sides and the reason for
 

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,140
happens on both sides and the reason for
that is so that there's always boats at

74
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,150
that is so that there's always boats at
 

75
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,509
that is so that there's always boats at
each station you could ride from over

76
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
each station you could ride from over
 

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,100
each station you could ride from over
there five times and five boats will get

78
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,110
there five times and five boats will get
 

79
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,199
there five times and five boats will get
sent back so that's one thing you can't

80
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,209
sent back so that's one thing you can't
 

81
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,210
sent back so that's one thing you can't
really do with minecarts which is pretty

82
00:02:59,210 --> 00:02:59,220
really do with minecarts which is pretty
 

83
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,840
really do with minecarts which is pretty
cool about this system so this isn't a

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:05,850
cool about this system so this isn't a
 

85
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,470
cool about this system so this isn't a
tutorial video this is just to show you

86
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
tutorial video this is just to show you
 

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,270
tutorial video this is just to show you
what I've done and what it might look

88
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
what I've done and what it might look
 

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,360
what I've done and what it might look
like if you wanted to build your own

90
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,370
like if you wanted to build your own
 

91
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,530
like if you wanted to build your own
intersection the way I got the setup is

92
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,540
intersection the way I got the setup is
 

93
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,250
intersection the way I got the setup is
pretty nice

94
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,260
pretty nice
 

95
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,729
pretty nice
so you exit here then if you want to

96
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:25,739
so you exit here then if you want to
 

97
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,500
so you exit here then if you want to
keep going straight you just walk up up

98
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,510
keep going straight you just walk up up
 

99
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,199
keep going straight you just walk up up
here up on the next boat and it takes

100
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,209
here up on the next boat and it takes
 

101
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,280
here up on the next boat and it takes
you straight or you can go right or left

102
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,290
you straight or you can go right or left
 

103
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,970
you straight or you can go right or left
or hop off and go visit the town and do

104
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:37,980
or hop off and go visit the town and do
 

105
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,550
or hop off and go visit the town and do
whatever you want so it's pretty cool

106
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
whatever you want so it's pretty cool
 

107
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,229
whatever you want so it's pretty cool
it's technically not an intersection

108
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,239
it's technically not an intersection
 

109
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,449
it's technically not an intersection
because the boats don't cross paths but

110
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:47,459
because the boats don't cross paths but
 

111
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,920
because the boats don't cross paths but
I'm going to call it that anyway and you

112
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:51,930
I'm going to call it that anyway and you
 

113
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,390
I'm going to call it that anyway and you
can take your time choosing where you

114
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,400
can take your time choosing where you
 

115
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,170
can take your time choosing where you
want to go I recommend putting some kind

116
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,180
want to go I recommend putting some kind
 

117
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,180
want to go I recommend putting some kind
of information inside here saying like

118
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,190
of information inside here saying like
 

119
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,780
of information inside here saying like
which direction you're going and where

120
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:05,790
which direction you're going and where
 

121
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,720
which direction you're going and where
the road takes you

122
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:07,730
the road takes you
 

123
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,320
the road takes you
so for example this road takes you to a

124
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,330
so for example this road takes you to a
 

125
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,699
so for example this road takes you to a
dead end at about 0.1 kilometers which

126
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:15,709
dead end at about 0.1 kilometers which
 

127
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:22,780
dead end at about 0.1 kilometers which
is 100 meters or 100 blocks that's kind

128
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:22,790
is 100 meters or 100 blocks that's kind
 

129
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,550
is 100 meters or 100 blocks that's kind
of cool to have and same down here tell

130
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,560
of cool to have and same down here tell
 

131
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,580
of cool to have and same down here tell
the player which direction they're going

132
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,590
the player which direction they're going
 

133
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,860
the player which direction they're going
and if you want you can put what

134
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:32,870
and if you want you can put what
 

135
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:44,950
and if you want you can put what
destinations are at the next stop so

136
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
destinations are at the next stop so
 

137
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,840
destinations are at the next stop so
yeah I'm going to release the tutorial

138
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:46,850
yeah I'm going to release the tutorial
 

139
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,110
yeah I'm going to release the tutorial
video later and I'll explain everything

140
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,120
video later and I'll explain everything
 

141
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,000
video later and I'll explain everything
in that like what why I have these

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,010
in that like what why I have these
 

143
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,920
in that like what why I have these
ladders here why these are only three

144
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:53,930
ladders here why these are only three
 

145
00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:00,730
ladders here why these are only three
blocks long stuff like that um I will

146
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:00,740
blocks long stuff like that um I will
 

147
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:09,430
blocks long stuff like that um I will
take you grab a boat I will take you

148
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
take you grab a boat I will take you
 

149
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,570
take you grab a boat I will take you
down and show you the shafts here so I

150
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,580
down and show you the shafts here so I
 

151
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,010
down and show you the shafts here so I
just built this little room here to get

152
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,020
just built this little room here to get
 

153
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,760
just built this little room here to get
down or I don't know if I want to keep

154
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:21,770
down or I don't know if I want to keep
 

155
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:29,110
down or I don't know if I want to keep
it like that what I've done here this is

156
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
it like that what I've done here this is
 

157
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,719
it like that what I've done here this is
a return shaft this water stream is

158
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:34,729
a return shaft this water stream is
 

159
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,450
a return shaft this water stream is
eight blocks long so that the boat will

160
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:37,460
eight blocks long so that the boat will
 

161
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,840
eight blocks long so that the boat will
bottom out when it hits here and then it

162
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:40,850
bottom out when it hits here and then it
 

163
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,870
bottom out when it hits here and then it
goes up into the water elevator and the

164
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:43,880
goes up into the water elevator and the
 

165
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,330
goes up into the water elevator and the
reason why I have it bottomed out now is

166
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:46,340
reason why I have it bottomed out now is
 

167
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,110
reason why I have it bottomed out now is
because if you just have a normal stream

168
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,120
because if you just have a normal stream
 

169
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,040
because if you just have a normal stream
like this

170
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,050
like this
 

171
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,290
like this
if one boat is here and another one

172
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:54,300
if one boat is here and another one
 

173
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,570
if one boat is here and another one
lands on top of it

174
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:55,580
lands on top of it
 

175
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,029
lands on top of it
the the second boat isn't going to move

176
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
the the second boat isn't going to move
 

177
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,860
the the second boat isn't going to move
forward when it touches the water it's

178
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:00,870
forward when it touches the water it's
 

179
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,180
forward when it touches the water it's
going to get stuck which is a serious

180
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,190
going to get stuck which is a serious
 

181
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,450
going to get stuck which is a serious
problem if the bullet Center the return

182
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,460
problem if the bullet Center the return
 

183
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:19,460
problem if the bullet Center the return
system too close together yeah so

184
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,470
system too close together yeah so
 

185
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,170
system too close together yeah so
another problem I had though is I don't

186
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:21,180
another problem I had though is I don't
 

187
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,620
another problem I had though is I don't
really have any place to put easy

188
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:24,630
really have any place to put easy
 

189
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,999
really have any place to put easy
loaders to stop the system so what I

190
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:29,009
loaders to stop the system so what I
 

191
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,149
loaders to stop the system so what I
figured out is I can do it from down

192
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:32,159
figured out is I can do it from down
 

193
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,010
figured out is I can do it from down
here

194
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,020

 

195
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:46,679

just by placing boats right here

196
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:46,689

 

197
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,089

the reason I can't build an easy loader

198
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:49,099
the reason I can't build an easy loader
 

199
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:54,100
the reason I can't build an easy loader
anywhere is because all the return

200
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,110
anywhere is because all the return
 

201
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,140
anywhere is because all the return
shafts are right next to an elevator

202
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,150
shafts are right next to an elevator
 

203
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,899
shafts are right next to an elevator
like I think it's behind here yeah and

204
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:03,909
like I think it's behind here yeah and
 

205
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:10,200
like I think it's behind here yeah and
that is interfering with the water flows

206
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,210

 

207
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:18,610

but anyway so one thing I figured out

208
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:18,620
but anyway so one thing I figured out
 

209
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,820
but anyway so one thing I figured out
tonight is that these rapid dispensers

210
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:21,830
tonight is that these rapid dispensers
 

211
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,929
tonight is that these rapid dispensers
do not work in multiplayer at the moment

212
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:24,939
do not work in multiplayer at the moment
 

213
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:28,480
do not work in multiplayer at the moment
some reason the boats won't point

214
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,490
some reason the boats won't point
 

215
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,459
some reason the boats won't point
straight they're kind of crooked always

216
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:30,469
straight they're kind of crooked always
 

217
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:34,689
straight they're kind of crooked always
and that causes the boats to bounce back

218
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:34,699
and that causes the boats to bounce back
 

219
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,829
and that causes the boats to bounce back
and forth and I think break eventually

220
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:37,839
and forth and I think break eventually
 

221
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,619
and forth and I think break eventually
which is a problem in single-player they

222
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:41,629
which is a problem in single-player they
 

223
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:49,059
which is a problem in single-player they
won't break like this and hopefully

224
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:49,069
won't break like this and hopefully
 

225
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:56,649
won't break like this and hopefully
notch will fix that problem later so at

226
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:56,659
notch will fix that problem later so at
 

227
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,230
notch will fix that problem later so at
the moment boats and my carts and

228
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,240
the moment boats and my carts and
 

229
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,610
the moment boats and my carts and
everything are still pretty buggy in

230
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:00,620
everything are still pretty buggy in
 

231
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,579
everything are still pretty buggy in
multiplayer servers if you don't want to

232
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:03,589
multiplayer servers if you don't want to
 

233
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,350
multiplayer servers if you don't want to
wait for things to improve and you want

234
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
wait for things to improve and you want
 

235
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,059
wait for things to improve and you want
to go ahead and try build one of these

236
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:07,069
to go ahead and try build one of these
 

237
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,089
to go ahead and try build one of these
already what you'll have to do is modify

238
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:10,099
already what you'll have to do is modify
 

239
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,570
already what you'll have to do is modify
this dispenser a little bit you'll

240
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:13,580
this dispenser a little bit you'll
 

241
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,450
this dispenser a little bit you'll
basically need to cut out one block so

242
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:16,460
basically need to cut out one block so
 

243
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,969
basically need to cut out one block so
it's so it's just the elevator so it's a

244
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:18,979
it's so it's just the elevator so it's a
 

245
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,260
it's so it's just the elevator so it's a
2x2 area instead of this three by two

246
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,270
2x2 area instead of this three by two
 

247
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,629
2x2 area instead of this three by two
area that will only allow one boat to

248
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:25,639
area that will only allow one boat to
 

249
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,679
area that will only allow one boat to
float up and you won't have issues with

250
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:29,689
float up and you won't have issues with
 

251
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:38,680
float up and you won't have issues with
the boats being placed in properly and

252
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:38,690

 

253
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,269

if you have any ideas on how to improve

254
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
if you have any ideas on how to improve
 

255
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,480
if you have any ideas on how to improve
this please let me know if you can think

256
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,490
this please let me know if you can think
 

257
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,389
this please let me know if you can think
of any flaws please let me know and I

258
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:47,399
of any flaws please let me know and I
 

259
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,730
of any flaws please let me know and I
will try to come up with solutions to

260
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:49,740
will try to come up with solutions to
 

261
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,509
will try to come up with solutions to
those problems and improve the system

262
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
those problems and improve the system
 

263
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:01,629
those problems and improve the system
before I release a tutorial is a video
