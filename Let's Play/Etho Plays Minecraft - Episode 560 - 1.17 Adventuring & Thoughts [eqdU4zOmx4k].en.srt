because all the new stuff is in new
 

29
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,709
because all the new stuff is in new
chunks pretty much we have to go out on

30
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
chunks pretty much we have to go out on
 

31
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,670
chunks pretty much we have to go out on
an adventure

32

an adventure
 

33
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,830

the new stuff
and then maybe we'll get around to

38
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
and then maybe we'll get around to
 

39
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,830
and then maybe we'll get around to
building farms and playing around and

40
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
building farms and playing around and
 

41
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,590
building farms and playing around and
testing things out

42
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
testing things out
 

43
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,630

you might recall we have built

54
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
you might recall we have built
 

55
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,389
you might recall we have built
an expansive array of tunnels in our

56
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
an expansive array of tunnels in our
 

57
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,310
an expansive array of tunnels in our
nether here and when i was building this

58
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
nether here and when i was building this
 

59
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,229
nether here and when i was building this
and i got a carpal tunnel from building

60
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
and i got a carpal tunnel from building
 

61
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,789
and i got a carpal tunnel from building
for so long pretty much it's like was

62
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
for so long pretty much it's like was
 

63
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,390
for so long pretty much it's like was
this really worth it am i going to use

64
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
this really worth it am i going to use
 

65
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,070
this really worth it am i going to use
this tunnel actually and i have been

66
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
this tunnel actually and i have been
 

67
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,109
this tunnel actually and i have been
using this tunnel

68
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
using this tunnel
 

69
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,590
using this tunnel
so this goes out to the crimson keep but

70
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
so this goes out to the crimson keep but
 

71
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,190
so this goes out to the crimson keep but
we're also going to head out there today

72
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
we're also going to head out there today
 

73
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,990
we're also going to head out there today
and just

74
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
and just
 

75
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,749
and just
drop the portal and see what's on the

76
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
drop the portal and see what's on the
 

77
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,510
drop the portal and see what's on the
other side in the overworld and it's

78
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
other side in the overworld and it's
 

79
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,270
other side in the overworld and it's
going to be brand new chunks

80
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
going to be brand new chunks
 

81
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,789
going to be brand new chunks
don't have to build any infrastructure

82
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
don't have to build any infrastructure
 

83
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,109
don't have to build any infrastructure
it's all pre-built for us already

84
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
it's all pre-built for us already
 

85
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,190
it's all pre-built for us already
oh man it's dangerous here it is very

86
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
oh man it's dangerous here it is very
 

87
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,109
oh man it's dangerous here it is very
dangerous yeah i just set up a portal

88
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
dangerous yeah i just set up a portal
 

89
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,429
dangerous yeah i just set up a portal
over here we're gonna go through

90
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
over here we're gonna go through
 

91
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,030
over here we're gonna go through
now place your predictions do you think

92
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
now place your predictions do you think
 

93
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,630
now place your predictions do you think
anything's gonna be different

94
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
anything's gonna be different
 

95
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,030
anything's gonna be different
in amplified terrain with the new stuff

96
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
in amplified terrain with the new stuff
 

97
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,630
in amplified terrain with the new stuff
i don't know i kind of suspect it'll be

98
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
i don't know i kind of suspect it'll be
 

99
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,149
i don't know i kind of suspect it'll be
much the same

100
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
much the same
 

101
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,469
much the same
oh boy okay so not the best portal here

102
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
oh boy okay so not the best portal here
 

103
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,910
oh boy okay so not the best portal here
we got put underground

104
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
we got put underground
 

105
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,429
we got put underground
we are at y 28 so i think what we're

106
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
we are at y 28 so i think what we're
 

107
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,109
we are at y 28 so i think what we're
going to do is bust this and try bring

108
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
going to do is bust this and try bring
 

109
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,990
going to do is bust this and try bring
it up to the surface

110
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
it up to the surface
 

111
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,990
it up to the surface
because uh i've done this before where i

112
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
because uh i've done this before where i
 

113
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,830
because uh i've done this before where i
leave the portal down underground and i

114
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
leave the portal down underground and i
 

115
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,350
leave the portal down underground and i
always regret it later

116
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
always regret it later
 

117
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,630
always regret it later
uh we do have new stuff right lykan

118
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
uh we do have new stuff right lykan
 

119
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,109
uh we do have new stuff right lykan
that's the lichen so something kind of

120
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
that's the lichen so something kind of
 

121
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,950
that's the lichen so something kind of
caught me off guard with this the

122
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
caught me off guard with this the
 

123
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,070
caught me off guard with this the
the terrain generated very quickly

124
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
the terrain generated very quickly
 

125
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,830
the terrain generated very quickly
so that either means one of two things

126
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
so that either means one of two things
 

127
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,229
so that either means one of two things
either i've been here before

128

131
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,630
and i don't remember going here or
mojang have really improved the chunk

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,190
know if that's an amplified thing
or just the area here

166
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
or just the area here
 

167
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,150
or just the area here
haha we got the drip stone awesome okay

168
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
haha we got the drip stone awesome okay
 

169
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,589
haha we got the drip stone awesome okay
so that wasn't too hard to find

170
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
so that wasn't too hard to find
 

171
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,110
so that wasn't too hard to find
let's start putting together a goodie

172
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
let's start putting together a goodie
 

173
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,550
let's start putting together a goodie
bag here with all the new cool stuff

174
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
bag here with all the new cool stuff
 

175
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,149
bag here with all the new cool stuff
from the update

176
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
from the update
 

177
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,630
from the update
we'll see how much we can get today um

178
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
we'll see how much we can get today um
 

179
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,309
we'll see how much we can get today um
so i found a way up to

180
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
so i found a way up to
 

181
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,229
so i found a way up to
the surface here from the cave which is

182
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
the surface here from the cave which is
 

183
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,350
the surface here from the cave which is
awesome i didn't have to

184
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
awesome i didn't have to
 

185
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,390
awesome i didn't have to
dig a tunnel or anything and

186
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
dig a tunnel or anything and
 

187
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,790
dig a tunnel or anything and
brand new terrain here guys brand new

188
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
brand new terrain here guys brand new
 

189
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,990
brand new terrain here guys brand new
look at this

190
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
look at this
 

191
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,509
look at this
i'm gonna fly around a little bit and

192
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
i'm gonna fly around a little bit and
 

193
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,030
i'm gonna fly around a little bit and
just see how it does in the

194
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
just see how it does in the
 

195
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,070
just see how it does in the
in the video here if it like stutters or

196
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
in the video here if it like stutters or
 

197
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,910
in the video here if it like stutters or
for if we're good because it might be

198
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
for if we're good because it might be
 

199
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,149
for if we're good because it might be
quick now i don't know

200
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
quick now i don't know
 

201
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,509
quick now i don't know
like this is amplify terrain it's

202
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
like this is amplify terrain it's
 

203
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,190
like this is amplify terrain it's
usually really slow

204
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
usually really slow
 

205
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,270
usually really slow
so it is struggling a little bit but

206
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
so it is struggling a little bit but
 

207
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,869
so it is struggling a little bit but
honestly i think it might be a bit

208
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
honestly i think it might be a bit
 

209
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,869
honestly i think it might be a bit
faster like this is brand new terrain

210
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
faster like this is brand new terrain
 

211
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,750
faster like this is brand new terrain
it's generating

212
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
it's generating
 

213
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,750
it's generating
while i'm recording at 1080p and stuff

214
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
while i'm recording at 1080p and stuff
 

215
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,070
while i'm recording at 1080p and stuff
like this is a huge load on my cpu my

216
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
like this is a huge load on my cpu my
 

217
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,949
like this is a huge load on my cpu my
fan is going

218
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
fan is going
 

219
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,630
fan is going
crazy right now uh it's not bad though

220
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
crazy right now uh it's not bad though
 

221
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,789
crazy right now uh it's not bad though
it's honestly not too bad okay so we got

222
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
it's honestly not too bad okay so we got
 

223
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,470
it's honestly not too bad okay so we got
really lucky with our starting spot here

224
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
really lucky with our starting spot here
 

225
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,789
really lucky with our starting spot here
we

226
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
we
 

227
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,550
we
we came out at the swamp but there is an

228
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
we came out at the swamp but there is an
 

229
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,550
we came out at the swamp but there is an
ocean right by it

230
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
ocean right by it
 

231
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,030
ocean right by it
and we gotta get some moss from a

232
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
and we gotta get some moss from a
 

233
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,750
and we gotta get some moss from a
shipwreck

234
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
shipwreck
 

235
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,470
shipwreck
so this is perfect also i think the

236
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
so this is perfect also i think the
 

237
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,630
so this is perfect also i think the
easiest way to find the geos is just to

238
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
easiest way to find the geos is just to
 

239
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,509
easiest way to find the geos is just to
go to the ocean

240
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
go to the ocean
 

241
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,110
go to the ocean
because you usually see them sticking

242
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
because you usually see them sticking
 

243
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,869
because you usually see them sticking
out at the ground

244
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
out at the ground
 

245
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,589
out at the ground
oh we got coral reefs here good good

246
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
oh we got coral reefs here good good
 

247
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,869
oh we got coral reefs here good good
good i have to like go

248
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
good i have to like go
 

249
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,550
good i have to like go
and just mine a big coral reef sometime

250
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
and just mine a big coral reef sometime
 

251
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,149
and just mine a big coral reef sometime
so i got those blocks because i still

252
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
so i got those blocks because i still
 

253
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,270
so i got those blocks because i still
don't really have

254
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
don't really have
 

255
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,270
don't really have
a supply of them anywhere oh i think

256
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
a supply of them anywhere oh i think
 

257
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,030
a supply of them anywhere oh i think
that's one right

258
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
that's one right
 

259
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,430

261
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,510
there is that no that's sand that's just
sand no it is a shipwreck

262
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520

attention we got
ice spikes biome which are normally

280
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
ice spikes biome which are normally
 

281
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,469
ice spikes biome which are normally
pretty rare

282
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
pretty rare
 

283
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,909
pretty rare
and they look really cool and amplified

284
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
and they look really cool and amplified
 

285
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,030
and they look really cool and amplified
so i just want to see if there's

286
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
so i just want to see if there's

more and more ways to use iron in the
game right

356
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039

never added a new way of getting iron
 

367
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,230
never added a new way of getting iron
now you can fortune iron and you get a

368
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
now you can fortune iron and you get a
 

369
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,830
now you can fortune iron and you get a
lot more so caving

370
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
lot more so caving
 

371
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,870
lot more so caving
for iron just got way better right

372
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
for iron just got way better right
 

373
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,790
for iron just got way better right
you don't necessarily have to make an

374
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
you don't necessarily have to make an
 

375
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,029
you don't necessarily have to make an
iron firm anymore like for the average

376
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
iron firm anymore like for the average
 

377
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,710

generate because i've been really
 

759
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,470
generate because i've been really
curious about that like from what i've

760
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
curious about that like from what i've
 

761
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,550
curious about that like from what i've
observed so far i've never seen two of

762
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
observed so far i've never seen two of
 

763

767
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,710
really close to each other so i don't
know if there's something in the code

768
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
know if there's something in the code
 

769
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,269
know if there's something in the code
that

770
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
that
 

771
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,030

there's another one uh wandering around
 

811
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,750
there's another one uh wandering around
somewhere waiting to

812
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
somewhere waiting to
 

813
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,829
somewhere waiting to
headbutt me probably but yeah while

814
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
headbutt me probably but yeah while
 

815
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,990
headbutt me probably but yeah while
mining i i dug up here and there was a

816
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
mining i i dug up here and there was a
 

817
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,030
mining i i dug up here and there was a
geo down here

818
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
geo down here
 

819
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,509
geo down here
as well so like i think those two are

820
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
as well so like i think those two are
 

821
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,110
as well so like i think those two are
close enough together where i could farm

822
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
close enough together where i could farm
 

823
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,949
close enough together where i could farm
at least two together

824
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
at least two together
 

825
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,230
at least two together
and there's probably at least one or two

826
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
and there's probably at least one or two
 

827
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,790
and there's probably at least one or two
more in the area so

828
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
more in the area so
 

829
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,189
more in the area so
maybe we do that i don't know

830
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
maybe we do that i don't know
 

831
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,949
maybe we do that i don't know
um but i do want to get a little bit of

832
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
um but i do want to get a little bit of
 

833
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,110
um but i do want to get a little bit of
amethyst before we head back here

834
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
amethyst before we head back here
 

835
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,430
amethyst before we head back here
so the other question is what is the

836
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
so the other question is what is the
 

837
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,230
so the other question is what is the
best way of

838
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
best way of
 

839
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,470
best way of
farming these i might just set up a

840
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
farming these i might just set up a
 

841
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,389
farming these i might just set up a
bunch of pistons and then just manually

842
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
bunch of pistons and then just manually
 

843
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,069
bunch of pistons and then just manually
trigger it

844
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
trigger it
 

845
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,829
trigger it
to break the crystals and then get the

846
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
to break the crystals and then get the
 

847
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,310
to break the crystals and then get the
shards

848
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
shards
 

849
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,670
shards
all right so check it out we got the

850
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
all right so check it out we got the
 

851
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,350
all right so check it out we got the
geode pretty much mined out here that's

852
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
geode pretty much mined out here that's
 

853
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,189
geode pretty much mined out here that's
kind of step one to making an amethyst

854
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
kind of step one to making an amethyst
 

855
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,030
kind of step one to making an amethyst
farm just expose as many of these

856
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
farm just expose as many of these
 

857
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,350
farm just expose as many of these
crystal sides as possible

858
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
crystal sides as possible
 

859
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,269
crystal sides as possible
um and leave all the crystals behind

860
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
um and leave all the crystals behind
 

861
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,470
um and leave all the crystals behind
obviously you don't want to break these

862
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
obviously you don't want to break these
 

863
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,310
obviously you don't want to break these
because you can't get them back

864
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
because you can't get them back
 

865
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,790
because you can't get them back
now i mined out one of these geodes

866
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
now i mined out one of these geodes
 

867
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,189
now i mined out one of these geodes
before and it only had 18 of these

868
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
before and it only had 18 of these
 

869
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,310
before and it only had 18 of these
crystal seed things

870
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
crystal seed things
 

871
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,629
crystal seed things
this one has over 30 so this is like a

872
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
this one has over 30 so this is like a
 

873
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,150
this one has over 30 so this is like a
super geode actually

874
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
super geode actually
 

875
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,790
super geode actually
so not all of them are created equal we

876
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
so not all of them are created equal we
 

877
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,550
so not all of them are created equal we
got about 10 stacks of calcite and

878
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
got about 10 stacks of calcite and
 

879
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,509
got about 10 stacks of calcite and
amethyst from

880
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
amethyst from
 

881
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,550
amethyst from
from this geode as well from mining it

882
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
from this geode as well from mining it
 

883
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,670
from this geode as well from mining it
now how do we make the farm trying to

884
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
now how do we make the farm trying to
 

885
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,790
now how do we make the farm trying to
figure that out

886
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
figure that out
 

887
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,189
figure that out
uh so i'm pretty sure you can waterlog

888
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
uh so i'm pretty sure you can waterlog
 

889
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,949
uh so i'm pretty sure you can waterlog
these so you can't use water to break

890
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
these so you can't use water to break
 

891
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,310
these so you can't use water to break
the crystals i think we're gonna have to

892
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
the crystals i think we're gonna have to
 

893
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,230
the crystals i think we're gonna have to
go for pistons

894
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
go for pistons
 

895
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,470
go for pistons
and probably the smartest way to do it

896
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
and probably the smartest way to do it
 

897
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,069
and probably the smartest way to do it
is to work from the top and go

898
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
is to work from the top and go
 

899
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,870
is to work from the top and go
down and when you use the piston to

900
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
down and when you use the piston to
 

901
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,030
down and when you use the piston to
break the crystal

902
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
break the crystal
 

903
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,110
break the crystal
you need to figure out a way to make the

904
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
you need to figure out a way to make the
 

905
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,069
you need to figure out a way to make the
crystal shards

906
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
crystal shards
 

907
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,629
crystal shards
drop into a water stream and then like

908
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
drop into a water stream and then like
 

909
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,949
drop into a water stream and then like
combine all the water streams together

910
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
combine all the water streams together
 

911
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,949
combine all the water streams together
and then like the water streams from

912
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
and then like the water streams from
 

913
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,790
and then like the water streams from
several different geodes together

914
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
several different geodes together
 

915
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,749
several different geodes together
all into one central location so it's

916
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
all into one central location so it's
 

917
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,870
all into one central location so it's
actually like a

918
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
actually like a
 

919
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,910
actually like a
big crazy thing to do because you're

920
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
big crazy thing to do because you're
 

921
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,430
big crazy thing to do because you're
gonna need like hundreds of pistons for

922
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
gonna need like hundreds of pistons for
 

923
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,269
gonna need like hundreds of pistons for
this right there's so many sides

924
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
this right there's so many sides
 

925
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,150
this right there's so many sides
okay you know what normally i'm like oh

926
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
okay you know what normally i'm like oh
 

927
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,829
okay you know what normally i'm like oh
guys this is how you automate stuff

928
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
guys this is how you automate stuff
 

929
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,629
guys this is how you automate stuff
right you just

930
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
right you just
 

931
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,949
right you just
get a bunch of pistons in the redstone

932
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
get a bunch of pistons in the redstone
 

933
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,949
get a bunch of pistons in the redstone
in it oh it works amazing you should do

934
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
in it oh it works amazing you should do
 

935
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,749
in it oh it works amazing you should do
it too

936
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
it too
 

937
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,910
it too
i'm going to go out and say don't try to

938
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
i'm going to go out and say don't try to
 

939
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,910
i'm going to go out and say don't try to
automate this farm it's not worth it

940
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
automate this farm it's not worth it
 

941
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,230
automate this farm it's not worth it
just mind the crystals yourself i'll

942
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
just mind the crystals yourself i'll
 

943
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,590
just mind the crystals yourself i'll
probably try to automate it just because

944
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
probably try to automate it just because
 

945
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,110
probably try to automate it just because
i like the challenge but it

946
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
i like the challenge but it
 

947
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,389
i like the challenge but it
is a nightmare absolute nightmare it's a

948
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
is a nightmare absolute nightmare it's a
 

949
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,829
is a nightmare absolute nightmare it's a
giant puzzle

950
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
giant puzzle
 

951
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,470
giant puzzle
and this is two of the seeds this is

952
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
and this is two of the seeds this is
 

953
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,150
and this is two of the seeds this is
what just getting two of them done looks

954
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
what just getting two of them done looks
 

955
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,550
what just getting two of them done looks
like

956
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
like
 

957
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,670
like
so it's like 11 or 12 pistons there

958
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
so it's like 11 or 12 pistons there
 

959
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,509
so it's like 11 or 12 pistons there
i decided to go for hoppers instead of

960
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
i decided to go for hoppers instead of
 

961
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,030
i decided to go for hoppers instead of
water streams just because they're more

962
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
water streams just because they're more
 

963
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,470
water streams just because they're more
compact i don't have to worry about

964
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
compact i don't have to worry about
 

965
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,949
compact i don't have to worry about
water

966
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
water
 

967
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,470
water
spilling over the redstone as i'm

968
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
spilling over the redstone as i'm
 

969
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,069
spilling over the redstone as i'm
working on this

970
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
working on this
 

971
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,749
working on this
uh but yeah the crazy thing is you also

leads to do it instead of minecarts this
 

1063
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,270
leads to do it instead of minecarts this
is so much

1064

is so much
 

1065
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,950
is so much
so much faster and easier to like remove

i've almost had the llamas go extinct
 

1115
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,630
i've almost had the llamas go extinct
because i only brought a few over right

guess what i gotta go thousands of
 

1125
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,470
guess what i gotta go thousands of
blocks to get more llamas

1126
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
blocks to get more llamas
 

1127
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,230
blocks to get more llamas

breed a couple more and uh yeah

1132
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
breed a couple more and uh yeah

breed a couple more and uh yeah
oh oh i bet you it was a ramming attack

1134
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
oh oh i bet you it was a ramming attack
 

1135
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,750
oh oh i bet you it was a ramming attack
i didn't expect the little guys to do

1136
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
i didn't expect the little guys to do
 

1137
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,350
i didn't expect the little guys to do
the ramming attacks but i guess it makes

1138
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
the ramming attacks but i guess it makes
 

1139
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,390
the ramming attacks but i guess it makes
sense that uh

1140
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
sense that uh
 

1141
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,390
sense that uh
they all would do it unless he got mad

1142
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
they all would do it unless he got mad

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,350
because i put the food away
i look like he said no there

1146
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360

 

1147
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,110

so apparently you can get milk from

1148
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
so apparently you can get milk from
 

1149
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,630
so apparently you can get milk from
goats if you want

1150
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
goats if you want
 

1151
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,230

1152
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
uh i don't think you can put saddles on
 

1153
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,630
uh i don't think you can put saddles on
them and the little guys you can feed

1154
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
them and the little guys you can feed
 

1155
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:38,390
them and the little guys you can feed
wheat to grow faster question mark

1156
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
wheat to grow faster question mark
 

1157
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,350
wheat to grow faster question mark
okay no you can't settle them oh that

1158
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
okay no you can't settle them oh that
 

1159
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,549
okay no you can't settle them oh that
would have been cool because they jump

1160
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
would have been cool because they jump
 

1161
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,430
would have been cool because they jump
really high right

1162
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
really high right
 

1163
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,190
really high right
and you could use them for getting

1164
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
and you could use them for getting
 

1165
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,630
and you could use them for getting
around vertically

1166
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640
around vertically
 

1167
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,390
around vertically
uh-huh so whenever a new animal comes

1168
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
uh-huh so whenever a new animal comes
 

1169
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,909
uh-huh so whenever a new animal comes
out in this game one of my goals with

1170
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
out in this game one of my goals with
 

1171
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,350
out in this game one of my goals with
our world now is to

1172
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
our world now is to
 

1173
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,510
our world now is to
try to spread them throughout our

1174
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
try to spread them throughout our
 

1175
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,590
try to spread them throughout our
pre-existing world so that it's not like

1176
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
pre-existing world so that it's not like
 

1177
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,549
pre-existing world so that it's not like
uh

1178
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
uh
 

1179
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,549
uh
they don't exist you know because we

1180
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
they don't exist you know because we
 

1181
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,230
they don't exist you know because we
never see pandas we never see any of

1182
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
never see pandas we never see any of
 

1183
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,350
never see pandas we never see any of
these things in our world

1184
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,360
these things in our world
 

1185
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,870
these things in our world
because you know i never populated them

1186
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
because you know i never populated them
 

1187
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,950
because you know i never populated them
anywhere right so i brought some goats

1188
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
anywhere right so i brought some goats
 

1189
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,549
anywhere right so i brought some goats
up to our ice farm area here i'll

1190
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
up to our ice farm area here i'll
 

1191
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,230
up to our ice farm area here i'll
probably spread them around the man cave

1192
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
probably spread them around the man cave
 

1193
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,470
probably spread them around the man cave
area and a few other places as well

1194
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
area and a few other places as well
 

1195
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,909
area and a few other places as well
just so it feels like they're part of

1196
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
just so it feels like they're part of
 

1197
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,669
just so it feels like they're part of
our world and in the game

1198
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
our world and in the game
 

1199
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,830
our world and in the game
instead of like we never see them so

1200
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
instead of like we never see them so
 

1201
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,350
instead of like we never see them so
over at our ice farm uh

1202
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
over at our ice farm uh
 

1203
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,710
over at our ice farm uh
another thing i want to do here is just

1204
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
another thing i want to do here is just
 

1205
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,390
another thing i want to do here is just
drop down a bunch of cauldrons so next

1206
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
drop down a bunch of cauldrons so next
 

1207
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,149
drop down a bunch of cauldrons so next
time it rains in the game i'm going to

1208
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
time it rains in the game i'm going to
 

1209
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,350
time it rains in the game i'm going to
come out here

1210
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
come out here
 

1211
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,950
come out here
and we'll try to collect some of that

1212
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
and we'll try to collect some of that
 

1213
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,029
and we'll try to collect some of that
powdered snow in the cauldrons and

1214
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
powdered snow in the cauldrons and
 

1215
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,350
powdered snow in the cauldrons and
we may eventually set up a farm here for

1216
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
we may eventually set up a farm here for
 

1217
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,310
we may eventually set up a farm here for
it

1218
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
it
 

1219
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,510
it
seems like this would be a good area

1220
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
seems like this would be a good area
 

1221
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,190
seems like this would be a good area
because i kind of afk here for the ice

1222
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
because i kind of afk here for the ice
 

1223
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,909
because i kind of afk here for the ice
already

1224
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
already
 

1225
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,430
already

like whenever a new update comes out do

1234
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
like whenever a new update comes out do
 

1235
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,470
like whenever a new update comes out do
you think i should try to enhance

1236
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
you think i should try to enhance
 

1237
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,789
you think i should try to enhance
the man cave with the new features or

1238
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
the man cave with the new features or
 

1239
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,070
the man cave with the new features or
should we leave it

1240
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
should we leave it
 

1241
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,590
should we leave it
kind of the way it is because it for the

1242
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
kind of the way it is because it for the
 

1243
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,669
kind of the way it is because it for the
most part like most of the areas we see

1244
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
most part like most of the areas we see
 

1245
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,710
most part like most of the areas we see
here are

1246
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
here are
 

1247
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,029
here are
are done right but whenever a new update

1248
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
are done right but whenever a new update
 

1249
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,789
are done right but whenever a new update
comes out there is potential to

1250
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
comes out there is potential to
 

1251
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,350
comes out there is potential to
enhance it like we got the stone slabs a

1252
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
enhance it like we got the stone slabs a
 

1253
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,390
enhance it like we got the stone slabs a
long time ago

1254
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
long time ago
 

1255
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,070
long time ago
you know i could smooth out the cave

1256
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
you know i could smooth out the cave
 

1257
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,710
you know i could smooth out the cave
with these with the stone stairs and we

1258
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
with these with the stone stairs and we
 

1259
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,190
with these with the stone stairs and we
could mix

1260
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
could mix
 

1261
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,110
could mix
andesite into the walls all that kind of

1262
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
andesite into the walls all that kind of
 

1263
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,430
andesite into the walls all that kind of
stuff i kind of chose not to

1264
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
stuff i kind of chose not to
 

1265
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,710
stuff i kind of chose not to
i don't know if that was the right

1266
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
i don't know if that was the right
 

1267
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,549
i don't know if that was the right
decision though like

1268
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
decision though like
 

1269
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,070
decision though like
and like with this update now we've

1270
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
and like with this update now we've
 

1271
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,230
and like with this update now we've
gotten more foliage and stuff we got

1272
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
gotten more foliage and stuff we got
 

1273
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,110
gotten more foliage and stuff we got
these

1274
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
these
 

1275
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,789
these
drip stone things we could hang in

1276
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
drip stone things we could hang in
 

1277
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,870
drip stone things we could hang in
places do you think that's a mistake

1278
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
places do you think that's a mistake
 

1279
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,789
places do you think that's a mistake

1280
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
let me know in the comments because i
 

1281
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,630
let me know in the comments because i
really struggle with that decision

1282
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
really struggle with that decision
 

1283
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,909
really struggle with that decision

that kind of stuff
so can we get the smooth basalt from

1294
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640
so can we get the smooth basalt from
 

1295
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,530
so can we get the smooth basalt from
the nether update basalt

1296
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:38,540
the nether update basalt
 

1297
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,909

it is smelting okay that's good what
 

1301
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,950
it is smelting okay that's good what
happens when we smelt

1302
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
happens when we smelt
 

1303
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,950
happens when we smelt
deep slate iron does it just give us an

1304
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960
deep slate iron does it just give us an
 

1305
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,630
deep slate iron does it just give us an
ingots um

1306
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
ingots um
 

1307
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,549
ingots um
i don't think you can smelt the full

1308
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
i don't think you can smelt the full
 

1309
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,909
i don't think you can smelt the full
blocks of these can you

1310
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
blocks of these can you
 

1311
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,110
blocks of these can you
no because i think it takes nine i

1312
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
no because i think it takes nine i
 

1313
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,950
no because i think it takes nine i
or nine uh copper ingots to make a

1314
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
or nine uh copper ingots to make a
 

1315
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,350
or nine uh copper ingots to make a
copper block right

1316
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
copper block right
 

1317
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,350
copper block right
i almost feel like maybe they should add

1318
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
i almost feel like maybe they should add
 

1319
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,830
i almost feel like maybe they should add
a way to smell the full block

1320
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
a way to smell the full block
 

1321
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,029
a way to smell the full block
and make it just take longer or

1322
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
and make it just take longer or
 

1323
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,149
and make it just take longer or
something i don't know i don't know

1324
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
something i don't know i don't know
 

1325
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,390
something i don't know i don't know
you gotta uncompress it and then smelt

1326
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
you gotta uncompress it and then smelt
 

1327
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,310
you gotta uncompress it and then smelt
it and then recompress it as the block i

1328
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
it and then recompress it as the block i
 

1329
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,190
it and then recompress it as the block i
guess

1330
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
guess
 

1331
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,230
guess
um so we did get some gobble deep slate

1332
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
um so we did get some gobble deep slate
 

1333
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,990
um so we did get some gobble deep slate
you get that if you don't use silk touch

1334
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
you get that if you don't use silk touch
 

1335
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,110
you get that if you don't use silk touch
that smelts into i think regular deep

1336
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
that smelts into i think regular deep
 

1337
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,909
that smelts into i think regular deep
slate which you can get with silk touch

1338
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
slate which you can get with silk touch
 

1339
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,430
slate which you can get with silk touch
that can't be smelted again into

1340
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
that can't be smelted again into
 

1341
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,230
that can't be smelted again into
anything okay so

1579
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,430
with someone it's like etho where are
you you eat the glowberry and then you

1580
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
you you eat the glowberry and then you
 

1581
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,149
you you eat the glowberry and then you
get highlighted for them

1582

get highlighted for them
 

1583
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,510
get highlighted for them
i think that would have been neat

1584
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
i think that would have been neat
 

1585
