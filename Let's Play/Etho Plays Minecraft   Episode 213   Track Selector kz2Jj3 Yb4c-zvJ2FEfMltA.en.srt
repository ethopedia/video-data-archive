96
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
could still use it as a way of
 

97
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,670
could still use it as a way of
transporting villagers and

98
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
transporting villagers and
 

99
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,470
transporting villagers and

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
and moving lots of items like with
 

101
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,710
and moving lots of items like with
storage minecarts at a time

102
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
storage minecarts at a time
 

103
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,150
storage minecarts at a time
um other animals you know

104

so you won't see the levers and we might
 

285
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,469
so you won't see the levers and we might
get rid of these columns i'm not sure

if the gas shoots it it'll burn so i can
 

345
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,990
if the gas shoots it it'll burn so i can
even potentially leave it behind if i

346
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
even potentially leave it behind if i
 

347
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,909
even potentially leave it behind if i
don't feel like removing it

348
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
don't feel like removing it
 

349
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,670
don't feel like removing it
um but yeah i might do a montage

367
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,150
nine ten eleven and a half stacks of
glowstone from that trip

368
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160

 

369
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,670

back to business here we're gonna
 

371
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,030
back to business here we're gonna
enchant a shovel

372
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
enchant a shovel
 

373
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,190
enchant a shovel
going through these things quickly

374
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200

 

375
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,230

a little bit low but it'll do

376
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
a little bit low but it'll do
 

377
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,590
a little bit low but it'll do
all right let's head on over to the

378
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
all right let's head on over to the
 

379
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,430
all right let's head on over to the
nether

380
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
nether
 

381
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,350
nether
oh that was pro um i'm going to show you

382
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
oh that was pro um i'm going to show you
 

383
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,550
oh that was pro um i'm going to show you
the plan for the selection panel i saw a

384
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
the plan for the selection panel i saw a
 

385
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,910
the plan for the selection panel i saw a
really cool design for one

386
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
really cool design for one
 

387
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,110
really cool design for one
that we're gonna use

388
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120

 

389
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,590

let's see get that going we'll need

390
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
let's see get that going we'll need
 

391
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,389
let's see get that going we'll need
these

392
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
these
 

393
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,750
these
and some stone brick

394
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
and some stone brick
 

395
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,990
and some stone brick
so we'll just set up uh an example of it

396
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
so we'll just set up uh an example of it
 

397
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,310
so we'll just set up uh an example of it
and get an idea of the size and all that

398
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
and get an idea of the size and all that
 

399
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,350
and get an idea of the size and all that
too

400
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
too
 

401
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,470
too
and then we will

402
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
and then we will
 

403
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,110
and then we will
build it into place so maybe let's just

404
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
build it into place so maybe let's just
 

405
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,750
build it into place so maybe let's just
build it

406
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
build it
 

407
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,630
build it
over here

408
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
over here
 

409
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,670
over here
okay it's going to be a little tough

410
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
okay it's going to be a little tough
 

411
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,829
okay it's going to be a little tough
with the half slabs

412
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839

 

413
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,710

um

414
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
um
 

415
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,110
um
let's see

416
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120

 

417
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,230

you know what i'm going to get rid of

418
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
you know what i'm going to get rid of
 

419
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,910
you know what i'm going to get rid of
the half slabs just so we can get down a

420
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
the half slabs just so we can get down a
 

421
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,509
the half slabs just so we can get down a
little lower

422
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519

 

423
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,350

also somebody suggested i should put ice

424
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
also somebody suggested i should put ice
 

425
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,630
also somebody suggested i should put ice
under this and i didn't even think of

426
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
under this and i didn't even think of
 

427
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,150
under this and i didn't even think of
that that's uh that's a pretty good idea

428
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
that that's uh that's a pretty good idea
 

429
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,269
that that's uh that's a pretty good idea
all right let's do like this

430
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
all right let's do like this
 

431
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,190
all right let's do like this
i'm going by memory hopefully i can

432
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
i'm going by memory hopefully i can
 

433
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,590
i'm going by memory hopefully i can
remember it exactly correctly

434
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
remember it exactly correctly
 

435
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,870
remember it exactly correctly
otherwise it's not going to work

436
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
otherwise it's not going to work
 

437
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,150
otherwise it's not going to work
um

438
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160

 

439
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,949

do this okay so first of all we need

440
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
do this okay so first of all we need
 

441
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,710
do this okay so first of all we need
buttons we need

442
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
buttons we need
 

443
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,670
buttons we need
five buttons

444
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680

 

445
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,670

go over here each of these will be

446
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
go over here each of these will be
 

447
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,710
go over here each of these will be
represent a

448
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
represent a
 

449
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,590
represent a
selection of places to go destinations

450
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
selection of places to go destinations
 

451
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,550
selection of places to go destinations
and

452
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
and
 

453
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,509
and
nice spots under that we have the wire

454
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
nice spots under that we have the wire
 

455
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,990
nice spots under that we have the wire
and then

456
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000

 

457
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,870

i think i can just fill this all in

458
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880

 

459
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,990

okay then it's it goes repeater

460
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000

 

461
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,829

and piston

462
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839

 

463
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,069

that okay then i think uh

464
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079

 

465
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,990

oh yeah above the buttons there's also

466
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
oh yeah above the buttons there's also
 

467
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,829
oh yeah above the buttons there's also
redstone torches

468
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
redstone torches
 

469
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:19,269
redstone torches
and then wait maybe not

470
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279

 

471
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,030

something seems strange

472
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040

 

473
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,389

all right i'm gonna check i'm gonna

474
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
all right i'm gonna check i'm gonna
 

475
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,990
all right i'm gonna check i'm gonna
check it one more time and then we'll

476
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
check it one more time and then we'll
 

477
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,389
check it one more time and then we'll
continue

478
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
continue
 

479
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,030
continue
no that was uh that was right um i got a

480
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
no that was uh that was right um i got a
 

481
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,949
no that was uh that was right um i got a
little confused i thought for some

482
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
little confused i thought for some
 

483
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,470
little confused i thought for some
reason the repeaters were supposed to go

484
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
reason the repeaters were supposed to go
 

485
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,710
reason the repeaters were supposed to go
the other way

486
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
the other way
 

487
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,550
the other way
put this here i thought the repeaters

488
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
put this here i thought the repeaters
 

489
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,750
put this here i thought the repeaters
are supposed to go this way for some

490
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
are supposed to go this way for some
 

491
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,550
are supposed to go this way for some
reason but no

492
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
reason but no
 

493
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,750
reason but no
they they uh attached to the torches

494
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
they they uh attached to the torches
 

495
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,269
they they uh attached to the torches
like that all right

496
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
like that all right
 

497
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,030
like that all right
then these blocks will come up

498
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
then these blocks will come up
 

499
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:01,269
then these blocks will come up
and then above that we have more pistons

500
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279

 

501
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,990

with more blocks which will extend

502
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
with more blocks which will extend
 

503
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,069
with more blocks which will extend
to above the torches and then the power

504
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
to above the torches and then the power
 

505
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,670
to above the torches and then the power
will go from the torches to

506
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
will go from the torches to
 

507
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,949
will go from the torches to
glowstone lamps lamps just lamps

508
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
glowstone lamps lamps just lamps
 

509
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,030
glowstone lamps lamps just lamps
not closed stone lamps like that

510
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
not closed stone lamps like that
 

511
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,790
not closed stone lamps like that
all right so that's that's our selector

512
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
all right so that's that's our selector
 

513
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,350
all right so that's that's our selector
panel here it's a very cool design i'm

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,430
glad i
i saw it tried to figure out who made it

518
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
i saw it tried to figure out who made it
 

519
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,470
i saw it tried to figure out who made it
originally and

520
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
originally and
 

521
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,430
originally and
uh let's just say that was not an easy

522
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
uh let's just say that was not an easy
 

523
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,069
uh let's just say that was not an easy
task

524
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
task
 

525
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,629
task
i found a few youtube videos of it and

526
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
i found a few youtube videos of it and
 

527
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,550
i found a few youtube videos of it and
then somebody linked it all the way back

528
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
then somebody linked it all the way back
 

529
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:36,949
then somebody linked it all the way back
to

530
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
to
 

531
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,870
to
a thread on the minecraft forums and i

532
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
a thread on the minecraft forums and i
 

533
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,670
a thread on the minecraft forums and i
went there

534
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
went there
 

535
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,710
went there
and the image the guy

536
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
and the image the guy
 

537
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,030
and the image the guy
showing it wasn't there so i couldn't

538
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
showing it wasn't there so i couldn't
 

539
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,910
showing it wasn't there so i couldn't
confirm if he was the first or not so

540
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
confirm if he was the first or not so
 

541
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,470
confirm if he was the first or not so
somebody made it wasn't me and there's

542
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
somebody made it wasn't me and there's
 

543
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,430
somebody made it wasn't me and there's
probably a lot of

544
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
probably a lot of
 

545
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,949
probably a lot of
youtube videos of it so

546
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959

 

547
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,230

yeah so this is pretty cool

548
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
yeah so this is pretty cool
 

549
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,629
yeah so this is pretty cool
so it's inverse the one that's selected

550
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
so it's inverse the one that's selected
 

551
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,150
so it's inverse the one that's selected
is unlit and the ones that aren't

552
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
is unlit and the ones that aren't
 

553
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,670
is unlit and the ones that aren't
selected are lit

554
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
selected are lit
 

555
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,590
selected are lit
and you can attach as many of these as

556
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
and you can attach as many of these as
 

557
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,990
and you can attach as many of these as
you want

558
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
you want
 

559
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,990
you want
keeping in mind the 15 block limit of

560
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
keeping in mind the 15 block limit of
 

561
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,509
keeping in mind the 15 block limit of
redstone

562
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519

 

563
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,470

so yeah that's what we're going to use

564
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
so yeah that's what we're going to use
 

565
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,550
so yeah that's what we're going to use
and i think i'm going to let's see

566
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
and i think i'm going to let's see
 

567
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,189
and i think i'm going to let's see
stairs yeah let's try make it look a

568
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
stairs yeah let's try make it look a
 

569
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,389
stairs yeah let's try make it look a
little bit more sleek

570
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
little bit more sleek
 

571
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,990
little bit more sleek
i'm going to have stairs go up like this

572
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
i'm going to have stairs go up like this
 

573
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,310
i'm going to have stairs go up like this
and stairs below

574
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
and stairs below
 

575
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,430
and stairs below
like that

576
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440

 

577
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,790

that's pretty cool very snazzy

578
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
that's pretty cool very snazzy
 

579
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,629
that's pretty cool very snazzy
and then the outputs are on the back

580
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
and then the outputs are on the back
 

581
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,550
and then the outputs are on the back
here um

582
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
here um
 

583
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,750
here um
basically when it goes through the

584
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
basically when it goes through the
 

585
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,990
basically when it goes through the
repeater here we need to

586
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
repeater here we need to
 

587
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,230
repeater here we need to
have a block behind her that with

588
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
have a block behind her that with
 

589
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,910
have a block behind her that with
another repeater whatever on top

590
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
another repeater whatever on top
 

591
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,189
another repeater whatever on top
to catch it

592
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199

 

593
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,350

and then branch off from that

594
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360

 

595
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,069

actually no we need uh we need to invert

596
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
actually no we need uh we need to invert
 

597
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,269
actually no we need uh we need to invert
the signal too

598
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
the signal too
 

599
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,790
the signal too
but yeah basically that's what we're

600
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
but yeah basically that's what we're
 

601
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,949
but yeah basically that's what we're
gonna do uh we're gonna actually have

602
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
gonna do uh we're gonna actually have
 

603
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,670
gonna do uh we're gonna actually have
two of those

604
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
two of those
 

605
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,790
two of those
of these though and link them together

606
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
of these though and link them together
 

607
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,509
of these though and link them together
uh just five buttons on each for a total

608
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
uh just five buttons on each for a total
 

609
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,629
uh just five buttons on each for a total
of ten

610
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
of ten
 

611
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,710
of ten
so we'll have one on the left and one on

612
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
so we'll have one on the left and one on
 

613
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,910
so we'll have one on the left and one on
the right

614
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
the right
 

615
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,910
the right
and then i'm going to put a mine cart in

616
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
and then i'm going to put a mine cart in
 

617
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,670
and then i'm going to put a mine cart in
between them

618
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
between them
 

619
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,269
between them
so that when we're in the mine cart

620
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
so that when we're in the mine cart
 

621
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,790
so that when we're in the mine cart
we'll be able to

622
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
we'll be able to
 

623
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,749
we'll be able to
reach all the buttons five here and then

624
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
reach all the buttons five here and then
 

625
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,069
reach all the buttons five here and then
five

626
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
five
 

627
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,230
five
over here so

628
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
over here so
 

629
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,749
over here so
that's the plan and i'm going to start

630
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
that's the plan and i'm going to start
 

631
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,829
that's the plan and i'm going to start
hollowing out a space

632
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
hollowing out a space
 

633
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,790
hollowing out a space
for our area here and we will get to

634
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
for our area here and we will get to
 

635
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,509
for our area here and we will get to
building

636
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
building
 

637
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,550
building
the official one

638
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560

okay i think we are ready to go here um
 

641
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,629
okay i think we are ready to go here um
since there's a lot of wiring involved i

642
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
since there's a lot of wiring involved i
 

643
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,550
since there's a lot of wiring involved i
want a little bit of a buffer before we

644
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
want a little bit of a buffer before we
 

645
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,310
want a little bit of a buffer before we
get to the selector

646
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
get to the selector
 

647
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,629
get to the selector
panels so we are going to

648
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639

 

649
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,910

make an arch to begin with to get an
 

661
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,790
make an arch to begin with to get an
idea of how big of an

662
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
idea of how big of an
 

663
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,189

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
the nether all right um maybe let's try
 

689
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,829
the nether all right um maybe let's try
up to here

690
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
up to here
 

691
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,710
up to here

695
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:37,430
how's that look yeah it's a good size
and let's make it rounded

696
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440

 

697
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,230

i want a 3x3 thing

700
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
i want a 3x3 thing
 

701
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,390
i want a 3x3 thing
so let's try

702
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400

 

703
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,029

yeah oh yeah that works perfect okay
 

705
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,990
yeah oh yeah that works perfect okay
three by three

706
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
three by three
 

707
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,549
three by three
same on this side

708
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559

 

709
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,630

okay so that's going to be our buffer

710
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
okay so that's going to be our buffer
 

711
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,310
okay so that's going to be our buffer
just this little extra

712
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
just this little extra
 

713
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,990
just this little extra
3x3 edition then

714
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
3x3 edition then
 

715
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,190
3x3 edition then
we will put our selector panel here

716
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200
we will put our selector panel here
 

717
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,830
we will put our selector panel here
and i want the buttons at eye level

718
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
and i want the buttons at eye level
 

719
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,909
and i want the buttons at eye level
um how's that gonna work

720
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919

 

721
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,909

i guess the stairs on the ground then

722
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
i guess the stairs on the ground then
 

723
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,430
i guess the stairs on the ground then
buttons then stairs above

724
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
buttons then stairs above
 

725
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,710
buttons then stairs above
okay

726
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720

 

727
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,070

um maybe let's go down

728
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
um maybe let's go down
 

729
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,430
um maybe let's go down
one block too that would be cool uh that

730
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
one block too that would be cool uh that
 

731
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,990
one block too that would be cool uh that
way we'll

732
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
way we'll
 

733
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,909
way we'll
we'll sort of look down at a nice open

734
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
we'll sort of look down at a nice open
 

735
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,510
we'll sort of look down at a nice open
room

736
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
room
 

737
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:45,110
room
and do do it like

738
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120

 

739
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,440

i'm not really sure i could do that

740
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:50,450
i'm not really sure i could do that
 

741
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,470
i'm not really sure i could do that
[Music]

742
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
[Music]
 

743
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,310
[Music]
that and we'll just worry about the

744
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
that and we'll just worry about the
 

745
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,990
that and we'll just worry about the
front first of all we want it to look

746
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
front first of all we want it to look
 

747
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,950
front first of all we want it to look
good

748
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
good
 

749
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,870
good
then we can do the wiring afterward

750
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
then we can do the wiring afterward
 

751
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,669
then we can do the wiring afterward
since we already know what we're doing

752
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
since we already know what we're doing
 

753
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,510
since we already know what we're doing
uh actually let's let's start getting

754
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
uh actually let's let's start getting
 

755
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,150
uh actually let's let's start getting
some wool involved here

756
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
some wool involved here
 

757
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,029
some wool involved here
now some people said i should try to get

758
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
now some people said i should try to get
 

759
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,310
now some people said i should try to get
other colors of wool

760
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
other colors of wool
 

761
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,350
other colors of wool
in um

762
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
in um
 

763
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,909
in um
i do really like the purple but if we do

764
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
i do really like the purple but if we do
 

765
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,430
i do really like the purple but if we do
other colors

766
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
other colors
 

767
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,270
other colors
each of these because we got to build

768
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
each of these because we got to build
 

769
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,630
each of these because we got to build
four of these things and each one of

770
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
four of these things and each one of
 

771
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,150
four of these things and each one of
these would have to be a different color

772
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
these would have to be a different color
 

773
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,510
these would have to be a different color
i think

774
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520

 

775
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,110

i guess it doesn't matter

776
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120

 

777
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,669

all right how's it going to look

778
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679

 

779
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,070

oh that's cool so our buttons will go on

780
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
oh that's cool so our buttons will go on
 

781
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:50,830
oh that's cool so our buttons will go on
that

782
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:50,840

 

783
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,230

okay

784
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
okay
 

785
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,070
okay
uh oh yeah let's let's change this to

786
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
uh oh yeah let's let's change this to
 

787
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:03,510
uh oh yeah let's let's change this to
stairs

788
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520

 

789
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,190

all right yeah that's that goes good

790
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
all right yeah that's that goes good
 

791
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,110
all right yeah that's that goes good
then it kind of goes with this

792
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
then it kind of goes with this
 

793
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,510
then it kind of goes with this
and then we'll have the same over here

794
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520

 

795
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,909

liking it um

796
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919

 

797
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,230

then another column like that

798
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
then another column like that
 

799
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,909
then another column like that
okay and then we can do a floor whatever

800
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
okay and then we can do a floor whatever
 

801
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,590
okay and then we can do a floor whatever
we want we need it to be a full block at

802
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
we want we need it to be a full block at
 

803
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,270
we want we need it to be a full block at
the floor because we got to put minecart

804
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
the floor because we got to put minecart
 

805
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,430
the floor because we got to put minecart
tracks on it and stuff um

806
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440

 

807
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,510

and let's change this to the wool color

808
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
and let's change this to the wool color
 

809
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,789
and let's change this to the wool color
too

810
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
more lighting in here too let's put some
 

815
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,510
more lighting in here too let's put some
lamps down

816
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
lamps down
 

817
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,950
lamps down
here

818
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960

 

819
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,149

i'll power these once i stop recording

820
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159

 

821
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,710

okay we've got something going here

822
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
okay we've got something going here
 

823
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,230
okay we've got something going here
i'll i'm gonna mirror it to this side

824
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
i'll i'm gonna mirror it to this side
 

825
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,909
i'll i'm gonna mirror it to this side
and i'll get back to you

826
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919

 

827
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,750

all right it's looking pretty good so

828
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
all right it's looking pretty good so
 

829
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,669
all right it's looking pretty good so
far i'm happy with it

830
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
far i'm happy with it
 

831
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,270
far i'm happy with it
i think the next thing

832
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
i think the next thing
 

833
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,510
i think the next thing
should work on is the tunnel so i've

834
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
should work on is the tunnel so i've
 

835
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,750
should work on is the tunnel so i've
decided already i want my rail tunnels

836
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
decided already i want my rail tunnels
 

837
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,590
decided already i want my rail tunnels
to be a 3x3

838
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
to be a 3x3
 

839
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,110
to be a 3x3
by default so if we center it

840
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
by default so if we center it
 

841
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,310
by default so if we center it
it would be over there

842
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
it would be over there
 

843
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,669
it would be over there
so i think let's just try

844
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679

 

845
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,830

shape that out and see how that goes

846
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840

 

847
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,070

[Music]

848
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080

 

849
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,669

oh yeah and also i put purple wall on

850
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
oh yeah and also i put purple wall on
 

851
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,470
oh yeah and also i put purple wall on
the floor and i like that too

852
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
the floor and i like that too
 

853
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,029
the floor and i like that too
so it goes from the circle to out into

854
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
so it goes from the circle to out into
 

855
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,590
so it goes from the circle to out into
here

856
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600

 

857
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,190

okay there's our tunnel

858
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
okay there's our tunnel
 

859
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,350
okay there's our tunnel
and yeah i'll encase all this with stone

860
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
and yeah i'll encase all this with stone
 

861
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,669
and yeah i'll encase all this with stone
brick later so it's gas proof

862
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
brick later so it's gas proof
 

863
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,230
brick later so it's gas proof
uh actually these uh these areas here

864
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
uh actually these uh these areas here
 

865
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,510
uh actually these uh these areas here
might be good for a door

866
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
might be good for a door
 

867
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,430
might be good for a door
to get to the wiring in that too behind

868
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
to get to the wiring in that too behind
 

869
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,029
to get to the wiring in that too behind
there

870
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
there
 

871
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,789
there
so that could be good

872
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
so that could be good
 

873
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,830
so that could be good
all right

874
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840

 

875
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,789

so yeah let's work on the ceiling now

876
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799

 

877
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,549

uh let yeah so we got these two columns

878
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
uh let yeah so we got these two columns
 

879
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,070
uh let yeah so we got these two columns
one there and one there let's do the

880
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
one there and one there let's do the
 

881
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,430
one there and one there let's do the
arch on the second one

882
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
arch on the second one
 

883
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,430
arch on the second one
too to be the same it would be

884
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440

 

885
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,029

over here

886
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039

 

887
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,470

i'm not sure if that will work

888
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480

 

889
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,110

and let's uh let's mirror the floor

890
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120

 

891
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,310

that

892
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320

 

893
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,430

and that's and let's

894
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
and that's and let's
 

895
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,710
and that's and let's
try purple wool maybe a 3x3 and

896
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
try purple wool maybe a 3x3 and
 

897
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,750
try purple wool maybe a 3x3 and
see how that goes

898
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760

 

899
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:13,350

very nice um

900
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360

 

901
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,070

yeah that's that's good uh it'll be

902
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
yeah that's that's good uh it'll be
 

903
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,430
yeah that's that's good uh it'll be
brighter in here because these will be

904
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
brighter in here because these will be
 

905
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,830
brighter in here because these will be
on

906
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840

 

907
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,870

right

908
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
right
 

909
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,710
right
let's do this over here

910
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720

 

911
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:36,149

sandstone sides with purple middle and

912
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
sandstone sides with purple middle and
 

913
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,950
sandstone sides with purple middle and
we're going to go

914
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
we're going to go
 

915
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,510
we're going to go
over this later and fine-tune some

916
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
over this later and fine-tune some
 

917
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,230
over this later and fine-tune some
details probably

918
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240

 

919
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:59,029

let's see how this goes it's all purple

920
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039

 

921
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,789

all right and then we'll probably do the

922
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
all right and then we'll probably do the
 

923
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,830
all right and then we'll probably do the
same on ceiling

924
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840
same on ceiling
 

925
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,590
same on ceiling
um

926
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600

 

927
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:16,710

what if we do this

928
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720

 

929
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,070

yeah this is looking good i'm happy

930
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,080
yeah this is looking good i'm happy
 

931
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,590
yeah this is looking good i'm happy
very happy

932
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600

 

933
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,390

purple

934
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400

 

935
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,070

and yeah we may change it to a different

936
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
and yeah we may change it to a different
 

937
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,669
and yeah we may change it to a different
color but for now i think purple's

938
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:35,679
color but for now i think purple's
 

939
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,510
color but for now i think purple's
what we'll just use

940
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520

 

941
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,830

i actually really like the purple

942
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840

 

943
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,750

that's okay now somehow we have to

944
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
that's okay now somehow we have to
 

945
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,710
that's okay now somehow we have to
connect this parts

946
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
connect this parts
 

947
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,870
connect this parts
um let's do this here too

948
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
um let's do this here too
 

949
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,789
um let's do this here too
the stairs

950
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799

 

951
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:07,990

yeah i like that more very cool

952
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000

 

953
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,549

all right um

954
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559

 

955
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,830

let's go up

956
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840

 

957
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,750

that go up

958
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760

 

959
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:30,070

and let's just see what this looks like

960
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080

 

961
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,750

yeah that's pretty cool i like it

962
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
yeah that's pretty cool i like it
 

963
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,870
yeah that's pretty cool i like it
um i'm gonna go through here

964
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
um i'm gonna go through here
 

965
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,789
um i'm gonna go through here
with a little bit of finer detail while

966
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
with a little bit of finer detail while
 

967
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,470
with a little bit of finer detail while
not recording and

968
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
not recording and
 

969
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,470
not recording and
maybe change a few things and also i'm

970
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
maybe change a few things and also i'm
 

971
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,909
maybe change a few things and also i'm
going to hook up the redstone

972
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
going to hook up the redstone
 

973
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,110
going to hook up the redstone
wiring for both of the panels and then

974
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
wiring for both of the panels and then
 

975
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,909
wiring for both of the panels and then
we got to link them together

976
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
we got to link them together
 

977
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,990
we got to link them together
basically we just have to attach this

978
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
basically we just have to attach this
 

979
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,710
basically we just have to attach this
wire on both of them together

980
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
wire on both of them together
 

981
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,510
wire on both of them together
in a way that they won't create an

982
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
in a way that they won't create an
 

983
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,590
in a way that they won't create an
infinite loop where

984
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,600
infinite loop where
 

985
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,830
infinite loop where
or clock or something down like that so

986
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
or clock or something down like that so
 

987
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,830
or clock or something down like that so
we'll have to be careful

988
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840

 

989
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,990

oh yeah check it out it's all done

990
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
oh yeah check it out it's all done
 

991
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,510
oh yeah check it out it's all done
it's all wired

992
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520

 

993
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,230

got it all in here and i even found a

994
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
got it all in here and i even found a
 

995
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,269
got it all in here and i even found a
very easy way

996
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
very easy way
 

997
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,590
very easy way
of hooking them together i i didn't

998
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
of hooking them together i i didn't
 

999
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,190
of hooking them together i i didn't
think they would be

1000
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
think they would be
 

1001
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,830
think they would be
within 15 bucks but they are so we just

1002
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
within 15 bucks but they are so we just
 

1003
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,950
within 15 bucks but they are so we just
need to run a wire

1004
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
need to run a wire
 

1005
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,870
need to run a wire
from one side to the other so

1006
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
from one side to the other so
 

1007
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,789
from one side to the other so
let's count it one two three

1008
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
let's count it one two three
 

1009
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,830
let's count it one two three
four five six seven eight

1010
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
four five six seven eight
 

1011
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,950
four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven 12 13

1012
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
nine ten eleven 12 13
 

1013
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,909
nine ten eleven 12 13
14. i sound that right one two three

1014
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
14. i sound that right one two three
 

1015
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,630
14. i sound that right one two three
four

1016
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
four
 

1017
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,909
four
wait 1 2 3 4

1018
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
wait 1 2 3 4
 

1019
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,669
wait 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

1020
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
 

1021
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,430
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 15. so it just

1022
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
13 14 15 15. so it just
 

1023
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,190
13 14 15 15. so it just
barely reaches and we can do this

1024
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
barely reaches and we can do this
 

1025
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,110
barely reaches and we can do this
because these are stairs so we can run a

1026
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
because these are stairs so we can run a
 

1027
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,669
because these are stairs so we can run a
wire

1028
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
wire
 

1029
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,950
wire
through it like that which is very good

1030
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
through it like that which is very good
 

1031
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,950
through it like that which is very good
so let's fire it up

1032
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
so let's fire it up
 

1033
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,870
so let's fire it up
when we press one button all the lights

1034
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
when we press one button all the lights
 

1035
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,990
when we press one button all the lights
should come on

1036
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
should come on
 

1037
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,669
should come on
except for one

1038
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679

 

1039
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,230

very cool so that's our selector panel

1040
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
very cool so that's our selector panel
 

1041
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,789
very cool so that's our selector panel
so if we push this one

1042
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
so if we push this one
 

1043
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,149
so if we push this one
the lights all turn on on that side even

1044
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159

 

1045
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,389

it's much brighter in here with that lit

1046
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:26,399
it's much brighter in here with that lit
 

1047
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,710
it's much brighter in here with that lit
up

1048
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720

 

1049
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,789

um so this is how i did the corners this

1050
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
um so this is how i did the corners this
 

1051
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,470
um so this is how i did the corners this
one seems to be having a lighting glitch

1052
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
one seems to be having a lighting glitch
 

1053
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,149
one seems to be having a lighting glitch
which i'll have to fix

1054
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
which i'll have to fix
 

1055
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,750
which i'll have to fix
um but yeah i think it's pretty good

1056
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760

 

1057
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,470

so i'm not sure if i should continue

1058
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
so i'm not sure if i should continue
 

1059
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,870
so i'm not sure if i should continue
this

1060
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
this
 

1061
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,710
this
theme through the tunnel or if we should

1062
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
theme through the tunnel or if we should
 

1063
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,190
theme through the tunnel or if we should
transition to something else

1064
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
transition to something else
 

1065
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,269
transition to something else
um i'm

1066
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279

 

1067
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,470

yeah i'm not really sure excuse me

1068
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,480
yeah i'm not really sure excuse me
 

1069
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,669
yeah i'm not really sure excuse me
what i'm going to do with the tunnel

1070
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
what i'm going to do with the tunnel
 

1071
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,710
what i'm going to do with the tunnel
itself if we do sandstone and purple we

1072
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
itself if we do sandstone and purple we
 

1073
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,389
itself if we do sandstone and purple we
need to line it so it's going to be a

1074
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
need to line it so it's going to be a
 

1075
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,710
need to line it so it's going to be a
lot of extra work

1076
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
lot of extra work
 

1077
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,470
lot of extra work
because instead of like a five by five

1078
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
because instead of like a five by five
 

1079
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,389
because instead of like a five by five
thing we gotta make a five by five plus

1080
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
thing we gotta make a five by five plus
 

1081
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,990
thing we gotta make a five by five plus
a seven by seven

1082
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,000
a seven by seven
 

1083
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,350
a seven by seven
it's a lot of blocks to do tunnels that

1084
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,360
it's a lot of blocks to do tunnels that
 

1085
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,150
it's a lot of blocks to do tunnels that
way

1086
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,160

very cool okay oh yeah so

1090
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240

 

1091
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,710

then as we figure out our destinations

1092
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:22,720
then as we figure out our destinations
 

1093
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,669
then as we figure out our destinations
and wire them

1094
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
and wire them
 

1095
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,310
and wire them
up we will have these signs which we'll

1096
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
up we will have these signs which we'll
 

1097
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,190
up we will have these signs which we'll
write the names on

1098
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,200
write the names on
 

1099
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,270
write the names on
i think we'll put them here

1100
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:32,280

1103
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,389

and then also this is how i'm going to

1104
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
and then also this is how i'm going to
 

1105
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,870
and then also this is how i'm going to
do the minecart stuff so

1106
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:40,880
do the minecart stuff so
 

1107
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,789
do the minecart stuff so
this is the center right here um

1108
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
this is the center right here um
 

1109
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,110
this is the center right here um
so i want a power rail here

1110
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120

 

1111
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,830

and then another one there

1112
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840

 

1113
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,029

and the track will go this way

1114
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:57,039
and the track will go this way
 

1115
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,549
and the track will go this way
like that minecart will sit there so

1116
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
like that minecart will sit there so
 

1117
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,789
like that minecart will sit there so
this is what's going to look like just

1118
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
this is what's going to look like just
 

1119
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,750
this is what's going to look like just
like this we hop in the mine carts

1120
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
like this we hop in the mine carts
 

1121
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,470
like this we hop in the mine carts
select our destination when we hit the

1122
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
select our destination when we hit the
 

1123
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,950
select our destination when we hit the

1124
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
button
 

1125
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,870
button
it will send power to the power rail

1126
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
it will send power to the power rail
 

1127
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,070
it will send power to the power rail
below and also

1128
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080

 

1129
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,350

oh okay i gotta move that to

1130
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
oh okay i gotta move that to
 

1131
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,630
oh okay i gotta move that to
the other side

1132
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640

 

1133
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,070

that shouldn't be a problem see i went

1134
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
that shouldn't be a problem see i went
 

1135
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,750
that shouldn't be a problem see i went
this way i can go this way though no

1136
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
this way i can go this way though no
 

1137
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,710
this way i can go this way though no

uh but below here

1140
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
uh but below here
 

1141
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:40,950
uh but below here
we're gonna have a piston that comes up

1142
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
we're gonna have a piston that comes up
 

1143
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,310
we're gonna have a piston that comes up
i don't have any pistons no

1144
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
i don't have any pistons no
 

1145
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,230
i don't have any pistons no
dang all right

1146
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
dang all right
 

1147
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,029
dang all right
let's see where did i put them there we

1148
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:51,039
let's see where did i put them there we
 

1149
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,590
let's see where did i put them there we
go

1150
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600

 

1151
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,510

and because we need a block behind the

1152
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
and because we need a block behind the
 

1153
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,110
and because we need a block behind the
minecart for it to launch

1154
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,120
minecart for it to launch
 

1155
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,269
minecart for it to launch
so that's what this is all about

1156
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279

 

1157
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,510

all right so when we push a button power

1158
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
all right so when we push a button power
 

1159
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,389
all right so when we push a button power
rail will

1160
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
rail will
 

1161
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,029
rail will
power and also that block will come up

1162
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:07,039
power and also that block will come up
 

1163
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,950
power and also that block will come up
so it'll send the minecart off with us

1164
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:08,960
so it'll send the minecart off with us
 

1165
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,230
so it'll send the minecart off with us
in it

1166
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
in it
 

1167
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,789
in it
and then on the return we gotta make the

1168
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
and then on the return we gotta make the
 

1169
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,750
and then on the return we gotta make the
minecart to go

1170
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
minecart to go
 

1171
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,950
minecart to go
over a detector rail

1172
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960
over a detector rail
 

1173
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,269
over a detector rail
which will make the piston come up to

1174
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:19,279
which will make the piston come up to
 

1175
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,630
which will make the piston come up to
stop it

1176
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
stop it
 

1177
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,549
stop it
and then it'll go down after a few

1178
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
and then it'll go down after a few
 

1179
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,430
and then it'll go down after a few
seconds or whatever

1180
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
seconds or whatever
 

1181
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,149
seconds or whatever
but it won't light up this power rail so

1182
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:28,159
but it won't light up this power rail so
 

1183
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,470
but it won't light up this power rail so
if it does it'll just send it back again

1184
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
if it does it'll just send it back again
 

1185
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,630
if it does it'll just send it back again
so we want it to stop and that's what

1186
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
so we want it to stop and that's what
 

1187
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,149
so we want it to stop and that's what
i'm planning

1188
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:34,159
i'm planning
 

1189
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,590
i'm planning
and then with these selector panels

1190
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
and then with these selector panels
 

1191
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,950
and then with these selector panels
we're going to hook them up to track

1192
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
we're going to hook them up to track
 

1193
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,230
we're going to hook them up to track
junctions

1194
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
junctions
 

1195
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,269
junctions
and that's how we will control

1196
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
and that's how we will control
 

1197
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,310
and that's how we will control
where the minecart goes

1198
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
where the minecart goes
 

1199
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,029
where the minecart goes
and that is that

1200
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
