719
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,750
three weeks I got to do something for it
and I started working on a few ideas and

720
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:08,760
and I started working on a few ideas and
 

721
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,120
and I started working on a few ideas and
after a few hours of those either either

722
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,130
after a few hours of those either either
 

723
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,310
after a few hours of those either either
the the idea wasn't very good and I

724
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,320
the the idea wasn't very good and I
 

725
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,840
the the idea wasn't very good and I
realized it's not going to turn out in

726
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:18,850
realized it's not going to turn out in
 

727
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,990
realized it's not going to turn out in
the end or it was gonna take too long to

728
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
the end or it was gonna take too long to
 

729
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,620
the end or it was gonna take too long to
do so I sort of just abandoned those and

730
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:25,630
do so I sort of just abandoned those and
 

731
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,799
do so I sort of just abandoned those and
in scope instead I decided I should

732
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:31,809
in scope instead I decided I should
 

733
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,909
in scope instead I decided I should
focus more on maybe beneficial things

734
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:34,919
focus more on maybe beneficial things
 

735
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,190
focus more on maybe beneficial things
instead of like some fancy show for the

736
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,200
instead of like some fancy show for the
 

737
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,039
instead of like some fancy show for the
special so of course we did the

738
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,049
special so of course we did the
 

739
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,690
special so of course we did the
mindcrack ending there with the two

740
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:45,700
mindcrack ending there with the two
 

741
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,190
mindcrack ending there with the two
parts clip show big thing I thought that

742
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,200
parts clip show big thing I thought that
 

743
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,210
parts clip show big thing I thought that
turned out pretty good

744
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:51,220
turned out pretty good
 

745
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,150
turned out pretty good
that was a lot of work to do I had to go

746
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
that was a lot of work to do I had to go
 

747
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,820
that was a lot of work to do I had to go
through like a hundred episodes or

748
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:56,830
through like a hundred episodes or
 

749
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,430
through like a hundred episodes or
something crazy that took a bit of time

750
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
something crazy that took a bit of time
 

751
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,970
something crazy that took a bit of time
I gotta say but all in all it turned out

752
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:02,980
I gotta say but all in all it turned out
 

753
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,400
I gotta say but all in all it turned out
pretty good I was happy with that and

754
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,410
pretty good I was happy with that and
 

755
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:13,140
pretty good I was happy with that and
then another idea I had is

756
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,150

 

757
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:21,780

maybe maybe something something

758
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:21,790
maybe maybe something something
 

759
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,910
maybe maybe something something
beneficial that should focus on is

760
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:23,920
beneficial that should focus on is
 

761
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,100
beneficial that should focus on is

the only one let's see if put clips

800
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,320

801
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,090
the only one let's see if put clips
together and that's about it so I think

802
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,100
together and that's about it so I think
 

803
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,370
together and that's about it so I think
I think that would be a good goal a good

804
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:32,380
I think that would be a good goal a good
 

805
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,250
I think that would be a good goal a good
good good place to put my efforts into

806
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,260
good good place to put my efforts into
 

807
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,980
good good place to put my efforts into
getting better at video editing because

808
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:37,990
getting better at video editing because
 

809
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,050
getting better at video editing because
I don't want to make any drastic changes

810
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,060
I don't want to make any drastic changes
 

811
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,380
I don't want to make any drastic changes
to my channel and my like the way I

812
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,390
to my channel and my like the way I
 

813
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,750
to my channel and my like the way I
present my videos too much but I think a

814
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
present my videos too much but I think a
 

815
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,600
present my videos too much but I think a
little bit of video editing would go a

816
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:48,610
little bit of video editing would go a
 

817
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,740
little bit of video editing would go a
long ways and people would appreciate it

818
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:51,750
long ways and people would appreciate it
 

819
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,850
long ways and people would appreciate it
so I want to look into that for sure

820
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:55,860
so I want to look into that for sure
 

821
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,930
so I want to look into that for sure
lots of people no surprise requested I

822
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:00,940
lots of people no surprise requested I
 

823
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,300
lots of people no surprise requested I
do a face cam for my 1 million

824
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,310
do a face cam for my 1 million
 

825
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,430
do a face cam for my 1 million
subscriber special and I I tell you I

826
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
subscriber special and I I tell you I
 

827
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,110
subscriber special and I I tell you I
put a lot of thought into that I was

828
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
put a lot of thought into that I was
 

829
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,650
put a lot of thought into that I was
considering it but I think the

830
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:10,660
considering it but I think the
 

831
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,730
considering it but I think the
conclusion I have is I don't want to do

832
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:14,740
conclusion I have is I don't want to do
 

833
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,680
conclusion I have is I don't want to do
it just to satisfy people's curiosity I

834
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:18,690
it just to satisfy people's curiosity I
 

835
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,030
it just to satisfy people's curiosity I
think if I do it there needs to be a

836
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,040
think if I do it there needs to be a
 

837
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,870
think if I do it there needs to be a
real point to it

838
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
real point to it
 

839
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,010
real point to it
so my plant with that by the way is like

840
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,020

 

841
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,900

I'm not really set up to do that at the

842
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:32,910
I'm not really set up to do that at the
 

843
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,750
I'm not really set up to do that at the
moment like I don't have a webcam I

844
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
moment like I don't have a webcam I
 

845
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,530
moment like I don't have a webcam I
don't have a green screen I don't have a

846
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:39,540
don't have a green screen I don't have a
 

847
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,910
don't have a green screen I don't have a
non cluttered place where I could record

848
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:43,920
non cluttered place where I could record
 

849
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,710
non cluttered place where I could record
I don't have what else do I need

850
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
I don't have what else do I need
 

851
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,770
I don't have what else do I need
I need like this episode for example

852
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:51,780
I need like this episode for example
 

853
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,510
I need like this episode for example
this is what I'm talking about there

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
this is what I'm talking about there
 

855
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,430
this is what I'm talking about there
would have been some benefit to having a

856
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
would have been some benefit to having a
 

857
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,290
would have been some benefit to having a
face cam in this because this is a this

858
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:57,300
face cam in this because this is a this
 

859
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,260

is a more personal episode I feel and I
 

861
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,380
is a more personal episode I feel and I
wouldn't have minded having like me

862
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,390
wouldn't have minded having like me
 

863
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,510
wouldn't have minded having like me
talking in the corner of the screen

864
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520

869
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,320
about the game in this episode so
there's definitely times where it would

870
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,330
there's definitely times where it would
 

871
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,600
there's definitely times where it would
be beneficial like this episode the

be beneficial like this episode the
 

873
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,580
be beneficial like this episode the
other thing though is like I said I'm

874
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:19,590
other thing though is like I said I'm
 

875
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,620
other thing though is like I said I'm
using virtualdub and I can't overlay

876
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:21,630
using virtualdub and I can't overlay
 

877
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,570
using virtualdub and I can't overlay
video using that that editor so I got to

878
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,580
video using that that editor so I got to
 

879
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,300
video using that that editor so I got to
work on stuff is what I'm getting to it

880
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,310
work on stuff is what I'm getting to it
 

881
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,570
work on stuff is what I'm getting to it
and I'm hoping to move in a few months

882
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:32,580
and I'm hoping to move in a few months
 

883
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,200
and I'm hoping to move in a few months
here I got to get into house hunting and

884
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,210
here I got to get into house hunting and
 

885
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,150
here I got to get into house hunting and
find them find a house to move to fine

886
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:41,160
find them find a house to move to fine
 

887
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,100
find them find a house to move to fine
I'm finding it hard to get time to do

888
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,110
I'm finding it hard to get time to do
 

889
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,590
I'm finding it hard to get time to do
that though because making videos takes

890
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
that though because making videos takes
 

891
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,030
that though because making videos takes
a lot of time and finding a house takes

892
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,040
a lot of time and finding a house takes
 

893
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,110
a lot of time and finding a house takes
a lot of time too

894
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
a lot of time too
 

895
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,350
a lot of time too
so that's when one of the things I got

896
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,360
so that's when one of the things I got
 

897
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,300
so that's when one of the things I got
to do and when I when I finally get a

898
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,310
to do and when I when I finally get a
 

899
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,170
to do and when I when I finally get a
house I'm gonna set up a proper office

900
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,180
house I'm gonna set up a proper office
 

901
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,990
house I'm gonna set up a proper office
place proper office office space with

902
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
place proper office office space with
 

903
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,980
place proper office office space with
all that stuff with a green screen with

904
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:08,990
all that stuff with a green screen with
 

905
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,690
all that stuff with a green screen with
webcam all that kind of stuff and and

906
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:11,700
webcam all that kind of stuff and and
 

907
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,580
webcam all that kind of stuff and and
then maybe get into doing face cam

908
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:16,590
then maybe get into doing face cam
 

909
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,980
then maybe get into doing face cam
episodes or even streaming with the face

910
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:18,990
episodes or even streaming with the face
 

911
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,200
episodes or even streaming with the face
cam or or using it when it makes sense I

912
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,210
cam or or using it when it makes sense I
 

913
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,610
cam or or using it when it makes sense I
think that would be good because there's

914
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:25,620
think that would be good because there's
 

915
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,440
think that would be good because there's
there's definitely some niceness to it

916
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,450
there's definitely some niceness to it
 

917
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,790
there's definitely some niceness to it
but until then I don't really see the

918
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:31,800
but until then I don't really see the
 

919
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,310
but until then I don't really see the
point is this isn't a V log Channel

920
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,320
point is this isn't a V log Channel
 

921
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,649
point is this isn't a V log Channel
it's about the game more than anything

922
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:37,659
it's about the game more than anything
 

923
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,720
it's about the game more than anything
it's not like I'm I'm recording in real

924
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:39,730
it's not like I'm I'm recording in real
 

925
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,850
it's not like I'm I'm recording in real
life videos here and choosing not to

926
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:41,860
life videos here and choosing not to
 

927
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,779
life videos here and choosing not to
show my face

928
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:42,789
show my face
 

929
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:46,740
show my face
it's just I'm recording my desktop and

930
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:46,750
it's just I'm recording my desktop and
 

931
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,899
it's just I'm recording my desktop and
I'm not really set up for it and yeah

932
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:50,909
I'm not really set up for it and yeah
 

933
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:54,840
I'm not really set up for it and yeah
it's it's not really it doesn't really

934
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:54,850
it's it's not really it doesn't really
 

935
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,930
it's it's not really it doesn't really
make sense at the moment to do it I feel

936
00:24:59,930 --> 00:24:59,940

 

937
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,220

but anyway that's kind of the plan

938
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,230
but anyway that's kind of the plan
 

939
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,350
but anyway that's kind of the plan
something else I thought of for the

940
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:04,360
something else I thought of for the
 

941
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,299
something else I thought of for the
special I don't know if we'll do this or

942
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:06,309
special I don't know if we'll do this or
 

943
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:09,110
special I don't know if we'll do this or
not but a lot of people have requested I

944
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
not but a lot of people have requested I
 

945
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,590
not but a lot of people have requested I
