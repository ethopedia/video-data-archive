00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,459
there before when I made this it would
only go within a 3x3 area around here

162
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:25,469
only go within a 3x3 area around here
 

163
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:27,230
only go within a 3x3 area around here
which was really important to the

164
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,240
which was really important to the
 

165
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,150
which was really important to the
design and now it just flies all over

166
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160
design and now it just flies all over
 

167
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,320
design and now it just flies all over
the place and when I hit the item

168
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,330
the place and when I hit the item
 

169
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,350
the place and when I hit the item
collection water here let's see if it'll

170
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
collection water here let's see if it'll
 

171
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,920
collection water here let's see if it'll
happen water comes down just long enough

172
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:42,930
happen water comes down just long enough
 

173
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,779
happen water comes down just long enough
where it should wash all the wool down

174
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:44,789
where it should wash all the wool down
 

175
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,460
where it should wash all the wool down
the grates without drowning the sheep

176
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,470
the grates without drowning the sheep
 

177
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,779
the grates without drowning the sheep
which for the most part does happen

178
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:50,789
which for the most part does happen
 

179
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,990
which for the most part does happen
exactly except now I don't know why this

180
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
exactly except now I don't know why this
 

181
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,300
exactly except now I don't know why this
happens I guess it's because it's jumps

182
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,310
happens I guess it's because it's jumps
 

183
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,850
happens I guess it's because it's jumps
out of the 3x3 area it it goes down here

184
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:58,860
out of the 3x3 area it it goes down here
 

185
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,589
out of the 3x3 area it it goes down here
and and wool can end up in the middle

186
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:03,599
and and wool can end up in the middle
 

187
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:09,700
and and wool can end up in the middle
now which isn't good so I almost wonder

188
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:09,710

 

189
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,170

probably all I need to do is just have

190
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,180
probably all I need to do is just have
 

191
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,320
probably all I need to do is just have
like some slabs maybe not running down

192
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,330
like some slabs maybe not running down
 

193
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,770
like some slabs maybe not running down
now try to figure out how to fix it okay

194
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:24,780
now try to figure out how to fix it okay
 

195
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,300
now try to figure out how to fix it okay
the water comes down here let's just see

196
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,310
the water comes down here let's just see
 

197
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,559
the water comes down here let's just see
what happens don't kill the Sheep data

198
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:30,569
what happens don't kill the Sheep data
 

199
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,360
what happens don't kill the Sheep data
if I do that yeah you see that it's

200
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,370
if I do that yeah you see that it's
 

201
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,760
if I do that yeah you see that it's
pushing the wool then I think but oops I

202
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:36,770
pushing the wool then I think but oops I
 

203
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,560
pushing the wool then I think but oops I
bet if wool was here when it would still

204
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:39,570
bet if wool was here when it would still
 

205
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,560
bet if wool was here when it would still
get stuck

206
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,570
get stuck
 

207
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,939
get stuck
yeah just pushes it right against there

208
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:43,949
yeah just pushes it right against there
 

209
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,459
yeah just pushes it right against there
so hmm another thing I could do kind of

210
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:49,469
so hmm another thing I could do kind of
 

211
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,219
so hmm another thing I could do kind of
wreck the whole concept of the farm is

212
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:52,229
wreck the whole concept of the farm is
 

213
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,870
wreck the whole concept of the farm is
replace all these Pistons here with

214
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:53,880
replace all these Pistons here with
 

215
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,670
replace all these Pistons here with
hoppers and then when I shear the sheep

216
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
hoppers and then when I shear the sheep
 

217
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
hoppers and then when I shear the sheep
that would just instantly collect I

218
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,210
that would just instantly collect I
 

219
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,649
that would just instantly collect I
think there's another idea but then the

220
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:00,659
think there's another idea but then the
 

221
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,820
think there's another idea but then the
whole water water collection system down

222
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:04,830
whole water water collection system down
 

223
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,200
whole water water collection system down
there and all that's kind of pointless

224
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,210
there and all that's kind of pointless
 

225
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,300
there and all that's kind of pointless
if I do that whoo and also this is kind

226
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,310
if I do that whoo and also this is kind
 

227
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,629
if I do that whoo and also this is kind
of messy here too I might mess around

228
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
of messy here too I might mess around
 

229
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,980
of messy here too I might mess around
with this and see if I can come up with

230
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:15,990
with this and see if I can come up with
 

231
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:22,309
with this and see if I can come up with
a solution okay you know that might work

232
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
a solution okay you know that might work
 

233
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,129
a solution okay you know that might work
actually so I I did put the slabs I used

234
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:25,139
actually so I I did put the slabs I used
 

235
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,770
actually so I I did put the slabs I used
stone brick slabs to divide each of the

236
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:27,780
stone brick slabs to divide each of the
 

237
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,709
stone brick slabs to divide each of the
colors so I think like the water comes

238
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:30,719
colors so I think like the water comes
 

239
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:36,769
colors so I think like the water comes
down here so it should flow yeah it

240
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:36,779
down here so it should flow yeah it
 

241
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,850
down here so it should flow yeah it
should flow that way I think

242
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:38,860
should flow that way I think
 

243
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,580
should flow that way I think
I'm not sure I like the look of it as

244
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:41,590
I'm not sure I like the look of it as
 

245
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,990
I'm not sure I like the look of it as
much it's kind of cool like when you're

246
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,000
much it's kind of cool like when you're
 

247
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,270
much it's kind of cool like when you're
here and you're looking like this that

248
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
here and you're looking like this that
 

249
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,619
here and you're looking like this that
the dividers between the colors but when

250
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:49,629
the dividers between the colors but when
 

251
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,809
the dividers between the colors but when
you're off way at the end here which is

252
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:51,819
you're off way at the end here which is
 

253
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,330
you're off way at the end here which is
where I usually view it from it sort of

254
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,340
where I usually view it from it sort of
 

255
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,830
where I usually view it from it sort of
blocks the view of the Sheep

256
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
blocks the view of the Sheep
 

257
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,920
blocks the view of the Sheep
pop-up sheep farm woo especially the

258
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:58,930
pop-up sheep farm woo especially the
 

259
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,020
pop-up sheep farm woo especially the
ones in the back like you don't get that

260
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,030
ones in the back like you don't get that
 

261
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,839
ones in the back like you don't get that
nice rainbow look going down like we did

262
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:03,849
nice rainbow look going down like we did
 

263
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,559
nice rainbow look going down like we did
before but it might make it work so that

264
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:07,569
before but it might make it work so that
 

265
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,950
before but it might make it work so that
that will probably be what we have to do

266
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
that will probably be what we have to do
 

267
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,779
that will probably be what we have to do
if it does so let's try it out

268
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:14,789
if it does so let's try it out
 

269
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,779
if it does so let's try it out
it's better it's working then and like

270
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:18,789
it's better it's working then and like
 

271
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,480
it's better it's working then and like
ugly then then not working and looking

272
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,490
ugly then then not working and looking
 

273
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,170
ugly then then not working and looking
great I guess I think it's the lesser of

274
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:25,180
great I guess I think it's the lesser of
 

275
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,820
great I guess I think it's the lesser of
the two evils it's looking like yeah the

276
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:26,830
the two evils it's looking like yeah the
 

277
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,499
the two evils it's looking like yeah the
wool isn't hopping over this divider

278
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:28,509
wool isn't hopping over this divider
 

279
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,249
wool isn't hopping over this divider
which is good as worried about that some

280
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:32,259
which is good as worried about that some
 

281
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,149
which is good as worried about that some
of it might still land like in this path

282
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:35,159
of it might still land like in this path
 

283
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,850
of it might still land like in this path
which would be bad so let's try just

284
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:38,860
which would be bad so let's try just
 

285
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,969
which would be bad so let's try just
that half first and see what happens so

286
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:40,979
that half first and see what happens so
 

287
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,469
that half first and see what happens so
since they're all sheared all the peeps

288
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:43,479
since they're all sheared all the peeps
 

289
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,839
since they're all sheared all the peeps
go down

290
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:44,849
go down
 

291
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,969
go down
did I say people all the peeps go down

292
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:47,979
did I say people all the peeps go down
 

293
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,089
did I say people all the peeps go down
all the sheep should go down when I hit

294
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:51,099
all the sheep should go down when I hit
 

295
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:54,209
all the sheep should go down when I hit
the water button is the goal here we'll

296
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:54,219
the water button is the goal here we'll
 

297
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:58,499
the water button is the goal here we'll
go inside just to watch it so when the

298
00:07:58,499 --> 00:07:58,509
go inside just to watch it so when the
 

299
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,209
go inside just to watch it so when the
wool falls down there it makes the Sheep

300
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:00,219
wool falls down there it makes the Sheep
 

301
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:13,369
wool falls down there it makes the Sheep
go down no I'm not getting them all oh

302
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:13,379

 

303
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,140

and some of its not going down that was

304
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,150
and some of its not going down that was
 

305
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,950
and some of its not going down that was
weird so there's two pressure plates

306
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:19,960
weird so there's two pressure plates
 

307
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,649
weird so there's two pressure plates
there's two wood pressure plates I think

308
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:21,659
there's two wood pressure plates I think
 

309
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,240
there's two wood pressure plates I think
like if the wool from this side jumps

310
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,250
like if the wool from this side jumps
 

311
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,920
like if the wool from this side jumps
over to this side it's only going to

312
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:25,930
over to this side it's only going to
 

313
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,719
over to this side it's only going to
land on that pressure plate which will

314
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:27,729
land on that pressure plate which will
 

315
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,329
land on that pressure plate which will
only make that sheep go down and not

316
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:30,339
only make that sheep go down and not
 

317
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,089
only make that sheep go down and not
just the other one I think that's what

318
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:33,099
just the other one I think that's what
 

319
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,939
just the other one I think that's what
happened there

320
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:36,949

 

321
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:43,009

huh interesting but it did collect it a

322
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:43,019
huh interesting but it did collect it a
 

323
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,170
huh interesting but it did collect it a
lot better which is what I also want and

324
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,180
lot better which is what I also want and
 

325
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,680
lot better which is what I also want and
there's I could just do a manual reset

326
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:47,690
there's I could just do a manual reset
 

327
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,379
there's I could just do a manual reset
if I want so yeah I think that'll be

328
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:51,389
if I want so yeah I think that'll be
 

329
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:53,870
if I want so yeah I think that'll be
okay what do you guys think of that is

330
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:53,880
okay what do you guys think of that is
 

331
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,720
okay what do you guys think of that is
it look okay or did you identify and

332
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:56,730
it look okay or did you identify and
 

333
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,990
it look okay or did you identify and
just not working which is the lesser of

334
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
just not working which is the lesser of
 

335
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,170
just not working which is the lesser of
the two evils I guess is the question

336
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:05,180

 

337
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,720

okay let's go again here you know what

338
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:08,730
okay let's go again here you know what
 

339
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,509
okay let's go again here you know what
guys since we got the collection system

340
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
guys since we got the collection system
 

341
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,509
guys since we got the collection system
for this working properly now for the

342
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:14,519
for this working properly now for the
 

343
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,129
for this working properly now for the
most part the main thing is that it

344
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:16,139
most part the main thing is that it
 

345
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,920
most part the main thing is that it
actually gets the wool I don't mind

346
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:18,930
actually gets the wool I don't mind
 

347
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,620
actually gets the wool I don't mind
doing this afterwards oh that guy just

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,630
doing this afterwards oh that guy just
 

349
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,210
doing this afterwards oh that guy just
came up and he's like nope going back

350
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,220
came up and he's like nope going back
 

351
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,470
came up and he's like nope going back
down rejected grow better wool next time

352
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,480
down rejected grow better wool next time
 

353
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,499
down rejected grow better wool next time
um like this does work I think all the

354
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:30,509
um like this does work I think all the
 

355
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,850
um like this does work I think all the
wool got collected I think yeah I don't

see any around on the ground so that's

358
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
see any around on the ground so that's
 

359
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,550
see any around on the ground so that's
good so I just have to run through shear

360
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
good so I just have to run through shear
 

361
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,819

then honestly to to go through each of
 

387
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,139
then honestly to to go through each of
these chests and put the proper type of

00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,790
these chests and put the proper type of
wool in each of the chests when you only

390

wool in each of the chests when you only
 

391
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,189
wool in each of the chests when you only
have like five or less of each of the

just I just drop and also plate wood I

396
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:29,790
just I just drop and also plate wood I
 

397
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,999
just I just drop and also plate wood I
just drop it off in one of the chests

398
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:32,009
just drop it off in one of the chests
 

399
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,040
just drop it off in one of the chests
usually and don't horse around with it

400
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,050
usually and don't horse around with it
 

401
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,689
usually and don't horse around with it
and it's a real pain because you can

402
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:35,699
and it's a real pain because you can
 

403
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,670
and it's a real pain because you can
only pick up a couple at a time usually

404
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
only pick up a couple at a time usually
 

405

only pick up a couple at a time usually
if your inventories full I was lucky

406
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:39,389
if your inventories full I was lucky
 

407
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,559
if your inventories full I was lucky
this time my inventory wasn't full so we

408
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:42,569
this time my inventory wasn't full so we
 

409
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,300
this time my inventory wasn't full so we
are going to put a hopper in down below

410
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,310
are going to put a hopper in down below
 

411
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,210
are going to put a hopper in down below
here and then do an auto collection

412
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,220
here and then do an auto collection
 

413
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,309
here and then do an auto collection
system and also like this was made

414
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:49,319
system and also like this was made
 

415
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:50,300
system and also like this was made
before

416
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,310
before
 

417
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,850
before
trapped chests and that so I had to vary

418
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:52,860
trapped chests and that so I had to vary
 

419
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,200
trapped chests and that so I had to vary
the chests on each of the different

420
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,210
the chests on each of the different
 

421
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,160
the chests on each of the different
heights can have them next to each other

422
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,170
heights can have them next to each other
 

423
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,290
heights can have them next to each other
so we should try and make it look better

424
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:00,300
so we should try and make it look better
 

425
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,200
so we should try and make it look better
too and I'll show you this in case

426
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,210
too and I'll show you this in case
 

427
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,430
too and I'll show you this in case
you're wondering since we're talking

428
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,440
you're wondering since we're talking
 

429
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,600
you're wondering since we're talking
about the sheep farm today this is this

430
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:08,610
about the sheep farm today this is this
 

431
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,980
about the sheep farm today this is this
is what we got underneath so it's a

432
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:12,990
is what we got underneath so it's a
 

433
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,290
is what we got underneath so it's a
two-stage bud system the way it worked

434
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,300
two-stage bud system the way it worked
 

435
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,190
two-stage bud system the way it worked
is when the grass would grow regrow on

436
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
is when the grass would grow regrow on
 

437
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
is when the grass would grow regrow on
the soil block it would activate one of

438
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,450
the soil block it would activate one of
 

439
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,700
the soil block it would activate one of
the buds and then when the sheep would

440
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,710
the buds and then when the sheep would
 

441
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,410
the buds and then when the sheep would
eat the grass it would activate the

442
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:24,420
eat the grass it would activate the
 

443
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,630
eat the grass it would activate the
second one and it would push a grass

444
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
second one and it would push a grass
 

445
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,340
second one and it would push a grass
block up high enough so that grass

446
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,350
block up high enough so that grass
 

447
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,540
block up high enough so that grass
couldn't spread to it anymore um now I'm

448
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:32,550
couldn't spread to it anymore um now I'm
 

449
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,850
couldn't spread to it anymore um now I'm
not exactly sure if it works the way it

450
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:34,860
not exactly sure if it works the way it
 

451
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,350
not exactly sure if it works the way it
used to because I think they adjusted it

452
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
used to because I think they adjusted it
 

453
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,170
used to because I think they adjusted it
where um bud switches don't detect sheep

454
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,180
where um bud switches don't detect sheep
 

455
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,670
where um bud switches don't detect sheep
eating grass or something they might

456
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:46,680
eating grass or something they might
 

457
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,170
eating grass or something they might
have might have reverted that though

458
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,180
have might have reverted that though
 

459
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,170
have might have reverted that though
because it does work somehow still so it

460
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,180
because it does work somehow still so it
 

461
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,630
because it does work somehow still so it
knows I'll I never really looked at it

462
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:53,640
knows I'll I never really looked at it
 

463
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,310
knows I'll I never really looked at it
though why it still works

464
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,320
though why it still works
 

465
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,680
though why it still works
um but yeah let's let's fix up this room

466
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:00,690
um but yeah let's let's fix up this room
 

467
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:07,130
um but yeah let's let's fix up this room
shall we um so maybe one option I like

468

shall we um so maybe one option I like
 

469
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,980
shall we um so maybe one option I like
the idea of labeling the colors for the

470
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:09,990
the idea of labeling the colors for the

frames to be honest can we would it look
 

475
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,240
frames to be honest can we would it look
good if we did like all the colors below

00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:53,549
travel should show up any minute oh here
 

637
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,759
travel should show up any minute oh here
we go here we go that took a lot longer

638
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:55,769
we go here we go that took a lot longer
 

639
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:56,840
we go here we go that took a lot longer
than I was expecting

640
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:56,850
than I was expecting
 

641
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,039
than I was expecting
it's running on ice it should be quick

642
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:00,049
it's running on ice it should be quick
 

643
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,449
it's running on ice it should be quick
but yeah it'll fill up and it'll sort

644
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:02,459
but yeah it'll fill up and it'll sort
 

645
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,909
but yeah it'll fill up and it'll sort
itself and then when there's like sixty

646
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:04,919
itself and then when there's like sixty
 

647
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,500

four of a color I can easily just pick

648
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,510
four of a color I can easily just pick
 

649
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,699
four of a color I can easily just pick
it up out of there and put in the proper

650
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:07,709
it up out of there and put in the proper
 

651
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,670
it up out of there and put in the proper
chests so that should be cool

652
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:12,680

 

653
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,860

it seemed to be missing a fair bit of

654
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:15,870
it seemed to be missing a fair bit of
 

655
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:22,880
it seemed to be missing a fair bit of
the wool five colors only and we shoot

656
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:22,890
the wool five colors only and we shoot
 

657
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,070
the wool five colors only and we shoot
them all what's that about and we

658
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,080
them all what's that about and we
 

659
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,650
them all what's that about and we
dropped a little bit here and ah the

660
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:33,660
dropped a little bit here and ah the
 

661
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,800
dropped a little bit here and ah the
sheep farm it does not want to work so

662
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:36,810
sheep farm it does not want to work so
 

663
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,070
sheep farm it does not want to work so
that must mean the wool got lost

664
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
that must mean the wool got lost
 

665
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,600
that must mean the wool got lost
somewhere down here right one second

666
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:47,610
somewhere down here right one second
 

667
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,750
somewhere down here right one second
I'll see if I can find it I really don't

668
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
I'll see if I can find it I really don't
 

669
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,130
I'll see if I can find it I really don't
know I thought it would be on these

670
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,140
know I thought it would be on these
 

671
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,200
know I thought it would be on these
pressure plates but I'm not picking it

672
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,210
pressure plates but I'm not picking it
 

673
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,310
pressure plates but I'm not picking it
up white was definitely one of the

674
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,320
up white was definitely one of the
 

675
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,110
up white was definitely one of the
colors that didn't get picked up it's

676
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
colors that didn't get picked up it's
 

677
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,840
colors that didn't get picked up it's
nowhere up there

678
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:04,850
nowhere up there
 

679
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,340
nowhere up there
can't find it down here which means it

680
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,350
can't find it down here which means it
 

681
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,050
can't find it down here which means it
must have gotten stuck down there

682
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,060
must have gotten stuck down there
 

683
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:22,280
must have gotten stuck down there
somewhere ah I'm not looking forward to

684
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,290
somewhere ah I'm not looking forward to
 

685
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:31,610
somewhere ah I'm not looking forward to
breaking all this oh man

686
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:31,620

 

687
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,970

I don't have a clue it doesn't exist

688
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:34,980
I don't have a clue it doesn't exist
 

689
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,500
I don't have a clue it doesn't exist
anywhere it's gone ah some of the wall

690
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,510
anywhere it's gone ah some of the wall
 

691
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,090
anywhere it's gone ah some of the wall
did get stuck in these droppers the

692
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,100
did get stuck in these droppers the
 

693
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,080
did get stuck in these droppers the
black did so that's accounted for I

694
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,090
black did so that's accounted for I
 

695
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,580
black did so that's accounted for I
don't think this was all the light gray

696
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:46,590
don't think this was all the light gray
 

697
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,770
don't think this was all the light gray
that dropped anyway this is the way I

698
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:51,780
that dropped anyway this is the way I
 

699
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,640
that dropped anyway this is the way I
did the elevator the item elevator if

700
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:55,650
did the elevator the item elevator if
 

701
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,549
did the elevator the item elevator if
there is an item well from the hopper

702
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,559
there is an item well from the hopper
 

703
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,190
there is an item well from the hopper
here all the wool goes down the stream

704
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,200
here all the wool goes down the stream
 

705
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,100
here all the wool goes down the stream
lands onto this hopper right you throw

706
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,110
lands onto this hopper right you throw
 

707
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,049
lands onto this hopper right you throw
let's throw in all our planks here okay

708
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:12,059
let's throw in all our planks here okay
 

709
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,680
let's throw in all our planks here okay
that turns this comparator on as it

710
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:15,690
that turns this comparator on as it
 

711
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,430
that turns this comparator on as it
funnels in that activates this clock

712
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
funnels in that activates this clock
 

713
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,030
funnels in that activates this clock
thing and that points into all the

714
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,040
thing and that points into all the
 

715
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,190
thing and that points into all the
droppers so it's really simple actually

716
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
droppers so it's really simple actually
 

717
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,919
droppers so it's really simple actually
but it seems to work pretty good as

718
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:29,929
but it seems to work pretty good as
 

719
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,390
but it seems to work pretty good as
actually surprised some got stuck in the

720
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
actually surprised some got stuck in the
 

721
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,950
actually surprised some got stuck in the
droppers because in all my testing here

722
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:33,960
droppers because in all my testing here
 

723
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,650
droppers because in all my testing here
you can see they're all empty so it just

724
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:36,660
you can see they're all empty so it just
 

725
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,750
you can see they're all empty so it just
must it must be because there is a a

726
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:38,760
must it must be because there is a a
 

727
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,240
must it must be because there is a a
single piece that went in or something I

728
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,250
single piece that went in or something I
 

729
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,419
single piece that went in or something I
don't know but the white and the light

730
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:44,429
don't know but the white and the light
 

731
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:51,710
don't know but the white and the light
gray it is gone oops not a clue where it

732
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:51,720
gray it is gone oops not a clue where it
 

733
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,930
gray it is gone oops not a clue where it
went like gray there's and ray where was

734
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:56,940
went like gray there's and ray where was
 

735
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,680
went like gray there's and ray where was
it gray

736
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:57,690
it gray
 

737
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,900
it gray
we missed out on three colors in that

738
00:19:59,900 --> 00:19:59,910
we missed out on three colors in that
 

739
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,320
we missed out on three colors in that
harvest that was I'll have to keep my

740
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,330
harvest that was I'll have to keep my
 

741
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:09,440
harvest that was I'll have to keep my
eye on that alright everybody so one

742
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,450
eye on that alright everybody so one
 

743
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,690
eye on that alright everybody so one
more thing before we end this maybe

744
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:11,700
more thing before we end this maybe
 

745
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,180
more thing before we end this maybe
let's just spend a little time with

746
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,190
let's just spend a little time with
 

747
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,030
let's just spend a little time with
Wilson talking about Wilson maybe do a

748
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,040
Wilson talking about Wilson maybe do a
 

749
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,060
Wilson talking about Wilson maybe do a
thing or two here too so I hooked up a

750
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,070
thing or two here too so I hooked up a
 

751
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,520
thing or two here too so I hooked up a
wire from the cow sensor the player

752
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:22,530
wire from the cow sensor the player
 

753
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,070
wire from the cow sensor the player
sensor so when we're in the area

754
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,080
sensor so when we're in the area
 

755
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,090
sensor so when we're in the area
this wire pulses sort of randomly if

756
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,100
this wire pulses sort of randomly if
 

757
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,160
this wire pulses sort of randomly if
we're over thirty two blocks away from

758
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,170
we're over thirty two blocks away from
 

759
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,400
we're over thirty two blocks away from
the tower down there this stays off all

760
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,410
the tower down there this stays off all
 

761
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,780
the tower down there this stays off all
the time but looking at this at the

762
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:38,790
the time but looking at this at the
 

763
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,169
the time but looking at this at the
speeded pulses I think I'm just going to

764
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:42,179
speeded pulses I think I'm just going to
 

765
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,540
speeded pulses I think I'm just going to
hook this up directly to his happiness

766
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:44,550
hook this up directly to his happiness
 

767
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,320
hook this up directly to his happiness
so

768
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,330
so
 

769
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,749
so
every time it pulses his happiness goes

770
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:47,759
every time it pulses his happiness goes
 

771
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,629
every time it pulses his happiness goes
up by one and he has a range of zero to

772
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:50,639
up by one and he has a range of zero to
 

773
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:54,169
up by one and he has a range of zero to
fifty happiness so it would take 50 of

774
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:54,179
fifty happiness so it would take 50 of
 

775
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,080
fifty happiness so it would take 50 of
these pulses to take them from zero all

776
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,090
these pulses to take them from zero all
 

777
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,229
these pulses to take them from zero all
the way up to full so when we're in the

778
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:00,239
the way up to full so when we're in the
 

779
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,029
the way up to full so when we're in the
area he'll slowly get a little bit

780
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:02,039
area he'll slowly get a little bit
 

781
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,399
area he'll slowly get a little bit
happier over time but you can see it's

782
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:04,409
happier over time but you can see it's
 

783
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,830
happier over time but you can see it's
not very frequent that it goes so I

784
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:06,840
not very frequent that it goes so I
 

785
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,060
not very frequent that it goes so I
think it's a good rate so that'll be one

786
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,070
think it's a good rate so that'll be one
 

787
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,039
think it's a good rate so that'll be one
more way to increases happiness ed yes

788
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,049

 

789
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:19,999

yeah it's pretty slow pretty slow going

790
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:20,009
yeah it's pretty slow pretty slow going
 

791
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:22,580
yeah it's pretty slow pretty slow going
here and also yeah I start talking about

792
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:22,590
here and also yeah I start talking about
 

793
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,289
here and also yeah I start talking about

that thing still but the timing between
 

829
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:27,349
that thing still but the timing between
repeaters is just too long like it's a

830
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:27,359
repeaters is just too long like it's a
 

831
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,340
repeaters is just too long like it's a
tenth of a second apparently and you

832
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,350
tenth of a second apparently and you
 

833
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,159
tenth of a second apparently and you
couldn't really continue the tune

834
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:33,169
couldn't really continue the tune
 

835
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,499
couldn't really continue the tune
throughout because of that delay it's a

836
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:36,509
throughout because of that delay it's a
 

837
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:38,659
throughout because of that delay it's a
little too long and also the range of

838
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:38,669
little too long and also the range of
 

839
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,340
little too long and also the range of
pitch probably the most important thing

840
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,350
pitch probably the most important thing
 

841
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,729

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,869
limited on what you can do with the note
blocks and you can't really stop a tune

846
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:47,879

like partway through or anything like

848
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:49,499
like partway through or anything like
 

849
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,919
like partway through or anything like
that so just a lot of limitations that

850
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:51,929
that so just a lot of limitations that
 

851
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:55,190
that so just a lot of limitations that
won't allow it to happen but it is

852
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
won't allow it to happen but it is
 

853
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,830
won't allow it to happen but it is
possible make tunes that sound or that

854
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
possible make tunes that sound or that
 

855
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,150
possible make tunes that sound or that

convey happiness and
 

857
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,410
convey happiness and
this and that so that's probably what

858
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,420
this and that so that's probably what
 

859
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,360
this and that so that's probably what
we'll do even if it doesn't sound like a

860
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,370
we'll do even if it doesn't sound like a
 

861
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,320
we'll do even if it doesn't sound like a
creature making noise so we can still

862
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,330
creature making noise so we can still
 

863
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,890
creature making noise so we can still
convey emotion with the note blocks

864
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:08,900
