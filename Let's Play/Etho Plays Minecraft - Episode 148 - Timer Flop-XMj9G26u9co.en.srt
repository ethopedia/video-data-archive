hello hello
as everybody doing today you get your

as everybody doing today you get your
 

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,370
as everybody doing today you get your
snacks

8
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:13,380
snacks
 

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,540
snacks
go get your snacks okay

10
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,550
go get your snacks okay
 

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,090
go get your snacks okay
so we're gonna do a follow-up on that

12
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,100
so we're gonna do a follow-up on that
 

13
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,230
so we're gonna do a follow-up on that
timer today got it installed I think it

14
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
timer today got it installed I think it
 

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,769
timer today got it installed I think it
is working now so I'll give you a quick

16
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:27,779
is working now so I'll give you a quick
 

17
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,400
is working now so I'll give you a quick
run-through of it or I'll try to I've

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,410
run-through of it or I'll try to I've
 

19
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,510
run-through of it or I'll try to I've
got two buttons now this one turns it on

20
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:34,520
got two buttons now this one turns it on
 

21
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,470
got two buttons now this one turns it on
this one turns it off nice and simple

22
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
this one turns it off nice and simple
 

23
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,680
this one turns it off nice and simple
after you turn it on it will shut off

24
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:41,690
after you turn it on it will shut off
 

25
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,150
after you turn it on it will shut off
automatically on its own after an hour

26
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
automatically on its own after an hour
 

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,440
automatically on its own after an hour
so if I go afk after an hour the spiders

28
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,450
so if I go afk after an hour the spiders
 

29
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,279
so if I go afk after an hour the spiders
will stop spawning

30
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:49,289
will stop spawning
 

31
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,430
will stop spawning
so that they don't build up to the point

32
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,440
so that they don't build up to the point
 

33
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,740
so that they don't build up to the point
where they cause extreme lag in my game

34
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:54,750
where they cause extreme lag in my game
 

35
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,080
where they cause extreme lag in my game
or possibly even crash it that was the

36
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,090
or possibly even crash it that was the
 

37
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,920
or possibly even crash it that was the
whole point of this

38
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:57,930
whole point of this
 

39
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,840
whole point of this
so haven't really tested it yet

40
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:04,850
so haven't really tested it yet
 

41
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,070
so haven't really tested it yet
um spawning so after an hour should shut

42
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
um spawning so after an hour should shut
 

43
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,210
um spawning so after an hour should shut
off on its own is the idea and you know

44
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:14,220
off on its own is the idea and you know
 

45
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,039
off on its own is the idea and you know
the wirings gonna be really good because

46
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,049
the wirings gonna be really good because
 

47
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,510
the wirings gonna be really good because
I put a lot of thought into this right

48
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
I put a lot of thought into this right
 

49
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,380
I put a lot of thought into this right
no oh it's a disaster back here because

50
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,390
no oh it's a disaster back here because
 

51
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,020
no oh it's a disaster back here because
yeah when I built the prototype I should

52
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,030
yeah when I built the prototype I should
 

53
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,160
yeah when I built the prototype I should
have built the whole thing the buttons

54
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,170
have built the whole thing the buttons
 

55
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,859
have built the whole thing the buttons
and everything but I didn't some things

56
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:33,869
and everything but I didn't some things
 

57
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:34,999
and everything but I didn't some things
turned out different than I was

58
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:35,009
turned out different than I was
 

59
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,690
turned out different than I was
expecting and I ended up just doing a

60
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:38,700
expecting and I ended up just doing a
 

61
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,760
expecting and I ended up just doing a
patch job down here so everything's a

62
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:40,770
patch job down here so everything's a
 

63
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,190
patch job down here so everything's a
mess because you need to add a few

64
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
mess because you need to add a few
 

65
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,530
mess because you need to add a few
things I didn't realize alright so I'm

66
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:48,540
things I didn't realize alright so I'm
 

67
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,749
things I didn't realize alright so I'm
gonna try my best to explain the wire

68
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:50,759
gonna try my best to explain the wire
 

69
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,630
gonna try my best to explain the wire
setup here I won't go into super detail

70
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
setup here I won't go into super detail
 

71
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,539
setup here I won't go into super detail
you can check out last episode if you

72
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:56,549
you can check out last episode if you
 

73
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,209
you can check out last episode if you
want more information about this timer

74
00:01:59,209 --> 00:01:59,219
want more information about this timer
 

75
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,050
want more information about this timer
concept and everything but this is the

76
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,060
concept and everything but this is the
 

77
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,059
concept and everything but this is the
way I set this up so this wire here is

78
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:08,069
way I set this up so this wire here is
 

79
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,859
way I set this up so this wire here is
connected to all the pressure plates and

80
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:09,869
connected to all the pressure plates and
 

81
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,710
connected to all the pressure plates and
everything it's always on when the timer

82
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
everything it's always on when the timer
 

83
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,850
everything it's always on when the timer
is running

84
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:13,860
is running
 

85
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,160
is running
and it's always off when the timer is

86
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,170
and it's always off when the timer is
 

87
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,300
and it's always off when the timer is
not running so if this this wire is on

88
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,310
not running so if this this wire is on
 

89
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,280
not running so if this this wire is on
that means we want the spiders spawning

90
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,290
that means we want the spiders spawning
 

91
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,550
that means we want the spiders spawning
so it's dark in there that's what we

92
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,560
so it's dark in there that's what we
 

93
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,700
so it's dark in there that's what we
want so I could have connected that

94
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:28,710
want so I could have connected that
 

95
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,750
want so I could have connected that
directly to the lighting system but if I

96
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:32,760
directly to the lighting system but if I
 

97
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,230
directly to the lighting system but if I
did that I would have no way of

98
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,240
did that I would have no way of
 

99
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,260
did that I would have no way of
controlling like being able to turn the

100
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,270
controlling like being able to turn the
 

101
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,980
controlling like being able to turn the
spawning off like if the timer's running

102
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:42,990
spawning off like if the timer's running
 

103
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,800
spawning off like if the timer's running
unless I use the lever to override it or

104
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:45,810
unless I use the lever to override it or
 

105
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,560
unless I use the lever to override it or
something but then I have to play around

106
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,570
something but then I have to play around
 

107
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,300
something but then I have to play around
with flipping it and stuff like that and

108
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,310
with flipping it and stuff like that and
 

109
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,330
with flipping it and stuff like that and
I wanted to use buttons just because

110
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:55,340
I wanted to use buttons just because
 

111
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,250
I wanted to use buttons just because
they're a little bit fancier but the

112
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,260
they're a little bit fancier but the
 

113
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,020
they're a little bit fancier but the
thing is if I use buttons I need this

114
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,030
thing is if I use buttons I need this
 

115
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,710
thing is if I use buttons I need this
combo here I have an RS nor latch over

116
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720
combo here I have an RS nor latch over
 

117
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,729
combo here I have an RS nor latch over
here and also an and eats and eats

118
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:07,739
here and also an and eats and eats
 

119
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,310
here and also an and eats and eats
connected to the arsenal' inside of it

120
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,320
connected to the arsenal' inside of it
 

121
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,270
connected to the arsenal' inside of it
and this wire is connected to the other

122
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,280
and this wire is connected to the other
 

123
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,050
and this wire is connected to the other
torch so this basically controls whether

124
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,060
torch so this basically controls whether
 

125
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,009
torch so this basically controls whether
or not we let this current to pass

126
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:22,019
or not we let this current to pass
 

127
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,280
or not we let this current to pass
through so this is the override to

128
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,290
through so this is the override to
 

129
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,729
through so this is the override to
shedding this spawning off if we want it

130
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:28,739
shedding this spawning off if we want it
 

131
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,960
shedding this spawning off if we want it
off okay and a lot of people were

132
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:35,970
off okay and a lot of people were
 

133
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,789
off okay and a lot of people were
wondering why I don't just took this

134
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:37,799
wondering why I don't just took this
 

135
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,330
wondering why I don't just took this
last torch hops like this is the first

136
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,340
last torch hops like this is the first
 

137
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,030
last torch hops like this is the first
dispenser here it's activated by this

138
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040
dispenser here it's activated by this
 

139
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,280
dispenser here it's activated by this
torch below this is the first one that

140
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,290
torch below this is the first one that
 

141
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,650
torch below this is the first one that
goes along ooh that's six of the

142
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:51,660
goes along ooh that's six of the
 

143
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,900
goes along ooh that's six of the
dispensers then it wraps around and goes

144
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,910
dispensers then it wraps around and goes
 

145
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,479
dispensers then it wraps around and goes
to this other side and it makes its way

146
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:56,489
to this other side and it makes its way
 

147
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,110
to this other side and it makes its way
back and that's the full 12 dispensers

148
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,120
back and that's the full 12 dispensers
 

149
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,820
back and that's the full 12 dispensers
for the hour timer

150
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:01,830
for the hour timer
 

151
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,120
for the hour timer
I can't just hook up this torch to the

152
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,130
I can't just hook up this torch to the
 

153
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,400
I can't just hook up this torch to the
RS nor latch because if I do that we

154
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,410
RS nor latch because if I do that we
 

155
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,979
RS nor latch because if I do that we
have an issue where this no longer

156
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:12,989
have an issue where this no longer
 

157
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,849
have an issue where this no longer
becomes resettable correctly so for

158
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:16,859
becomes resettable correctly so for
 

159
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,750
becomes resettable correctly so for
example if 40 minutes were to pass our

160
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:20,760
example if 40 minutes were to pass our
 

161
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,190
example if 40 minutes were to pass our
spider eyes would make it up to

162
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,200
spider eyes would make it up to
 

163
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,540
spider eyes would make it up to
something like around here right

164
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:26,550
something like around here right
 

165
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,540
something like around here right
and say I was a PK for those 40 minutes

166
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:29,550
and say I was a PK for those 40 minutes
 

167
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,339
and say I was a PK for those 40 minutes
I come back I decided I'm gonna kill the

168
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:31,349
I come back I decided I'm gonna kill the
 

169
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,980
I come back I decided I'm gonna kill the
spiders then I hit the on button to

170
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:33,990
spiders then I hit the on button to
 

171
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,399
spiders then I hit the on button to
reset the timer for a full hour and then

172
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:37,409
reset the timer for a full hour and then
 

173
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,309
reset the timer for a full hour and then
this dispenser shoots out the item but

174
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:40,319
this dispenser shoots out the item but
 

175
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,960
this dispenser shoots out the item but
what's gonna happen is we would still

176
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:41,970
what's gonna happen is we would still
 

177
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,649
what's gonna happen is we would still
have that other spider eye over here and

178
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:44,659
have that other spider eye over here and
 

179
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,080
have that other spider eye over here and
in 20 minutes they would make it to the

180
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,090
in 20 minutes they would make it to the
 

181
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,800
in 20 minutes they would make it to the
end and the spider thing would get shut

182
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:51,810
end and the spider thing would get shut
 

183
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,930
end and the spider thing would get shut
off in 20 minutes instead of the hour

184
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:53,940
off in 20 minutes instead of the hour
 

185
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,930
off in 20 minutes instead of the hour
like we want so that's the whole point

186
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:56,940
like we want so that's the whole point
 

187
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,240
like we want so that's the whole point
behind having to use this mean wire here

188
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,250
behind having to use this mean wire here
 

189
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,219
behind having to use this mean wire here
and not just connecting the last one

190
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:04,229
and not just connecting the last one
 

191
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:09,830
and not just connecting the last one
just to get it resettable and yeah I

192
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
just to get it resettable and yeah I
 

193
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,010
just to get it resettable and yeah I
think that's all I'm gonna say for now

194
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,020
think that's all I'm gonna say for now
 

195
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,270
think that's all I'm gonna say for now
I'll probably be putting on my world up

196
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,280
I'll probably be putting on my world up
 

197
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,640
I'll probably be putting on my world up
for download again soon I'm thinking

198
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:16,650
for download again soon I'm thinking
 

199
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,390
for download again soon I'm thinking
episode 150 so you can check this out in

200
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
episode 150 so you can check this out in
 

201
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,749
episode 150 so you can check this out in
more detail if you want at episode 150

202
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
more detail if you want at episode 150
 

203
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,879
more detail if you want at episode 150
people were suggesting I should kill the

204
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:25,889
people were suggesting I should kill the
 

205
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,890
people were suggesting I should kill the
dragon at 150 so I think that's what

206
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:27,900
dragon at 150 so I think that's what
 

207
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,779
dragon at 150 so I think that's what
I'll do and I'll release the world

208
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:29,789
I'll do and I'll release the world
 

209
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,980
I'll do and I'll release the world
before I say world before I hope I did I

210
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:33,990
before I say world before I hope I did I
 

211
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,209
before I say world before I hope I did I
might have said episode I'll release the

212
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:38,219
might have said episode I'll release the
 

213
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,670
might have said episode I'll release the
world at 150 before I kill the dragon is

214
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,680
world at 150 before I kill the dragon is
 

215
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,040
world at 150 before I kill the dragon is
the plan I might also hook up noteblocks

216
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,050
the plan I might also hook up noteblocks
 

217
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,689
the plan I might also hook up noteblocks
to this timer thing so every five

218
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:47,699
to this timer thing so every five
 

219
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,850
to this timer thing so every five
minutes a no block will get triggered

220
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:49,860
minutes a no block will get triggered
 

221
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,939
minutes a no block will get triggered
and play a different tune the different

222
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:52,949
and play a different tune the different
 

223
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,409
and play a different tune the different
note blocks from each other so that I

224
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:54,419
note blocks from each other so that I
 

225
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,749
note blocks from each other so that I
can tell how far along it is in the

226
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:56,759
can tell how far along it is in the
 

227
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:03,230
can tell how far along it is in the
timing yeah I had a lot of fun building

228
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
timing yeah I had a lot of fun building
 

229
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,159
timing yeah I had a lot of fun building
this too because so much stuff in the

230
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:07,169
this too because so much stuff in the
 

231
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:14,059
this too because so much stuff in the
way this is a panel right here and right

232
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:14,069
way this is a panel right here and right
 

233
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,309
way this is a panel right here and right
behind that is the spider elevator so

234
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
behind that is the spider elevator so
 

235
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,719
behind that is the spider elevator so
that was in the way I have to build

236
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:17,729
that was in the way I have to build
 

237
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,129
that was in the way I have to build
around it and then over here is the

238
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:22,139
around it and then over here is the
 

239
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,790
around it and then over here is the
slime escalator thing so right above

240
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:25,800
slime escalator thing so right above
 

241
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,290
slime escalator thing so right above
here where it's dripping is where the

242
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,300
here where it's dripping is where the
 

243
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,730
here where it's dripping is where the
slimes go by and also right below like

244
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:31,740
slimes go by and also right below like
 

245
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,939
slimes go by and also right below like
over here there's also where the slimes

246
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:34,949
over here there's also where the slimes
 

247
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,189
over here there's also where the slimes
are so I kind of built it in between the

248
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
are so I kind of built it in between the
 

249
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,180
are so I kind of built it in between the
two layers

250
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,190
two layers
 

251
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,559
two layers
oops

252
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:39,569
oops
 

253
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,439
oops
which was fun and I also wanted to try

254
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:43,449
which was fun and I also wanted to try
 

255
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,529
which was fun and I also wanted to try
keep it away from the slime chambers

256
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:46,539
keep it away from the slime chambers
 

257
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,969
keep it away from the slime chambers
here because we're probably going to do

258
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:47,979
here because we're probably going to do
 

259
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,460
here because we're probably going to do
something with them yet so dance is the

260
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:53,470
something with them yet so dance is the
 

261
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,610
something with them yet so dance is the
timer and I think we're gonna start on

262
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:56,620
timer and I think we're gonna start on
 

263
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,249
timer and I think we're gonna start on
today's project I said I had a even

264
00:06:59,249 --> 00:06:59,259
today's project I said I had a even
 

265
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,119
today's project I said I had a even
fancier timer that we're gonna build for

266
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:03,129
fancier timer that we're gonna build for
 

267
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,059
fancier timer that we're gonna build for
the blaze farm so we'll start that I

268
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:06,069
the blaze farm so we'll start that I
 

269
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,659
the blaze farm so we'll start that I
think it's actually gonna be smaller and

270
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:09,669
think it's actually gonna be smaller and
 

271
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:14,460
think it's actually gonna be smaller and
better than this one this one ended up

272
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:14,470
better than this one this one ended up
 

273
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,020
better than this one this one ended up
being a lot bigger than I expected

274
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,030
being a lot bigger than I expected
 

275
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,990
being a lot bigger than I expected
I think this other one is gonna be a lot

276
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,000
I think this other one is gonna be a lot
 

277
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,899
I think this other one is gonna be a lot
cooler so we're gonna get ready and we

278
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:21,909
cooler so we're gonna get ready and we
 

279
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,379
cooler so we're gonna get ready and we
will start building it oh yeah one more

280
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:25,389
will start building it oh yeah one more
 

281
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:27,029
will start building it oh yeah one more
thing I wanted to mention really quick

282
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
thing I wanted to mention really quick
 

283
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,420
thing I wanted to mention really quick
about this timer I got it set up for the

284
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:30,430
about this timer I got it set up for the
 

285
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,790
about this timer I got it set up for the
full hour right now but if I ever decide

286
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
full hour right now but if I ever decide
 

287
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,129
full hour right now but if I ever decide
I want to make it shorter it should be

288
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:35,139
I want to make it shorter it should be
 

289
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,200
I want to make it shorter it should be
pretty easy to do all I have to do is

290
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,210
pretty easy to do all I have to do is
 

291
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,089
pretty easy to do all I have to do is
remove the items from the last

292
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:39,099
remove the items from the last
 

293
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:41,520
remove the items from the last
dispensers and then I think it'll

294
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,530
dispensers and then I think it'll
 

295
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,709
dispensers and then I think it'll
shorten it five minutes each one I

296
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:43,719
shorten it five minutes each one I
 

297
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:47,279
shorten it five minutes each one I
remove them from and it's also what the

298
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,289
remove them from and it's also what the
 

299
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,149
remove them from and it's also what the
these levers were about by all the

300
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:51,159
these levers were about by all the
 

301
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,469
these levers were about by all the
dispensers I don't know if this will

302
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
dispensers I don't know if this will
 

303
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,790
dispensers I don't know if this will
work or not but I think I might be able

304
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:53,800
work or not but I think I might be able
 

305
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,370
work or not but I think I might be able
to override them just by sending power

306
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,380
to override them just by sending power
 

307
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,950
to override them just by sending power
to it instead of removing the items but

308
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
to it instead of removing the items but
 

309
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,200
to it instead of removing the items but
I haven't tried so I don't know for sure

310
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,210

 

311
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,519

all right so I think we're ready to

312
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:05,529
all right so I think we're ready to
 

313
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:08,700
all right so I think we're ready to
start building our fancy timer here once

314
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:08,710
start building our fancy timer here once
 

315
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,749
start building our fancy timer here once
again we're gonna build a prototype

316
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
again we're gonna build a prototype
 

317
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,800
again we're gonna build a prototype
first so that we can make sure we get

318
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,810
first so that we can make sure we get
 

319
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,200
first so that we can make sure we get
the wiring all nice and clean when we

320
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,210
the wiring all nice and clean when we
 

321
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,570
the wiring all nice and clean when we
build the actual thing at the blaze farm

322
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:18,580
build the actual thing at the blaze farm
 

323
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,480
build the actual thing at the blaze farm
and if we have to figure things out

324
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,490
and if we have to figure things out
 

325
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,820
and if we have to figure things out
which I'm sure we'll need to because

326
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:23,830
which I'm sure we'll need to because
 

327
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,589
which I'm sure we'll need to because
this is uh this is actually a pretty

328
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
this is uh this is actually a pretty
 

329
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,269
this is uh this is actually a pretty
complicated thing I took a look at it

330
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:27,279
complicated thing I took a look at it
 

331
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,999
complicated thing I took a look at it
again and it's gonna be it's gonna be a

332
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:30,009
again and it's gonna be it's gonna be a
 

333
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,510
again and it's gonna be it's gonna be a
challenge if we have to modify it we'll

334
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:33,520
challenge if we have to modify it we'll
 

335
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,480
challenge if we have to modify it we'll
have space to work outside here instead

336
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,490
have space to work outside here instead
 

337
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,819
have space to work outside here instead
of having to dig through netherrack and

338
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:38,829
of having to dig through netherrack and
 

339
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:41,699
of having to dig through netherrack and
stuff to make more space for us to test

340
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:41,709
stuff to make more space for us to test
 

341
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:45,520
stuff to make more space for us to test
things out when we actually build it

342
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:45,530
things out when we actually build it
 

343
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:52,280
things out when we actually build it
okay so let's begin this is the first

344
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,290
okay so let's begin this is the first
 

345
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,840
okay so let's begin this is the first
thing we're building here is the blocks

346
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:53,850
thing we're building here is the blocks
 

347
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,820
thing we're building here is the blocks
whopper so this is the most difficult

348
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:55,830
whopper so this is the most difficult
 

349
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,270
whopper so this is the most difficult
part of the build and lucky for us it's

350
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,280
part of the build and lucky for us it's
 

351
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,070
part of the build and lucky for us it's
actually been built before I have in my

352
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,080
actually been built before I have in my
 

353
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,920
actually been built before I have in my
creative world and I took a look at it

354
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:03,930
creative world and I took a look at it
 

355
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,400
creative world and I took a look at it
so I have it fresh in mind and we just

356
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,410
so I have it fresh in mind and we just
 

357
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,980
so I have it fresh in mind and we just
basically have to copy it over here and

358
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:09,990
basically have to copy it over here and
 

359
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,900
basically have to copy it over here and
then once we do that we have to modify

360
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:11,910
then once we do that we have to modify
 

361
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,950
then once we do that we have to modify
it to modify the blocks whopper into a

362
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:15,960
it to modify the blocks whopper into a
 

363
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,860
it to modify the blocks whopper into a
timer and that's gonna be the tough part

364
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:17,870
timer and that's gonna be the tough part
 

365
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,890
timer and that's gonna be the tough part
so this is like the GUI for the timer

366
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:21,900
so this is like the GUI for the timer
 

367
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,700
so this is like the GUI for the timer
the graphical interface got buttons here

368
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,710
the graphical interface got buttons here
 

369
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,130
the graphical interface got buttons here
pressing this button will subtract the

370
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,140
pressing this button will subtract the
 

371
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,100
pressing this button will subtract the
time by 5 minutes and pressing this one

372
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,110
time by 5 minutes and pressing this one
 

373
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,240
time by 5 minutes and pressing this one
will increase it by 5 minutes that's the

374
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,250
will increase it by 5 minutes that's the
 

375
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:44,420
will increase it by 5 minutes that's the
plan for that below here I took a look

376
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:44,430
plan for that below here I took a look
 

377
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,860
plan for that below here I took a look
at the redstone on this thing and I

378
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:45,870
at the redstone on this thing and I
 

379
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,410
at the redstone on this thing and I
don't even understand it I don't know if

380
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,420
don't even understand it I don't know if
 

381
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,820
don't even understand it I don't know if
I knew what I was doing when I built it

382
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:49,830
I knew what I was doing when I built it
 

383
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,210
I knew what I was doing when I built it
but I sure don't know how it works now

384
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,220
but I sure don't know how it works now
 

385
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,540
but I sure don't know how it works now
it's really really weird got an

386
00:09:59,540 --> 00:09:59,550
it's really really weird got an
 

387
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,990
it's really really weird got an
efficiency for shovel pretty nice okay

388
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
efficiency for shovel pretty nice okay
 

389
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,700
efficiency for shovel pretty nice okay
so I have a block here yeah so a new

390
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:13,710
so I have a block here yeah so a new
 

391
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,870
so I have a block here yeah so a new
patch is coming out soon looks very cool

392
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
patch is coming out soon looks very cool
 

393
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
patch is coming out soon looks very cool
lots of changes too they've really been

394
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:19,770
lots of changes too they've really been
 

395
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,090
lots of changes too they've really been
working hard at that got the AI changes

396
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,100
working hard at that got the AI changes
 

397
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,310
working hard at that got the AI changes
and I saw there's gonna be lamps and

398
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:25,320
and I saw there's gonna be lamps and
 

399
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,210
and I saw there's gonna be lamps and
stuff lamps I really liked how they

400
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,220
stuff lamps I really liked how they
 

401
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,000
stuff lamps I really liked how they
implemented them too it's a flight

402
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,010
implemented them too it's a flight
 

403
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,970
implemented them too it's a flight
glowstone but if it's only it's only

404
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:34,980
glowstone but if it's only it's only
 

405
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,910
glowstone but if it's only it's only
light if it's powered which is cool I

406
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
light if it's powered which is cool I
 

407
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,620
light if it's powered which is cool I
liked how there's no particles or

408
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:39,630
liked how there's no particles or
 

409
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,680
liked how there's no particles or
anything not a big fan of light that

410
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:45,690
anything not a big fan of light that
 

411
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,080
anything not a big fan of light that
emits particles and I am avoiding

412
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,090
emits particles and I am avoiding
 

413
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,260
emits particles and I am avoiding
torches in the cave yeah yeah we got the

414
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,270
torches in the cave yeah yeah we got the
 

415
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,490
torches in the cave yeah yeah we got the
AI we got

416
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:57,500

 

417
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,060

new map heights new map format that's

418
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,070
new map heights new map format that's
 

419
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,660
new map heights new map format that's
pretty cool I like Choa it's gonna be a

420
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:08,670
pretty cool I like Choa it's gonna be a
 

421
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,370
pretty cool I like Choa it's gonna be a
lot more efficient so stuff should load

422
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,380
lot more efficient so stuff should load
 

423
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,990
lot more efficient so stuff should load
faster and multiplayer and all that

424
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,000
faster and multiplayer and all that
 

425
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,460
faster and multiplayer and all that
which is good those kinds of changes are

426
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:18,470
which is good those kinds of changes are
 

427
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,230
which is good those kinds of changes are
drastically needed I'm kind of sad

428
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,240
drastically needed I'm kind of sad
 

429
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,060
drastically needed I'm kind of sad
though about one thing and I've been

430
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,070
though about one thing and I've been
 

431
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,800
though about one thing and I've been
thinking about this a lot lately mcedit

432
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:27,810
thinking about this a lot lately mcedit
 

433
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,210
thinking about this a lot lately mcedit
is no longer supported which is really

434
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,220
is no longer supported which is really
 

435
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,160
is no longer supported which is really
sad for me because I've been working on

436
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,170
sad for me because I've been working on
 

437
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,710
sad for me because I've been working on
the map a lot lately the CTM map I've

438
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
the map a lot lately the CTM map I've
 

439
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,230
the map a lot lately the CTM map I've
actually come kind of addicted to

440
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
actually come kind of addicted to
 

441
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,660
actually come kind of addicted to
working on it people have been wondering

442
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:41,670
working on it people have been wondering
 

443
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,550
working on it people have been wondering
why I haven't been releasing tutorials

444
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,560
why I haven't been releasing tutorials
 

445
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,490
why I haven't been releasing tutorials
and stuff it's because most of the

446
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:46,500
and stuff it's because most of the
 

447
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,050
and stuff it's because most of the
creative stuff and new stuff I've been

448
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,060
creative stuff and new stuff I've been
 

449
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,950
creative stuff and new stuff I've been
making is in the CPM map and I don't

450
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:51,960
making is in the CPM map and I don't
 

451
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,470
making is in the CPM map and I don't
want to spoil the things I've made so I

452
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
want to spoil the things I've made so I
 

453
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,080
want to spoil the things I've made so I
think I counted right here oh we need

454
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,090
think I counted right here oh we need
 

455
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:06,740
think I counted right here oh we need
regular Pistons dang it hmm yeah so one

456
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:06,750
regular Pistons dang it hmm yeah so one
 

457
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,470
regular Pistons dang it hmm yeah so one
two three four five six

458
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:09,480
two three four five six
 

459
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,470
two three four five six
I need Pistons there okay I'll be right

460
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
I need Pistons there okay I'll be right
 

461
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,650
I need Pistons there okay I'll be right
back

462
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:17,660
back
 

463
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,160
back
okay I'm back yeah the CPM map is going

464
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,170
okay I'm back yeah the CPM map is going
 

465
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,920
okay I'm back yeah the CPM map is going
very well but I still have a lot left to

466
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:24,930
very well but I still have a lot left to
 

467
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,140
very well but I still have a lot left to
do on it so don't expect it anytime soon

468
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,150
do on it so don't expect it anytime soon
 

469
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,950
do on it so don't expect it anytime soon
when you see it you'll kind of

470
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:30,960
when you see it you'll kind of
 

471
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,270
when you see it you'll kind of
understand why it's taking me so long

472
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,280
understand why it's taking me so long
 

473
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,940
understand why it's taking me so long
there's a lot of very complicated things

474
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:34,950
there's a lot of very complicated things
 

475
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,170
there's a lot of very complicated things
going into it and each of those takes a

476
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,180
going into it and each of those takes a
 

477
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,140
going into it and each of those takes a
very long time to make even though I'm

478
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,150
very long time to make even though I'm
 

479
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,840
very long time to make even though I'm
pretty quick at making most things still

480
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:44,850
pretty quick at making most things still
 

481
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,540
pretty quick at making most things still
have to tweak them and make sure they

482
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:47,550
have to tweak them and make sure they
 

483
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,780
have to tweak them and make sure they
work for such a small small part of the

484
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:53,790
work for such a small small part of the
 

485
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,680
work for such a small small part of the
map it takes a long time to work out but

486
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:57,690
map it takes a long time to work out but
 

487
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,480
map it takes a long time to work out but
I can hardly wait to see how people

488
00:12:59,480 --> 00:12:59,490
I can hardly wait to see how people
 

489
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,130
I can hardly wait to see how people
react to some of the things I put into

490
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:01,140
react to some of the things I put into
 

491
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,230
react to some of the things I put into
it which is why I've become very

492
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,240
it which is why I've become very
 

493
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,760
it which is why I've become very
addicted to working on it what are we

494
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:07,770
addicted to working on it what are we
 

495
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,490
addicted to working on it what are we
missing here

496
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:08,500
missing here
 

497
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,740
missing here
but yeah I'm kind of sad about them see

498
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:10,750
but yeah I'm kind of sad about them see
 

499
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,060
but yeah I'm kind of sad about them see
other thing because now I don't know

500
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,070
other thing because now I don't know
 

501
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,690
other thing because now I don't know
what I should do if I should wait on

502
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:14,700
what I should do if I should wait on
 

503
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,690
what I should do if I should wait on
working on my map or I don't know

504
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:18,700
working on my map or I don't know
 

505
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,040
working on my map or I don't know
because I need it

506
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,050
because I need it
 

507
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,950
because I need it
I really do I

508
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:22,960
I really do I
 

509
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,510
I really do I
I could probably continue it but then I

510
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:24,520
I could probably continue it but then I
 

511
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,300
I could probably continue it but then I
just can't take advantage of the the new

512
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,310
just can't take advantage of the the new
 

513
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,670
just can't take advantage of the the new
height of maps I'll just have to stick

514
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
height of maps I'll just have to stick
 

515
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,030
height of maps I'll just have to stick
with the 128 block limit or something

516
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040

 

517
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:44,370

okay what are we doing here so let's see

518
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:44,380
okay what are we doing here so let's see
 

519
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,550
okay what are we doing here so let's see
here these are what do you call

520
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:47,560
here these are what do you call
 

521
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,550
here these are what do you call
monostable circuits these things here

522
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
monostable circuits these things here
 

523
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,760
monostable circuits these things here
and here this controls this piston which

524
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:56,770
and here this controls this piston which
 

525
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,670
and here this controls this piston which
pushes a block oh into our excuse me out

526
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:02,680
pushes a block oh into our excuse me out
 

527
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,030
pushes a block oh into our excuse me out
into our interface here and the only

528
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
into our interface here and the only
 

529
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,460
into our interface here and the only
thing we have to do now is hook up these

530
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:11,470
thing we have to do now is hook up these
 

531
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,450
thing we have to do now is hook up these
to our Pistons and that's gonna be tough

532
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:14,460
to our Pistons and that's gonna be tough
 

533
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,110
to our Pistons and that's gonna be tough
so I will do that off-camera and I'll

534
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
so I will do that off-camera and I'll
 

535
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,700
so I will do that off-camera and I'll
see you in a few more minutes that

536
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:23,710
see you in a few more minutes that
 

537
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,650
see you in a few more minutes that
wasn't too bad I took a screenshot of

538
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:25,660
wasn't too bad I took a screenshot of
 

539
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,270
wasn't too bad I took a screenshot of
the one I had built already and just

540
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,280
the one I had built already and just
 

541
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,060
the one I had built already and just
copied that went really quick this is

542
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,070
copied that went really quick this is
 

543
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,920
copied that went really quick this is
the wiring here just give you an

544
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:34,930
the wiring here just give you an
 

545
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,020
the wiring here just give you an
overview first and then maybe I'll

546
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,030
overview first and then maybe I'll
 

547
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,400
overview first and then maybe I'll
explain it more later so this is all

548
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,410
explain it more later so this is all
 

549
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,960
explain it more later so this is all
just to control the Pistons all this

550
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:42,970
just to control the Pistons all this
 

551
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,110
just to control the Pistons all this
wire I added it's it's pretty crazy I

552
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
wire I added it's it's pretty crazy I
 

553
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,400
wire I added it's it's pretty crazy I
don't think I've ever seen it without

554
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,410
don't think I've ever seen it without
 

555
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,470
don't think I've ever seen it without
the blocks in like what the Pistons do

556
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
the blocks in like what the Pistons do
 

557
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,330
the blocks in like what the Pistons do
so the there's supposed to be 12 blocks

558
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:57,340
so the there's supposed to be 12 blocks
 

559
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,460
so the there's supposed to be 12 blocks
at the bottom row here and 12 at the top

560
00:14:59,460 --> 00:14:59,470
at the bottom row here and 12 at the top
 

561
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,580
at the bottom row here and 12 at the top
row for 24 total if you press the left

562
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:02,590
row for 24 total if you press the left
 

563
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,550
row for 24 total if you press the left
button they're supposed to cycle

564
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
button they're supposed to cycle
 

565
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,830
button they're supposed to cycle
counterclockwise and if you press the

566
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:07,840
counterclockwise and if you press the
 

567
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,120
counterclockwise and if you press the
right button they're supposed to kick

568
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,130
right button they're supposed to kick
 

569
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,560
right button they're supposed to kick
cycle clockwise all right this is what

570
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:13,570
cycle clockwise all right this is what
 

571
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,749
cycle clockwise all right this is what
happens when you press the left one

572
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:17,759

 

573
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,189

pistons go crazy on the left side and

574
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:20,199
pistons go crazy on the left side and
 

575
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,970
pistons go crazy on the left side and
also on the right side all so all eight

576
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:23,980
also on the right side all so all eight
 

577
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,610
also on the right side all so all eight
go at once and same if you do the right

578
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:26,620
go at once and same if you do the right
 

579
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,379
go at once and same if you do the right
one they all kind of spaz out like that

580
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:30,389
one they all kind of spaz out like that
 

581
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,600
one they all kind of spaz out like that
all due to the fancy redstone that

582
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,610
all due to the fancy redstone that
 

583
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,809
all due to the fancy redstone that
doesn't make much sense so I'm gonna put

584
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:36,819
doesn't make much sense so I'm gonna put
 

585
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,350
doesn't make much sense so I'm gonna put
blocks in here and hopefully it works

586
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
blocks in here and hopefully it works
 

587
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,090
blocks in here and hopefully it works
this like I said this is a very weird

588
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,100
this like I said this is a very weird
 

589
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,189
this like I said this is a very weird
setup I have for it and I'm hoping

590
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:46,199
setup I have for it and I'm hoping
 

591
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,069
setup I have for it and I'm hoping
there's no like directional issues or

592
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
there's no like directional issues or
 

593
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,569
there's no like directional issues or
anything like that that's gonna prevent

594
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:51,579
anything like that that's gonna prevent
 

595
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:56,970
anything like that that's gonna prevent
it from working this blocks whopper I

596
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:56,980
it from working this blocks whopper I
 

597
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,069
it from working this blocks whopper I
made originally back when 1.8 was being

598
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
made originally back when 1.8 was being
 

599
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,350
made originally back when 1.8 was being
developed when I said goodbye to my old

600
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:04,360
developed when I said goodbye to my old
 

601
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,420
developed when I said goodbye to my old
world what I was doing is I was trying

602
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,430
world what I was doing is I was trying
 

603
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,199
world what I was doing is I was trying
to make something really fancy for my

604
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:10,209
to make something really fancy for my
 

605
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:12,329
to make something really fancy for my
for a new storage room when I started my

606
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:12,339
for a new storage room when I started my
 

607
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,660
for a new storage room when I started my
LP up again and the idea was I would

608
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:15,670
LP up again and the idea was I would
 

609
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,960
LP up again and the idea was I would
have 12 different blocks to select from

610
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:18,970
have 12 different blocks to select from
 

611
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,929
have 12 different blocks to select from
with the blocks whopper and I could

612
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:21,939
with the blocks whopper and I could
 

613
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,309
with the blocks whopper and I could
cycle through them with these buttons

614
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:23,319
cycle through them with these buttons
 

615
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,120
cycle through them with these buttons
and then when I picked one I wanted I

616
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,130
and then when I picked one I wanted I
 

617
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,249
and then when I picked one I wanted I
would press a button and then they would

618
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:29,259
would press a button and then they would
 

619
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:32,759
would press a button and then they would
fall from dispensers above that was kind

620
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:32,769
fall from dispensers above that was kind
 

621
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,199
fall from dispensers above that was kind
of the idea I had for the storage room

622
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:34,209
of the idea I had for the storage room
 

623
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,559
of the idea I had for the storage room
but it just cycled too slow so let's see

624
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:37,569
but it just cycled too slow so let's see
 

625
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:43,259
but it just cycled too slow so let's see
if it works even it's going the wrong

626
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:43,269
if it works even it's going the wrong
 

627
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,960
if it works even it's going the wrong
way

628
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:44,970
way
 

629
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:53,300
way
not be going right hmm I might have made

630
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,310
not be going right hmm I might have made
 

631
00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:01,250
not be going right hmm I might have made
a mistake somewhere okay I'll have to

632
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:01,260
a mistake somewhere okay I'll have to
 

633
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,140
a mistake somewhere okay I'll have to
play around with this and hopefully fix

634
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,150
play around with this and hopefully fix
 

635
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,840
play around with this and hopefully fix
it okay this is frustrating it's it's

636
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:08,850
it okay this is frustrating it's it's
 

637
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,490
it okay this is frustrating it's it's
built exactly the same as the original

638
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:10,500
built exactly the same as the original
 

639
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,650
built exactly the same as the original
one I had but it's behaving differently

640
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:12,660
one I had but it's behaving differently
 

641
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,000
one I had but it's behaving differently
so I think it's a directional thing our

642
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,010
so I think it's a directional thing our
 

643
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,699
so I think it's a directional thing our
F is one here I'm gonna go to the

644
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:19,709
F is one here I'm gonna go to the
 

645
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,140
F is one here I'm gonna go to the
creative world where I have the original

646
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,150
creative world where I have the original
 

647
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,750
creative world where I have the original
just to show you how it's supposed to

648
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
just to show you how it's supposed to
 

649
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,480
just to show you how it's supposed to
work and I want to check what direction

650
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:26,490
work and I want to check what direction
 

651
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,020
work and I want to check what direction
I have it built there the issue is the

652
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,030
I have it built there the issue is the
 

653
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,910
I have it built there the issue is the
fancy redstone thing over here it's

654
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:34,920
fancy redstone thing over here it's
 

655
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,850
fancy redstone thing over here it's
because the input to share the same wire

656
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:36,860
because the input to share the same wire
 

657
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,790
because the input to share the same wire
so I'll have to separate them but that

658
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:40,800
so I'll have to separate them but that
 

659
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,560
so I'll have to separate them but that
means I'll probably have to space some

660
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:42,570
means I'll probably have to space some
 

661
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,310
means I'll probably have to space some
things out to make it work

662
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,320
things out to make it work
 

663
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,410
things out to make it work
so anyway let's go to the creative world

664
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:50,420

 

665
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,000

okay here we are in the creative world

666
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,010
okay here we are in the creative world
 

667
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,640
okay here we are in the creative world
this is where this is original and I

668
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:55,650
this is where this is original and I
 

669
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,980
this is where this is original and I
built a few months ago the one that

670
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:57,990
built a few months ago the one that
 

671
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,900
built a few months ago the one that
actually works and oddly enough it's it

672
00:17:59,900 --> 00:17:59,910
actually works and oddly enough it's it
 

673
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,280
actually works and oddly enough it's it
built at the same direction f1 but for

674
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,290
built at the same direction f1 but for
 

675
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,560
built at the same direction f1 but for
some reason even though it's exactly the

676
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:06,570
some reason even though it's exactly the
 

677
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,930
some reason even though it's exactly the
same it behaves properly unlike the

678
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:08,940
same it behaves properly unlike the
 

679
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,100
same it behaves properly unlike the
other one so this is what's supposed to

680
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,110
other one so this is what's supposed to
 

681
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,060
other one so this is what's supposed to
do

682
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,070
do
 

683
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:21,500
do
you can cycle left or right use your

684
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:21,510
you can cycle left or right use your
 

685
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:28,100
you can cycle left or right use your
block and just to prove it to you the

686
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,110
block and just to prove it to you the
 

687
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,140
block and just to prove it to you the
redstone is exactly the same over here

688
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,150
redstone is exactly the same over here
 

689
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,840
redstone is exactly the same over here
it's at least the inputs still joined

690
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:32,850
it's at least the inputs still joined
 

691
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:40,280
it's at least the inputs still joined
together but yeah oh well I will adjust

692
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,290
together but yeah oh well I will adjust
 

693
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,590
together but yeah oh well I will adjust
the other one and hopefully get it

694
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:42,600
the other one and hopefully get it
 

695
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,790
the other one and hopefully get it
working well I don't know what to do

696
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:46,800
working well I don't know what to do
 

697
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,360
working well I don't know what to do
here

698
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,370
here
 

699
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,280
here
I think today's episode is gonna be a

700
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,290
I think today's episode is gonna be a
 

701
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,790
I think today's episode is gonna be a
bit of a flop because this stupid thing

702
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:52,800
bit of a flop because this stupid thing
 

703
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,060
bit of a flop because this stupid thing
doesn't want to work just doesn't like

704
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,070
doesn't want to work just doesn't like
 

705
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,610
doesn't want to work just doesn't like
me today for some reason um I'm having

706
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:01,620
me today for some reason um I'm having
 

707
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,230
me today for some reason um I'm having
just enough not enough space to work and

708
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
just enough not enough space to work and
 

709
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,560
just enough not enough space to work and
if I I make that adjustment here so that

710
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:12,570
if I I make that adjustment here so that
 

711
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,390
if I I make that adjustment here so that
these wires are separate and becomes

712
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
these wires are separate and becomes
 

713
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,170
these wires are separate and becomes
very difficult to attach to this torch

714
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,180
very difficult to attach to this torch
 

715
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,710
very difficult to attach to this torch
here in the middle and if I use

716
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:21,720
here in the middle and if I use
 

717
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,730
here in the middle and if I use
repeaters or any other sort of delay it

718
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:25,740
repeaters or any other sort of delay it
 

719
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,020
repeaters or any other sort of delay it
just doesn't want to work anymore so

720
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,030
just doesn't want to work anymore so
 

721
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,100
just doesn't want to work anymore so
this doesn't work with repeaters and I

722
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,110
this doesn't work with repeaters and I
 

723
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,200
this doesn't work with repeaters and I
had to move these a loop had to move

724
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,210
had to move these a loop had to move
 

725
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,800
had to move these a loop had to move
these over one block each just to make

726
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:39,810
these over one block each just to make
 

727
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,730
these over one block each just to make
this work and this doesn't work so I

728
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:43,740
this work and this doesn't work so I
 

729
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,030
this work and this doesn't work so I
kind of need the space over here to hook

730
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,040
kind of need the space over here to hook
 

731
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,940
kind of need the space over here to hook
up to convert this into a memory thing

732
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:49,950
up to convert this into a memory thing
 

733
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,280
up to convert this into a memory thing
ah so yeah I'm a little frustrated with

734
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,290
ah so yeah I'm a little frustrated with
 

735
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:01,280
ah so yeah I'm a little frustrated with
all this and just to show if I get rid

736
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,290
all this and just to show if I get rid
 

737
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,600
all this and just to show if I get rid
of the effect where it pops out which I

738
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:05,610
of the effect where it pops out which I
 

739
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:11,630
of the effect where it pops out which I
really like it does work but for some

740
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:11,640
really like it does work but for some
 

741
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,320
really like it does work but for some
reason it's I came and get out of here

742
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,330
reason it's I came and get out of here
 

743
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:25,040
reason it's I came and get out of here
perk or it's not popped out will cycle

744
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,050

 

745
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,200

it's going the wrong way though for some

746
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,210
it's going the wrong way though for some
 

747
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:35,900
it's going the wrong way though for some
reason seems to be jammed now there we

748
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:35,910
reason seems to be jammed now there we
 

749
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,790
reason seems to be jammed now there we
go

750
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:36,800
go
 

751
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,770
go
this really buggy for some reason I

752
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:39,780
this really buggy for some reason I
 

753
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,840
this really buggy for some reason I
don't know the original worked fine

754
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:41,850
don't know the original worked fine
 

755
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:50,150
don't know the original worked fine
I think I'm to get this working I have

756
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,160
I think I'm to get this working I have
 

757
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,710
I think I'm to get this working I have
to get rid of these vertical Pistons I

758
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:51,720
to get rid of these vertical Pistons I
 

759
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,420
to get rid of these vertical Pistons I
have to lay everything out horizontally

760
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:53,430
have to lay everything out horizontally
 

761
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,650
have to lay everything out horizontally
because the piston glitches are I'm sure

762
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:57,660
because the piston glitches are I'm sure
 

763
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:04,850
because the piston glitches are I'm sure
having an effect on this oh well I think

764
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:04,860
having an effect on this oh well I think
 

765
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,650
having an effect on this oh well I think
I've messed around with this enough

766
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:06,660
I've messed around with this enough
 

767
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,330
I've messed around with this enough
today I'll do I'll go over the idea

768
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:08,340
today I'll do I'll go over the idea
 

769
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,100
today I'll do I'll go over the idea
behind behind this with you though

770
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,110
behind behind this with you though
 

771
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,910
behind behind this with you though
before we end this that's what this

772
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:12,920
before we end this that's what this
 

773
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,190
before we end this that's what this
rainbow wool here is for each of these

774
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,200
rainbow wool here is for each of these
 

775
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,710
rainbow wool here is for each of these
was gonna represent visually represent

776
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
was gonna represent visually represent
 

777
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,370
was gonna represent visually represent
five minutes so this would be like zero

778
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:22,380
five minutes so this would be like zero
 

779
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,250
five minutes so this would be like zero
minutes this would be 5 10 15 20 all the

780
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,260
minutes this would be 5 10 15 20 all the
 

781
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,720
minutes this would be 5 10 15 20 all the
way up to I think 55 and I could either

782
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:29,730
way up to I think 55 and I could either
 

783
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,870
way up to I think 55 and I could either
add or subtract the minutes using these

784
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
add or subtract the minutes using these
 

785
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,360
add or subtract the minutes using these
buttons this would subtract this would

786
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,370
buttons this would subtract this would
 

787
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,870
buttons this would subtract this would
add and I was gonna have a memory

788
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
add and I was gonna have a memory
 

789
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,250
add and I was gonna have a memory
convert this into a memory system by

790
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,260
convert this into a memory system by
 

791
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,150
convert this into a memory system by
making one of the visual entries

792
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,160
making one of the visual entries
 

793
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,900
making one of the visual entries
glowstone block or glass block so one of

794
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:50,910
glowstone block or glass block so one of
 

795
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,040
glowstone block or glass block so one of
these would have to be glass or

796
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,050
these would have to be glass or
 

797
00:21:52,050 --> 00:22:00,410
these would have to be glass or
glowstone and then I'd have so even

798
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,420
glowstone and then I'd have so even
 

799
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,530
glowstone and then I'd have so even
though this is 24 blocks here I'd only

800
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:03,540
though this is 24 blocks here I'd only
 

801
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,170
though this is 24 blocks here I'd only
have 12 different ones so two of them

802
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:06,180
have 12 different ones so two of them
 

803
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,980
have 12 different ones so two of them
would be copies

804
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:12,990

 

805
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,170

yeah I can't even show it with you with

806
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:15,180
yeah I can't even show it with you with
 

807
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,780
yeah I can't even show it with you with
this but basically if you send power

808
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:17,790
this but basically if you send power
 

809
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,030
this but basically if you send power
into a glass block it doesn't look let

810
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,040
into a glass block it doesn't look let
 

811
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,610
into a glass block it doesn't look let
power through unlike the other blocks so

812
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:22,620
power through unlike the other blocks so
 

813
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,890
power through unlike the other blocks so
that way you could detect what one

814
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:24,900
that way you could detect what one
 

815
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,460
that way you could detect what one
you're on which one is number zero or

816
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:28,470
you're on which one is number zero or
 

817
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,260
you're on which one is number zero or
zero time you would hook that up to the

818
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:33,270
zero time you would hook that up to the
 

819
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,860
zero time you would hook that up to the
spawning light system and then you would

820
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:36,870
spawning light system and then you would
 

821
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,840
spawning light system and then you would
also have a timer system as when these

822
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:38,850
also have a timer system as when these
 

823
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:45,320
also have a timer system as when these
dispensers one dispenser and every every

824
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,330
dispensers one dispenser and every every
 

825
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,060
dispensers one dispenser and every every
five minutes it would subtract five

826
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,070
five minutes it would subtract five
 

827
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,170
five minutes it would subtract five
minutes from this so it would be

828
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:51,180
minutes from this so it would be
 

829
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,990
minutes from this so it would be
equivalent to pressing this left button

830
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
equivalent to pressing this left button
 

831
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,420
equivalent to pressing this left button
so it would have allowed me to freely

832
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,430
so it would have allowed me to freely
 

833
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,490
so it would have allowed me to freely
control the time on the thing because I

834
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,500
control the time on the thing because I
 

835
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,300
control the time on the thing because I
could add or subtract the time as the

836
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,310
could add or subtract the time as the
 

837
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,130
could add or subtract the time as the
timer's running and when I would do that

838
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,140
timer's running and when I would do that
 

839
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,190
timer's running and when I would do that
the five minutes would reset on the

840
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
the five minutes would reset on the
 

841
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,750
the five minutes would reset on the
dispenser and yeah I had it pretty much

842
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
dispenser and yeah I had it pretty much
 

843
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,550
dispenser and yeah I had it pretty much
all figured out but I was expecting this

844
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:19,560
all figured out but I was expecting this
 

845
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,380
all figured out but I was expecting this
to work and it's just not working today

846
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:21,390
to work and it's just not working today
 

847
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,910
to work and it's just not working today
or for me so I'm going to take a break

848
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:25,920
or for me so I'm going to take a break
 

849
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,310
or for me so I'm going to take a break
from this today I will an episode here

850
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
from this today I will an episode here
 

851
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,210
from this today I will an episode here
and I might scrap this project and so I

852
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,220
and I might scrap this project and so I
 

853
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,310
and I might scrap this project and so I
how I feel about it next time I start

854
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
how I feel about it next time I start
 

855
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,910
how I feel about it next time I start
recording okay I'll see you guys next

856
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:37,920
recording okay I'll see you guys next
