on although it doesn't matter and you
 

97
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,870
on although it doesn't matter and you
can have the items fall over there or if

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:15,880
can have the items fall over there or if
 

99
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,949

you want them to go to the main
 

101
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,630
you want them to go to the main
collection stream then you just open the

102
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
collection stream then you just open the
 

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,530
collection stream then you just open the
bottom door here and the items will flow

104
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:22,540
bottom door here and the items will flow
 

105
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,090

out

106
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,100

 

107
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,480

just like that - this whole

torches in here temporarily just to

114
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:36,610
torches in here temporarily just to
 

115
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,030
torches in here temporarily just to
improve the lighting conditions

116
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,040
improve the lighting conditions
 

117
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,980

apparently it doesn't seem to melt the

118
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:40,990
apparently it doesn't seem to melt the
 

119
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,830
apparently it doesn't seem to melt the
ice below just good but if I place like

120
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:46,840
ice below just good but if I place like
 

121
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,220
ice below just good but if I place like
a torch around here it would so I got to

122
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,230
a torch around here it would so I got to
 

123
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,650
a torch around here it would so I got to
be careful that's working good working

124
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:55,660
be careful that's working good working
 

125
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:09,050
be careful that's working good working
dude working great I should say yeah

126
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,060

 

127
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,860

that's interesting yeah you can combine

128
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:13,870
that's interesting yeah you can combine
 

129
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,370
that's interesting yeah you can combine
this stuff in lots of different ways and

130
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,380
this stuff in lots of different ways and
 

131
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,050
this stuff in lots of different ways and
then weird stuff will happen then she'll

132
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,060
then weird stuff will happen then she'll
 

133
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,930
then weird stuff will happen then she'll
probably rewire this so this floor

134
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:21,940
probably rewire this so this floor
 

135
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,790
probably rewire this so this floor
doesn't open if that door is closed

136
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
doesn't open if that door is closed
 

137
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:38,640
doesn't open if that door is closed
sound really like that

138
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:38,650

 

139
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,010

big stuff is much the same oh yeah I

140
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,020
big stuff is much the same oh yeah I
 

141
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:49,149
big stuff is much the same oh yeah I
forgot we got the lab so can have them

142
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:49,159
forgot we got the lab so can have them
 

143
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,439
forgot we got the lab so can have them
fall through lava like that if you have

144
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:50,449
fall through lava like that if you have
 

145
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,799
fall through lava like that if you have
the water break on the fall through

146
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:53,809
the water break on the fall through
 

147
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,559
the water break on the fall through
water first then lava but the water will

148
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:56,569
water first then lava but the water will
 

149
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,950
water first then lava but the water will
slow down their their fall so then they

150
00:04:59,950 --> 00:04:59,960
slow down their their fall so then they
 

151
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,939
slow down their their fall so then they
will just burn here a little bit longer

152
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:02,949
will just burn here a little bit longer
 

153
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:10,149
will just burn here a little bit longer
if you want a show I guess or if you

154
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:10,159
if you want a show I guess or if you
 

155
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,739
if you want a show I guess or if you
enjoy that kind of thing torturing

156
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:11,749
enjoy that kind of thing torturing
 

157
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:19,350
enjoy that kind of thing torturing
animals and that works good for you umm

158
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
animals and that works good for you umm
 

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:30,519
animals and that works good for you umm
what else yeah the pigs the lava if we

160
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:30,529
what else yeah the pigs the lava if we
 

161
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,309
what else yeah the pigs the lava if we
have the lava above here then you get

162
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:33,319
have the lava above here then you get
 

163
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,139
have the lava above here then you get
the roasted pork chops because they fall

164

00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,730
the roasted pork chops because they fall
through the lava but they died from

166
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:39,740
through the lava but they died from
 

167
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,709
through the lava but they died from
gravity pretty much instantly but since

168
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:41,719
gravity pretty much instantly but since
 

169
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,679
gravity pretty much instantly but since
they're on fire they still drop roasted

170
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:44,689
they're on fire they still drop roasted
 

171
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,800
they're on fire they still drop roasted
pork chops cooked pork chops I should

172
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:47,810
pork chops cooked pork chops I should
 

173
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:55,920
pork chops cooked pork chops I should
say just like that if we get rid of this

174
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:55,930

 

175
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,699

now the lab is gone we get to uncooked

176
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:00,709
now the lab is gone we get to uncooked
 

177
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:07,899
now the lab is gone we get to uncooked
pork chops just like that that's good

178
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:07,909
pork chops just like that that's good
 

179
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,290
pork chops just like that that's good
because wolves need uncooked pork chops

180
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:11,300
because wolves need uncooked pork chops
 

181
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,480
because wolves need uncooked pork chops
you have to you can't feed them the

182
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,490
you have to you can't feed them the
 

183
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,119
you have to you can't feed them the
cooked ones so there is some point to

184
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:16,129
cooked ones so there is some point to
 

185
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:23,110
cooked ones so there is some point to
that and what else what else everything

186
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
that and what else what else everything
 

187
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,730
that and what else what else everything
else works much the same the pressure is

188
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:24,740
else works much the same the pressure is
 

189
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,110
else works much the same the pressure is
different for the pigs because their

190
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,120
different for the pigs because their
 

191
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,799
different for the pigs because their
border

192
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:32,809

 

193
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:37,670

seems to work perfectly though pretty

194
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
seems to work perfectly though pretty
 

195
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,019
seems to work perfectly though pretty
much Jeremy if I said this but this

196
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:42,029
much Jeremy if I said this but this
 

197
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,510
much Jeremy if I said this but this
lever here is hooked up to anything it's

198
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,520
lever here is hooked up to anything it's
 

199
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:52,010
lever here is hooked up to anything it's
just to bounce up the look and what else

200
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,020
just to bounce up the look and what else
 

201
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,689
just to bounce up the look and what else
what else I really liked how it looks in

202
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:53,699
what else I really liked how it looks in
 

203
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,409
what else I really liked how it looks in
here right now

204
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:54,419
here right now
 

205
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:03,670
here right now
it's pretty cool very technical looking

206
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680

 

207
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,689

you might be wondering where the

208
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:05,699
you might be wondering where the
 

209
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:13,730
you might be wondering where the
chickens are what I'm doing right now is

210
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:13,740
chickens are what I'm doing right now is
 

211
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,189
chickens are what I'm doing right now is
I have my plan is to hook this lever up

212
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:18,199
I have my plan is to hook this lever up
 

213
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,189
I have my plan is to hook this lever up
to what go up to the top here to

214
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
to what go up to the top here to
 

215
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,549
to what go up to the top here to
something I have set up right now

216
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:24,559
something I have set up right now
 

217
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,959
something I have set up right now
because we don't need a water break for

218
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:26,969
because we don't need a water break for
 

219
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:29,749
because we don't need a water break for
chickens so I'm gonna have the wire go

220
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
chickens so I'm gonna have the wire go
 

221
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,360
chickens so I'm gonna have the wire go
up to this thing here which is killing

222
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,370
up to this thing here which is killing
 

223
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,179
up to this thing here which is killing
them a lot quicker than if they were to

224
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:40,189

 

225
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:45,469

follow the stream all the way here then

226
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:45,479
follow the stream all the way here then
 

227
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:53,559
follow the stream all the way here then
they slowly float down to the bottom

228
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:53,569

 

229
00:07:53,569 --> 00:08:00,199

like that so having that chilling thing

230
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,209
like that so having that chilling thing
 

231
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,050
like that so having that chilling thing
up there for them just greatly speeds up

232
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,060
up there for them just greatly speeds up
 

233
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,480
up there for them just greatly speeds up
the time it takes to kill them and if

234
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,490
the time it takes to kill them and if
 

235
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,820
the time it takes to kill them and if
you do that then you get two sheep and

236
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:07,830
you do that then you get two sheep and
 

237
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:18,529
you do that then you get two sheep and
cows and pigs a lot faster oh yeah that

238
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:18,539
cows and pigs a lot faster oh yeah that
 

239
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,300
cows and pigs a lot faster oh yeah that
drowner for the pigs what I might do is

240
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,310
drowner for the pigs what I might do is
 

241
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,740
drowner for the pigs what I might do is
I might replace

242
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:28,750
I might replace
 

243
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,290
I might replace
this snow block here with the fence that

244
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:32,300
this snow block here with the fence that
 

245
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,009
this snow block here with the fence that
way when the water comes down items will

246
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:36,019
way when the water comes down items will
 

247
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:38,469
way when the water comes down items will
be able to flow with the water but the

248
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
be able to flow with the water but the
 

249
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,269
be able to flow with the water but the
pigs won't be able to fit between the

250
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
pigs won't be able to fit between the
 

251
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,069
pigs won't be able to fit between the
fence and the glass like they are right

252
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:45,079
fence and the glass like they are right
 

253
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:58,660
fence and the glass like they are right
now okay what else just eating up all my

254
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,670
now okay what else just eating up all my
 

255
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,759
now okay what else just eating up all my
episode of time today focusing on this

256
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:02,769
episode of time today focusing on this
 

257
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:12,610
episode of time today focusing on this
but it's important yeah okay yeah the

258
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:12,620
but it's important yeah okay yeah the
 

259
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,750
but it's important yeah okay yeah the
chickens if we want to collect chickens

260
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:16,760
chickens if we want to collect chickens
 

261
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,180
chickens if we want to collect chickens
in here then we have the pig set to

262
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,190
in here then we have the pig set to
 

263
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,090
in here then we have the pig set to
dying and the sheep and cows at dying

264
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,100
dying and the sheep and cows at dying
 

265
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,900
dying and the sheep and cows at dying
and eventually this will fill up with

266
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:28,910
and eventually this will fill up with
 

267
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,400
and eventually this will fill up with
chickens because they're the only ones

268
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,410
chickens because they're the only ones
 

269
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,050
chickens because they're the only ones
that aren't being killed and if you do

270
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,060
that aren't being killed and if you do
 

271
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
that aren't being killed and if you do
that then they'll lay eggs in here so

272
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,070
that then they'll lay eggs in here so
 

273
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,920
that then they'll lay eggs in here so
this doubles as an egg farm and if we

274
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:41,930
this doubles as an egg farm and if we
 

275
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,660
this doubles as an egg farm and if we
want well I'll show you the pressure

276
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:48,670
want well I'll show you the pressure
 

277
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,780
want well I'll show you the pressure
seems okay get all the same options you

278
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:52,790
seems okay get all the same options you
 

279
00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:01,590
seems okay get all the same options you
got the lappa and you have the water and

280
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600

 

281
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,699

you have opening blow doors open

282
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:09,709
you have opening blow doors open
 

283
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,179
you have opening blow doors open
if you want to free them for some reason

284
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:13,189
if you want to free them for some reason
 

285
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:19,910
if you want to free them for some reason
if you have the drowner sets the

286
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
if you have the drowner sets the
 

287
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,889
if you have the drowner sets the
chickens will float down and they'll

288
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:21,899
chickens will float down and they'll
 

289
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,549
chickens will float down and they'll
stay in the water like up at the top of

290
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:25,559
stay in the water like up at the top of
 

291
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,389
stay in the water like up at the top of
the water in the lay eggs eggs will fall

292
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:29,399
the water in the lay eggs eggs will fall
 

293
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,689
the water in the lay eggs eggs will fall
down into this water stream and then

294
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:31,699
down into this water stream and then
 

295
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,860
down into this water stream and then
they'll float to the main collection

296
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:33,870
they'll float to the main collection
 

297
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,660
they'll float to the main collection
area so you can have an auto egg farm as

298
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:38,670
area so you can have an auto egg farm as
 

299
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,840
area so you can have an auto egg farm as
well you can see there's a chicken stuck

300
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:44,850
well you can see there's a chicken stuck
 

301
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,400
well you can see there's a chicken stuck
there so he won't die there the lay eggs

302
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,410
there so he won't die there the lay eggs
 

303
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,100
there so he won't die there the lay eggs
eggs will fall down into the water go to

304
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,110
eggs will fall down into the water go to
 

305
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:58,040
eggs will fall down into the water go to
the main stream right okay

306
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,050
the main stream right okay
 

307
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:05,360
the main stream right okay
so I think I covered everything right

308
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,370
so I think I covered everything right
 

309
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,530
so I think I covered everything right
now it looks kind of ugly

310
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:06,540
now it looks kind of ugly
 

311
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,160
now it looks kind of ugly
I plan on covering this all up

312
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,170
I plan on covering this all up
 

313
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,840
I plan on covering this all up
everything directly above these levers

314
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:11,850
everything directly above these levers
 

315
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,889
everything directly above these levers
here so you won't see this weird stuff

316
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:15,899
here so you won't see this weird stuff
 

317
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,669
here so you won't see this weird stuff
and I'll try to make all this look a lot

318
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:19,679
and I'll try to make all this look a lot
 

319
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,069
and I'll try to make all this look a lot
better when it's done but first we want

320
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
better when it's done but first we want
 

321
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,009
better when it's done but first we want
to figure out exactly how we're gonna do

322
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:25,019
to figure out exactly how we're gonna do
 

323
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:36,110
to figure out exactly how we're gonna do
this unfortunately we don't have any

324
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,120
this unfortunately we don't have any
 

325
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:44,120
this unfortunately we don't have any
wolves I'm very disappointed about that

326
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,130

 

327
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,199

you know wolves

328
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:46,209
you know wolves
 

329
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:53,030
you know wolves
so that's too bad what happened is

330
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
so that's too bad what happened is
 

331
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,710
so that's too bad what happened is
before I even started building all this

332
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:55,720
before I even started building all this
 

333
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,840
before I even started building all this
stuff I that was one of the things I

334
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:57,850
stuff I that was one of the things I
 

335
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,000
stuff I that was one of the things I
checked for to make sure wolves would

336
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,010
checked for to make sure wolves would
 

337
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:08,960
checked for to make sure wolves would
spawn in this area it's just to day here

338
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:08,970

 

339
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,300

sleeping on the clay yeah I checked for

340
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,310
sleeping on the clay yeah I checked for
 

341
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,370
sleeping on the clay yeah I checked for
wolves originally and I did see them

342
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:19,380
wolves originally and I did see them
 

343
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:26,689
wolves originally and I did see them
what happened was I saw them let's see

344
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:26,699
what happened was I saw them let's see
 

345
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:30,720
what happened was I saw them let's see
opposite side over here that island we

346
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:30,730
opposite side over here that island we
 

347
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,060
opposite side over here that island we
blew up I saw them spawning on there ah

348
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,070

 

349
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:44,870

come on load you chunks load so directly

350
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880

 

351
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,850

this is where the island started I saw

352
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:47,860
this is where the island started I saw
 

353
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,750
this is where the island started I saw
wolves spawning here right here so less

354
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
wolves spawning here right here so less
 

355
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,150
wolves spawning here right here so less
then Oh probably 20 blocks away or so 30

356
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,160
then Oh probably 20 blocks away or so 30
 

357
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:04,579
then Oh probably 20 blocks away or so 30
blocks so that's kind of a disappointing

358
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:04,589

 

359
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:07,199

excuse me I got to stop gonna cough

360
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,209
excuse me I got to stop gonna cough
 

361
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,900
excuse me I got to stop gonna cough
really bad here

362
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:10,910

 

363
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,129

yeah so if I ever seems like I'm

364
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:13,139
yeah so if I ever seems like I'm
 

365
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,410
yeah so if I ever seems like I'm
stumbling with my words part of it's

366
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:15,420
stumbling with my words part of it's
 

367
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,240
stumbling with my words part of it's
probably because I'm an idiot

368
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,250
probably because I'm an idiot
 

369
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,519
probably because I'm an idiot
and I don't know how to speak the other

370
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:19,529
and I don't know how to speak the other
 

371
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,369
and I don't know how to speak the other
part time probably got something in my

372
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:22,379
part time probably got something in my
 

373
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,809
part time probably got something in my
throat because I'm still getting over

374
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:23,819
throat because I'm still getting over
 

375
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:27,439
throat because I'm still getting over
that cold I had and it feels like I got

376
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:27,449
that cold I had and it feels like I got
 

377
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:33,019
that cold I had and it feels like I got
junk in my lungs still anyway yeah so

378
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:33,029
junk in my lungs still anyway yeah so
 

379
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,970
junk in my lungs still anyway yeah so
about 20 30 blocks away from here we

380
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:34,980
about 20 30 blocks away from here we
 

381
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,679
about 20 30 blocks away from here we
could have had wolf spawning if the

382
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:36,689
could have had wolf spawning if the
 

383
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:40,090
could have had wolf spawning if the
spawning pads just ended out that far

384
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,100
spawning pads just ended out that far
 

385
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,199
spawning pads just ended out that far
unfortunately they don't there are some

386
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,209
unfortunately they don't there are some
 

387
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:52,809
unfortunately they don't there are some
advantages to this so it's down here

388
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:52,819

 

389
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:55,970

so since wolves aren't spawning that

390
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:55,980
so since wolves aren't spawning that
 

391
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,480
so since wolves aren't spawning that
means we get more cows more sheep more

392
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,490
means we get more cows more sheep more
 

393
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,439
means we get more cows more sheep more
pigs more chickens a lot quicker because

394
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:03,449
pigs more chickens a lot quicker because
 

395
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,170
pigs more chickens a lot quicker because
we don't do that we don't have wolves to

396
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,180
we don't do that we don't have wolves to
 

397
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,999
we don't do that we don't have wolves to
deal with so we get other mobs instead

398
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:10,009
deal with so we get other mobs instead
 

399
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:14,179
deal with so we get other mobs instead
and this is good because wolves don't

400
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:14,189
and this is good because wolves don't
 

401
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:18,290
and this is good because wolves don't
drop anything so we don't necessarily

402
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:18,300
drop anything so we don't necessarily
 

403
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,720
drop anything so we don't necessarily
want them spawning if they're not

404
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:20,730
want them spawning if they're not
 

405
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,590
want them spawning if they're not
providing anything so that's kind of

406
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:24,600
providing anything so that's kind of
 

407
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,749
providing anything so that's kind of
good that they don't spawn here kind of

408
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:26,759
good that they don't spawn here kind of
 

409
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,840
good that they don't spawn here kind of
sucks though because you know I got this

410
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:29,850
sucks though because you know I got this
 

411
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,110
sucks though because you know I got this
all set up for them I wanted to show it

412
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
all set up for them I wanted to show it
 

413
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,980
all set up for them I wanted to show it
in action and it's not happening what we

414
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:36,990
in action and it's not happening what we
 

415
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,619
in action and it's not happening what we
could do you know that useless future we

416
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:42,629
could do you know that useless future we
 

417
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:44,600
could do you know that useless future we
have on our passive spawning pants this

418
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:44,610
have on our passive spawning pants this
 

419
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,619
have on our passive spawning pants this
shut to shut them down at all I don't

420
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:48,629
shut to shut them down at all I don't
 

421
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,519
shut to shut them down at all I don't
want to go up there again we can shut

422
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:52,529
want to go up there again we can shut
 

423
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,790
want to go up there again we can shut
off the passive spawning pads and we can

424
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:55,800
off the passive spawning pads and we can
 

425
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,329
off the passive spawning pads and we can
have a second passive spawning pad if we

426
00:14:59,329 --> 00:14:59,339
have a second passive spawning pad if we
 

427
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,720
have a second passive spawning pad if we
want or a third or a fourth as long as

428
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:02,730
want or a third or a fourth as long as
 

429
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,579
want or a third or a fourth as long as
we're able to shut them off we can have

430
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:04,589
we're able to shut them off we can have
 

431
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:08,929
we're able to shut them off we can have
more so that useless feature is starting

432
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:08,939
more so that useless feature is starting
 

433
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:15,410
more so that useless feature is starting
to have some potential now in my eyes so

434
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:15,420
to have some potential now in my eyes so
 

435
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,990
to have some potential now in my eyes so
for example we could build

436
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000

 

437
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,630

it doesn't even have to be spawning pads

438
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:22,640
it doesn't even have to be spawning pads
 

439
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,030
it doesn't even have to be spawning pads
it could just be a nice park area a

440
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
it could just be a nice park area a
 

441
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,570
it could just be a nice park area a
patch of grass over here that we can

442
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:28,580
patch of grass over here that we can
 

443
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,420
patch of grass over here that we can
flood with water to and we could switch

444
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,430
flood with water to and we could switch
 

445
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,690
flood with water to and we could switch
between having them spawn here or spawn

446
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:34,700
between having them spawn here or spawn
 

447
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,410
between having them spawn here or spawn
up there or spawn it both whatever you

448
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:38,420
up there or spawn it both whatever you
 

449
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,170
up there or spawn it both whatever you
know and that way we could get wolves

450
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,180
know and that way we could get wolves
 

451
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,280
know and that way we could get wolves
over here because I'm sue me this

452
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,290
over here because I'm sue me this
 

453
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,460
over here because I'm sue me this
building is gonna extend this far so

454
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:48,470
building is gonna extend this far so
 

455
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,020
building is gonna extend this far so
that's one possibility

456
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,030
that's one possibility
 

457
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:57,850
that's one possibility
oh I got a cough again oh yeah I'm gonna

458
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:57,860
oh I got a cough again oh yeah I'm gonna
 

459
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,500
oh I got a cough again oh yeah I'm gonna
pause here alright so I thought I'd show

460
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,510
pause here alright so I thought I'd show
 

461
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,680
pause here alright so I thought I'd show
the chicken farm egg farm in action here

462
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:05,690
the chicken farm egg farm in action here
 

463
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,580
the chicken farm egg farm in action here
we got about no probably twelve chickens

464
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:09,590
we got about no probably twelve chickens
 

465
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,190
we got about no probably twelve chickens
or so in there right now and they're

466
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,200
or so in there right now and they're
 

467
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,180
or so in there right now and they're
laying eggs chicken lays an egg every

468
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,190
laying eggs chicken lays an egg every
 

469
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:22,480
laying eggs chicken lays an egg every
five minutes and we have our Pig set to

470
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,490
five minutes and we have our Pig set to
 

471
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,020
five minutes and we have our Pig set to
dying and our cows and sheep set to

472
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,030
dying and our cows and sheep set to
 

473
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:31,600
dying and our cows and sheep set to
dying so if if they spawn on the

474
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:31,610
dying so if if they spawn on the
 

475
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,730
dying so if if they spawn on the
spawning pads they'll die and they'll

476
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:33,740
spawning pads they'll die and they'll
 

477
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,560
spawning pads they'll die and they'll
keep dying until eventually chickens

478
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,570
keep dying until eventually chickens
 

479
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,720
keep dying until eventually chickens
spawn and when chickens spawn they'll go

480
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:37,730
spawn and when chickens spawn they'll go
 

481
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,820
spawn and when chickens spawn they'll go
to this tube and slowly we keep getting

482
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:42,830
to this tube and slowly we keep getting
 

483
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,829
to this tube and slowly we keep getting
more and more chickens and fewer and

484
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:44,839
more and more chickens and fewer and
 

485
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,650
more and more chickens and fewer and
fewer of the other moms right now we

486
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:47,660
fewer of the other moms right now we
 

487
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,770
fewer of the other moms right now we
only have three mobs up on our spawning

488
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:50,780
only have three mobs up on our spawning
 

489
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,180
only have three mobs up on our spawning
pads so they're greatly slowed down

490
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,190
pads so they're greatly slowed down
 

491
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,370
pads so they're greatly slowed down
right now as we reach the passive mob

492
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:00,380
right now as we reach the passive mob
 

493
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,020
right now as we reach the passive mob
limit because we have all these chickens

494
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,030
limit because we have all these chickens
 

495
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:07,449
limit because we have all these chickens
here normally there's about ten to

496
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:07,459
here normally there's about ten to
 

497
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,780
here normally there's about ten to
fifteen mobs on our spawning pads

498
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:09,790
fifteen mobs on our spawning pads
 

499
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,150
fifteen mobs on our spawning pads
having a spawning pads that are 300

500
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,160
having a spawning pads that are 300
 

501
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,870
having a spawning pads that are 300
blocks in size seem to are not spawning

502
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
blocks in size seem to are not spawning
 

503
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,179
blocks in size seem to are not spawning
pets but spawning systems that are 300

504
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:19,189
pets but spawning systems that are 300
 

505
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:22,630
pets but spawning systems that are 300
blocks in size for passive mobs seems to

506
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
blocks in size for passive mobs seems to
 

507
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,660
blocks in size for passive mobs seems to
work really well it seems to keep up

508
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:25,670
work really well it seems to keep up
 

509
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,159
work really well it seems to keep up
pretty good at the rate I'm killing them

510
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:30,169

 

511
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:33,529

yeah so eventually we'll have all

512
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:33,539
yeah so eventually we'll have all
 

513
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:35,060
yeah so eventually we'll have all
chickens and no other mobs will be

514
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,070
chickens and no other mobs will be
 

515
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,720
chickens and no other mobs will be
spawning up there and we'll have about

516
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:38,730
spawning up there and we'll have about
 

517
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,639
spawning up there and we'll have about
15 chickens in here or so and that

518
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:43,649
15 chickens in here or so and that
 

519
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:46,580
15 chickens in here or so and that
averages out to an egg every 20 seconds

520
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:46,590
averages out to an egg every 20 seconds
 

521
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,279
averages out to an egg every 20 seconds
or so and they float on top of the water

522
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:52,289
or so and they float on top of the water
 

523
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:55,190
or so and they float on top of the water
if we have the stream running eggs show

524
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
if we have the stream running eggs show
 

525
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,690
if we have the stream running eggs show
up here at our main collection area just

526
00:17:59,690 --> 00:17:59,700
up here at our main collection area just
 

527
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:06,830
up here at our main collection area just
got 9 eggs if we don't want them to show

528
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:06,840
got 9 eggs if we don't want them to show
 

529
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,489
got 9 eggs if we don't want them to show
up there we close this up we have to

530
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:13,499
up there we close this up we have to
 

531
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:16,310
up there we close this up we have to
have this top one up like that because

532
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
have this top one up like that because
 

533
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,769
have this top one up like that because
otherwise it's possible for the eggs to

534
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:18,779
otherwise it's possible for the eggs to
 

535
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:28,369
otherwise it's possible for the eggs to
get stuck on the piston there another

536
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:28,379
get stuck on the piston there another
 

537
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:32,049
get stuck on the piston there another
option would be to have the chickens oh

538
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:32,059
option would be to have the chickens oh
 

539
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:34,489
option would be to have the chickens oh
yeah we don't have a winery

540
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:34,499
yeah we don't have a winery
 

541
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:44,269
yeah we don't have a winery
nevermind or we can just have them down

542
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:44,279
nevermind or we can just have them down
 

543
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,739
nevermind or we can just have them down
here and having lay eggs down here that

544
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:48,749
here and having lay eggs down here that
 

545
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:55,580
here and having lay eggs down here that
works too yeah so that's how we hipped

546
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:55,590
works too yeah so that's how we hipped
 

547
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:02,960
works too yeah so that's how we hipped
and have an egg farm and there's no way

550
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:04,889
of auto killing the chickens to get
 

551
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:10,249

would be good if I could but I don't

556
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:14,669
would be good if I could but I don't

561
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,549

yeah I got some key thing to do with the

562
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
yeah I got some key thing to do with the
 

563
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,619
yeah I got some key thing to do with the
system yet anyway

564
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:46,629

 

565
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,849

alright so most of the time I'm gonna

566
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:48,859
alright so most of the time I'm gonna
 

567
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:50,649
alright so most of the time I'm gonna
have this set so let the chickens just

568
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:50,659
have this set so let the chickens just
 

569
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,499
have this set so let the chickens just
die up at the top there at that lab a

570
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:53,509
die up at the top there at that lab a
 

571
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,080
die up at the top there at that lab a
switch because we don't really need them

572
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,090
switch because we don't really need them
 

573
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,269
switch because we don't really need them
for anything they're kind of kind of

574
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:58,279
for anything they're kind of kind of
 

575
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,349
for anything they're kind of kind of
like wolves they're pretty much useless

576
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:01,359
like wolves they're pretty much useless
 

577
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,690
like wolves they're pretty much useless
for their drops anyway we don't need

578
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:04,700
for their drops anyway we don't need
 

579
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,789
for their drops anyway we don't need
feathers from them really because

580
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
feathers from them really because
 

581
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,830
feathers from them really because
feathers are one of the mostly useless

582
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:08,840
feathers are one of the mostly useless
 

583
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,889
feathers are one of the mostly useless
items in the game and also we're gonna

584
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:11,899
items in the game and also we're gonna
 

585
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:14,529
items in the game and also we're gonna
get tons of feathers from zombies when

586
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:14,539
get tons of feathers from zombies when
 

587
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:17,830
get tons of feathers from zombies when
we set up bar our hostile spawning

588
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
we set up bar our hostile spawning
 

589
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,129
we set up bar our hostile spawning
system on this side so the only thing we

590
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:21,139
system on this side so the only thing we
 

591
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:23,499
system on this side so the only thing we
really need from chickens is eggs

592
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:23,509
really need from chickens is eggs
 

593
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:27,669
really need from chickens is eggs
every once in a while maybe so we want

594
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
every once in a while maybe so we want
 

595
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,749
every once in a while maybe so we want
to get rid of them as quick as possible

00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:28,759
to get rid of them as quick as possible
 

597
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,640
to get rid of them as quick as possible
at the top there

598
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:32,650
at the top there
 

599
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,770
at the top there
pigs probably have it this setting most

600
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:34,780
pigs probably have it this setting most
 

601
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,920
pigs probably have it this setting most
of time I'll have the floor open if I

602
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:37,930
of time I'll have the floor open if I
 

603
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,620
of time I'll have the floor open if I
don't want the extra leg those 30 or 40

pork chops will cause me and then we
 

607
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,110
pork chops will cause me and then we
have these guys most of time I'll just

608

have these guys most of time I'll just
 

609
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,480
have these guys most of time I'll just
have them falling to their death so I

610
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,490
have them falling to their death so I
 

611
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,550
have them falling to their death so I
can collect the wall on that but if we

612
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:56,560
can collect the wall on that but if we
 

613
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:08,480
can collect the wall on that but if we
want to we want to man it out we want to

614

there's a few different ways we can that

622
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:20,890
there's a few different ways we can that
 

623
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,960
there's a few different ways we can that
die them this first way is pretty funny

624
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:24,970
die them this first way is pretty funny
 

625
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,750
die them this first way is pretty funny
and I think you guys are gonna like this

626
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:26,760
and I think you guys are gonna like this
 

627
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,620
and I think you guys are gonna like this
we open up our top and they just come

628
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:31,630
we open up our top and they just come
 

629
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,460
we open up our top and they just come
flying out and then we can shear them

630
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:35,470
flying out and then we can shear them
 

631
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:42,090
flying out and then we can shear them
kill them doesn't happen every time but

632
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,100
kill them doesn't happen every time but
 

633
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,310
kill them doesn't happen every time but
a lot of the times

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,320
a lot of the times
 

635
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,740
a lot of the times
that bunch will fly out which is kind of

636
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:49,750
that bunch will fly out which is kind of
 

637
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,270
that bunch will fly out which is kind of
nice you don't want them all flying out

638
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
nice you don't want them all flying out
 

639
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
nice you don't want them all flying out
probably

640
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:55,850

 

641
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,730

oops ah ding so you can deal with a few

642
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:01,740
oops ah ding so you can deal with a few
 

643
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,810
oops ah ding so you can deal with a few
at a time doing it that way

644
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:02,820
at a time doing it that way
 

645
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:14,210
at a time doing it that way
which is nice another way of doing it is

646
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,220
which is nice another way of doing it is
 

647
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,330
which is nice another way of doing it is
just to leave it open

648
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:16,340
just to leave it open
 

649
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:25,820
just to leave it open
oops and then try them through this

650
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,830
oops and then try them through this
 

651
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,510
oops and then try them through this
opening

652
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:26,520
opening
 

653
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,950
opening
well that's very hard to do you have to

654
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:29,960
well that's very hard to do you have to
 

655
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,020
well that's very hard to do you have to
hold down the right click and move your

656
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,030
hold down the right click and move your
 

657
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,400
hold down the right click and move your
mouse around and you'll get a few

658
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,410
mouse around and you'll get a few
 

659
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,510
mouse around and you'll get a few
another thing you can do is just let

660
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:38,520
another thing you can do is just let
 

661
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,470
another thing you can do is just let
them all free roam that's a kind of hard

662
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:45,480
them all free roam that's a kind of hard
 

663
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,550
them all free roam that's a kind of hard
to deal with them when they're all out

664
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:51,560

 

665
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,110

because they like to wander places they

666
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,120
because they like to wander places they
 

667
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,750
because they like to wander places they
shouldn't go like this guys doing

668
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:56,760
shouldn't go like this guys doing
 

669
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,790
shouldn't go like this guys doing
and then you might not catch them of

670
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:01,800
and then you might not catch them of
 

671
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,140
and then you might not catch them of
course this will be more closed off

672
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,150
course this will be more closed off
 

673
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:09,500
course this will be more closed off
later when I gets lab more finished

674
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,510

 

675
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:19,580

oh look there's one more J but the best

676
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:19,590
oh look there's one more J but the best
 

677
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,770
oh look there's one more J but the best
way I found of dealing with them and

678
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,780
way I found of dealing with them and
 

679
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:32,780
way I found of dealing with them and
simply get rid of these guys I have this

680
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:32,790
simply get rid of these guys I have this
 

681
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,880
simply get rid of these guys I have this
open have this thing empty just deal

682
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:37,890
open have this thing empty just deal
 

683
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,600
open have this thing empty just deal
with them one at a time if you can you

684
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,610
with them one at a time if you can you
 

685
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,400
with them one at a time if you can you
gotta be fast though and have your die

686
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,410
gotta be fast though and have your die
 

687
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:52,160
gotta be fast though and have your die
your shears and your sword equipped Jeep

688
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,170
your shears and your sword equipped Jeep
 

689
00:23:52,170 --> 00:24:05,560

here that's too slow there we go just

690
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,570

 

691
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,440

like that is the best way I found of

692
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,450
like that is the best way I found of
 

693
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,460
like that is the best way I found of
doing it quickly with the least amount

694
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:13,470
doing it quickly with the least amount
 

695
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:21,670
doing it quickly with the least amount
of stress of chasing them down and stuff

696
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:21,680

 

697
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:32,710

get some black this works pretty good

698
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720

 

699
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,110

one more come on if you share them you

700
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,120
one more come on if you share them you
 

701
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,380
one more come on if you share them you
get more wool it's another nice thing

702
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,390
get more wool it's another nice thing
 

703
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,660
get more wool it's another nice thing
save only getting one gets between two

704
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:41,670
save only getting one gets between two
 

705
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,550
save only getting one gets between two
and four fatale Falls just kill it

706
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:45,560
and four fatale Falls just kill it
 

707
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,530
and four fatale Falls just kill it
um excuse me I was maybe thinking of

708
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:51,540
um excuse me I was maybe thinking of
 

709
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,980
um excuse me I was maybe thinking of
raising that water break so you can kill

710
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:54,990
raising that water break so you can kill
 

711
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,750
raising that water break so you can kill
them simply by punching them instead of

712
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:56,760
them simply by punching them instead of
 

713
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,650
them simply by punching them instead of
using a sword

714
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:57,660
using a sword
 

715

I don't know fail if I do that it

716
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:00,870
I don't know fail if I do that it
 

717
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,760
I don't know fail if I do that it
probably won't work 100% anyway like

718
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:04,770
probably won't work 100% anyway like
 

719
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,010
probably won't work 100% anyway like
some you might have to punch twice or

720
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,020
some you might have to punch twice or
 

721
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,980
some you might have to punch twice or
three times

722
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:09,990

 

723
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,680

um you know I never tried milking them

724
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:15,690
um you know I never tried milking them
 

725
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,250
um you know I never tried milking them
maybe I'm gonna let I'm gonna let some

726
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:20,260
maybe I'm gonna let I'm gonna let some
 

727

all right here we go we're gonna try see
if we can milk the cows when they're all

734
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,370
if we can milk the cows when they're all
 

735
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,240
if we can milk the cows when they're all
grouped together like this at the top

736
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,250

 

737
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:41,730

holding rights mostly seems to try every

738
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:41,740
holding rights mostly seems to try every

00:25:41,740 --> 00:26:00,900
holding rights mostly seems to try every
so often the bucket goes like that it's

740
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:00,910
so often the bucket goes like that it's
 

741
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,570
so often the bucket goes like that it's
not very effective actually pressing the

742
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:06,580
not very effective actually pressing the
 

743
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:13,860
not very effective actually pressing the

to work maybe you've tried in the water

746
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,330
to work maybe you've tried in the water
 

747
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:24,570
to work maybe you've tried in the water
on much more effective still not any

748
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:24,580
on much more effective still not any
 

749
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,290
on much more effective still not any
milk though

750
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:29,300

 

751
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:37,210

it's it's going a lot more often okay

752
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:37,220
it's it's going a lot more often okay
 

753
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,080
it's it's going a lot more often okay
oops sorry guys let's try with the

754
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,090
oops sorry guys let's try with the
 

755
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:51,220
oops sorry guys let's try with the
bottom open doesn't seem to be

756
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,230
bottom open doesn't seem to be
 

757
00:26:51,230 --> 00:27:02,800
bottom open doesn't seem to be
activating from water it can't seem to

758
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:02,810
activating from water it can't seem to
 

759
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:09,330
activating from water it can't seem to
do it with the bottom glass block down

760
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:09,340

 

761
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,290

of course you can probably do it when

762
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:11,300
of course you can probably do it when
 

763
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:20,040
of course you can probably do it when
they're free-roaming that's much better

764
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,050

 

765
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:38,320

there's supposed to be a trick to it

766
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,330

 

767
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,840

come on

768
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:40,850
come on
 

769
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:48,080
come on
want some milk yes this is one part of

770
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,090
want some milk yes this is one part of
 

771
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,730
want some milk yes this is one part of
the game I've never really figured out

772
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:49,740
the game I've never really figured out
 

773
00:27:49,740 --> 00:28:00,350
the game I've never really figured out
is how to get milk oh I had some I think

774
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,360
is how to get milk oh I had some I think
 

775
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,500
is how to get milk oh I had some I think
I just had some more yeah Ariel why am I

776
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:03,510
I just had some more yeah Ariel why am I
 

777
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,529
I just had some more yeah Ariel why am I
getting it now you got a milk the butter

778
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:06,539
getting it now you got a milk the butter
 

779
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,700
getting it now you got a milk the butter
are you kidding me

780
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:09,710

 

781
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:20,289

you have to milk the button why not why

782
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:20,299
you have to milk the button why not why
 

783
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,789
you have to milk the button why not why
it doesn't work if you click on the pink

784
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
it doesn't work if you click on the pink
 

785
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:31,490
it doesn't work if you click on the pink
thing you gotta milk the button it works

786
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:31,500
thing you gotta milk the button it works
 

787
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:57,810
thing you gotta milk the button it works
100% okay very strange

788
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:57,820

 

789
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:06,460

okay very interesting design choice by

790
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:06,470
okay very interesting design choice by
 

791
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,450
okay very interesting design choice by
knotch anyway I guess we're gonna end

792
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:10,460
knotch anyway I guess we're gonna end
 

793
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,770
knotch anyway I guess we're gonna end
the episode here

794
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:11,780
the episode here
 

795
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,890
the episode here
that's the MP units I didn't get to the

796
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:14,900
that's the MP units I didn't get to the
 

797
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,340
that's the MP units I didn't get to the
spider spawning in this episode but

798
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,350
spider spawning in this episode but
 

799
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,680
spider spawning in this episode but
we'll probably focus the whole next

800
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:20,690
we'll probably focus the whole next
 

801
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:27,580
we'll probably focus the whole next
episode on that and I'm gonna work out

802
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:27,590
episode on that and I'm gonna work out
 

803
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,750
episode on that and I'm gonna work out
some designs for it a little bit and

804
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:30,760
some designs for it a little bit and
 

805
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,370
some designs for it a little bit and
they'll be a little bit challenging

806
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:33,380
they'll be a little bit challenging
 

807
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,170
they'll be a little bit challenging
because if nobody's really built any

808
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:35,180
because if nobody's really built any
 

809
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,870
because if nobody's really built any
spider only spawning systems yet like

810
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
spider only spawning systems yet like
 

811
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,270
