00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:40,610
in here them
 

327
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:55,980
in here them
oh they're fast holy No hey okay whoo

328
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:55,990

 

329
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,110

yes I had no idea was happening because

330
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
yes I had no idea was happening because
 

331
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,540
yes I had no idea was happening because
I thought for one thing they wouldn't

332
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:01,550
I thought for one thing they wouldn't
 

333
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,300
I thought for one thing they wouldn't
spawn this biome because I think this is

334
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,310
spawn this biome because I think this is
 

335
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:11,640
spawn this biome because I think this is
a swamp biome and yet they seem to and

336
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:11,650
a swamp biome and yet they seem to and
 

337
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,780
a swamp biome and yet they seem to and
the other thing is it seemed like they

338
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:13,790
the other thing is it seemed like they
 

339
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,430
the other thing is it seemed like they
were spawning in my house which didn't

340
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
were spawning in my house which didn't
 

341
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,830
were spawning in my house which didn't
make sense at all because I thought they

342
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:17,840
make sense at all because I thought they
 

343
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:29,920
make sense at all because I thought they
would have to spawn off grass and

344
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:29,930

 

345
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,340

oh yeah so then I went on YouTube and

346
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,350
oh yeah so then I went on YouTube and
 

347
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,139
oh yeah so then I went on YouTube and
someone sent me a video showing he had

348
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:38,149
someone sent me a video showing he had
 

349
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:46,570
someone sent me a video showing he had
my world and he made a video of wolves

350
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:46,580
my world and he made a video of wolves
 

351
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,449
my world and he made a video of wolves
going through the pig separator not

352
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:52,459
going through the pig separator not
 

353
00:16:52,459 --> 00:17:01,630
going through the pig separator not
there's a wolf yes that's what's

354
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:01,640
there's a wolf yes that's what's
 

355
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,340
there's a wolf yes that's what's
happening so in his video he has my old

356
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:05,350
happening so in his video he has my old
 

357
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,699
happening so in his video he has my old
save though where this wasn't all set up

358
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:09,709
save though where this wasn't all set up
 

359
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,630
save though where this wasn't all set up
but he showed me that they fit through

360
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
but he showed me that they fit through
 

361
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,260
but he showed me that they fit through
the one high area for the pigs and just

362
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,270
the one high area for the pigs and just
 

363
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,620
the one high area for the pigs and just
by chance when I team up here I saw a

364
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:19,630
by chance when I team up here I saw a
 

365
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,809
by chance when I team up here I saw a
wolf in the big separator and saw what

366
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:22,819
wolf in the big separator and saw what
 

367
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,949
wolf in the big separator and saw what
was happening there smaller than a pig

368
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
was happening there smaller than a pig
 

369
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,740
was happening there smaller than a pig
so they don't get stuck at this spot

370
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:29,750
so they don't get stuck at this spot
 

371
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,520
so they don't get stuck at this spot
where the lava is so they don't die they

372
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,530
where the lava is so they don't die they
 

373
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,680
where the lava is so they don't die they
fall down into the item stream they run

374
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,690
fall down into the item stream they run
 

375
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,100
fall down into the item stream they run
along here and then they fall down the

376
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,110
along here and then they fall down the
 

377
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,460
along here and then they fall down the
collection pipe and since I don't have

378
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,470
collection pipe and since I don't have
 

379
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,180
collection pipe and since I don't have
the micro date set up there's nothing to

380
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,190
the micro date set up there's nothing to
 

381
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,990
the micro date set up there's nothing to
stop them from entering my storage room

382
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
stop them from entering my storage room
 

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,370
stop them from entering my storage room
so that's how they were getting into my

384
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:54,380
so that's how they were getting into my
 

385
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,539
so that's how they were getting into my
storage room

386
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:56,549
storage room
 

387
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:02,369
storage room
so yeah they spawn on grass and in light

388
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:02,379
so yeah they spawn on grass and in light
 

389
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:06,389
so yeah they spawn on grass and in light
Passaic the normal mobs I don't know if

390
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:06,399
Passaic the normal mobs I don't know if
 

391
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:10,849
Passaic the normal mobs I don't know if
they're any rarer than the normal moms

392
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:10,859
they're any rarer than the normal moms
 

393
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,959
they're any rarer than the normal moms
they probably are a little bit

394
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:12,969
they probably are a little bit
 

395
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:16,950
they probably are a little bit
whoa hey that's not good that's not good

396
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
whoa hey that's not good that's not good
 

397
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,719
whoa hey that's not good that's not good
oh my goodness

398
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:18,729
oh my goodness
 

399
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:39,629
oh my goodness
ah that was teamwork yes I have no

400
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:39,639
ah that was teamwork yes I have no
 

401
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:43,799
ah that was teamwork yes I have no
problem being wolves because apparently

402
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:43,809
problem being wolves because apparently
 

403
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,499
problem being wolves because apparently
I've made a wolf separator before they

404
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:46,509
I've made a wolf separator before they
 

405
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:50,419
I've made a wolf separator before they
even came out by pure chance

406
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:50,429
even came out by pure chance
 

407
00:18:50,429 --> 00:19:01,799
even came out by pure chance
is that so that's pretty cool

408
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:01,809
is that so that's pretty cool
 

409
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,779
is that so that's pretty cool
I'm pretty sure I'm the first person to

410
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:03,789
I'm pretty sure I'm the first person to
 

411
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:09,820
I'm pretty sure I'm the first person to
make a wolf separator

412
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:09,830

 

413
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,830

because I did it before the patch even

414
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
because I did it before the patch even
 

415
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,919
because I did it before the patch even
though

416
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:17,929

 

417
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:22,260

um

418
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,270

 

419
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,320

I had to clarify another thing every

420
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,330
I had to clarify another thing every
 

421
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,230
I had to clarify another thing every
wolf that spawns

422
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,240

 

423
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,380

they take up the account as a passive

424
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,390
they take up the account as a passive
 

425
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,820
they take up the account as a passive
mom so if you have too many wolves cows

426
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:41,830
mom so if you have too many wolves cows
 

427
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,790
mom so if you have too many wolves cows
and sheep and chickens and pigs won't

428
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:44,800
and sheep and chickens and pigs won't
 

429
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,830
and sheep and chickens and pigs won't
spawn anymore so some people have been

430
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
spawn anymore so some people have been
 

431
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,060
spawn anymore so some people have been
wondering about that

432
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,070
wondering about that
 

433
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,759
wondering about that
more wolves you have that you're feeding

434
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:54,769
more wolves you have that you're feeding
 

435
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:59,859
more wolves you have that you're feeding
these guys you'll have and you can see

436
00:19:59,859 --> 00:19:59,869
these guys you'll have and you can see
 

437
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:00,729
these guys you'll have and you can see
there's wool here

438
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:00,739
there's wool here
 

439
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:05,830
there's wool here
I'm sure wolf was over here just

440
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
I'm sure wolf was over here just
 

441
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,970
I'm sure wolf was over here just
recently

442
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:10,980

 

443
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,480

so I guess which go back up to the mob

444
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:15,490
so I guess which go back up to the mob
 

445
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,970
so I guess which go back up to the mob
system

446
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:20,980

 

447
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,180

so yeah it's easy to separate the walls

448
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,190
so yeah it's easy to separate the walls
 

449
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,460
so yeah it's easy to separate the walls
and it's easy to do it without killing

450
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:26,470
and it's easy to do it without killing
 

451
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:34,640
and it's easy to do it without killing
them so I probably will be using them to

452
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:34,650
them so I probably will be using them to
 

453
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,450
them so I probably will be using them to
automatically separates earth to assure

454
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:38,460
automatically separates earth to assure
 

455
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,610
automatically separates earth to assure
wool off sheep

456
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:45,620

 

457
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,940

let's see yeah if you wanted to make a

458
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:49,950
let's see yeah if you wanted to make a
 

459
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,600
let's see yeah if you wanted to make a
wolf separator you could do it oh yeah

460
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,610
wolf separator you could do it oh yeah
 

461
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,540
wolf separator you could do it oh yeah
so like I said before pigs can't fit

462
00:20:59,540 --> 00:20:59,550
so like I said before pigs can't fit
 

463
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,690
so like I said before pigs can't fit
through a gap if there's a ladder here

464
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:02,700
through a gap if there's a ladder here
 

465
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,330
through a gap if there's a ladder here
because the latter makes it makes it so

466
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:08,340
because the latter makes it makes it so
 

467
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,670
because the latter makes it makes it so
they can't quite squeeze through there -

468
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:10,680
they can't quite squeeze through there -
 

469
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,610
they can't quite squeeze through there -
the pigs are too fat but the wolves are

470
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:13,620
the pigs are too fat but the wolves are
 

471
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,610
the pigs are too fat but the wolves are
smaller so they just fall down if you

472
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:16,620
smaller so they just fall down if you
 

473
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,930
smaller so they just fall down if you
wanted to make a wolf separator

474
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:17,940
wanted to make a wolf separator
 

475
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,550
wanted to make a wolf separator
you probably should get rid of the lab

476
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:19,560
you probably should get rid of the lab
 

477
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,730
you probably should get rid of the lab
on top although it doesn't seem to kill

478
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:22,740
on top although it doesn't seem to kill
 

479
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:32,060
on top although it doesn't seem to kill
them ever but it will damage them and so

480
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,070
them ever but it will damage them and so
 

481
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:38,180
them ever but it will damage them and so
you can separate the Wolves and then you

482
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,190
you can separate the Wolves and then you
 

483
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,010
you can separate the Wolves and then you
should be able to send the Wolves where

484
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,020
should be able to send the Wolves where
 

485
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,460
should be able to send the Wolves where
the sheep go but the problem is if you

486
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,470
the sheep go but the problem is if you
 

487
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,170
the sheep go but the problem is if you
get too many wolves and these other mobs

488
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:48,180
get too many wolves and these other mobs
 

489

have in my world I think I would only
need three or four and I can't use team

496
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:01,380
need three or four and I can't use team
 

497
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,280
need three or four and I can't use team
mobs because the team moms will

498
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,290
mobs because the team moms will
 

499
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:09,560
mobs because the team moms will
automatically attack the passive mobs on

500
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:09,570
automatically attack the passive mobs on
 

501
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:18,020
automatically attack the passive mobs on
their own so and I think the neutral

laughter that one so anyway okay some

508
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
laughter that one so anyway okay some
 

509
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,710
laughter that one so anyway okay some
more fun facts about the Wolves if you

510
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:49,720
more fun facts about the Wolves if you
 

511
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,180
more fun facts about the Wolves if you
hold out bones or pork chops a kind of a

512
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,190
hold out bones or pork chops a kind of a
 

513
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,940
hold out bones or pork chops a kind of a
bag for the food they tilt their head

514
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,950
bag for the food they tilt their head
 

515
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,450

like that you'll notice his tails down

516
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:00,460
like that you'll notice his tails down
 

517
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,330
like that you'll notice his tails down
because he's damaged from the big

518
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,340
because he's damaged from the big
 

519
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:10,860
because he's damaged from the big
separator once you tame them if you can

520
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,870
separator once you tame them if you can
 

521
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,000
separator once you tame them if you can
tame them

522
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,010

 

523
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,190

they start at normal health full health

524
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
they start at normal health full health
 

525
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,770
they start at normal health full health
so that's interesting so even if they're

526
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:22,780
so that's interesting so even if they're
 

527
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,780
so that's interesting so even if they're
at low health when they're neutral as

528
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:24,790
at low health when they're neutral as
 

529
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,020
at low health when they're neutral as
soon as you tame them they get to full

530
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,030
soon as you tame them they get to full
 

531
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:41,040
soon as you tame them they get to full
health and I'm wondering if it's somehow

532
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,050
health and I'm wondering if it's somehow
 

533
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:52,980
health and I'm wondering if it's somehow
possible to get a evil wolf to to attack

534
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:52,990
possible to get a evil wolf to to attack
 

535
00:23:52,990 --> 00:24:02,970
possible to get a evil wolf to to attack
the mobs okay didn't see that one coming

536
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:02,980
the mobs okay didn't see that one coming
 

537
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:19,230
the mobs okay didn't see that one coming

Oh does my last one mmm so also new in
 

539
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,870
Oh does my last one mmm so also new in
the patch is cookies I don't have any

540
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:21,880
the patch is cookies I don't have any
 

541
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,560
the patch is cookies I don't have any
cocoa beans so we're not gonna be making

542
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:25,570
cocoa beans so we're not gonna be making
 

543
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,220
cocoa beans so we're not gonna be making
any of those there's another day well

544
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,230
any of those there's another day well
 

545
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:36,460
any of those there's another day well
that's that's my team

546
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:36,470

 

547
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,200

so the other interesting thing this

548
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,210
so the other interesting thing this
 

549
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,880
so the other interesting thing this
patch I think is the water stronger

550
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:43,890
patch I think is the water stronger
 

551
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,250
patch I think is the water stronger
water currents apparently there's more

552
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:48,260
water currents apparently there's more
 

553
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:57,620
water currents apparently there's more
angles that the water can go into let's

554
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:57,630
angles that the water can go into let's
 

555
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:07,370
angles that the water can go into let's
go over here you can't make wolf sit

556
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,380
go over here you can't make wolf sit
 

557
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,980
go over here you can't make wolf sit
when they're in the water otherwise they

558
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:09,990
when they're in the water otherwise they
 

559
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:23,150
when they're in the water otherwise they
would drown good boy so I want to try

560
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,160
would drown good boy so I want to try
 

561
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,380
would drown good boy so I want to try
something with water I want to see if it

562
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,390
something with water I want to see if it
 

563
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,070
something with water I want to see if it
makes you walk faster in it and if so

564
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,080
makes you walk faster in it and if so
 

565
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:50,630
makes you walk faster in it and if so
how much I think that's faster it's hard

566
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
how much I think that's faster it's hard
 

567
00:25:50,640 --> 00:26:02,570
how much I think that's faster it's hard
to tell

568
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:02,580

 

569
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,520

maybe not I don't know this is if you

570
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,530
maybe not I don't know this is if you
 

571
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:15,990
maybe not I don't know this is if you
don't press any arrows yeah that must be

572
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
don't press any arrows yeah that must be
 

573
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:27,330
don't press any arrows yeah that must be
faster um so the other thing I'm

574
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:27,340
faster um so the other thing I'm
 

575
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,130
faster um so the other thing I'm
wondering about is how that's going to

576
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,140
wondering about is how that's going to
 

577
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,640
wondering about is how that's going to
affect each road I kind of don't think

578
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:35,650
affect each road I kind of don't think
 

579
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:41,070
affect each road I kind of don't think
it's going to affect it because there is

580
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,080
it's going to affect it because there is
 

581
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:52,260
it's going to affect it because there is
a max speed on boats so eat so it

582
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,270
a max speed on boats so eat so it
 

583
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,290
a max speed on boats so eat so it
shouldn't make any difference if it does

584
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,300
shouldn't make any difference if it does
 

585
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,330
shouldn't make any difference if it does
speed them up it's going to cause

586
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:57,340
speed them up it's going to cause
 

587
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,610
speed them up it's going to cause
problems because if the boats hit going

588
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:02,620
problems because if the boats hit going
 

589
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,180
problems because if the boats hit going
too fast there's an issue with them foot

590
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,190
too fast there's an issue with them foot
 

591
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,560
too fast there's an issue with them foot
going through the ground and then they

592
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:07,570
going through the ground and then they
 

593
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:17,000
going through the ground and then they
break so let's check it out

594
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,010

 

595
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:35,700

yeah I Pete that's the same

596
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:35,710

 

597
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,560

ya didn't notice any difference I think

598
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:38,570
ya didn't notice any difference I think
 

599
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:45,460
ya didn't notice any difference I think
that's the same uh I will be building

600
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:45,470
that's the same uh I will be building
 

601
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,060
that's the same uh I will be building
more stuff down here pretty soon there's

602
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,070
more stuff down here pretty soon there's
 

603
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,720
more stuff down here pretty soon there's
gonna be something here

604
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:51,730
gonna be something here
 

605
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,710
gonna be something here
actually there's going to be quite a few

606
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:53,720
actually there's going to be quite a few
 

607
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,000
actually there's going to be quite a few
things down here in the basement my

608
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,010
things down here in the basement my
 

609
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,750
things down here in the basement my
house isn't going to be complete until I

610
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760
house isn't going to be complete until I
 

611
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,890
house isn't going to be complete until I
have some kind of secret underwater boat

612
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:08,900
have some kind of secret underwater boat
 

613
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:15,010
have some kind of secret underwater boat
passage kind of like I had in my first

614
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,020

very easy for you to fall to the
 

785
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,210

00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:06,690
ideas or designs if you don't give me
credit it kind of bothers me if you

790
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:06,700
credit it kind of bothers me if you
 

791
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,030
credit it kind of bothers me if you
imply that the idea or design is yours

792
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,040
imply that the idea or design is yours
 

793
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,030
imply that the idea or design is yours
and most of the time this is

794
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
and most of the time this is
 

795
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,659
and most of the time this is
unintentional that people do this it can

796
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:16,669
unintentional that people do this it can
 

797
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:19,569
unintentional that people do this it can
be as simple as you know putting the

798
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:19,579
be as simple as you know putting the
 

799
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:23,740
be as simple as you know putting the
word I or mine or me or my in one of

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:23,750
word I or mine or me or my in one of
 

801
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,720
word I or mine or me or my in one of
your sentences and then you give the

802
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:25,730
your sentences and then you give the
 

803
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,089
your sentences and then you give the
impression that the idea or design team

804
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:28,099
impression that the idea or design team
 

805
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:33,970
