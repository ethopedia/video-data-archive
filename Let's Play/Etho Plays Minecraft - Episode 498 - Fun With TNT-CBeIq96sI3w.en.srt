of the server was building cannons

82
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:04,409

playing around with TNT and that was
 

85
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,999
playing around with TNT and that was
what I was really into on the server and

00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:10,009
what I was really into on the server and
 

87
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,589
what I was really into on the server and
that was kind of how I got started with

88
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:12,599
that was kind of how I got started with
 

89
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,850

redstone actually I

90
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:13,860
redstone actually I
 

91
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,400

as making more and more complicated

92
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,410
as making more and more complicated
 

93
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,790
as making more and more complicated
cannons and to go along with that you

94
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
cannons and to go along with that you
 

95
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,380
cannons and to go along with that you
need more and more complicated redstone

96
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:21,390
need more and more complicated redstone
 

97
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,570
need more and more complicated redstone
right so eventually like the first

98
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:23,580
right so eventually like the first
 

99
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,000
right so eventually like the first
redstone thing I really built that was

100
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,010
redstone thing I really built that was
 

101
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,140
redstone thing I really built that was
complicated was a variable timer for the

102
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,150
complicated was a variable timer for the
 

103
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,900
complicated was a variable timer for the

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,090
a simple test here to begin with I want
to see how close we can get to TNT

164
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,100
to see how close we can get to TNT
 

165
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,440
to see how close we can get to TNT
without it actually killing us and I'm

166
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,450
without it actually killing us and I'm
 

167
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,060
without it actually killing us and I'm
gonna be testing it with no armor with

168
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,070
gonna be testing it with no armor with
 

169
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,550
gonna be testing it with no armor with
iron armor diamond armor because these

170
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:07,560
iron armor diamond armor because these
 

171
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
iron armor diamond armor because these
are like two things you usually get on a

172
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,090
are like two things you usually get on a
 

173
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,350
are like two things you usually get on a
PvP server and then my standards like

174
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:12,360
PvP server and then my standards like
 

175
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,840
PvP server and then my standards like
what I generally wear over here and then

176
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:14,850
what I generally wear over here and then
 

177
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,840
what I generally wear over here and then
our blast protection full suit over here

178
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:17,850
our blast protection full suit over here
 

179
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,030
our blast protection full suit over here
see what kind of difference that makes -

180
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,040
see what kind of difference that makes -
 

181
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,810
see what kind of difference that makes -
so what I'm gonna do is set up the TNT

182
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:23,820
so what I'm gonna do is set up the TNT
 

183
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,750
so what I'm gonna do is set up the TNT
like this press the button oh I guess I

184
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:26,760
like this press the button oh I guess I
 

185
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,530
like this press the button oh I guess I
can't do it

186
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:27,540
can't do it
 

187
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,800
can't do it
down there I'm gonna guess we gotta

188
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:30,810
down there I'm gonna guess we gotta
 

189
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,670
down there I'm gonna guess we gotta
stand like here at least right okay so I

190
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680
stand like here at least right okay so I
 

191
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:44,810
stand like here at least right okay so I
took off six hearts aha

192
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:44,820
took off six hearts aha
 

193
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,630
took off six hearts aha
so the TNT when we ignited it it hopped

194
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:47,640
so the TNT when we ignited it it hopped
 

195
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,010
so the TNT when we ignited it it hopped
up on the trapdoor here and blew

196
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,020
up on the trapdoor here and blew
 

197
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,300
up on the trapdoor here and blew
everything up so you wouldn't want to

198
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,310
everything up so you wouldn't want to
 

199
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,150
everything up so you wouldn't want to
use a trapdoor to hold TNT in place

200
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,160
use a trapdoor to hold TNT in place
 

201
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,340
use a trapdoor to hold TNT in place
right maybe let's try figure out what

202
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,350
right maybe let's try figure out what
 

203
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,170
right maybe let's try figure out what
the max height it will hop up on

204
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,180
the max height it will hop up on
 

205
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,620
the max height it will hop up on
something is so this is if we go here

206
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:00,630
something is so this is if we go here
 

207
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,300
something is so this is if we go here
you see the y-coordinate sixty three

208
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,310
you see the y-coordinate sixty three
 

209
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,490
you see the y-coordinate sixty three
point zero if we go up on the trapdoor

210
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:04,500
point zero if we go up on the trapdoor
 

211
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,330
point zero if we go up on the trapdoor
it's 0.1875 I got some snow slabs here

212
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,340
it's 0.1875 I got some snow slabs here
 

213
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,350
it's 0.1875 I got some snow slabs here
we'll go up one one above that so with

214
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
we'll go up one one above that so with
 

215
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,810
we'll go up one one above that so with
one earlier with two it's point one two

216
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:14,820
one earlier with two it's point one two
 

217
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,540
one earlier with two it's point one two
five with three it is 0.25 so that's

218
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:17,550
five with three it is 0.25 so that's
 

219
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,790
five with three it is 0.25 so that's
gonna mean the next stage up okay so

220
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:19,800
gonna mean the next stage up okay so
 

221
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,460
gonna mean the next stage up okay so
with no armor oh it looks like you

222
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,470
with no armor oh it looks like you
 

223
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,970
with no armor oh it looks like you
landed on the slab aha so you're gonna

224
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:25,980
landed on the slab aha so you're gonna
 

225
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,750
landed on the slab aha so you're gonna
got to go up higher even added one more

226
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:29,760
got to go up higher even added one more
 

227
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,520
got to go up higher even added one more
snow slab to this so we're at point

228
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:31,530
snow slab to this so we're at point
 

229
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,360
snow slab to this so we're at point
three seven five see if that's okay with

230
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,370
three seven five see if that's okay with
 

231
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,950
three seven five see if that's okay with
no armor it seems we can stand like

232
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
no armor it seems we can stand like
 

233
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,800
no armor it seems we can stand like
right here guys down to one hearts let's

234
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:39,810
right here guys down to one hearts let's
 

235
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,500
right here guys down to one hearts let's
one two three four five blocks away

236
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:42,510
one two three four five blocks away
 

237
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,710
one two three four five blocks away
basically let's go ahead and heal up

238
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:45,720
basically let's go ahead and heal up
 

239
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,280
basically let's go ahead and heal up
we'll try it with iron armor next here

240
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,290
we'll try it with iron armor next here
 

241
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,350
we'll try it with iron armor next here
so this is our no armor line over here I

242
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
so this is our no armor line over here I
 

243
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,330
so this is our no armor line over here I
thought with iron armor we would be able

244
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:53,340
thought with iron armor we would be able
 

245
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,950
thought with iron armor we would be able
to get like up to here that was my guess

246
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
to get like up to here that was my guess
 

247
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,420
to get like up to here that was my guess
but it really doesn't help very much

248
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:58,430
but it really doesn't help very much
 

249
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,520
but it really doesn't help very much
like only only like a quarter of a block

250
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,530
like only only like a quarter of a block
 

251
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,870
like only only like a quarter of a block
like I think this is about the closest

252
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
like I think this is about the closest
 

253
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,690
like I think this is about the closest
we can stand so this line here is about

254
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:05,700
we can stand so this line here is about
 

255
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,060
we can stand so this line here is about
how close we can get with no armor with

256
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,070
how close we can get with no armor with
 

257
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,310
how close we can get with no armor with
iron armor it's about over here not much

258
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,320
iron armor it's about over here not much
 

259
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,050
iron armor it's about over here not much
closer only about a quarter block but

260
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
closer only about a quarter block but
 

261
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,910
closer only about a quarter block but
with diamond armor we move quite a bit

262
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:13,920
with diamond armor we move quite a bit
 

263
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,490
with diamond armor we move quite a bit
closer I think up to to about here let's

264
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,500
closer I think up to to about here let's
 

265
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,850
closer I think up to to about here let's
try it out did one test and it seemed to

266
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,860
try it out did one test and it seemed to
 

267
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,610
try it out did one test and it seemed to
work fine yeah got down to two hearts or

268
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:25,620
work fine yeah got down to two hearts or
 

269
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,530
work fine yeah got down to two hearts or
so over here so that made a pretty big

270
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:27,540
so over here so that made a pretty big
 

271
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,650
so over here so that made a pretty big
difference between iron and diamonds so

272
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:30,660
difference between iron and diamonds so
 

273
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,790
difference between iron and diamonds so
what I'm wearing here is what I

274
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:31,800
what I'm wearing here is what I
 

275
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,040
what I'm wearing here is what I
basically consider the best possible

276
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,050
basically consider the best possible
 

277
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,130
basically consider the best possible
armor for general minecraft like this is

278
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,140
armor for general minecraft like this is
 

279
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,710
armor for general minecraft like this is
the dream here you cannot put protection

280
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:39,720
the dream here you cannot put protection
 

281
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,510
the dream here you cannot put protection
on Alijah wings if you're

282
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
on Alijah wings if you're
 

283
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,570
on Alijah wings if you're
not in creative so like this is as good

284
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:44,580
not in creative so like this is as good
 

285
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,189
not in creative so like this is as good
as it's gonna get if this was a diamond

286
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,199
as it's gonna get if this was a diamond
 

287
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,800
as it's gonna get if this was a diamond
chestplate we could survive a lot better

288
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:47,810
chestplate we could survive a lot better
 

289
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,670
chestplate we could survive a lot better
but we want to be able to fly right so I

290
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
but we want to be able to fly right so I
 

291
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
but we want to be able to fly right so I
think about three blocks yeah guys down

292
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,250
think about three blocks yeah guys down
 

293
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,670
think about three blocks yeah guys down
to one and a half so right over here

294
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:58,680
to one and a half so right over here
 

295
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,320
to one and a half so right over here
it's about half a block closer than just

296
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,330
it's about half a block closer than just
 

297
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,839
it's about half a block closer than just
diamond armor now I could be wrong maybe

298
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:02,849
diamond armor now I could be wrong maybe
 

299
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,610
diamond armor now I could be wrong maybe
we'll try figure this out - is this the

300
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:04,620
we'll try figure this out - is this the
 

301
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,890
we'll try figure this out - is this the
best possible blast protection armor you

302
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:06,900
best possible blast protection armor you
 

303
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,379
best possible blast protection armor you
can get with four four enchantments or

304
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:09,389
can get with four four enchantments or
 

305
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,689
can get with four four enchantments or
is it like three blasts and one

306
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:11,699
is it like three blasts and one
 

307
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,309
is it like three blasts and one
protection for I'm not exactly sure

308
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,319
protection for I'm not exactly sure
 

309
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,120
protection for I'm not exactly sure
about that

310
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,130
about that
 

311
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,390
about that
we'll try figure that out - let's see if

312
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:17,400
we'll try figure that out - let's see if
 

313
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,430
we'll try figure that out - let's see if
we can get right in with it here again

314
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,440
we can get right in with it here again
 

315
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,110
we can get right in with it here again
okay so I've got a stance about three

316
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,120
okay so I've got a stance about three
 

317
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,990
okay so I've got a stance about three
hearts or so we'll try to do the same

318
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,000
hearts or so we'll try to do the same
 

319
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,760
hearts or so we'll try to do the same
again except we'll change out one of the

320
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:28,770
again except we'll change out one of the
 

321
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,219
again except we'll change out one of the
pieces to something with protection for

322
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:31,229
pieces to something with protection for
 

323
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:35,439
pieces to something with protection for
on and just see what that does

324
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:35,449
on and just see what that does
 

325
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,610
on and just see what that does
okay so check this out this should get

326
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:37,620
okay so check this out this should get
 

327
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,800
okay so check this out this should get
us down to about three hearts three

328
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:39,810
us down to about three hearts three
 

329
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,260
us down to about three hearts three
hearts exactly that's with one piece of

330
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,270
hearts exactly that's with one piece of
 

331
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,820
hearts exactly that's with one piece of
blast protection and then three pieces

332
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:43,830
blast protection and then three pieces
 

333
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,839
blast protection and then three pieces
of protection okay with three pieces of

334
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:47,849
of protection okay with three pieces of
 

335
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,820
of protection okay with three pieces of
blast protection one of protection it

336
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:49,830
blast protection one of protection it
 

337
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,740
blast protection one of protection it
got us down to three hearts with two and

338
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:51,750
got us down to three hearts with two and
 

339
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,860
got us down to three hearts with two and
two three hearts with one in three three

340
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:54,870
two three hearts with one in three three
 

341
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,510
two three hearts with one in three three
hearts now if we go entirely protection

342
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
hearts now if we go entirely protection
 

343
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,350
hearts now if we go entirely protection
though four pieces of it then we start

344
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
though four pieces of it then we start
 

345
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,050
though four pieces of it then we start
having trouble so you kind of want three

346
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,060
having trouble so you kind of want three
 

347
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,330
having trouble so you kind of want three
three protection fours in one blast

348
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,340
three protection fours in one blast
 

349
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,010
three protection fours in one blast
protection for the ideal mix I think if

350
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,020
protection for the ideal mix I think if
 

351
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,719
protection for the ideal mix I think if
you're not using electro wings come on

352
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:17,729
you're not using electro wings come on
 

353
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,890
you're not using electro wings come on
you'll up saturation here we go

354
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:21,900
you'll up saturation here we go
 

355
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,230
you'll up saturation here we go
okay so we're fully healed this should

356
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
okay so we're fully healed this should
 

357
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,379
okay so we're fully healed this should
kill us yeah

358
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:27,389
kill us yeah
 

359
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,920
kill us yeah
all right so quite a bit already these

360
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:30,930
all right so quite a bit already these
 

361
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,719
all right so quite a bit already these
slabs seem to be working by the way at

362
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:32,729
slabs seem to be working by the way at
 

363
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,209
slabs seem to be working by the way at
0.375

364
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:34,219
0.375
 

365
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,469
0.375
anything lower than that I think is a

366
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
anything lower than that I think is a
 

367
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,790
anything lower than that I think is a
little bit dangerous I think it'll land

368
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,800
little bit dangerous I think it'll land
 

369
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,909
little bit dangerous I think it'll land
on it what we're gonna figure out next

370
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:40,919
on it what we're gonna figure out next
 

371
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,550
on it what we're gonna figure out next
is how vertical height affects us so

372
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:43,560
is how vertical height affects us so
 

373
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,290
is how vertical height affects us so
remember with no armor we could stand

374
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,300
remember with no armor we could stand
 

375
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
remember with no armor we could stand
about here five blocks away we're gonna

376
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,310
about here five blocks away we're gonna
 

377
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,480
about here five blocks away we're gonna
go up five blocks vertically and I'm

378
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,490
go up five blocks vertically and I'm
 

379
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,540
go up five blocks vertically and I'm
assuming we should take about the same

380
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:53,550
assuming we should take about the same
 

381
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,310
assuming we should take about the same
damage or less

382
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,320
damage or less
 

383
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,070
damage or less
is my assumption I can't reach it can I

384
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
is my assumption I can't reach it can I
 

385
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,470
is my assumption I can't reach it can I
whoops it's gonna be a little bit tough

386
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:03,480
whoops it's gonna be a little bit tough
 

387
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,570
whoops it's gonna be a little bit tough
to you gonna be fast like a ninja we

388
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:08,580
to you gonna be fast like a ninja we
 

389
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,170
to you gonna be fast like a ninja we
should live though yeah so we took a

390
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,180
should live though yeah so we took a
 

391
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,520
should live though yeah so we took a
little bit less damage I think the

392
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,530
little bit less damage I think the
 

393
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,530
little bit less damage I think the
reason we took less damage is because if

394
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:15,540
reason we took less damage is because if
 

395
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,990
reason we took less damage is because if
you look at our player model we're kind

396
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
you look at our player model we're kind
 

397
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you look at our player model we're kind
of chunky right we stick out like if

398
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,010
of chunky right we stick out like if
 

399
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,930
of chunky right we stick out like if
we're standing right where we thought

400
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:22,940
we're standing right where we thought
 

401
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,010
we're standing right where we thought
we're right where we think it's safe

402
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,020
we're right where we think it's safe
 

403
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,590
we're right where we think it's safe
here right here we look at our player

404
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
here right here we look at our player
 

405
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,110
here right here we look at our player
model it goes over like four pixels on

406
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,120
model it goes over like four pixels on
 

407
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,750
model it goes over like four pixels on
that block right but at our feet were

408
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:32,760
that block right but at our feet were
 

409
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,530
that block right but at our feet were
flat with the block so we're like a

410
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:36,540
flat with the block so we're like a
 

411
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,660
flat with the block so we're like a
quarter block farther away vertically

412
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:41,670
quarter block farther away vertically
 

413
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,110
quarter block farther away vertically
right does that make sense I think so

414
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
right does that make sense I think so
 

415
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,200
right does that make sense I think so
okay that's good to know all right guys

416
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,210
okay that's good to know all right guys
 

417
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,060
okay that's good to know all right guys
so we're gonna start trying some weird

418
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,070
so we're gonna start trying some weird
 

419
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,220
so we're gonna start trying some weird
stuff out here so we got ourselves a

420
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,230
stuff out here so we got ourselves a
 

421
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,200
stuff out here so we got ourselves a
slime launcher here we're gonna stand on

422
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,210
slime launcher here we're gonna stand on
 

423
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,250
slime launcher here we're gonna stand on
and we have a 40 tick delay here I'm

424
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:58,260
and we have a 40 tick delay here I'm
 

425
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,620
and we have a 40 tick delay here I'm
pretty sure TNT still explodes in 40

426
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:00,630
pretty sure TNT still explodes in 40
 

427
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,380
pretty sure TNT still explodes in 40
ticks or four seconds like it always has

428
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,390
ticks or four seconds like it always has
 

429
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,140
ticks or four seconds like it always has
I don't think that changed basically we

430
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,150
I don't think that changed basically we
 

431
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,330
I don't think that changed basically we
stand here it launches it up through the

432
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:08,340
stand here it launches it up through the
 

433
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,170
stand here it launches it up through the
water here this is gonna be full of TNT

434
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:11,180
water here this is gonna be full of TNT
 

435
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,550
water here this is gonna be full of TNT
and I'm wondering if the motion we

436
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:13,560
and I'm wondering if the motion we
 

437
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,410
and I'm wondering if the motion we
gained from the slime launcher will will

438
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:15,420
gained from the slime launcher will will
 

439
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
gained from the slime launcher will will
launch us higher in the air when the TNT

440
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,430
launch us higher in the air when the TNT
 

441
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,180
launch us higher in the air when the TNT
explodes and what is the perfect timing

442
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,190
explodes and what is the perfect timing
 

443
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,500
explodes and what is the perfect timing
to it - I'm not sure

444
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,510
to it - I'm not sure
 

445
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,410
to it - I'm not sure
let's try remove three so we should be

446
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:27,420
let's try remove three so we should be
 

447
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,770
let's try remove three so we should be
in the air when the TNT explodes I think

448
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:30,780
in the air when the TNT explodes I think
 

449
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,050
in the air when the TNT explodes I think
that lands right above us in the water

450
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,060
that lands right above us in the water
 

451
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,390
that lands right above us in the water
oh yeah I get stuck on the ladder I

452
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:37,400
oh yeah I get stuck on the ladder I
 

453
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,270
oh yeah I get stuck on the ladder I
think I got stuck on the ladder guys try

454
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,280
think I got stuck on the ladder guys try
 

455
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,940
think I got stuck on the ladder guys try
that again

456
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:43,950

 

457
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,040

okay so we were waiting hi there hey

458
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,050
okay so we were waiting hi there hey
 

459
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,009
okay so we were waiting hi there hey
let's change the delay some more we

460
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:52,019
let's change the delay some more we
 

461
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,940
let's change the delay some more we
would want it to be longer then actually

462
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:54,950
would want it to be longer then actually
 

463
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:04,009
would want it to be longer then actually
let's go for what we originally had whoa

464
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:04,019
let's go for what we originally had whoa
 

465
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:10,340
let's go for what we originally had whoa
baby okay that was kind of cool the

466
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,350
baby okay that was kind of cool the
 

467
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,650
baby okay that was kind of cool the
water probably slows us down a bit too

468
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:12,660
water probably slows us down a bit too
 

469
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,430
water probably slows us down a bit too
though because it has friction

470
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
though because it has friction
 

471
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,310
though because it has friction
okay let's try change that again I don't

472
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,320
okay let's try change that again I don't
 

473
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,870
okay let's try change that again I don't
know if it's gonna get much better than

474
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
know if it's gonna get much better than
 

475
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,840
know if it's gonna get much better than
that here we go

476
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:25,850
that here we go
 

477
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:31,939
that here we go
that was pretty good hmm we didn't go as

478
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:31,949
that was pretty good hmm we didn't go as
 

479
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:32,829
that was pretty good hmm we didn't go as
high that time

480
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:32,839
high that time
 

481
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,389
high that time
mmm okay so that's that's the best

482
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:35,399
mmm okay so that's that's the best
 

483
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,100
mmm okay so that's that's the best
launch we could get with this design I

484
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,110
launch we could get with this design I
 

485
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,009
launch we could get with this design I
think I decided let's try a new design

486
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:40,019
think I decided let's try a new design
 

487
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,689
think I decided let's try a new design
to really get the most out of it though

488
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:41,699
to really get the most out of it though
 

489
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:44,180
to really get the most out of it though
so we don't want to pass through the

490
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,190
so we don't want to pass through the
 

491
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,850
so we don't want to pass through the
water because that'll slow us down and

492
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:46,860
water because that'll slow us down and
 

493
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,310
water because that'll slow us down and
we want the tea and just the right spot

494
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320
we want the tea and just the right spot
 

495
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,680
we want the tea and just the right spot
when it explodes I don't know what that

496
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:51,690
when it explodes I don't know what that
 

497
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,329
when it explodes I don't know what that
right spot is so we want to be able to

498
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:53,339
right spot is so we want to be able to
 

499
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,970
right spot is so we want to be able to
adjust it which with this new design

500
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:55,980
adjust it which with this new design
 

501
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,329
adjust it which with this new design
we're going to be able to and we want to

502
00:11:59,329 --> 00:11:59,339
we're going to be able to and we want to
 

503
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,639
we're going to be able to and we want to
be moving as fast as possible when the

504
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:01,649
be moving as fast as possible when the
 

505
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,300
be moving as fast as possible when the
tnt explodes I think so we want to get

506
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,310
tnt explodes I think so we want to get
 

507
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,400
tnt explodes I think so we want to get
launched right when the TNT explodes I

508
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,410
launched right when the TNT explodes I
 

509
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,340
launched right when the TNT explodes I
think so with this design basically

510
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,350
think so with this design basically
 

511
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,110
think so with this design basically
we've got a launcher for the TNT it's

512
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,120
we've got a launcher for the TNT it's
 

513
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,480
we've got a launcher for the TNT it's
gonna launch it up and at the top of the

514
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,490
gonna launch it up and at the top of the
 

515
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,290
gonna launch it up and at the top of the
TNT arc is then where we get launched

516
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,300
TNT arc is then where we get launched
 

517
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,569
TNT arc is then where we get launched
and the TNT should hopefully be

518
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:20,579
and the TNT should hopefully be
 

519
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,180
and the TNT should hopefully be
underneath us is the plan let's go up

520
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,190
underneath us is the plan let's go up
 

521
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,449
underneath us is the plan let's go up
there let's see if our one time version

522
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:26,459
there let's see if our one time version
 

523
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,639
there let's see if our one time version
here does anything it's got a pressure

524
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:28,649
here does anything it's got a pressure
 

525
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,740
here does anything it's got a pressure
plate and drop it on - if I can aim oh

526
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:32,750
plate and drop it on - if I can aim oh
 

527
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,040
plate and drop it on - if I can aim oh
come on really okay I'm supposed to

528
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,050
come on really okay I'm supposed to
 

529
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,660
come on really okay I'm supposed to
stand on the edge of the slime block

530
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:38,670
stand on the edge of the slime block
 

531
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,519
stand on the edge of the slime block
here yeah I don't think the slime block

532
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:43,529
here yeah I don't think the slime block
 

533
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,170
here yeah I don't think the slime block
launched us right so we got to shorten

534
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:48,180
launched us right so we got to shorten
 

535
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,530
launched us right so we got to shorten
the delay on this

536
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:51,540

 

537
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,760

okay there we go that was pretty good

538
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:58,770

 

539
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,350

okay guys so I tried a whole bunch of

540
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
okay guys so I tried a whole bunch of
 

541
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,670
okay guys so I tried a whole bunch of
different diamonds with this thing a few

542
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:02,680
different diamonds with this thing a few
 

543
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,470
different diamonds with this thing a few
different setups I even blew it up like

544
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
different setups I even blew it up like
 

545
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,780
different setups I even blew it up like
five times but I couldn't get it any

546
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:06,790
five times but I couldn't get it any
 

547
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,080
five times but I couldn't get it any
higher of a launch out of it so I think

548
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,090
higher of a launch out of it so I think
 

549
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,120
higher of a launch out of it so I think
it's not gonna be a super useful idea we

550
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,130
it's not gonna be a super useful idea we
 

551
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,400
it's not gonna be a super useful idea we
would need more TNT and we can just

552
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,410
would need more TNT and we can just
 

553
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,440
would need more TNT and we can just
barely survive one right we would need a

554
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,450
barely survive one right we would need a
 

555
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,500
barely survive one right we would need a
resistance to beacon and if you have to

556
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:19,510
resistance to beacon and if you have to
 

557
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,190
resistance to beacon and if you have to
there's always that chance you'll like

558
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,200
there's always that chance you'll like
 

559
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,420
there's always that chance you'll like
accidentally go into it not full health

560
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,430
accidentally go into it not full health
 

561
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,270
accidentally go into it not full health
and then you'll blow up and then the

562
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,280
and then you'll blow up and then the
 

563
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,680
and then you'll blow up and then the
second TNT is gonna blow up all your

564
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,690
second TNT is gonna blow up all your
 

565
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,040
second TNT is gonna blow up all your
gear which would be really bad but it

566
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,050
gear which would be really bad but it
 

567
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,840
gear which would be really bad but it
was cool to see like you can combine the

568
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:33,850
was cool to see like you can combine the
 

569
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,580
was cool to see like you can combine the
launch power of the slime block with the

570
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:35,590
launch power of the slime block with the
 

571
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,500
launch power of the slime block with the
TNT we went higher with the two combined

572
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,510
TNT we went higher with the two combined
 

573
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,060
TNT we went higher with the two combined
then you could go with either of them

574
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,070
then you could go with either of them
 

575
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,030
then you could go with either of them
separately so we kind of learned

576
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,040
separately so we kind of learned
 

577
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,100
separately so we kind of learned
something with it I guess

578
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,110
something with it I guess
 

579
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,240
something with it I guess
now I was thinking you know it would be

580
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,250
now I was thinking you know it would be
 

581
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,610
now I was thinking you know it would be
really fun I don't know how many of you

582
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:47,620
really fun I don't know how many of you
 

583
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,280
really fun I don't know how many of you
remember my old 360 cannon design is

584
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,290
remember my old 360 cannon design is
 

585
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,480
remember my old 360 cannon design is
like really really old I thought it'd be

586
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,490
like really really old I thought it'd be
 

587
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,940
like really really old I thought it'd be
cool if we could try to revise it with

588
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:56,950
cool if we could try to revise it with
 

589
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,520
cool if we could try to revise it with
the new stuff added into the game like

590
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,530
the new stuff added into the game like
 

591
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,090
the new stuff added into the game like
shooting TNT out of dispensers we'd be

592
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,100
shooting TNT out of dispensers we'd be
 

593
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,950
shooting TNT out of dispensers we'd be
able to compact it a lot with that and

594
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:04,960
able to compact it a lot with that and
 

595
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,380
able to compact it a lot with that and
we got comparators and stuff now I'm

596
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,390
we got comparators and stuff now I'm
 

597
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,850
we got comparators and stuff now I'm
sure we could do something really cool

598
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:08,860
sure we could do something really cool
 

599
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,600
sure we could do something really cool
so we're gonna try builds a new version

600
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:12,610
so we're gonna try builds a new version
 

601
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,910
so we're gonna try builds a new version
of it right in the middle here see the

602
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:14,920
of it right in the middle here see the
 

603
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,880
of it right in the middle here see the
problem with like most cannons it's like

604
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:17,890
problem with like most cannons it's like
 

605
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,710
problem with like most cannons it's like
you you see the guy he's at the cannon

606
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:19,720
you you see the guy he's at the cannon
 

607
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,240
you you see the guy he's at the cannon
oh he's trying to shoot me what do I do

608
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,250
oh he's trying to shoot me what do I do
 

609
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,850
oh he's trying to shoot me what do I do
what I do I'm gonna walk five steps to

610
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:23,860
what I do I'm gonna walk five steps to
 

611
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,260
what I do I'm gonna walk five steps to
the left and he'll never be able to hit

612
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,270
the left and he'll never be able to hit
 

613
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,630
the left and he'll never be able to hit
me because I can only shoot straight

614
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:27,640
me because I can only shoot straight
 

615
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,770
me because I can only shoot straight
right that's why I really like this old

616
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:31,780
right that's why I really like this old
 

617
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,250
right that's why I really like this old
360 cannon design you could actually aim

618
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,260
360 cannon design you could actually aim
 

619
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,900
360 cannon design you could actually aim
it and like to have different shot

620
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:36,910
it and like to have different shot
 

621
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,910
it and like to have different shot
towers and different timings to it you

622
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:38,920
towers and different timings to it you
 

623
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,190
towers and different timings to it you
could like actually hit moving targets

624
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,200
could like actually hit moving targets
 

625
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,390
could like actually hit moving targets
and stuff with it if you got really good

626
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,400
and stuff with it if you got really good
 

627
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,110
and stuff with it if you got really good
what I think we're gonna do trying to

628
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
what I think we're gonna do trying to
 

629
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,520
what I think we're gonna do trying to
think how to design this I think we'll

630
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,530
think how to design this I think we'll
 

631
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,000
think how to design this I think we'll
do a three by three to begin with here I

632
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,010
do a three by three to begin with here I
 

633
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,790
do a three by three to begin with here I
think I think we can get rid of or get

634
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
think I think we can get rid of or get
 

635
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
think I think we can get rid of or get
away with just like one water source in

636
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,050
away with just like one water source in
 

637
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,580
away with just like one water source in
the very middle the old design oh I

638
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:02,590
the very middle the old design oh I
 

639
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,100
the very middle the old design oh I
don't have any TNT with with me

640
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,110
don't have any TNT with with me
 

641
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,410
don't have any TNT with with me
pretend this is TNT the old design had

642
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:07,420
pretend this is TNT the old design had
 

643
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,250
pretend this is TNT the old design had
like 8p here these are the things that

644
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,260
like 8p here these are the things that
 

645
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,949
like 8p here these are the things that
launched the projectile and the

646
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:13,959
launched the projectile and the
 

647
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,110
launched the projectile and the
projectile TNT's were on the outside

648
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,120
projectile TNT's were on the outside
 

649
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,800
projectile TNT's were on the outside
like this we'll try to do something

650
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:19,810
like this we'll try to do something
 

651
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,329
like this we'll try to do something
similar like there was two rings the

652
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:24,339
similar like there was two rings the
 

653
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,310
similar like there was two rings the
launcher and the other ring was a

654
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
launcher and the other ring was a
 

655
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,460
launcher and the other ring was a
projectile tnt's so I think we will use

656
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:32,470
projectile tnt's so I think we will use
 

657
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,980
projectile tnt's so I think we will use
trapdoors just to hold the water in

658
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:34,990
trapdoors just to hold the water in
 

659
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,310
trapdoors just to hold the water in
place and they hopefully won't block up

660
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
place and they hopefully won't block up
 

661
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,730
place and they hopefully won't block up
the explosion power of the TNT and then

662
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:41,740
the explosion power of the TNT and then
 

663
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,019
the explosion power of the TNT and then
we'll have like a water source in the

664
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:43,029
we'll have like a water source in the
 

665
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,759
we'll have like a water source in the
middle here we'll drop the TNT

666
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:44,769
middle here we'll drop the TNT
 

667
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:49,319
middle here we'll drop the TNT
vertically down into and then we'll go

668
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:49,329
vertically down into and then we'll go
 

669
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:54,840
vertically down into and then we'll go
fences that just fall through I'm not

670
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:54,850
fences that just fall through I'm not
 

671
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,540
fences that just fall through I'm not
sure can I get back up oh I don't think

672
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:57,550
sure can I get back up oh I don't think
 

673
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,340
sure can I get back up oh I don't think
I shot further phone out we're getting

674
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,350
I shot further phone out we're getting
 

675
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,000
I shot further phone out we're getting
okay oh is it because I think I know

676
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,010
okay oh is it because I think I know
 

677
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,019
okay oh is it because I think I know
what happens yeah look at that okay so

678
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:07,029
what happens yeah look at that okay so
 

679
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,680
what happens yeah look at that okay so
you can place it but you place it while

680
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:10,690
you can place it but you place it while
 

681
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,180
you can place it but you place it while
you're in the collision box so you just

682
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,190
you're in the collision box so you just
 

683
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,970
you're in the collision box so you just
fall through then oh well that was a bad

684
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:14,980
fall through then oh well that was a bad
 

685
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,870
fall through then oh well that was a bad
thrill that was a bad throw alright so

686
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
thrill that was a bad throw alright so
 

687
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,069
thrill that was a bad throw alright so
this is what we're gonna do we're gonna

688
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
this is what we're gonna do we're gonna
 

689
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,680
this is what we're gonna do we're gonna
try have the projectile TNT the ones

690
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:22,690
try have the projectile TNT the ones
 

691
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,720
try have the projectile TNT the ones
we're launching on top of the fences

692
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:24,730
we're launching on top of the fences
 

693
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,380
we're launching on top of the fences
here and then actual launching TNT is

694
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,390
here and then actual launching TNT is
 

695
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,579
here and then actual launching TNT is
gonna go right in the middle here and

696
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:29,589
gonna go right in the middle here and
 

697
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,199
gonna go right in the middle here and
depending on how many we put in the

698
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:31,209
depending on how many we put in the
 

699
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,750
depending on how many we put in the
middle will affect how far the shot goes

700
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:33,760
middle will affect how far the shot goes
 

701
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,990
middle will affect how far the shot goes
and we have five plus five plus three

702
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,000
and we have five plus five plus three
 

703
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,250
and we have five plus five plus three
plus three 21 different angles we can

704
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,260
plus three 21 different angles we can
 

705
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,750
plus three 21 different angles we can
shoot the TNT from so hopefully that

706
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:42,760
shoot the TNT from so hopefully that
 

707
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,439
shoot the TNT from so hopefully that
gives us a nice range of shooting now we

708
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:46,449
gives us a nice range of shooting now we
 

709
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,819
gives us a nice range of shooting now we
got to figure out how we're gonna get

710
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:47,829
got to figure out how we're gonna get
 

711
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:51,060
got to figure out how we're gonna get
the the TNT on these fences like I think

712
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,070
the the TNT on these fences like I think
 

713
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,030
the the TNT on these fences like I think
let's just try a test here kind of like

714
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,040
let's just try a test here kind of like
 

715
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,069
let's just try a test here kind of like
what just happened to us I think if we

716
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
what just happened to us I think if we
 

717
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,680
what just happened to us I think if we
just ignite it on top of the fence it

718
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:58,690
just ignite it on top of the fence it
 

719
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:05,429
just ignite it on top of the fence it
might fall through let's see here okay

720
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
might fall through let's see here okay
 

721
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,559
might fall through let's see here okay
it does have to be ready to to break it

722
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:07,569
it does have to be ready to to break it
 

723
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,000
it does have to be ready to to break it
just okay so we can't we can't ignite it

724
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,010
just okay so we can't we can't ignite it
 

725
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,819
just okay so we can't we can't ignite it
on top of the fences fences are a bit of

726
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:14,829
on top of the fences fences are a bit of
 

727
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,980
on top of the fences fences are a bit of
a weird block because they're only they

728
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:16,990
a weird block because they're only they
 

729
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,870
a weird block because they're only they
only occupy one block space but they

730
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
only occupy one block space but they
 

731
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,110
only occupy one block space but they
have

732
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
have
 

733
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,670
have
collision box that's one and a half

734
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:20,680
collision box that's one and a half
 

735
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,240
collision box that's one and a half
blocks you see where it 81.5 on the

736
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,250
blocks you see where it 81.5 on the
 

737
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,760
blocks you see where it 81.5 on the
y-coordinate and the trap door is there

738
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:26,770
y-coordinate and the trap door is there
 

739
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,530
y-coordinate and the trap door is there
lower I think they're low enough they

740
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:28,540
lower I think they're low enough they
 

741
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,100
lower I think they're low enough they
won't block the TNT explosion so it'll

742
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,110
won't block the TNT explosion so it'll
 

743
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,960
won't block the TNT explosion so it'll
go to the fences and since these are

744
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:33,970
go to the fences and since these are
 

745
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,280
go to the fences and since these are
higher hopefully none of the explosion

746
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,290
higher hopefully none of the explosion
 

747
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,190
higher hopefully none of the explosion
from the TNT gets dampens that's what

748
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
from the TNT gets dampens that's what
 

749
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,260
from the TNT gets dampens that's what
we're trying to avoid with this so I

750
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,270
we're trying to avoid with this so I
 

751
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,180
we're trying to avoid with this so I
guess we got to go at least one block

752
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,190
guess we got to go at least one block
 

753
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,760
guess we got to go at least one block
higher for dropping the TNT like it's

754
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:47,770
higher for dropping the TNT like it's
 

755
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,160
higher for dropping the TNT like it's
got to be at least at this height mmm I

756
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,170
got to be at least at this height mmm I
 

757
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,690
got to be at least at this height mmm I
think we want to go one higher though

758
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:54,700
think we want to go one higher though
 

759
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,180
think we want to go one higher though
just so there's less chance of it

760
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,190
just so there's less chance of it
 

761
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,380
just so there's less chance of it
hitting our frame when it launches

762
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,390
hitting our frame when it launches
 

763
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,460
hitting our frame when it launches
yeah actually maybe we'll do this a

764
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:02,470
yeah actually maybe we'll do this a
 

765
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,690
yeah actually maybe we'll do this a
little bit different like the way I

766
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:03,700
little bit different like the way I
 

767
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,480
little bit different like the way I
originally did it is I had a ring of

768
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,490
originally did it is I had a ring of
 

769
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,120
originally did it is I had a ring of
redstone like this and then you put your

770
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,130
redstone like this and then you put your
 

771
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,669
redstone like this and then you put your
projectile TNT in for each launch and

772
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
projectile TNT in for each launch and
 

773
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,669
projectile TNT in for each launch and
then it it triggers right and then it

774
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:14,679
then it it triggers right and then it
 

775
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,710
then it it triggers right and then it
falls down on the fences but this time I

776
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
falls down on the fences but this time I
 

777
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,790
falls down on the fences but this time I
think we're gonna have a ring of

778
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:17,800
think we're gonna have a ring of
 

779
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,340
think we're gonna have a ring of
dispensers you see I got them over here

780
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,350

 

781
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,320

the problem with dispensers though is

782
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,330
the problem with dispensers though is
 

783
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,010
the problem with dispensers though is
they're hard to control like if you put

784
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,020
they're hard to control like if you put
 

785
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,630
they're hard to control like if you put
a ring a redstone around the dispensers

786
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
a ring a redstone around the dispensers
 

787
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,450
a ring a redstone around the dispensers
every single one's gonna shoot off TNT

788
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,460
every single one's gonna shoot off TNT
 

789
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,680
every single one's gonna shoot off TNT
every time you launch it right so you

790
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:34,690
every time you launch it right so you
 

791
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,270
every time you launch it right so you
got to tell it which ones you want to

792
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,280
got to tell it which ones you want to
 

793
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,960
got to tell it which ones you want to
actually drop the TNT and we can't

794
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:39,970
actually drop the TNT and we can't
 

795
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,780
actually drop the TNT and we can't
really do the switch trick with this

796
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:42,790
really do the switch trick with this
 

797
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,740
really do the switch trick with this
like here let me try demonstrate here

798
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,750
like here let me try demonstrate here
 

799
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,710
like here let me try demonstrate here
where's my repeaters you're there

800
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
where's my repeaters you're there
 

801
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
where's my repeaters you're there
hey we try to make a switch like this

802
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,410
hey we try to make a switch like this
 

803
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,470
hey we try to make a switch like this
where we have a block in front that we

804
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:55,480
where we have a block in front that we
 

805
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,160
where we have a block in front that we
can control and then if there's a sticky

806
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,170
can control and then if there's a sticky
 

807
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,799
can control and then if there's a sticky
piston here this isn't gonna work

808
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:01,809
piston here this isn't gonna work
 

809
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,390
piston here this isn't gonna work
because dispensers get bud powered right

810
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:05,400
because dispensers get bud powered right
 

811
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,380
because dispensers get bud powered right
that would be over there so like I was

812
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:10,390
that would be over there so like I was
 

813
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,060
that would be over there so like I was
thinking we could control the Pistons

814
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,070
thinking we could control the Pistons
 

815
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,610
thinking we could control the Pistons
with a lever and it'll either have the

816
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:14,620
with a lever and it'll either have the
 

817
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,560
with a lever and it'll either have the
block over here or down there but it

818
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:16,570
block over here or down there but it
 

819
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,330
block over here or down there but it
doesn't matter because if we send this a

820
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,340
doesn't matter because if we send this a
 

821
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,240
doesn't matter because if we send this a
pulse you hear that it still triggers a

822
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,250
pulse you hear that it still triggers a
 

823
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,180
pulse you hear that it still triggers a
dispenser wherever the block is so we'd

824
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,190
dispenser wherever the block is so we'd
 

825
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,970
dispenser wherever the block is so we'd
have to do it from a side angle if we

826
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:26,980
have to do it from a side angle if we
 

827
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,260
have to do it from a side angle if we
actually wanted to do that which would

828
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,270
actually wanted to do that which would
 

829
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,370
actually wanted to do that which would
not be very good

830
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:32,380
not be very good
 

831
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,990
not be very good
have to have it there and the piston

832
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,000
have to have it there and the piston
 

833
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,330
have to have it there and the piston
over here like that and then have the

834
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,340
over here like that and then have the
 

835
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,080
over here like that and then have the
repeater here Oh miss clicked like that

836
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,090
repeater here Oh miss clicked like that
 

837
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,630
repeater here Oh miss clicked like that
and then if that block is up but like

838
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:51,640
and then if that block is up but like
 

839
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,700
and then if that block is up but like
over here then it won't send a signal to

840
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:53,710
over here then it won't send a signal to
 

841
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,780
over here then it won't send a signal to
the dispenser problem is if we do that

842
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:56,790
the dispenser problem is if we do that
 

843
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,790
the dispenser problem is if we do that
this frame is gonna stick out super far

844
00:19:59,790 --> 00:19:59,800
this frame is gonna stick out super far
 

845
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,720
this frame is gonna stick out super far
and we're likely going to hit it with

846
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:02,730
and we're likely going to hit it with
 

847
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,170
and we're likely going to hit it with
the trajectory of the TNT it's gonna fly

848
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:07,180
the trajectory of the TNT it's gonna fly
 

849
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,730
the trajectory of the TNT it's gonna fly
upwards a bit right and that's gonna hit

850
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:08,740
upwards a bit right and that's gonna hit
 

851
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,170
upwards a bit right and that's gonna hit
that and then fall straight down pretty

852
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,180
that and then fall straight down pretty
 

853
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,720
that and then fall straight down pretty
much so I think this is what we're going

854
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:12,730
much so I think this is what we're going
 

855
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,360
much so I think this is what we're going
to do instead we'll have hoppers above

856
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,370
to do instead we'll have hoppers above
 

857
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,640
to do instead we'll have hoppers above
each of the dispensers and then like the

858
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:17,650
each of the dispensers and then like the
 

859
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,590
each of the dispensers and then like the
guy operating the cannon is gonna be up

860
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
guy operating the cannon is gonna be up
 

861
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,470
guy operating the cannon is gonna be up
at the top here and he'll be able to see

862
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
at the top here and he'll be able to see
 

863
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,630
at the top here and he'll be able to see
oh there's a guy over there I think I

864
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
oh there's a guy over there I think I
 

865
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,030
oh there's a guy over there I think I
gotta throw in a a TNT over here it'll

866
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,040
gotta throw in a a TNT over here it'll
 

867
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,790
gotta throw in a a TNT over here it'll
go down to the dispenser but all the

868
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:29,800
go down to the dispenser but all the
 

869
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,350
go down to the dispenser but all the
other dispensers are gonna be empty all

870
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
other dispensers are gonna be empty all
 

871
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
other dispensers are gonna be empty all
right that way we don't have to load a

872
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,370
right that way we don't have to load a
 

873
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,820
right that way we don't have to load a
ton of TNT into this we don't have to

874
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:35,830
ton of TNT into this we don't have to
 

875
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,290
ton of TNT into this we don't have to
worry about the dispensers running out

876
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,300
worry about the dispensers running out
 

877
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,020
worry about the dispensers running out
of TNT oh that's not that's not the

878
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,030
of TNT oh that's not that's not the
 

879
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:45,900
of TNT oh that's not that's not the
right block and like it avoids the the

880
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:45,910
right block and like it avoids the the
 

881
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,830
right block and like it avoids the the
big problem cannons have cannons have a

882
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
big problem cannons have cannons have a
 

883
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
big problem cannons have cannons have a
habit of blowing up if you don't know

884
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:51,850
habit of blowing up if you don't know
 

885
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,540
habit of blowing up if you don't know
it's because because of user error so

886
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:54,550
it's because because of user error so
 

887
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,570
it's because because of user error so
you want to try avoid any possibility of

888
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:57,580
you want to try avoid any possibility of
 

889
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,660
you want to try avoid any possibility of
user error while using a cannon and to

890
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:00,670
user error while using a cannon and to
 

891
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,970
user error while using a cannon and to
do that you don't want the person having

892
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:02,980
do that you don't want the person having
 

893
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,000
do that you don't want the person having
to place the TNT in the cannon somewhere

894
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,010
to place the TNT in the cannon somewhere
 

895
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,350
to place the TNT in the cannon somewhere
because if they put it in the wrong spot

896
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
because if they put it in the wrong spot
 

897
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,630
because if they put it in the wrong spot
that's that's what's gonna destroy it

898
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:09,640
that's that's what's gonna destroy it
 

899
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,610
that's that's what's gonna destroy it
this way because we're not actually

900
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:11,620
this way because we're not actually
 

901
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,100
this way because we're not actually
placing TNT we're throwing it there's no

902
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,110
placing TNT we're throwing it there's no
 

903
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,760
placing TNT we're throwing it there's no
chance of us causing an explosion

904
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:16,770
chance of us causing an explosion
 

905
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,280
chance of us causing an explosion
somewhere hopefully all right and then

906
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,290
somewhere hopefully all right and then
 

907
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,720
somewhere hopefully all right and then
we'll run the ring of redstone around

908
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:21,730
we'll run the ring of redstone around
 

909
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,930
we'll run the ring of redstone around
this and we just got to send that a

910
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:24,940
this and we just got to send that a
 

911
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,080
this and we just got to send that a
pulse at the whatever timing we want so

912
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,090
pulse at the whatever timing we want so
 

913
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,400
pulse at the whatever timing we want so
I guess let's see if we can figure out

914
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,410
I guess let's see if we can figure out
 

915
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,750
I guess let's see if we can figure out
how we're gonna do the middle here we

916
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:30,760
how we're gonna do the middle here we
 

917
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,240
how we're gonna do the middle here we
still need our launching TNT the stuff

918
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,250
still need our launching TNT the stuff
 

919
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,730
still need our launching TNT the stuff
that drops into the water there and I

920
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:35,740
that drops into the water there and I
 

921
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,980
that drops into the water there and I
figured we'd do dispensers in the middle

922
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:37,990
figured we'd do dispensers in the middle
 

923
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,750
figured we'd do dispensers in the middle
we'll keep these full of TNT all the

924
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
we'll keep these full of TNT all the
 

925
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,320
we'll keep these full of TNT all the
time if we can and have them all face

926
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,330
time if we can and have them all face
 

927
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,289
time if we can and have them all face
each other let's go over here

928
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:46,299
each other let's go over here
 

929
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:48,329
each other let's go over here
should we do either should we do 12 I

930
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:48,339
should we do either should we do 12 I
 

931
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:53,190
should we do either should we do 12 I
think it's probably good right we'll try

932
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
think it's probably good right we'll try
 

933
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,320
think it's probably good right we'll try
8 first off and we want to be able to

934
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,330
8 first off and we want to be able to
 

935
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,930
8 first off and we want to be able to
adjust these so not all eight get

936
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:57,940
adjust these so not all eight get
 

937
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,759
adjust these so not all eight get
triggered every time we want to be able

938
00:21:59,759 --> 00:21:59,769
triggered every time we want to be able
 

939
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:01,709
triggered every time we want to be able
to control the power of the cannon how

940
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:01,719
to control the power of the cannon how
 

941
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,589
to control the power of the cannon how
far it actually shoots cuz like if

942
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:04,599
far it actually shoots cuz like if
 

943
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,570
far it actually shoots cuz like if
somebody gets too close you still want

944
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:06,580
somebody gets too close you still want
 

945
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,379
somebody gets too close you still want
to be able to hit them right maybe I'll

946
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:10,389
to be able to hit them right maybe I'll
 

947
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,329
to be able to hit them right maybe I'll
do it like this actually let's go on top

948
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:12,339
do it like this actually let's go on top
 

949
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,629
do it like this actually let's go on top
here and have like another ring of

950
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:15,639
here and have like another ring of
 

951
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:21,329
here and have like another ring of
redstone up here and do it like this so

952
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:21,339
redstone up here and do it like this so
 

953
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,999
redstone up here and do it like this so
not a complete ring we will do it like

954
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:24,009
not a complete ring we will do it like
 

955
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:29,399
not a complete ring we will do it like
that and then either use buttons or

956
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:29,409
that and then either use buttons or
 

957
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:34,109
that and then either use buttons or
something else here so yeah redstone

958
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:34,119
something else here so yeah redstone
 

959
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,919
something else here so yeah redstone
only travels 15 blocks right so if we

960
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:37,929
only travels 15 blocks right so if we
 

961
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:43,409
only travels 15 blocks right so if we
have a bunch of buttons here like over

962
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:43,419
have a bunch of buttons here like over
 

963
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,879
have a bunch of buttons here like over
here and that triggers the redstone line

964
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:47,889
here and that triggers the redstone line
 

965
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:51,239
here and that triggers the redstone line
the closer one will go farther than the

966
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:51,249
the closer one will go farther than the
 

967
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:54,749
the closer one will go farther than the
farther one right so the closer one will

968
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:54,759
farther one right so the closer one will
 

969
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:57,239
farther one right so the closer one will
try set up so it's it triggers all the

970
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,249
try set up so it's it triggers all the
 

971
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:59,190
try set up so it's it triggers all the
dispensers all eight of them and then

972
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
dispensers all eight of them and then
 

973
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,919
dispensers all eight of them and then
the one one block farther away or two

974
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:01,929
the one one block farther away or two
 

975
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:03,299
the one one block farther away or two
blocks farther away it will only trigger

976
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:03,309
blocks farther away it will only trigger
 

977
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:06,329
blocks farther away it will only trigger
three sets and another lonely control

978
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:06,339
three sets and another lonely control
 

979
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:08,039
three sets and another lonely control
two sets and one will you control one

980
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,049
two sets and one will you control one
 

981
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:11,579
two sets and one will you control one
set maybe oh I say you know we could

982
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:11,589
set maybe oh I say you know we could
 

983
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:16,109
set maybe oh I say you know we could
maybe use a an item frame right I think

984
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:16,119
maybe use a an item frame right I think
 

985
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,649
maybe use a an item frame right I think
I got them on me because we got eight

986
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:19,659
I got them on me because we got eight
 

987
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,029
I got them on me because we got eight
dispensers and this has eight outputs

988
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
dispensers and this has eight outputs
 

989
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,409
dispensers and this has eight outputs
right or eight degrees of power how does

990
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:25,419
right or eight degrees of power how does
 

991
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:29,999
right or eight degrees of power how does
that work again I hardly use these if we

992
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:30,009
that work again I hardly use these if we
 

993
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,499
that work again I hardly use these if we
have a comparator here can you get it

994
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:31,509
have a comparator here can you get it
 

995
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:34,969
have a comparator here can you get it
from the side I don't know

996
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:34,979
from the side I don't know
 

997
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,489
from the side I don't know
now I decide doesn't work it's gonna be

998
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:37,499
now I decide doesn't work it's gonna be
 

999
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:43,310
now I decide doesn't work it's gonna be
actually on the block uh-huh so if we

1000
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,320
actually on the block uh-huh so if we
 

1001
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,539
actually on the block uh-huh so if we
cause it gonna be a behind the block

1002
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:45,549
cause it gonna be a behind the block
 

1003
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,499
cause it gonna be a behind the block
actually interesting like I never use

1004
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:49,509
actually interesting like I never use
 

1005
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:54,389
actually interesting like I never use
these hardly yeah that would work and I

1006
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:54,399
these hardly yeah that would work and I
 

1007
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,489
these hardly yeah that would work and I
think it's one to eight right or zero

1008
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:56,499
think it's one to eight right or zero
 

1009
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:59,850
think it's one to eight right or zero
two eight zero to seven maybe one

1010
00:23:59,850 --> 00:23:59,860
two eight zero to seven maybe one
 

1011
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,630
two eight zero to seven maybe one
two three four five six hope too far too

1012
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
two three four five six hope too far too
 

1013
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,220
two three four five six hope too far too
far one two three four five six seven

1014
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,230
far one two three four five six seven
 

1015
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,270
far one two three four five six seven
eight

1016
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,280
eight
 

1017
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,730
eight
it does go to eights really and then

1018
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:14,740
it does go to eights really and then
 

1019
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,220
it does go to eights really and then
that's oh it it doesn't go to zero it

1020
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,230
that's oh it it doesn't go to zero it
 

1021
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,680
that's oh it it doesn't go to zero it
goes to one okay one two eight how do we

1022
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:22,690
goes to one okay one two eight how do we
 

1023
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,289
goes to one okay one two eight how do we
make that work because this travels two

1024
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:25,299
make that work because this travels two
 

1025
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:28,320
make that work because this travels two
blocks and that only travels one each

1026
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,330
blocks and that only travels one each
 

1027
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,770
blocks and that only travels one each
each flick mm so we could easily control

1028
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:31,780
each flick mm so we could easily control
 

1029
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,830
each flick mm so we could easily control
like four degrees of power I don't know

1030
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:34,840
like four degrees of power I don't know
 

1031
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,630
like four degrees of power I don't know
about all eight-year unless we do

1032
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
about all eight-year unless we do
 

1033
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,340
about all eight-year unless we do
something fancy what happens if we what

1034
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,350
something fancy what happens if we what
 

1035
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,049
something fancy what happens if we what
if we put a piston in the middle here

1036
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:43,059
if we put a piston in the middle here
 

1037
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,810
if we put a piston in the middle here
let's try something let's go down here

1038
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:45,820
let's try something let's go down here
 

1039
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,320
let's try something let's go down here
where we can blow stuff up if you have a

1040
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,330
where we can blow stuff up if you have a
 

1041
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:57,210
where we can blow stuff up if you have a
dispenser here and a piston here and the

1042
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:57,220
dispenser here and a piston here and the
 

1043
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,919
dispenser here and a piston here and the
arm blocks the dispenser I don't think

1044
00:24:58,919 --> 00:24:58,929
arm blocks the dispenser I don't think
 

1045
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:04,110
arm blocks the dispenser I don't think
it'll launch the TNT right oh let's just

1046
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,120
it'll launch the TNT right oh let's just
 

1047
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,750
it'll launch the TNT right oh let's just
make sure um we don't have a lever okay

1048
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
make sure um we don't have a lever okay
 

1049
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,090
make sure um we don't have a lever okay
I guess I'll have to stand here so if

1050
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,100
I guess I'll have to stand here so if
 

1051
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,450
I guess I'll have to stand here so if
that's there and then we trigger the

1052
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:15,460
that's there and then we trigger the
 

1053
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,080
that's there and then we trigger the
dispenser is it gonna shoot the TNT oh

1054
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,090
dispenser is it gonna shoot the TNT oh
 

1055
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:25,620
dispenser is it gonna shoot the TNT oh
it does really what if it's a full block

1056
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:25,630
it does really what if it's a full block
 

1057
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,950
it does really what if it's a full block
let's try with a full block arm doesn't

1058
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:28,960
let's try with a full block arm doesn't
 

1059
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,390
let's try with a full block arm doesn't
work oh it still works okay all right

1060
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,400
work oh it still works okay all right
 

1061
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,919
work oh it still works okay all right
that idea is nothing I thought we could

1062
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:37,929
that idea is nothing I thought we could
 

1063
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:40,650
that idea is nothing I thought we could
like block four of them with the piston

1064
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:40,660
like block four of them with the piston
 

1065
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,130
like block four of them with the piston
and control that all right guys so this

1066
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,140
and control that all right guys so this
 

1067
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,600
and control that all right guys so this
episode is actually starting it a little

1068
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,610
episode is actually starting it a little
 

1069
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,430
episode is actually starting it a little
bit long I decided I'll just work out

1070
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
bit long I decided I'll just work out
 

1071
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,780
bit long I decided I'll just work out
the last couple pieces here off camera

1072
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:48,790
the last couple pieces here off camera
 

1073
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,120
the last couple pieces here off camera
and show them to you so this is our

1074
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,130
and show them to you so this is our
 

1075
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,340
and show them to you so this is our
device for triggering the the middle

1076
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,350
device for triggering the the middle
 

1077
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,130
device for triggering the the middle
dispensers here and depending on where

1078
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:56,140
dispensers here and depending on where
 

1079
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,820
dispensers here and depending on where
the item frame is controls two four six

1080
00:25:59,820 --> 00:25:59,830
the item frame is controls two four six
 

1081
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,159
the item frame is controls two four six
or eight dispensers so this is our first

1082
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:02,169
or eight dispensers so this is our first
 

1083
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:04,289
or eight dispensers so this is our first
setting to actually launch a cannon I

1084
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:04,299
setting to actually launch a cannon I
 

1085
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,940
setting to actually launch a cannon I
decided to put the button right in the

1086
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:05,950
decided to put the button right in the
 

1087
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,530
decided to put the button right in the
middle of the cannon so no matter where

1088
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:07,540
middle of the cannon so no matter where
 

1089
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,840
middle of the cannon so no matter where
we are on the platform here we should be

1090
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:09,850
we are on the platform here we should be
 

1091
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,070
we are on the platform here we should be
able to reach this easily

1092
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,080
able to reach this easily
 

1093
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,799
able to reach this easily
you press it there's red

1094
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:12,809
you press it there's red
 

1095
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,930
you press it there's red
on top on top of that goes to the piston

1096
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:14,940
on top on top of that goes to the piston
 

1097
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,759
on top on top of that goes to the piston
that goes down and another comparator

1098
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:16,769
that goes down and another comparator
 

1099
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:20,570
that goes down and another comparator
and lets a signal through so let's just

1100
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:20,580
and lets a signal through so let's just
 

1101
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,239
and lets a signal through so let's just
check this out show it to you working so

1102
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:23,249
check this out show it to you working so
 

1103
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,249
check this out show it to you working so
at this setting here it's at the first

1104
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:25,259
at this setting here it's at the first
 

1105
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,830
at this setting here it's at the first
set of dispensers only travels to there

1106
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
set of dispensers only travels to there
 

1107
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,519
set of dispensers only travels to there
if we flip this two times it goes to up

1108
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:31,529
if we flip this two times it goes to up
 

1109
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,129
if we flip this two times it goes to up
to here two more times

1110
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:34,139
to here two more times
 

1111
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:37,940
to here two more times
it goes to six and you know what happens

1112
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:37,950
it goes to six and you know what happens
 

1113
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,710
it goes to six and you know what happens
on the last set goes all the way around

1114
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:39,720
on the last set goes all the way around
 

1115
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,139
on the last set goes all the way around
so triggers all eight so that's pretty

1116
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:42,149
so triggers all eight so that's pretty
 

1117
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:44,210
so triggers all eight so that's pretty
cool now the other thing we got to

1118
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,220
cool now the other thing we got to
 

1119
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,090
cool now the other thing we got to
figure out is how to add delay before

1120
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:47,100
figure out is how to add delay before
 

1121
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,109
figure out is how to add delay before
triggering our ring here because we want

1122
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:51,119
triggering our ring here because we want
 

1123
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,180
triggering our ring here because we want
to press a button and then have a little

1124
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,190
to press a button and then have a little
 

1125
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,940
to press a button and then have a little
bit of a delay and then trigger the

1126
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:54,950
bit of a delay and then trigger the
 

1127
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,359
bit of a delay and then trigger the
actual projectile TNT and we if possible

1128
00:26:59,359 --> 00:26:59,369
actual projectile TNT and we if possible
 

1129
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,919
actual projectile TNT and we if possible
we'd like to be able to control that -

1130
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:00,929
we'd like to be able to control that -
 

1131
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:03,350
we'd like to be able to control that -
remember I said one of my first things I

1132
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
remember I said one of my first things I
 

1133
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,259
remember I said one of my first things I
designed was a variable timer and it was

1134
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:06,269
designed was a variable timer and it was
 

1135
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:09,259
designed was a variable timer and it was
like a 10 by 10 area so I worked out

1136
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:09,269
like a 10 by 10 area so I worked out
 

1137
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:11,960
like a 10 by 10 area so I worked out
something a little bit fancy here this

1138
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:11,970
something a little bit fancy here this
 

1139
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,730
something a little bit fancy here this
basically does the same thing as my old

1140
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:13,740
basically does the same thing as my old
 

1141
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,129
basically does the same thing as my old
timer except it all fits in neat little

1142
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:16,139
timer except it all fits in neat little
 

1143
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:20,019
timer except it all fits in neat little
package here you might recognize this

1144
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:20,029
package here you might recognize this
 

1145
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:22,690
package here you might recognize this
these six blocks here this is a pretty

1146
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:22,700
these six blocks here this is a pretty
 

1147
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,180
these six blocks here this is a pretty
popular timer to set up thing maybe I'll

1148
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,190
popular timer to set up thing maybe I'll
 

1149
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,980
popular timer to set up thing maybe I'll
show you show you that first because

1150
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:27,990
show you show you that first because
 

1151
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,889
show you show you that first because
that's the basis of this was it like

1152
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:30,899
that's the basis of this was it like
 

1153
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,480
that's the basis of this was it like
this turn these two subtracts and there

1154
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:35,490
this turn these two subtracts and there
 

1155
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,580
this turn these two subtracts and there
we go so now if you power that it takes

1156
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:37,590
we go so now if you power that it takes
 

1157
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,649
we go so now if you power that it takes
a long time for the signal to decay once

1158
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:42,659
a long time for the signal to decay once
 

1159
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,789
a long time for the signal to decay once
the button goes off you can see it

1160
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:43,799
the button goes off you can see it
 

1161
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,889
the button goes off you can see it
starts to fade out and then it finally

1162
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:45,899
starts to fade out and then it finally
 

1163
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,320
starts to fade out and then it finally
shuts off so I that's basically what we

1164
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,330
shuts off so I that's basically what we
 

1165
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,710
shuts off so I that's basically what we
do over here and then we control how

1166
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:51,720
do over here and then we control how
 

1167
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,470
do over here and then we control how
long it takes to fade off using our item

1168
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,480
long it takes to fade off using our item
 

1169
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,180
long it takes to fade off using our item
frame here that's also and subtracts oh

1170
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,190
frame here that's also and subtracts oh
 

1171
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,649
frame here that's also and subtracts oh
I should sleep here real quick one sec

1172
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:00,659
I should sleep here real quick one sec
 

1173
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,340
I should sleep here real quick one sec
okay so check this out this is like with

1174
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,350
okay so check this out this is like with
 

1175
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,739
okay so check this out this is like with
no delay on our variable timer here so

1176
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:06,749
no delay on our variable timer here so
 

1177
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:08,960
no delay on our variable timer here so
we press the button that turns on like

1178
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:08,970
we press the button that turns on like
 

1179
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,940
we press the button that turns on like
right away right flip it one more time

1180
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:10,950
right away right flip it one more time
 

1181
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,430
right away right flip it one more time
and it's a little bit longer a little

1182
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
and it's a little bit longer a little
 

1183
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,249
and it's a little bit longer a little
bit longer and I think every time we

1184
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:19,259
bit longer and I think every time we
 

1185
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:24,109
bit longer and I think every time we
flip it it adds two ticks of delay so at

1186
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:24,119
flip it it adds two ticks of delay so at
 

1187
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,110
flip it it adds two ticks of delay so at
16 range basically

1188
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120

 

1189
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,770

all right

1190
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:30,780
all right
 

1191
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,450
all right
only problem is on the last one here

1192
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:34,460
only problem is on the last one here
 

1193
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,860
only problem is on the last one here
because these wooden wooden buttons only

1194
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:36,870
because these wooden wooden buttons only
 

1195
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:42,110
because these wooden wooden buttons only
last 15 ticks and this is 16 ticks it's

1196
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,120
last 15 ticks and this is 16 ticks it's
 

1197
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,660
last 15 ticks and this is 16 ticks it's
not quite long enough of a pulse like if

1198
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:44,670
not quite long enough of a pulse like if
 

1199
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,130
not quite long enough of a pulse like if
we use a lever it'll be fine

1200
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:46,140
we use a lever it'll be fine
 

1201
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,040
we use a lever it'll be fine
but or a pressure plate or something

1202
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,050
but or a pressure plate or something
 

1203
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,270
but or a pressure plate or something
like if we stand on here this will

1204
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,280
like if we stand on here this will
 

1205
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,570
like if we stand on here this will
eventually turn on you see that so we

1206
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:53,580
eventually turn on you see that so we
 

1207
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,550
eventually turn on you see that so we
got to add a little bit extra delay if

1208
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:55,560
got to add a little bit extra delay if
 

1209
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,150
got to add a little bit extra delay if
we want to use a wooden button which we

1210
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,160
we want to use a wooden button which we
 

1211
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,950
we want to use a wooden button which we
might end up doing with a cannon just so

1212
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:00,960
might end up doing with a cannon just so
 

1213
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,850
might end up doing with a cannon just so
we have the full range how do we do this

1214
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:04,860
we have the full range how do we do this
 

1215
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:11,150
we have the full range how do we do this
let's put a block here and something

1216
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,160
let's put a block here and something
 

1217
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,390
let's put a block here and something
like this should work great I think so

1218
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,400
like this should work great I think so
 

1219
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,600
like this should work great I think so
oh and we gonna maybe add to that yeah

1220
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:20,610
oh and we gonna maybe add to that yeah
 

1221
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,930
oh and we gonna maybe add to that yeah
it does turn on now though all right

1222
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:23,940
it does turn on now though all right
 

1223
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,880
it does turn on now though all right
cool so I'm going to try and stall that

1224
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:25,890
cool so I'm going to try and stall that
 

1225
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,470
cool so I'm going to try and stall that
on the cannon and it should be about

1226
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:27,480
on the cannon and it should be about
 

1227
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,470
on the cannon and it should be about
done then ah yeah yeah so there we go

1228
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
done then ah yeah yeah so there we go
 

1229
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,410
done then ah yeah yeah so there we go
guys that is our final cannon design the

1230
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:33,420
guys that is our final cannon design the
 

1231
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,630
guys that is our final cannon design the
bare-bones redstone to it and all that

1232
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
bare-bones redstone to it and all that
 

1233
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,700
bare-bones redstone to it and all that
not exactly a work of arts to behold but

1234
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:40,710
not exactly a work of arts to behold but
 

1235
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,080
not exactly a work of arts to behold but
hopefully it works that's all I care

1236
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,090
hopefully it works that's all I care
 

1237
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,220
hopefully it works that's all I care
about

1238
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,230
about
 

1239
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,130
about
I did notice that's sticking out a bit

1240
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,140
I did notice that's sticking out a bit
 

1241
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,900
I did notice that's sticking out a bit
far I'm hoping this shot doesn't fly up

1242
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:47,910
far I'm hoping this shot doesn't fly up
 

1243
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,640
far I'm hoping this shot doesn't fly up
and hit that might need to change that

1244
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:49,650
and hit that might need to change that
 

1245
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,260
and hit that might need to change that
to slabs or something if it's in the way

1246
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,270
to slabs or something if it's in the way
 

1247
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,330
to slabs or something if it's in the way
but yeah an important part of this as

1248
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:56,340
but yeah an important part of this as
 

1249
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,310
but yeah an important part of this as
you can see we got nothing really

1250
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
you can see we got nothing really
 

1251
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,520
you can see we got nothing really
blocking that the shooting area there's

1252
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,530
blocking that the shooting area there's
 

1253
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,220
blocking that the shooting area there's
no like columns that run up to the top

1254
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,230
no like columns that run up to the top
 

1255
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,230
no like columns that run up to the top
part there so everything all the

1256
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
part there so everything all the
 

1257
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,940
part there so everything all the
controls are self-contained at the top

1258
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:07,950
controls are self-contained at the top
 

1259
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,580
controls are self-contained at the top
which is really important and I made a

1260
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:10,590
which is really important and I made a
 

1261
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,410
which is really important and I made a
couple little tweaks to this so that it

1262
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:12,420
couple little tweaks to this so that it
 

1263
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,570
couple little tweaks to this so that it
looks balanced instead of having the

1264
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:14,580
looks balanced instead of having the
 

1265
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,980
looks balanced instead of having the
thing in the middle we now have it on

1266
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:15,990
thing in the middle we now have it on
 

1267
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,140
thing in the middle we now have it on
the left and the right here we got our

1268
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,150
the left and the right here we got our
 

1269
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,760
the left and the right here we got our
shot power on the left here that

1270
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:19,770
shot power on the left here that
 

1271
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,550
shot power on the left here that
controls this part over here and then we

1272
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:22,560
controls this part over here and then we
 

1273
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,790
controls this part over here and then we
got the delay which controls the ring

1274
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:25,800
got the delay which controls the ring
 

1275
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,360
got the delay which controls the ring
down here and basically like just like

1276
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,370
down here and basically like just like
 

1277
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,090
down here and basically like just like
we saw before let's see if we can get

1278
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,100
we saw before let's see if we can get
 

1279
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,290
we saw before let's see if we can get
over here with our our timer here the

1280
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:36,300
over here with our our timer here the
 

1281
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,110
over here with our our timer here the
redstone torch goes down and then it

1282
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
redstone torch goes down and then it
 

1283
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,190
redstone torch goes down and then it
goes to I think

1284
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,200
goes to I think
 

1285
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,129
goes to I think
five repeater set at four so it's 20

1286
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:43,139
five repeater set at four so it's 20
 

1287
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:45,169
five repeater set at four so it's 20
ticks a delay and then it finally goes

1288
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:45,179
ticks a delay and then it finally goes
 

1289
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,980
ticks a delay and then it finally goes
to the ring and ignites our projectile

1290
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:48,990
to the ring and ignites our projectile
 

1291
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,009
to the ring and ignites our projectile
TNT so bare minimum we're gonna have 20

1292
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:52,019
TNT so bare minimum we're gonna have 20
 

1293
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,009
TNT so bare minimum we're gonna have 20
ticks of delay here plus the 16 from our

1294
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:55,019
ticks of delay here plus the 16 from our
 

1295
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,279
ticks of delay here plus the 16 from our
shot delay maximum and I think I got

1296
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:58,289
shot delay maximum and I think I got
 

1297
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,810
shot delay maximum and I think I got
maybe a couple other ticks of delay

1298
00:30:59,810 --> 00:30:59,820
maybe a couple other ticks of delay
 

1299
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,379
maybe a couple other ticks of delay
somewhere as well so it's gonna be

1300
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:03,389
somewhere as well so it's gonna be
 

1301
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:06,590
somewhere as well so it's gonna be
around 40 max without hopefully

1302
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:06,600
around 40 max without hopefully
 

1303
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,629
around 40 max without hopefully
exceeding that if it exceeds it the

1304
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:08,639
exceeding that if it exceeds it the
 

1305
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:10,460
exceeding that if it exceeds it the
cannons are gonna blow up is the problem

1306
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:10,470
cannons are gonna blow up is the problem
 

1307
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,389
cannons are gonna blow up is the problem
and I did put in our little extra delay

1308
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:14,399
and I did put in our little extra delay
 

1309
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,370
and I did put in our little extra delay
that we needed for the button so we got

1310
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:16,380
that we needed for the button so we got
 

1311
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,220
that we needed for the button so we got
the full range but anyways guys let's

1312
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,230
the full range but anyways guys let's
 

1313
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,019
the full range but anyways guys let's
give this a try this is the fun part now

1314
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:21,029
give this a try this is the fun part now
 

1315
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,840
give this a try this is the fun part now
I set up five targets we got a red one a

1316
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:23,850
I set up five targets we got a red one a
 

1317
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,899
I set up five targets we got a red one a
lime green green one up there orange and

1318
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:26,909
lime green green one up there orange and
 

1319
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:29,930
lime green green one up there orange and
a yellow one over there I doubt we're

1320
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:29,940
a yellow one over there I doubt we're
 

1321
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,360
a yellow one over there I doubt we're
gonna be able to hit them too well but

1322
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,370
gonna be able to hit them too well but
 

1323
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,279
gonna be able to hit them too well but
we'll see like if we can hit all five

1324
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:34,289
we'll see like if we can hit all five
 

1325
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:36,470
we'll see like if we can hit all five
that would be amazing but I don't think

1326
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
that would be amazing but I don't think
 

1327
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,990
that would be amazing but I don't think
we have that kind of control still even

1328
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,000
we have that kind of control still even
 

1329
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,409
we have that kind of control still even
with all our our stuff here but we'll

1330
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:42,419
with all our our stuff here but we'll
 

1331
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,389
with all our our stuff here but we'll
see let's aim for the green one first I

1332
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
see let's aim for the green one first I
 

1333
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,659
see let's aim for the green one first I
think that's gonna be the easiest to hit

1334
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:46,669
think that's gonna be the easiest to hit
 

1335
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,759
think that's gonna be the easiest to hit
so this is our center over here

1336
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:49,769
so this is our center over here
 

1337
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:53,120
so this is our center over here
I don't know I'm assuming hopefully if

1338
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,130
I don't know I'm assuming hopefully if
 

1339
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,220
I don't know I'm assuming hopefully if
we throw one in here it's gonna veer a

1340
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,230
we throw one in here it's gonna veer a
 

1341
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,470
we throw one in here it's gonna veer a
bit to the right and we'll change our

1342
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:57,480
bit to the right and we'll change our
 

1343
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,080
bit to the right and we'll change our
shot power to maybe four for tea and tea

1344
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,090
shot power to maybe four for tea and tea
 

1345
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,210
shot power to maybe four for tea and tea
okay and our delay let's just set that a

1346
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,220
okay and our delay let's just set that a
 

1347
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,680
okay and our delay let's just set that a
little bit higher I don't know what we

1348
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:09,690
little bit higher I don't know what we
 

1349
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,830
little bit higher I don't know what we
would need that's probably good and

1350
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:12,840
would need that's probably good and
 

1351
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,899
would need that's probably good and
hopefully it doesn't blow up this is

1352
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:14,909
hopefully it doesn't blow up this is
 

1353
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:16,340
hopefully it doesn't blow up this is
gonna be our first launch guys are you

1354
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,350
gonna be our first launch guys are you
 

1355
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,049
gonna be our first launch guys are you
ready here we go that's such a scary

1356
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:21,059
ready here we go that's such a scary
 

1357
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:25,759
ready here we go that's such a scary
sound oh okay that veered more right

1358
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:25,769
sound oh okay that veered more right
 

1359
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:27,560
sound oh okay that veered more right
than I expected

1360
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:27,570
than I expected
 

1361
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,180
than I expected
I just realized we're actually missing

1362
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,190
I just realized we're actually missing
 

1363
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,519
I just realized we're actually missing
something on here I think there's a

1364
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:31,529
something on here I think there's a
 

1365
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:34,580
something on here I think there's a
chance the TNT might fly up up up there

1366
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:34,590
chance the TNT might fly up up up there
 

1367
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,509
chance the TNT might fly up up up there
and explode but maybe not I'm not sure

1368
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:38,519
and explode but maybe not I'm not sure
 

1369
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:48,549
and explode but maybe not I'm not sure
exactly okay let's try oh ah really no

1370
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
exactly okay let's try oh ah really no
 

1371
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,659
exactly okay let's try oh ah really no
oh that sucks the TNT is exploding our

1372
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:53,669
oh that sucks the TNT is exploding our
 

1373
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:54,019
oh that sucks the TNT is exploding our
item

1374
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:54,029
item
 

1375
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:57,080
item
frames it was almost perfect guys almost

1376
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,090
frames it was almost perfect guys almost
 

1377
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,820
frames it was almost perfect guys almost
but we're back to the drawing board now

1378
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:58,830
but we're back to the drawing board now
 

1379
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,029
but we're back to the drawing board now
I think no matter how many blocks we

1380
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:02,039
I think no matter how many blocks we
 

1381
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,700
I think no matter how many blocks we
throw in front of it it's still gonna

1382
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:03,710
throw in front of it it's still gonna
 

1383
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,779
throw in front of it it's still gonna
kill the item frame right yeah

1384
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:08,789
kill the item frame right yeah
 

1385
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:12,680
kill the item frame right yeah
lame so we just have to have the proper

1386
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:12,690
lame so we just have to have the proper
 

1387
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,359
lame so we just have to have the proper
distance I guess let's try figure out

1388
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:14,369
distance I guess let's try figure out
 

1389
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,719
distance I guess let's try figure out
what that is let's go over here I think

1390
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:17,729
what that is let's go over here I think
 

1391
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,799
what that is let's go over here I think
it's eight blocks

1392
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:18,809
it's eight blocks
 

1393
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,639
it's eight blocks
if I remember right I think that's the

1394
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:22,649
if I remember right I think that's the
 

1395
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:24,799
if I remember right I think that's the
next range of TMT is that inside the

1396
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:24,809
next range of TMT is that inside the
 

1397
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:29,299
next range of TMT is that inside the
block what was that a visual glitch it

1398
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:29,309
block what was that a visual glitch it
 

1399
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:39,039
block what was that a visual glitch it
was visual okay let's go one closer and

1400
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:39,049

 

1401
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:44,450

yeah it's gotta be this far let's count

1402
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:44,460
yeah it's gotta be this far let's count
 

1403
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,139
yeah it's gotta be this far let's count
how many blocks that is so it's one two

1404
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:48,149
how many blocks that is so it's one two
 

1405
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:50,570
how many blocks that is so it's one two
three four five six seven eight

1406
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:50,580
three four five six seven eight
 

1407
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,820
three four five six seven eight
oh it's safe at eight so the easiest way

1408
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:55,830
oh it's safe at eight so the easiest way
 

1409
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,799
oh it's safe at eight so the easiest way
to fix this is just to lower the

1410
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:57,809
to fix this is just to lower the
 

1411
00:33:57,809 --> 00:33:59,539
to fix this is just to lower the
launching platform so I dropped it down

1412
00:33:59,539 --> 00:33:59,549
launching platform so I dropped it down
 

1413
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,700
launching platform so I dropped it down
three blocks hopefully that's far enough

1414
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:01,710
three blocks hopefully that's far enough
 

1415
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,369
three blocks hopefully that's far enough
away at the danger with that though is

1416
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:04,379
away at the danger with that though is
 

1417
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,019
away at the danger with that though is
like the TNT shoots out of those

1418
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:06,029
like the TNT shoots out of those
 

1419
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:09,049
like the TNT shoots out of those
dispensers at a random angle and if it

1420
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:09,059
dispensers at a random angle and if it
 

1421
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:11,119
dispensers at a random angle and if it
lands within those the inner ring of

1422
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,129
lands within those the inner ring of
 

1423
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:14,450
lands within those the inner ring of
trapdoors there when the TNT launches it

1424
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:14,460
trapdoors there when the TNT launches it
 

1425
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,789
trapdoors there when the TNT launches it
it might ram against the fence cuz the

1426
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:16,799
it might ram against the fence cuz the
 

1427
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,740
it might ram against the fence cuz the
fence is higher and then gets stuck up

1428
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:18,750
fence is higher and then gets stuck up
 

1429
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,019
fence is higher and then gets stuck up
there and blow up the launching platform

1430
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:21,029
there and blow up the launching platform
 

1431
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:22,669
there and blow up the launching platform
and probably a little bit of our cannon

1432
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:22,679
and probably a little bit of our cannon
 

1433
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,569
and probably a little bit of our cannon
but we'll see we'll see how it goes here

1434
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:25,579
but we'll see we'll see how it goes here
 

1435
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:29,690
but we'll see we'll see how it goes here
let's go back up hopefully it's far

1436
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:29,700
let's go back up hopefully it's far
 

1437
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,339
let's go back up hopefully it's far
enough away we might need to go one

1438
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:31,349
enough away we might need to go one
 

1439
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:36,549
enough away we might need to go one
lower but we will see put these back

1440
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:36,559
lower but we will see put these back
 

1441
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:41,029
lower but we will see put these back
okay so let's get this back to let's go

1442
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:41,039
okay so let's get this back to let's go
 

1443
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,399
okay so let's get this back to let's go
for six this time shot delay will put up

1444
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:43,409
for six this time shot delay will put up
 

1445
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,240
for six this time shot delay will put up
and let's aim I don't think we'll be

1446
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,250
and let's aim I don't think we'll be
 

1447
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,909
and let's aim I don't think we'll be
able to hit that that green targets so

1448
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
able to hit that that green targets so
 

1449
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,899
able to hit that that green targets so
it's kind of in-between these two angles

1450
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:52,909
it's kind of in-between these two angles
 

1451
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,039
it's kind of in-between these two angles
mm-hmm

1452

mm-hmm
 

1453
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:57,260

what went wrong ah you know we should
have put a ring of slabs on the inside

1466

have put a ring of slabs on the inside
 

1467
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,829
have put a ring of slabs on the inside
and outside of the dispensers if we put

1468
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:22,839
and outside of the dispensers if we put
 

1469
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,510
and outside of the dispensers if we put
them one block lower I bet you that

them one block lower I bet you that
 

1471
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,870
them one block lower I bet you that
would prevent the TNT from straying but
