it's not definite or anything i just

138
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
it's not definite or anything i just
 

139
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,790
it's not definite or anything i just
thought of it within the last 30 minutes

140
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
thought of it within the last 30 minutes
 

141
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,070
thought of it within the last 30 minutes
or so so it's

142
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
or so so it's
 

143
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,869
or so so it's
probably gonna change too uh but the

144
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
probably gonna change too uh but the
 

145
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,750
probably gonna change too uh but the
main goal is

146
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
main goal is
 

147
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,309
main goal is
of course to summon the wither skeletons

148
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
of course to summon the wither skeletons
 

149
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,149
of course to summon the wither skeletons
or not summon them but spawn them

150
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
or not summon them but spawn them
 

151
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,949
or not summon them but spawn them
in the mob system so that we can get

152
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
in the mob system so that we can get
 

153
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,309
in the mob system so that we can get
their skulls

154
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
their skulls
 

155
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,229
their skulls
so that we can summon the wither boss

156
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
so that we can summon the wither boss
 

157
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,030
so that we can summon the wither boss
and then

158
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040

00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
and then get their stars and be able to
 

161
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,710
and then get their stars and be able to
make beacons so it's that

162
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
make beacons so it's that
 

163
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,270

spawn
how they spawn um some of their

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
how they spawn um some of their
 

177
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,789
how they spawn um some of their
movements and

178
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
movements and
 

179
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,949
movements and
stuff like that and i've got most of it

180
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
stuff like that and i've got most of it
 

181
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,149
stuff like that and i've got most of it
figured out

182
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
figured out
 

183
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,509
figured out
uh one thing i'm doing right now though

184
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
uh one thing i'm doing right now though
 

185
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,869
uh one thing i'm doing right now though
with these torches i'm trying to figure

186
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
with these torches i'm trying to figure
 

187
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,350
with these torches i'm trying to figure
out if

188
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
out if
 

189
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,309
out if
light level matters uh with all the

190
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
light level matters uh with all the
 

191
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,429
light level matters uh with all the
other nether

192
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
other nether
 

193
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,670
other nether
mobs it doesn't so you would think it

194
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
mobs it doesn't so you would think it
 

195
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,550
mobs it doesn't so you would think it
went with them

196
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
went with them
 

197
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,429
went with them
but ever since i put these torches up i

198
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
but ever since i put these torches up i
 

199
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,070
but ever since i put these torches up i
haven't seen

200
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
haven't seen
 

201
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,189
haven't seen
one near them so

202
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
one near them so
 

203
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,710
one near them so
nothing's definite yet but that's one

204
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
nothing's definite yet but that's one
 

205
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,469
nothing's definite yet but that's one
thing i'm watching out for right now

206
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
thing i'm watching out for right now
 

207
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,909
thing i'm watching out for right now
just kind of running back and forth

208
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
just kind of running back and forth
 

209
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,990
just kind of running back and forth
and looking um

210
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
and looking um
 

211
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,430
and looking um
one thing i did figure out though is

212
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
one thing i did figure out though is
 

213
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,189
one thing i did figure out though is
they can spawn in a two block high

214
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
they can spawn in a two block high
 

215
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,150
they can spawn in a two block high
area and i stumbled across this by

216
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
area and i stumbled across this by
 

217
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,710
area and i stumbled across this by
chance

218
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
chance
 

219
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,710
chance
i had i had one spawned like that

220
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
i had i had one spawned like that
 

221
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,950
i had i had one spawned like that
and his head was stuck in the ceiling

222
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
and his head was stuck in the ceiling
 

223
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,990
and his head was stuck in the ceiling
and he wasn't able

224
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
and he wasn't able
 

225
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,030
and he wasn't able
to move so even though they can spawn in

226
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
to move so even though they can spawn in
 

227
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,030
to move so even though they can spawn in
a two block high area their collision

228
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
a two block high area their collision
 

229
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,150
a two block high area their collision
box seems to be

230
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
box seems to be
 

231
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,990
box seems to be
bigger and they can't actually get out

232
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
bigger and they can't actually get out
 

233
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,870
bigger and they can't actually get out
of it so

234
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
of it so
 

235
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,469
of it so
that's interesting that means i can have

236
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
that's interesting that means i can have
 

237
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,590
that's interesting that means i can have
a too high spawning area

238
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
a too high spawning area
 

239
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,350
a too high spawning area
and they wouldn't be able to chase after

240
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
and they wouldn't be able to chase after
 

241
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,150
and they wouldn't be able to chase after
me i could have them stuck there

242
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
me i could have them stuck there
 

243
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,909
me i could have them stuck there
so that's one thing i'm thinking about

244
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
so that's one thing i'm thinking about
 

245
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,629
so that's one thing i'm thinking about
doing

246
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639

 

247
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,670

with whatever i build my mob system out

248
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
with whatever i build my mob system out
 

249
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,310
with whatever i build my mob system out
of i'll

250
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
of i'll
 

251
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,629
of i'll
probably want to avoid using this nether

252
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
probably want to avoid using this nether
 

253
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,909
probably want to avoid using this nether
brick because

254
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
brick because
 

255
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,670
brick because
it's really dark and it sucks for

256
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
it's really dark and it sucks for
 

257
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,990
it's really dark and it sucks for
youtube so i would probably pick

258
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
youtube so i would probably pick
 

259
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,749
youtube so i would probably pick
cobblestone stone brick or stone slabs

260
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
cobblestone stone brick or stone slabs
 

261
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,950
cobblestone stone brick or stone slabs
the white ones

262
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
the white ones
 

263
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,150
the white ones
those look pretty good in the nether

264
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
those look pretty good in the nether
 

265
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,749
those look pretty good in the nether
and i would want to build it out

266
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
and i would want to build it out
 

267
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,749
and i would want to build it out
above the lava lake here not in this

00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
above the lava lake here not in this
 

269

because these wither skeletons they

272
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
because these wither skeletons they
 

273
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,550
because these wither skeletons they
share their mob count with

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
share their mob count with

so if they're spawning outside of my

280
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
so if they're spawning outside of my
 

281
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,310
so if they're spawning outside of my
trap

283
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,510

like these guys are um

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
like these guys are um

like these guys are um
it's gonna lower my rates ideally i

286
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
it's gonna lower my rates ideally i
 

287
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,430
it's gonna lower my rates ideally i
would want to blow everything up

288
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
would want to blow everything up
 

289
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,070
would want to blow everything up
outside of my traps so that they

290
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
outside of my traps so that they
 

291
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,510
outside of my traps so that they
couldn't spawn because

292
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
couldn't spawn because
 

293
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,350
couldn't spawn because
the nether is just full of holes like

294
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
the nether is just full of holes like
 

295
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,550
the nether is just full of holes like
that and

296
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
that and
 

297
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,550
that and
in the ceiling there's holes everywhere

298
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
in the ceiling there's holes everywhere
 

299
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,550
in the ceiling there's holes everywhere
underground

300
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
underground
 

301
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,390
underground
it's really hard to get them all unless

302
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
it's really hard to get them all unless
 

303
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,909
it's really hard to get them all unless
you just blow

304
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
you just blow
 

305
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,189
you just blow
everything up but i don't really plan on

306
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
everything up but i don't really plan on
 

307
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,550
everything up but i don't really plan on
doing that so this is

308
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
doing that so this is
 

309
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,909
doing that so this is
a good spot oh

310
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919

 

311
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,950

i did not mean to jump there that scared

312
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
i did not mean to jump there that scared
 

313
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,469
i did not mean to jump there that scared
me

314
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
me
 

315
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,990
me
this is a good spot because most of the

316
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
this is a good spot because most of the
 

317
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,510
this is a good spot because most of the
work is done for us already with this

318
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
work is done for us already with this
 

319
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,230
work is done for us already with this
lava lake

320
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240

 

321
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,909

um so i

322
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
um so i
 

323
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,350
um so i
yeah i'm gonna probably just level the

324
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
yeah i'm gonna probably just level the
 

325
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,070
yeah i'm gonna probably just level the
fortress

326
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
fortress
 

327
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,350
fortress
and build rooms out of like cobble

328
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
and build rooms out of like cobble
 

329
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,790
and build rooms out of like cobble
or something uh two blocks high

330
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
or something uh two blocks high
 

331
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,710
or something uh two blocks high
might set up minecart tracks and that in

332
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
might set up minecart tracks and that in
 

333
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,270
might set up minecart tracks and that in
it to increase my mobility

334
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
it to increase my mobility
 

335
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,350
it to increase my mobility
or i might rely on speed potions to get

336
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
or i might rely on speed potions to get
 

337
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,790
or i might rely on speed potions to get
around quick

338
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
around quick
 

339
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,270
around quick
um as far as killing them goes to get

340
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
um as far as killing them goes to get
 

341
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,029
um as far as killing them goes to get
the mob drops i think we have to kill

342
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
the mob drops i think we have to kill
 

343
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,870
the mob drops i think we have to kill

as far as i've understood they spawn
 

357
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,230
as far as i've understood they spawn
only in other fortresses but you can

358
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
only in other fortresses but you can
 

359
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,189
only in other fortresses but you can
kind of expand them like where they

360
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
kind of expand them like where they
 

361
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,150
kind of expand them like where they
spawn

362
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
spawn
 

363
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,189
spawn
within the fortress by

364
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
within the fortress by
 

365
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,029
within the fortress by
building within a chunk that has part of

366
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
building within a chunk that has part of
 

367
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,830
building within a chunk that has part of
a fortress in so

368
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840

 

369
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,270

oh

371
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,189

there we go um well i get four blocks

372
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
there we go um well i get four blocks
 

373
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,150
there we go um well i get four blocks
of the fortress is in a chunk we can we

374
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
of the fortress is in a chunk we can we
 

375
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,790
of the fortress is in a chunk we can we
can build

376
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
can build
 

377
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,390
can build
into the whole chunk because it counts

378
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
into the whole chunk because it counts
 

379
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,469
into the whole chunk because it counts
the whole chunk type thing

380
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479

moment um
 

385
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,670
moment um
you can expand it that way and when it

386
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
you can expand it that way and when it
 

387
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,270
you can expand it that way and when it
tries to spawn the wither skeletons it

388
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
tries to spawn the wither skeletons it
 

389
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,950
tries to spawn the wither skeletons it
checks that chunk

390
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
checks that chunk
 

391
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,670
checks that chunk
but it also checks a bounding box around

392
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
but it also checks a bounding box around
 

393
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,230
but it also checks a bounding box around
the fortress which i think extends seven

394

the fortress which i think extends seven
 

395
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,950
the fortress which i think extends seven
blocks

blocks
 

397
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,390
blocks
above the path i don't know exactly how

398
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
above the path i don't know exactly how
 

399
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,510
above the path i don't know exactly how
that works like if

400
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
that works like if
 

401
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,350
that works like if
like if it checks from the highest point

402
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
like if it checks from the highest point
 

403
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,390
