so Kay that was odd so when I pick up

52
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:23,640
so Kay that was odd so when I pick up
 

53
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,630
so Kay that was odd so when I pick up
the XP then they should get let down for

54
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
the XP then they should get let down for
 

55
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,270
the XP then they should get let down for
the next next load of them huh oh I

56
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280
the next next load of them huh oh I
 

57
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,130
the next next load of them huh oh I
almost got it now I got to figure out

58
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,140
almost got it now I got to figure out
 

59
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,899
almost got it now I got to figure out
why the crusher activated there yeah I'm

60
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:38,909
why the crusher activated there yeah I'm
 

61
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,450
why the crusher activated there yeah I'm
not really sure I'm looking at this this

62
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:41,460
not really sure I'm looking at this this
 

63
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,010
not really sure I'm looking at this this
doesn't make any sense to me at all I

64
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,020
doesn't make any sense to me at all I
 

65
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,590

just added the redstone here right this

66
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
just added the redstone here right this
 

67
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,149
just added the redstone here right this
is a little delayed checker thing I

68
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:47,159
is a little delayed checker thing I
 

69
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,310
is a little delayed checker thing I
added so it checks to make sure items

70
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
added so it checks to make sure items
 

71
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,870
added so it checks to make sure items
are off that iron pressure plate for a

72
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:53,880
are off that iron pressure plate for a
 

73
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,760
are off that iron pressure plate for a
certain amount of time before it

74
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:55,770
certain amount of time before it
 

75
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,260

confirms that I picked up all the XP

76
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,270
confirms that I picked up all the XP
 

77

right somehow that redstone over there

78
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:03,149
right somehow that redstone over there
 

79
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,120
right somehow that redstone over there
is activating this hopper clock here and

80
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,130
is activating this hopper clock here and
 

81
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,059
is activating this hopper clock here and
they are not connected

82

they are not connected
 

83
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,720
they are not connected
which has me so confused unless maybe

84
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,730
which has me so confused unless maybe
 

85
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,819
which has me so confused unless maybe
I'm being tricked let's try something up

86
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:16,829
I'm being tricked let's try something up
 

87
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm being tricked let's try something up
here so there's a trick you can do with

88
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,450
here so there's a trick you can do with
 

89
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,890
here so there's a trick you can do with
pistons by the way normally if I use the

90
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:21,900
pistons by the way normally if I use the
 

91
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,619
pistons by the way normally if I use the
solid block here and we had a redstone

92
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:24,629
solid block here and we had a redstone
 

93
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,750
solid block here and we had a redstone
signal above it would power both of

94
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,760
signal above it would power both of
 

95
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,580
signal above it would power both of
these Pistons but if you just use a half

96
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:28,590
these Pistons but if you just use a half
 

97
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,890
these Pistons but if you just use a half
slab it only powers this top one and not

98
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:30,900
slab it only powers this top one and not
 

99
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,199
slab it only powers this top one and not
the bottom one which I need in this case

100
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,209
the bottom one which I need in this case
 

101
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,490
the bottom one which I need in this case
but maybe maybe I'm wrong now it only

102
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:37,500
but maybe maybe I'm wrong now it only
 

103
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,559
but maybe maybe I'm wrong now it only
activates the top one all right I'm so

104
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:42,569
activates the top one all right I'm so
 

105
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:51,080
activates the top one all right I'm so
confused okay here we go again guys yeah

this this row goes over to the Nexus and

166
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:17,700
this this row goes over to the Nexus and
 

167
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,550
this this row goes over to the Nexus and
some other stuff

168
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:21,560

 

169
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,959

I'm not sure if I should get rid of the

170
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:23,969
I'm not sure if I should get rid of the
 

171
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,790
I'm not sure if I should get rid of the
reeds here or what I kind of want to

172
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
reeds here or what I kind of want to
 

173
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,749
reeds here or what I kind of want to
have a straight wall going over top them

174
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:28,759
have a straight wall going over top them
 

175
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,119
have a straight wall going over top them
because of the sand launcher thing if we

176
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:32,129
because of the sand launcher thing if we
 

177
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,450
because of the sand launcher thing if we
built the wall up in front here I think

178
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,460
built the wall up in front here I think
 

179
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,420
built the wall up in front here I think
the sand would run into it right let's

180
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,430
the sand would run into it right let's
 

181
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,260
the sand would run into it right let's
see how high we can build before it does

182
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,270
see how high we can build before it does
 

183
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,459
see how high we can build before it does
is it going to hit that if it's gonna

184
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:43,469
is it going to hit that if it's gonna
 

185
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:47,629
is it going to hit that if it's gonna
hit that it's gonna hit the wall dududu

186
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:47,639
hit that it's gonna hit the wall dududu
 

187
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,409
hit that it's gonna hit the wall dududu
come on man hurry up people are waiting

up or so so that is a it's not going to

194
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
up or so so that is a it's not going to
 

195
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,529
up or so so that is a it's not going to
work if we like build around the reeds

196
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:03,539
work if we like build around the reeds
 

197
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,839
work if we like build around the reeds
we have to go just straight across here

198
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:05,849
we have to go just straight across here
 

199
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,409
we have to go just straight across here
I think yeah so we might just rip these

200
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419
I think yeah so we might just rip these
 

201
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,300
I think yeah so we might just rip these
out because there's no conceivable way I

202
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,310
out because there's no conceivable way I
 

203
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,700
out because there's no conceivable way I
can think of where you would ever build

204
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:13,710
can think of where you would ever build
 

205
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,040
can think of where you would ever build
over top plants like a wall over top

206
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,050
over top plants like a wall over top
 

207

211
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,409
bit of a stick break here I'm in the
middle of building and ran out of food

212
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:24,419
middle of building and ran out of food
 

213
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,589

there's a sweep attack with swords so it

220
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
there's a sweep attack with swords so it
 

221
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,740
there's a sweep attack with swords so it
doesn't just attack one mob attacks

222

pushes and back I don't think it
 

229
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,800
pushes and back I don't think it
actually damages them so around the

230
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:51,810
actually damages them so around the
 

231
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,249
actually damages them so around the
targets you can see it pretty clearly it

232
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:55,259
targets you can see it pretty clearly it
 

233
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,529

these gates I really liked how these
gates look by the way even though they

272
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
gates look by the way even though they
 

273
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,500
gates look by the way even though they
don't have much texture to them like not

don't have much texture to them like not
 

275
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,260
don't have much texture to them like not
many block variations I just love the

276
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,270
many block variations I just love the
 

277
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,110
many block variations I just love the
shape of them I think it's really nice

278
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
shape of them I think it's really nice
 

279

um got another one over here
 

281
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,800
um got another one over here
and the whole place is enclosed now it

282
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:06,810
and the whole place is enclosed now it
 

283
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,200
and the whole place is enclosed now it
gives it a good feeling I think we have

284
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,210
gives it a good feeling I think we have
 

285
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,420
gives it a good feeling I think we have
all this free space so like all this

286
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,430
all this free space so like all this
 

287
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,689
all this free space so like all this
over here and over here where we had the

288
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:14,699
over here and over here where we had the
 

289
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,370
over here and over here where we had the
reeds there I filled it in so we can

290
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,380
reeds there I filled it in so we can
 

291
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,010
reeds there I filled it in so we can
build something here as well and in this

292
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,020
build something here as well and in this
 

293
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,560
build something here as well and in this
corner once we do all that once we get

294
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,570
corner once we do all that once we get
 

295
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,390
corner once we do all that once we get
houses in here or whatever I want to put

296
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,400
houses in here or whatever I want to put
 

297
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,040
houses in here or whatever I want to put
then the city is done so it's getting

298
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,050
then the city is done so it's getting
 

299
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,439
then the city is done so it's getting
there it's kind of a big project this is

300
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:30,449
there it's kind of a big project this is
 

301
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,379
there it's kind of a big project this is
all part of the whole biome enhancement

302
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:33,389
all part of the whole biome enhancement
 

303
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,409

idea by the way so this was just empty

304
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:36,419
idea by the way so this was just empty
 

305
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,980

sand empty desert here for a long time

306
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:39,990
sand empty desert here for a long time
 

307
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,649

and I wanted to do something make it
 

309
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,260
and I wanted to do something make it
more interesting and I think it's kind

310
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,270
more interesting and I think it's kind
 

311
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,560
more interesting and I think it's kind
of doing the trick right and it looks

312
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:48,570
of doing the trick right and it looks
 

313
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,659
of doing the trick right and it looks
kind of cool I love those gates my

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,460
launches TNT randomly oh snap okay so
for our firework Lake here we have

478
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,470
for our firework Lake here we have
 

479
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,650
for our firework Lake here we have
firework launchers they activate

480
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:31,660
firework launchers they activate
 

481
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,440
firework launchers they activate
randomly but I want a TNT cannon that

482
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,450
randomly but I want a TNT cannon that
 

483
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,220
randomly but I want a TNT cannon that
does it too so normally you don't want

484
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,230
does it too so normally you don't want
 

485
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,290
does it too so normally you don't want
something like that TNT has to be

486
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:40,300
something like that TNT has to be
 

487
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,220
something like that TNT has to be
activated somewhat precisely otherwise

488
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,230
activated somewhat precisely otherwise
 

489
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,220
activated somewhat precisely otherwise
it blows up all over the place right but

490
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,230
it blows up all over the place right but
 

491
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,170
it blows up all over the place right but
you know it might not be that difficult

492
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,180
you know it might not be that difficult
 

493
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,340
you know it might not be that difficult
oh I broke the slime block it's fine we

494
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,350
oh I broke the slime block it's fine we
 

495
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,380
oh I broke the slime block it's fine we
didn't replace it there we go good as

496
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:55,390
didn't replace it there we go good as
 

497
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,560
didn't replace it there we go good as
new

498
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,570
new
 

499
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,980
new
so yeah we'll fill this up with TNT

500
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:57,990
so yeah we'll fill this up with TNT
 

501
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,180
so yeah we'll fill this up with TNT
we'll just do something really simple

502
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,190
we'll just do something really simple
 

503
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,040
we'll just do something really simple
here slime block will launch the TNT up

504
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,050
here slime block will launch the TNT up
 

505
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,110
here slime block will launch the TNT up
vertically and it will kind of be like

506
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,120
vertically and it will kind of be like
 

507
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,720
vertically and it will kind of be like
the old vertical TNT cannons we used to

508
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:06,730
the old vertical TNT cannons we used to
 

509
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,550
the old vertical TNT cannons we used to
build okay so here's what we're gonna do

510
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:11,560
build okay so here's what we're gonna do
 

511
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,590
build okay so here's what we're gonna do
we're gonna have a randomizer right so

512
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
we're gonna have a randomizer right so
 

513
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,230
we're gonna have a randomizer right so
we'll fill this up with a few few items

514
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
we'll fill this up with a few few items
 

515
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,150
we'll fill this up with a few few items
that don't stack and then one item that

516
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
that don't stack and then one item that
 

517
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,150
that don't stack and then one item that
does and just put that in here for right

518
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,160
does and just put that in here for right
 

519
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,460
does and just put that in here for right
now this is just the test anyway so if

520
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,470
now this is just the test anyway so if
 

521
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,730
now this is just the test anyway so if
it selects the the chainsaw it will send

522
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:26,740
it selects the the chainsaw it will send
 

523
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,890
it selects the the chainsaw it will send
a signal out two or three blocks

524
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:28,900
a signal out two or three blocks
 

525
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,170
a signal out two or three blocks
actually otherwise it will only send it

526
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,180
actually otherwise it will only send it
 

527
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,530
actually otherwise it will only send it
out one block so let's do this redstone

528
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:37,540
out one block so let's do this redstone
 

529
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,710
out one block so let's do this redstone
to our TNT dispenser thing okay and then

530
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
to our TNT dispenser thing okay and then
 

531
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,280
to our TNT dispenser thing okay and then
TNT takes four seconds to blow up right

532
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,290
TNT takes four seconds to blow up right
 

533
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,530
TNT takes four seconds to blow up right
yeah let's hope I'm right hopefully that

534
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:49,540
yeah let's hope I'm right hopefully that
 

535
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,319
yeah let's hope I'm right hopefully that
didn't change so probably at the

536
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:52,329
didn't change so probably at the
 

537
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,559
didn't change so probably at the
doing the two and three second area is

538
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:55,569
doing the two and three second area is
 

539
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,179
doing the two and three second area is
where we're going to want the piston to

540
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:57,189
where we're going to want the piston to
 

541
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:00,419
where we're going to want the piston to
activate so here let's just get this

542
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:00,429
activate so here let's just get this
 

543
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:04,259
activate so here let's just get this
down to the ground like so and we'll

544
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:04,269
down to the ground like so and we'll
 

545
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,960
down to the ground like so and we'll
just see if we can get the right timing

546
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:05,970
just see if we can get the right timing
 

547
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,979
just see if we can get the right timing
so that was four eight twelve sixteen

548
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:10,989
so that was four eight twelve sixteen
 

549
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:14,789
so that was four eight twelve sixteen
two seconds right there let's wrap it

550
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:14,799
two seconds right there let's wrap it
 

551
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:21,809
two seconds right there let's wrap it
back like a so two two point four two

552
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:21,819
back like a so two two point four two
 

553
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,960
back like a so two two point four two
point eight

554
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:23,970
point eight
 

555
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,910
point eight
should we go longer that's probably

556
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:26,920
should we go longer that's probably
 

557
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,220
should we go longer that's probably
about right okay so I think that was

558
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,230
about right okay so I think that was
 

559
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,150
about right okay so I think that was
three seconds so with the firework

560
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,160
three seconds so with the firework
 

561
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,439
three seconds so with the firework
launchers there there's a clock that

562
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:34,449
launchers there there's a clock that
 

563
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,479
launchers there there's a clock that
runs constantly as well so we'll set up

564
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:36,489
runs constantly as well so we'll set up
 

565
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:41,220
runs constantly as well so we'll set up
that over here just to mimic it okay

566
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,230
that over here just to mimic it okay
 

567
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,400
that over here just to mimic it okay
it's the regular clock nothing too fancy

568
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,410
it's the regular clock nothing too fancy
 

569
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,289
it's the regular clock nothing too fancy
Oh actually let's do it like this back

570
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:49,299
Oh actually let's do it like this back
 

571
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:54,600
Oh actually let's do it like this back
like this okay so that's everything

572
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:54,610
like this okay so that's everything
 

573
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,979
like this okay so that's everything
right I think so let's let's hope I did

574
00:13:58,979 --> 00:13:58,989
right I think so let's let's hope I did
 

575
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:02,479
right I think so let's let's hope I did
this right so now if we send this to

576
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:02,489
this right so now if we send this to
 

577
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,819
this right so now if we send this to
there it's going to pick one of those

578
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:05,829
there it's going to pick one of those
 

579
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:09,689
there it's going to pick one of those
items at random yeah and the the Pistons

580
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:09,699
items at random yeah and the the Pistons
 

581
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:12,299
items at random yeah and the the Pistons
triggering okay so if we figure this out

582
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:12,309
triggering okay so if we figure this out
 

583
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,309
triggering okay so if we figure this out
all correctly we should just be able to

584
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:14,319
all correctly we should just be able to
 

585
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,409
all correctly we should just be able to
throw some TNT in here and it will never

586
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:16,419
throw some TNT in here and it will never
 

587
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:22,289
throw some TNT in here and it will never
blow up the redstone that seems wrong

588
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:22,299
blow up the redstone that seems wrong
 

589
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:27,470
blow up the redstone that seems wrong
because I just saw I will just try it oh

590
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:27,480
because I just saw I will just try it oh
 

591
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,350
because I just saw I will just try it oh
why why so many oh my goodness oh my

592
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
why why so many oh my goodness oh my
 

593
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,480
why why so many oh my goodness oh my
gosh stop it stop

594
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:37,490

 

595
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,739

oh snap why did it shoot so many alright

596
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:44,749
oh snap why did it shoot so many alright
 

597
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:49,210
oh snap why did it shoot so many alright
I rebuilt it everything's good I slowed

598
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,220
I rebuilt it everything's good I slowed
 

599
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,879
I rebuilt it everything's good I slowed
down the clock this diamond I also

600
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:51,889
down the clock this diamond I also
 

601
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,859
down the clock this diamond I also
increased the number of items in here so

602
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:53,869
increased the number of items in here so
 

603
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,379
increased the number of items in here so
there's only a one in five chance of the

604
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:56,389
there's only a one in five chance of the
 

605
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,549
there's only a one in five chance of the
picking chainsaw it looks like it's not

606
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:00,559
picking chainsaw it looks like it's not
 

607
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,079
picking chainsaw it looks like it's not
gonna do it this time but I don't know I

608
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,089
gonna do it this time but I don't know I
 

609
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,840
gonna do it this time but I don't know I
felt like I got tricked there too like

610
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:04,850
felt like I got tricked there too like
 

611
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,780
felt like I got tricked there too like
why did it shoot so many TNT I expected

612
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:07,790
why did it shoot so many TNT I expected
 

613
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,809
why did it shoot so many TNT I expected
maybe a few not that many though I feel

614
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:13,819
maybe a few not that many though I feel
 

615
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,460
maybe a few not that many though I feel
like it's safe to put the TNT didn't

616
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:15,470
like it's safe to put the TNT didn't
 

617
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,910
like it's safe to put the TNT didn't
this time I'm only gonna put 12 in no.6

618
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:20,920
this time I'm only gonna put 12 in no.6
 

619
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,079
this time I'm only gonna put 12 in no.6
see if it does it again okay I think

620
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,089
see if it does it again okay I think
 

621
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,970
see if it does it again okay I think
it's working fine now it must have just

622
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:27,980
it's working fine now it must have just
 

623
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,579
it's working fine now it must have just
been too fast yeah three seconds looks

624
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:30,589
been too fast yeah three seconds looks
 

625
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:31,150
been too fast yeah three seconds looks
good

626
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,160
good
 

627
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,019
good
that was like at the top of the arch

628
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:34,029
that was like at the top of the arch
 

629
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:40,030
that was like at the top of the arch
where it blew up and yeah it doesn't

630
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,040
where it blew up and yeah it doesn't
 

631
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,590
where it blew up and yeah it doesn't
shoot it too often we don't really need

632
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
shoot it too often we don't really need
 

633
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,210
shoot it too often we don't really need
it to shoot it very often it's just a

634
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:43,220

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,110
blocks is because you must hold space
for the gliders to work but if you hold

for the gliders to work but if you hold
 

711
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,000
for the gliders to work but if you hold
space on the slime block you don't

space unless I'm doing it wrong but it

722
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,100
space unless I'm doing it wrong but it
 

723
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,150
space unless I'm doing it wrong but it

I also saw in the comments so the reason

732
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,360
I also saw in the comments so the reason
 

733
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,000
I also saw in the comments so the reason
I was having trouble with my slime block

734
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,010
I was having trouble with my slime block
 

735
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,430
I was having trouble with my slime block
launcher is because sign blocks are

736
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,440
launcher is because sign blocks are
 

737
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,610
launcher is because sign blocks are
acting a little weird in 1.9 so maybe

738
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:41,620
acting a little weird in 1.9 so maybe
 

739
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,960
acting a little weird in 1.9 so maybe
they got to be fixed I don't know I

740
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:42,970
they got to be fixed I don't know I
 

741
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,520
they got to be fixed I don't know I
don't know don't know too much about

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,360
them but that's just what a few people
 

745
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,190
them but that's just what a few people
said so maybe that was a reason but

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,200
said so maybe that was a reason but
 

747
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,490
