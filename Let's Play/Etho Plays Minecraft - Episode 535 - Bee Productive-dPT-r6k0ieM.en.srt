00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:14,830
yeah so we want to build the bee farm in
 

89
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,290
yeah so we want to build the bee farm in
the end here but we don't want to build

90

the end here but we don't want to build
 

91
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,560
the end here but we don't want to build
it on the main island probably so so

92
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:19,570
it on the main island probably so so
 

93
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,400
it on the main island probably so so
that we don't have to worry about the

94
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,410
that we don't have to worry about the

through one of these portal things

98
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,530
through one of these portal things
 

99
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,670
through one of these portal things
oh you can't just walk through them yeah

100
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:26,680
oh you can't just walk through them yeah
 

101
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,710

102
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
it was curious I don't think I've ever
 

103
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,450
it was curious I don't think I've ever
done that before I always use the ender

104
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:30,460
done that before I always use the ender
 

105
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,370
done that before I always use the ender
pearl okay yeah this area over here

106
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:32,380
pearl okay yeah this area over here
 

107
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,170
pearl okay yeah this area over here
looks like it should work for the build

108
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,180
looks like it should work for the build
 

109
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,970
looks like it should work for the build
I was mostly concerned like I don't want

110
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:35,980
I was mostly concerned like I don't want
 

111
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,070
I was mostly concerned like I don't want
to build it over top the void in case I

112
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
to build it over top the void in case I
 

113
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,590
to build it over top the void in case I
fall while building you know I like the

114
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:40,600
fall while building you know I like the
 

115
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,390
fall while building you know I like the
idea of having the island underneath us

116
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
idea of having the island underneath us
 

117
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,910
idea of having the island underneath us
as like a safety net as we make this

118
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:44,920
as like a safety net as we make this
 

119
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,010
as like a safety net as we make this
thing so we're gonna come out of the

120
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,020
thing so we're gonna come out of the
 

121
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,800
thing so we're gonna come out of the
portal here we'll probably have some

122
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:49,810
portal here we'll probably have some
 

123
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,000
portal here we'll probably have some
sort of a room like we'll come out we'll

124
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,010
sort of a room like we'll come out we'll
 

125
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,220
sort of a room like we'll come out we'll
have a room in this room we'll have

126
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,230
have a room in this room we'll have
 

127
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,350
have a room in this room we'll have
storage for all the honey we collect

128
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,360
storage for all the honey we collect
 

129
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,890
storage for all the honey we collect
from the bee farm so I'm guessing this

130
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:01,900
from the bee farm so I'm guessing this
 

131
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,320
from the bee farm so I'm guessing this
room's gonna be at least 9 or 11 blocks

132
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,330
room's gonna be at least 9 or 11 blocks
 

133
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,090
room's gonna be at least 9 or 11 blocks
wide so this is 11 here and then beyond

134
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,100
wide so this is 11 here and then beyond
 

135
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,740
wide so this is 11 here and then beyond
that is gonna be where we actually make

136
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:10,750
that is gonna be where we actually make
 

137
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,140
that is gonna be where we actually make
the honey so I just put down a bit of a

138
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,150
the honey so I just put down a bit of a
 

139
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,850
the honey so I just put down a bit of a
floor next to this portal thing we're

140
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:14,860
floor next to this portal thing we're
 

141
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,590
floor next to this portal thing we're
gonna go through and make sure we

142
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:16,600
gonna go through and make sure we
 

143
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,110
gonna go through and make sure we
actually land on this and not on the end

144
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
actually land on this and not on the end
 

145
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,750
actually land on this and not on the end

you inside blocks even that I didn't
 

159
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,430
you inside blocks even that I didn't
expect let's try that again that was

160
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
expect let's try that again that was
 

161
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,089
expect let's try that again that was
interesting yeah or no it didn't put me

162
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:39,099
interesting yeah or no it didn't put me
 

163
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,339
interesting yeah or no it didn't put me
in blocks I'm just crouching right yeah

164
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:41,349
in blocks I'm just crouching right yeah
 

165
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:42,839
in blocks I'm just crouching right yeah
I thought it put me inside that block

166
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:42,849
I thought it put me inside that block
 

167
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:43,860
I thought it put me inside that block
over there for some reason

168
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:43,870
over there for some reason
 

169
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,020
over there for some reason
okay everybody so check it out we got

170
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,030
okay everybody so check it out we got
 

171
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,330
okay everybody so check it out we got
our basic layout to the beef farm all

172
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,340
our basic layout to the beef farm all
 

173
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,630
our basic layout to the beef farm all
set up here and it doesn't look the best

174
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:51,640
set up here and it doesn't look the best
 

175
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,559
set up here and it doesn't look the best
that's true

176
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:52,569
that's true
 

177
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,300
that's true
it's true but we're not really going for

178
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,310
it's true but we're not really going for
 

179
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,869
it's true but we're not really going for
looks with this be far more going for

180
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
looks with this be far more going for
 

181
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,759
looks with this be far more going for
efficiency and production which is why

182
00:03:59,759 --> 00:03:59,769
efficiency and production which is why
 

183
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,140
efficiency and production which is why
we're building it in the end in the

184
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,150
we're building it in the end in the
 

185
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,970
we're building it in the end in the
first place because if we build it in

186
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:02,980
first place because if we build it in
 

187
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,740
first place because if we build it in
the overworld the bees will sleep during

188
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:04,750
the overworld the bees will sleep during
 

189
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,619
the overworld the bees will sleep during
the nights and we want them working 24/7

190
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:07,629
the nights and we want them working 24/7
 

191
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,720
the nights and we want them working 24/7
so if we build it in the end they never

192
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:09,730
so if we build it in the end they never
 

193
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,690
so if we build it in the end they never
sleep it'll be busy as bees over here

194
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:12,700
sleep it'll be busy as bees over here
 

195
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,360
sleep it'll be busy as bees over here
alright um so yeah with this design we

196
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,370
alright um so yeah with this design we
 

197
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,909
alright um so yeah with this design we
got the bee farm beehive over here

198
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
got the bee farm beehive over here
 

199
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,580
got the bee farm beehive over here
flower right in front hoppers underneath

200
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:20,590
flower right in front hoppers underneath
 

201
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,409
flower right in front hoppers underneath
that this is supposed to be tilled land

202
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:22,419
that this is supposed to be tilled land
 

203
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,170
that this is supposed to be tilled land
but I got to set up some water for it to

204
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,180
but I got to set up some water for it to
 

205
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,870
but I got to set up some water for it to
keep it tilt and then when items land on

206
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:27,880
keep it tilt and then when items land on
 

207
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,610
keep it tilt and then when items land on
top of the tilled land here they go in

208
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:29,620
top of the tilled land here they go in
 

209
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,940
top of the tilled land here they go in
the hoppers down below here yeah so

210
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:32,950
the hoppers down below here yeah so
 

211
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,339
the hoppers down below here yeah so
whenever the beehive updates observer

212
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:35,349
whenever the beehive updates observer
 

213
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:38,310
whenever the beehive updates observer
triggers flips a trapdoor which one goes

214
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
triggers flips a trapdoor which one goes
 

215
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,770
triggers flips a trapdoor which one goes
down to the dispenser and that will have

216
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:40,780
down to the dispenser and that will have
 

217
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,200
down to the dispenser and that will have
some empty bottles in to collect the

218
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,210
some empty bottles in to collect the
 

219
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,640
some empty bottles in to collect the
honey or shears to make the honeycomb

220
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:46,650
honey or shears to make the honeycomb
 

221
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,529
honey or shears to make the honeycomb
but yeah we got the same basic design

222
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:49,539
but yeah we got the same basic design
 

223
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,770
but yeah we got the same basic design
copied four times so it's just mirrored

224
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:52,780
copied four times so it's just mirrored
 

225
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,270
copied four times so it's just mirrored
between these two and then we have

226
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,280
between these two and then we have
 

227
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,189
between these two and then we have
another set over here and now we're

228
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:56,199
another set over here and now we're
 

229
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,170
another set over here and now we're
gonna like start expanding it out this

230
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:58,180
gonna like start expanding it out this
 

231
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,310
gonna like start expanding it out this
way I'm thinking in blocks of like 15 so

232
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
way I'm thinking in blocks of like 15 so
 

233
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,890
way I'm thinking in blocks of like 15 so
this is our first first one here then 2

234
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:04,900
this is our first first one here then 2
 

235
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:12,750
this is our first first one here then 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 alright so we got 15

236
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,760
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 alright so we got 15
 

237
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,620
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 alright so we got 15
over here so that's gonna be 60 beehives

238
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:16,630
over here so that's gonna be 60 beehives
 

239
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,950
over here so that's gonna be 60 beehives
because 15 times 460 will probably aim

240
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:19,960
because 15 times 460 will probably aim
 

241
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,930
because 15 times 460 will probably aim
for like 120 with this farm and just

242
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:21,940
for like 120 with this farm and just
 

243
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,370
for like 120 with this farm and just
take it from there and see how that

244
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:23,380
take it from there and see how that
 

245
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,469
take it from there and see how that
works see how much honey we actually

246
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:25,479
works see how much honey we actually
 

247
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,900
works see how much honey we actually
produce I don't know like how big this

248
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:27,910
produce I don't know like how big this
 

249
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,869
produce I don't know like how big this
needs to be

250
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:33,879

 

251
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,950

probably should place the dispensers

252
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:35,960
probably should place the dispensers
 

253
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,100
probably should place the dispensers
first now I have to hold shift here

254
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,110
first now I have to hold shift here
 

255
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,830
first now I have to hold shift here
oopsies all right so I don't think this

256
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
oopsies all right so I don't think this
 

257
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,719
oopsies all right so I don't think this
should take us very long to build it's a

258
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:43,729
should take us very long to build it's a
 

259
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,089
should take us very long to build it's a
pretty simple design just copied many

260
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:46,099
pretty simple design just copied many
 

261
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,309
pretty simple design just copied many
times so it's just like how many

262
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:48,319
times so it's just like how many
 

263
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,429
times so it's just like how many
beehives do we actually want to set up

264
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:50,439
beehives do we actually want to set up
 

265
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,929
beehives do we actually want to set up
the big trouble we're gonna have is I'm

266
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:52,939
the big trouble we're gonna have is I'm
 

267
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,510
the big trouble we're gonna have is I'm
gonna run out of iron it takes a lot of

268
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
gonna run out of iron it takes a lot of
 

269
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,969
gonna run out of iron it takes a lot of
hoppers to build this thing and I don't

270
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:57,979
hoppers to build this thing and I don't
 

271
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,119
hoppers to build this thing and I don't
have a lot of iron left so we'll see how

272
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:01,129
have a lot of iron left so we'll see how
 

273
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,820
have a lot of iron left so we'll see how
far we can get with it and we still have

274
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:03,830
far we can get with it and we still have
 

275
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,480
far we can get with it and we still have
that issue with it possibly getting

276
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,490
that issue with it possibly getting
 

277
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,070
that issue with it possibly getting
jammed so I'm just gonna run like a

278
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,080
jammed so I'm just gonna run like a
 

279
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,409
jammed so I'm just gonna run like a
bunch of redstone over top the observers

280
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:11,419
bunch of redstone over top the observers
 

281
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,249
bunch of redstone over top the observers
here probably flip the trapdoor every so

282
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:15,259
here probably flip the trapdoor every so
 

283
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,140
here probably flip the trapdoor every so
often if it gets jammed that'll that'll

284
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,150
often if it gets jammed that'll that'll
 

285
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,159
often if it gets jammed that'll that'll
fix it and then that should be fine

286
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:21,169
fix it and then that should be fine
 

287
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,240
fix it and then that should be fine
the other thing that's gonna take a

288
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,250
the other thing that's gonna take a
 

289
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,320
the other thing that's gonna take a
bunch of time is breeding the bees once

290
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,330
bunch of time is breeding the bees once
 

291
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,969
bunch of time is breeding the bees once
we get this fully set up it's gonna take

292
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:27,979
we get this fully set up it's gonna take
 

293
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,010
we get this fully set up it's gonna take
a while to build up the population so

294
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,020
a while to build up the population so
 

295
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,709
a while to build up the population so
yeah otherwise it's it's an easy thing

296
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:32,719
yeah otherwise it's it's an easy thing
 

297
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:45,490
yeah otherwise it's it's an easy thing
to do awesome good stuff so check it out

298
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:45,500
to do awesome good stuff so check it out
 

299
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,680
to do awesome good stuff so check it out
we got our first section complete tier

300
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:47,690
we got our first section complete tier
 

301
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,200
we got our first section complete tier
60 beehives all set up ready to roll

302
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,210
60 beehives all set up ready to roll
 

303
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,860
60 beehives all set up ready to roll
ready for the bees and let's let's put

304
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:53,870
ready for the bees and let's let's put
 

305
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,689
ready for the bees and let's let's put
them in there so I brought over some bee

306
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:55,699
them in there so I brought over some bee
 

307
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,959
them in there so I brought over some bee
nests with us with a few bees inside now

308
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:58,969
nests with us with a few bees inside now
 

309
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,800
nests with us with a few bees inside now
the tricky part with with these we got

310
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:02,810
the tricky part with with these we got
 

311
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,140
the tricky part with with these we got
to make sure like when we place them and

312
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,150
to make sure like when we place them and
 

313
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,369
to make sure like when we place them and
break them afterwards that we don't

314
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:08,379
break them afterwards that we don't
 

315
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,719
break them afterwards that we don't
anger all the bees and have them sing us

back inside here now we're gonna start

342
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:53,069
back inside here now we're gonna start
 

343
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,070
back inside here now we're gonna start
the be breeding hopefully yeah or go

344
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
the be breeding hopefully yeah or go
 

345
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,109
the be breeding hopefully yeah or go
first baby bee it's gonna take a long

346
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:00,119
first baby bee it's gonna take a long
 

347
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,329
first baby bee it's gonna take a long
time because each hive can handle three

348
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:02,339
time because each hive can handle three
 

349
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,089
time because each hive can handle three
bees and we have 60 so that's a hundred

350
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,099
bees and we have 60 so that's a hundred
 

351
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,260
bees and we have 60 so that's a hundred
and eighty that we need here

352
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,270
and eighty that we need here
 

353
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,510
and eighty that we need here
the other big thing I just realized like

354
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
the other big thing I just realized like
 

355
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,179
the other big thing I just realized like
for each beehive we have one dispenser

356
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:14,189
for each beehive we have one dispenser
 

357
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,540
for each beehive we have one dispenser
and two hoppers for distributing like

358
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:17,550
and two hoppers for distributing like
 

359
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,869
and two hoppers for distributing like
the glass bottles or the shears so that

360
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
the glass bottles or the shears so that
 

361
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,359
the glass bottles or the shears so that
means to fill this up with last bottles

362
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:23,369
means to fill this up with last bottles
 

363
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,389
means to fill this up with last bottles
all of these all sixty of them is gonna

364
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:26,399
all of these all sixty of them is gonna
 

365
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,230
all of these all sixty of them is gonna
take like 42 over 42 chests of sand it's

366
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
take like 42 over 42 chests of sand it's
 

367
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,399
take like 42 over 42 chests of sand it's
melted into glass

368
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:31,409
melted into glass
 

369
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,819
melted into glass
and made into bottles so we're gonna

370
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:34,829
and made into bottles so we're gonna
 

371
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:38,360
and made into bottles so we're gonna
need a lot of sand which I wasn't

372
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,370
need a lot of sand which I wasn't
 

373
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,269
need a lot of sand which I wasn't
prepared for oh yeah you know this is

374
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
prepared for oh yeah you know this is
 

375
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,279
prepared for oh yeah you know this is
actually gonna be way harder to do than

376
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,289
actually gonna be way harder to do than
 

377
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,490
actually gonna be way harder to do than
I thought isn't it cuz like breeding the

378
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:46,500
I thought isn't it cuz like breeding the
 

379
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,439
I thought isn't it cuz like breeding the
bees is gonna take a couple hours here

380
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:48,449
bees is gonna take a couple hours here
 

381
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:52,639
bees is gonna take a couple hours here
maybe and then collecting the sand like

382
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:52,649
maybe and then collecting the sand like
 

383
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,319
maybe and then collecting the sand like
42 chests of sand that's gonna take a

384
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:54,329
42 chests of sand that's gonna take a
 

385
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,199
42 chests of sand that's gonna take a
couple hours - we might need to break

386
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:57,209
couple hours - we might need to break
 

387
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,809
couple hours - we might need to break
this up a bit the thing about the bees

388
00:08:59,809 --> 00:08:59,819
this up a bit the thing about the bees
 

389
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:01,189
this up a bit the thing about the bees
like you can breed them every five

390
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:01,199
like you can breed them every five
 

391
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,679
like you can breed them every five
minutes but like once they go into their

392
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:03,689
minutes but like once they go into their
 

393
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:05,840
minutes but like once they go into their
beehive they don't grow any more or they

394
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:05,850
beehive they don't grow any more or they
 

395
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,519
beehive they don't grow any more or they
don't the countdown doesn't go down

396
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:07,529
don't the countdown doesn't go down
 

397
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,460
don't the countdown doesn't go down
anymore as they're in the Beehive and

398
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,470
anymore as they're in the Beehive and
 

399
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,720
anymore as they're in the Beehive and
like when they're babies they don't grow

400
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:11,730
like when they're babies they don't grow
 

401
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,129
like when they're babies they don't grow
when they're in the Beehive and I think

402
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:13,139
when they're in the Beehive and I think
 

403
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,900
when they're in the Beehive and I think
they spend only like a quarter of their

404
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:14,910
they spend only like a quarter of their
 

405
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,079
they spend only like a quarter of their
time out of the Beehive so if you can

406
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,089
time out of the Beehive so if you can
 

407
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,610
time out of the Beehive so if you can
breed them every five minutes it's

408
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:19,620
breed them every five minutes it's
 

409
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,980
breed them every five minutes it's
actually like every 20 minutes then yeah

410
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:24,990
actually like every 20 minutes then yeah
 

411
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,660
actually like every 20 minutes then yeah
unless like what I've been doing is I've

412
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:26,670
unless like what I've been doing is I've
 

413
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,639
unless like what I've been doing is I've
just been standing here holding a flower

414
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:28,649
just been standing here holding a flower
 

415
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,490
just been standing here holding a flower
so that they don't go back inside so

416
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:31,500
so that they don't go back inside so
 

417
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,259
so that they don't go back inside so
that reduces the time for these first

418
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:33,269
that reduces the time for these first
 

419
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,790
that reduces the time for these first
few bees but eventually like there's

420
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
few bees but eventually like there's
 

421
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,920
few bees but eventually like there's
gonna be so many I can't do that for

422
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:36,930
gonna be so many I can't do that for
 

423
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,160
gonna be so many I can't do that for
them uh yeah I'm like really struggling

424
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,170
them uh yeah I'm like really struggling
 

425
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,110
them uh yeah I'm like really struggling
here I'm trying to decide like what to

426
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,120
here I'm trying to decide like what to
 

427
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,269
here I'm trying to decide like what to
do like I could just go farm that sand

428
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:44,279
do like I could just go farm that sand
 

429
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,120
do like I could just go farm that sand
like it's not a huge deal

430
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,130
like it's not a huge deal
 

431
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,520
like it's not a huge deal
but like I think it's really important

432
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:49,530
but like I think it's really important
 

433
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,930
but like I think it's really important
you build a witch farm in your world

434
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:50,940
you build a witch farm in your world
 

435
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,970
you build a witch farm in your world
before you build the beef farm so that

436
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:52,980
before you build the beef farm so that
 

437
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,410
before you build the beef farm so that
you can get the free bottles from the

438
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:54,420
you can get the free bottles from the
 

439
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,790
you can get the free bottles from the
witches to use with your your bee farm

440
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:57,800
witches to use with your your bee farm
 

441
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,500
witches to use with your your bee farm
we actually do have a witch farm it's

442
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,510
we actually do have a witch farm it's
 

443
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,740
we actually do have a witch farm it's
this really trash so originally we had

444
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:03,750
this really trash so originally we had
 

445
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,230
this really trash so originally we had
an arrow method like where we would

446
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
an arrow method like where we would
 

447
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,970
an arrow method like where we would
shoot the witches off of a platform with

448
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:07,980
shoot the witches off of a platform with
 

449
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,880
shoot the witches off of a platform with
arrows that was very gimmicky mostly did

450
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:10,890
arrows that was very gimmicky mostly did
 

451
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,460
arrows that was very gimmicky mostly did
just for fun then I tore that out and I

452
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,470
just for fun then I tore that out and I
 

453
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,260
just for fun then I tore that out and I
replaced it with a water system here

454
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,270
replaced it with a water system here
 

455
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,260
replaced it with a water system here
which is not good at all so I'm gonna

456
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,270
which is not good at all so I'm gonna
 

457
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,150
which is not good at all so I'm gonna
maybe switch this up with a shifting

458
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
maybe switch this up with a shifting
 

459
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,630
maybe switch this up with a shifting
floor system fortunately in my world

460
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:23,640
floor system fortunately in my world
 

461
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,120
floor system fortunately in my world
there there are no like dual witch farms

462
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,130
there there are no like dual witch farms
 

463
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,790
there there are no like dual witch farms
or quads like some people have you have

464
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
or quads like some people have you have
 

465
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,400
or quads like some people have you have
to like you have to pick a special seed

466
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,410
to like you have to pick a special seed
 

467
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,530
to like you have to pick a special seed
to get that pretty much like chances of

468
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:33,540
to get that pretty much like chances of
 

469
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,270
to get that pretty much like chances of
actually finding one of those randomly

470
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,280
actually finding one of those randomly
 

471
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,820
actually finding one of those randomly
are extremely low so probably the first

472
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:37,830
are extremely low so probably the first
 

473
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,170
are extremely low so probably the first
thing we should do is just make sure

474
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:39,180
thing we should do is just make sure
 

475
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,720
thing we should do is just make sure
shifting floors still work in the game I

476
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:41,730
shifting floors still work in the game I
 

477
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,000
shifting floors still work in the game I
know there was an issue I think a one

478
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,010
know there was an issue I think a one
 

479
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,280
know there was an issue I think a one
point four point one where mobs wouldn't

480
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,290
point four point one where mobs wouldn't
 

481
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,470
point four point one where mobs wouldn't
spawn on soul sand anymore I think

482
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
spawn on soul sand anymore I think
 

483
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
spawn on soul sand anymore I think
that's that's been fixed now again I

484
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:51,690
that's that's been fixed now again I
 

485
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,300
that's that's been fixed now again I
just want to make sure we can actually

486
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,310
just want to make sure we can actually
 

487
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,230
just want to make sure we can actually
fall through so I'm gonna stand on the

488
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,240
fall through so I'm gonna stand on the
 

489
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,830
fall through so I'm gonna stand on the
soul sand here press the button and yeah

490
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:00,840
soul sand here press the button and yeah
 

491
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,210
soul sand here press the button and yeah
I think we fell through here actually

492
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,220
I think we fell through here actually
 

493
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,650
I think we fell through here actually
let's add some barriers yours yes so

494
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:06,660
let's add some barriers yours yes so
 

495
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,960
let's add some barriers yours yes so
it's a little bit more clear try this

496
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:11,970
it's a little bit more clear try this
 

497
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,980
it's a little bit more clear try this
again so it doesn't go we don't fall

498
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:15,990
again so it doesn't go we don't fall
 

499
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,240
again so it doesn't go we don't fall
through on that we have to be standing

500
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,250
through on that we have to be standing
 

501
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,270
through on that we have to be standing
on the soul sand for it to happen yeah

502
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,280
on the soul sand for it to happen yeah
 

503
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
on the soul sand for it to happen yeah
and we fell through the ground okay

504
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:21,690
and we fell through the ground okay
 

505
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,070
and we fell through the ground okay
that's good if a mob spawns on the dirt

506
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,080
that's good if a mob spawns on the dirt
 

507
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,790
that's good if a mob spawns on the dirt
though the soul sand will will go over

508
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
though the soul sand will will go over
 

509
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,140
though the soul sand will will go over
and then it'll switch back and then

510
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,150
and then it'll switch back and then
 

511
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,940
and then it'll switch back and then
they'll fall through so yeah it looks

512
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:31,950
they'll fall through so yeah it looks
 

513
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,600
they'll fall through so yeah it looks
like that's still still fine okay so

514
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,610
like that's still still fine okay so
 

515
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,220
like that's still still fine okay so
we're gonna tear out this old wiring

516
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,230
we're gonna tear out this old wiring
 

517
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,470
we're gonna tear out this old wiring
here the hopper clock just runs up to a

518
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,480
here the hopper clock just runs up to a
 

519
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,210
here the hopper clock just runs up to a
bunch of dispensers with water buckets

520
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,220
bunch of dispensers with water buckets
 

521
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,340
bunch of dispensers with water buckets
in we're gonna get rid of all that and

522
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,350
in we're gonna get rid of all that and
 

523
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,070
in we're gonna get rid of all that and
then start fresh here

524
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,080

 

525
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,630

so to be honest I don't entirely know

526
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:51,640
so to be honest I don't entirely know
 

527
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,670
so to be honest I don't entirely know
how to build one of these but I'm gonna

528
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
how to build one of these but I'm gonna
 

529
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,080
how to build one of these but I'm gonna
try my best here and hopefully it'll

530
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,090
try my best here and hopefully it'll
 

531
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,300
try my best here and hopefully it'll
work hopefully I don't miss any crucial

532
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,310
work hopefully I don't miss any crucial
 

533
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,540
work hopefully I don't miss any crucial
detail to the design ah but yeah I think

534
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,550
detail to the design ah but yeah I think
 

535
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,610
detail to the design ah but yeah I think
all we got to do is like mixin soulsand

536
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:02,620
all we got to do is like mixin soulsand
 

537
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,810
all we got to do is like mixin soulsand
every second block and we originally had

538
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:06,820
every second block and we originally had
 

539
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,400
every second block and we originally had
ice here so I'm just gonna leave it ice

540
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,410
ice here so I'm just gonna leave it ice
 

541
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,340
ice here so I'm just gonna leave it ice
for right now while we're building this

542
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,350
for right now while we're building this
 

543
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,270
for right now while we're building this
might change it later

544
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:12,280
might change it later
 

545
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,360
might change it later
I got more yeah we do okay good so we

546
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,370
I got more yeah we do okay good so we
 

547
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,120
I got more yeah we do okay good so we
shift this back and forth like left and

548
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,130
shift this back and forth like left and
 

549
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,680
shift this back and forth like left and
right here so we got to get a bunch of

550
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:19,690
right here so we got to get a bunch of
 

551
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,290
right here so we got to get a bunch of
pistons on this side and this side that

552
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,300
pistons on this side and this side that
 

553
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,450
pistons on this side and this side that
that'll do that I think we can maybe

554
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:24,460
that'll do that I think we can maybe
 

555
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,580
that'll do that I think we can maybe
stick in some trip wires at this top

556
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:26,590
stick in some trip wires at this top
 

557
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,000
stick in some trip wires at this top
layer and detect one witches spawn but

558
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,010
layer and detect one witches spawn but
 

559
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,120
layer and detect one witches spawn but
I'm not entirely sure if that'll work um

560
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,130
I'm not entirely sure if that'll work um
 

561
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,320
I'm not entirely sure if that'll work um
we're gonna get our trapdoors flip them

562
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,330
we're gonna get our trapdoors flip them
 

563
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,280
we're gonna get our trapdoors flip them
up here and do that all all the way

564
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,290
up here and do that all all the way
 

565
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,000
up here and do that all all the way
through here and yeah so it's a it's a

566
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,010
through here and yeah so it's a it's a
 

567
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,990
through here and yeah so it's a it's a
triple layer which firm just one single

568
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
triple layer which firm just one single
 

569
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,260
triple layer which firm just one single
like spawn area though so the idea is we

570
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,270
like spawn area though so the idea is we
 

571
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,540
like spawn area though so the idea is we
shift the top the top layer all the

572
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:54,550
shift the top the top layer all the
 

573
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,800
shift the top the top layer all the
witches on there will fall down to the

574
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:55,810
witches on there will fall down to the
 

575
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,630
witches on there will fall down to the
second layer combined with them then we

576
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:57,640
second layer combined with them then we
 

577
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,460
second layer combined with them then we
shift that second layer they fall down

578
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,470
shift that second layer they fall down
 

579
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,560
shift that second layer they fall down
again we should shift the third layer

580
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,570
again we should shift the third layer
 

581
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,450
again we should shift the third layer
and then we're gonna drop them like

582
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:03,460
and then we're gonna drop them like
 

583
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,510
and then we're gonna drop them like
20-some blocks down below where they'll

584
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:06,520
20-some blocks down below where they'll
 

585
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,370
20-some blocks down below where they'll
die from the fall damage or get to a

586
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,380
die from the fall damage or get to a
 

587
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,440
die from the fall damage or get to a
one-hit kill if we want to kill them

588
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,450
one-hit kill if we want to kill them
 

589
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,710
one-hit kill if we want to kill them
ourselves and that's I think all that

590
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:13,720
ourselves and that's I think all that
 

591
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:25,970
ourselves and that's I think all that
all we have to do with there right I

592
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:25,980

 

593
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,120

don't want to do a Windows Update I

594
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,130
don't want to do a Windows Update I
 

595
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,160
don't want to do a Windows Update I
think that's what that was awesome so

596
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,170
think that's what that was awesome so
 

597
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,810
think that's what that was awesome so
check it out here we got it set up and

598
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:33,820
check it out here we got it set up and
 

599
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,140
check it out here we got it set up and
functioning so it goes top middle and

600
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,150
functioning so it goes top middle and
 

601
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,240
functioning so it goes top middle and
then bottom I have a 5 tick delay

602
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,250
then bottom I have a 5 tick delay
 

603
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,340
then bottom I have a 5 tick delay
between activating the layers I might

604
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,350
between activating the layers I might
 

605
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,610
between activating the layers I might
need to increase that to 6 or 7 cuz I'm

606
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:44,620
need to increase that to 6 or 7 cuz I'm
 

607
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,530
need to increase that to 6 or 7 cuz I'm
not sure if they'll fall down in time

608
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:46,540
not sure if they'll fall down in time
 

609
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,449
not sure if they'll fall down in time
I think it's pretty close as it is right

610
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:48,459
I think it's pretty close as it is right
 

611
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:52,139
I think it's pretty close as it is right
now but yeah top middle bottom then it

612
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:52,149
now but yeah top middle bottom then it
 

613
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,730
now but yeah top middle bottom then it
waits a few seconds here four more

614
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:53,740
waits a few seconds here four more
 

615
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,660
waits a few seconds here four more
witches spawn and then it triggers again

616
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:57,670
witches spawn and then it triggers again
 

617
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,970
witches spawn and then it triggers again
and they should fall down here there is

618
00:13:59,970 --> 00:13:59,980
and they should fall down here there is
 

619
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,310
and they should fall down here there is
no no place for them to fall at the

620
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
no no place for them to fall at the
 

621
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,949
no no place for them to fall at the
moment we just have water underneath

622
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
moment we just have water underneath
 

623
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,009
moment we just have water underneath
here so I have to dig a big hole or set

624
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:08,019
here so I have to dig a big hole or set
 

625
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,740
here so I have to dig a big hole or set
up some kind of killing area below but

626
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:10,750
up some kind of killing area below but
 

627
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,090
up some kind of killing area below but
this was actually a lot easier to build

628
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,100
this was actually a lot easier to build
 

629
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,069
this was actually a lot easier to build
than I thought like the Redstone this is

630
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
than I thought like the Redstone this is
 

631
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,490
than I thought like the Redstone this is
pretty simple so we just have lines of

632
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:17,500
pretty simple so we just have lines of
 

633
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,060
pretty simple so we just have lines of
redstone here running to the Pistons six

634
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,070
redstone here running to the Pistons six
 

635
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,430
redstone here running to the Pistons six
sets of Pistons two per layer right and

636
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
sets of Pistons two per layer right and
 

637
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,069
sets of Pistons two per layer right and
the Pistons are just behind the ice here

638
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:29,079
the Pistons are just behind the ice here
 

639
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,480
the Pistons are just behind the ice here
and up here and over there and then we

640
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,490
and up here and over there and then we
 

641
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,800
and up here and over there and then we
just activated it all on the back here

642
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:36,810
just activated it all on the back here
 

643
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,769
just activated it all on the back here
you've got a hopper clock running right

644
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:40,779
you've got a hopper clock running right
 

645
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,480
you've got a hopper clock running right
now I just have I think eight or nine

646
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,490
now I just have I think eight or nine
 

647
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,600
now I just have I think eight or nine
items in here umm it goes to a

648
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:45,610
items in here umm it goes to a
 

649
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,199
items in here umm it goes to a
monostable circuit here and both sides

650
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:48,209
monostable circuit here and both sides
 

651
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,240
monostable circuit here and both sides
we have a two tick delay between like

652
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,250
we have a two tick delay between like
 

653
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,340
we have a two tick delay between like
this left side of Pistons activating and

654
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,350
this left side of Pistons activating and
 

655
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,400
this left side of Pistons activating and
on this side and then it goes down like

656
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,410
on this side and then it goes down like
 

657
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,110
on this side and then it goes down like
a staircase here to each of the layers

658
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,120
a staircase here to each of the layers
 

659
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,939
a staircase here to each of the layers
but yeah I guess let's try to get this

660
00:14:59,939 --> 00:14:59,949
but yeah I guess let's try to get this
 

661
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,889
but yeah I guess let's try to get this
thing done since it's so close to to

662
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:01,899
thing done since it's so close to to
 

663
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,170
thing done since it's so close to to
being done so what we're gonna have to

664
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:04,180
being done so what we're gonna have to
 

665
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,050
being done so what we're gonna have to
do is get rid of all this water I did

666
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,060
do is get rid of all this water I did
 

667
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,460
do is get rid of all this water I did
not bring in these sponges with me so

668
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:08,470
not bring in these sponges with me so
 

669
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,250
not bring in these sponges with me so
I'm just gonna use dirt I'll probably

670
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,260
I'm just gonna use dirt I'll probably
 

671
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,910
I'm just gonna use dirt I'll probably
leave one layer of dirt here while on

672
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:14,920
leave one layer of dirt here while on
 

673
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,199
leave one layer of dirt here while on
the building so they don't keep fallin

674
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:16,209
the building so they don't keep fallin
 

675
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:34,160
the building so they don't keep fallin
on my head like as I dig this

676
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,170

 

677
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,990

very good very good so making some

678
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,000
very good very good so making some
 

679
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,190
very good very good so making some
pretty good progress here it's just

680
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,200
pretty good progress here it's just
 

681
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,160
pretty good progress here it's just
about done I'm noticing when that bottom

682
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,170
about done I'm noticing when that bottom
 

683
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,230
about done I'm noticing when that bottom
layer moves some light is shining in so

684
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,240
layer moves some light is shining in so
 

685
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,920
layer moves some light is shining in so
we should probably try to stop that I

686
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:46,930
we should probably try to stop that I
 

687
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,530
we should probably try to stop that I
did move a beacon closer to here with

688
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:49,540
did move a beacon closer to here with
 

689
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,750
did move a beacon closer to here with
haste to so it's able to dig out this

690
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:51,760
haste to so it's able to dig out this
 

691
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,319
haste to so it's able to dig out this
hole pretty quickly but it is looking

692
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:55,329
hole pretty quickly but it is looking
 

693
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,160
hole pretty quickly but it is looking
like our spawn rates are horrible so we

694
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,170
like our spawn rates are horrible so we
 

695
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,720
like our spawn rates are horrible so we
got a we got a bit of work left to do

696
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:00,730
got a we got a bit of work left to do
 

697
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,079
got a we got a bit of work left to do
here mostly got a little caving next I

698
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,089
here mostly got a little caving next I
 

699
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,360
here mostly got a little caving next I
think try finished lighting up the rest

700
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,370
think try finished lighting up the rest
 

701
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,160
think try finished lighting up the rest
of the caves oh we are spawning a couple

702
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,170
of the caves oh we are spawning a couple
 

703
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,189
of the caves oh we are spawning a couple
guys it looks like yeah so this is the

704
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
guys it looks like yeah so this is the
 

705
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,699
guys it looks like yeah so this is the
hole we dug nothing too fancy so I just

706
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:14,709
hole we dug nothing too fancy so I just
 

707
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,350
hole we dug nothing too fancy so I just
realized like the walls weren't right

708
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,360
realized like the walls weren't right
 

709
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,699
realized like the walls weren't right
they were like an 8 by 8 or something

710
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:17,709
they were like an 8 by 8 or something
 

711
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,639
they were like an 8 by 8 or something
it's supposed to be a 7 by 9 so I just i

712
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:20,649
it's supposed to be a 7 by 9 so I just i
 

713
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,189
it's supposed to be a 7 by 9 so I just i
double-checked this like wait a minute

714
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
double-checked this like wait a minute
 

715
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,410
double-checked this like wait a minute
so I got that fixed up now it's a 7 by 9

716
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:25,420
so I got that fixed up now it's a 7 by 9
 

717
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,480
so I got that fixed up now it's a 7 by 9
area here with this being the center

718
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,490
area here with this being the center
 

719
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,240
area here with this being the center
point I guess yeah so we got a couple

720
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,250
point I guess yeah so we got a couple
 

721
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,829
point I guess yeah so we got a couple
options on how we could collect the

722
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
options on how we could collect the
 

723
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,050
options on how we could collect the
drops together from this we could set up

724
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,060
drops together from this we could set up
 

725
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,759
drops together from this we could set up
like a hopper minecart running

726
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:38,769
like a hopper minecart running
 

727
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,430
like a hopper minecart running
underneath some slabs to pick them all

728
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
underneath some slabs to pick them all
 

729
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,829
underneath some slabs to pick them all
up or I think we're just gonna use

730
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
up or I think we're just gonna use
 

731
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,199
up or I think we're just gonna use
hoppers it's a lot easier a lot less

732
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:46,209
hoppers it's a lot easier a lot less
 

733
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,480
hoppers it's a lot easier a lot less
hassle and it's not really that big of

734
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,490
hassle and it's not really that big of
 

735
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,660
hassle and it's not really that big of
an area that I don't mind spending this

736
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:51,670
an area that I don't mind spending this
 

737
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,430
an area that I don't mind spending this
much because I found a beacon that was

738
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
much because I found a beacon that was
 

739
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,840
much because I found a beacon that was
made out of iron as well over here so I

740
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:56,850
made out of iron as well over here so I
 

741
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,460
made out of iron as well over here so I
got about 2 2 stacks of iron blocks

742
00:16:59,460 --> 00:16:59,470
got about 2 2 stacks of iron blocks
 

743
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,259
got about 2 2 stacks of iron blocks
again pretty happy about that I don't

744
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:01,269
again pretty happy about that I don't
 

745
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,699
again pretty happy about that I don't
mind spending it on the hoppers here

746
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:04,709
mind spending it on the hoppers here
 

747
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,679
mind spending it on the hoppers here
well we got the witch farm totally set

748
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:07,689
well we got the witch farm totally set
 

749
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:10,500
well we got the witch farm totally set
up now like it's totally functional look

750
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,510
up now like it's totally functional look
 

751
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,289
up now like it's totally functional look
at it oh it's just amazing no it's

752
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:13,299
at it oh it's just amazing no it's
 

753
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,140
at it oh it's just amazing no it's
horrible it's really bad so we got to

754
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,150
horrible it's really bad so we got to
 

755
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,120
horrible it's really bad so we got to
decorate it still looks it looks nasty

756
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,130
decorate it still looks it looks nasty
 

757
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,010
decorate it still looks it looks nasty
we have a lot of subsystems to set up

758
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,020
we have a lot of subsystems to set up
 

759
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,640
we have a lot of subsystems to set up
like a sorting system for the items

760
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:22,650
like a sorting system for the items
 

761
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,480
like a sorting system for the items
everything is getting collected into

762
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,490
everything is getting collected into
 

763
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,520
everything is getting collected into
this double chest right now

764
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:26,530
this double chest right now
 

765
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,350
this double chest right now
but we can like do stuff in the area and

766
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:28,360
but we can like do stuff in the area and
 

767
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,659
but we can like do stuff in the area and
we'll be collecting the drops and as we

768
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:30,669
we'll be collecting the drops and as we
 

769
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:31,950
we'll be collecting the drops and as we
improve things it's gonna get better and

770
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:31,960
improve things it's gonna get better and
 

771
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,470
improve things it's gonna get better and
better but the big thing the rates look

772
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
better but the big thing the rates look
 

773
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,980
better but the big thing the rates look
at the rates here this is horrendous

774
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:37,990

 

775
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,140

I have believe it or not lit up a bunch

776
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,150
I have believe it or not lit up a bunch
 

777
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,159
I have believe it or not lit up a bunch
of the caves in the area

778
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:41,169
of the caves in the area
 

779
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,399
of the caves in the area
but it's the final few that make the

780
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:44,409
but it's the final few that make the
 

781
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,399
but it's the final few that make the
biggest difference so I gotta find those

782
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:47,409
biggest difference so I gotta find those
 

783
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:50,249
biggest difference so I gotta find those
final few caves light them up and we

784
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:50,259
