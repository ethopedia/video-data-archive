00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:09,810
so far but then there will also be
 

181
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,450
so far but then there will also be
dispensers for the nether warts so

182
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:14,460
dispensers for the nether warts so
 

183
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,510
dispensers for the nether warts so
that's 11 and then they'll also be

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,120
dispensers for the glass bottles so this
 

187
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,969
dispensers for the glass bottles so this
is what I want to happen when I walk in

188
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:23,979
is what I want to happen when I walk in

bunch of storage chess probably for
 

193
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,029
bunch of storage chess probably for
double chests or so for each potion type

194
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
double chests or so for each potion type
 

195
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,850
double chests or so for each potion type
so out of the seven potion types the

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:35,860
so out of the seven potion types the
 

197
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,810
so out of the seven potion types the
main the main branches so that'll be

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
right when you walk in then you'll walk
 

203
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,620
right when you walk in then you'll walk
to the end of the potion room and we'll

204

to the end of the potion room and we'll
 

205
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,040
to the end of the potion room and we'll
have this semicircle of brewing stands

206
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,050
have this semicircle of brewing stands
 

207
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,499
have this semicircle of brewing stands
they'll be one off the ground underneath

208
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:52,509
they'll be one off the ground underneath
 

209
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,290
they'll be one off the ground underneath
each of these I'll have a button the

210
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,300
each of these I'll have a button the
 

211
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,800
each of these I'll have a button the
buttons will go up to an array of

212
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:57,810
buttons will go up to an array of
 

213
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,870
buttons will go up to an array of
dispensers so most of these will have

214
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
dispensers so most of these will have
 

215
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,129
dispensers so most of these will have
ten dispensers each so you hit a button

216
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:04,139
ten dispensers each so you hit a button
 

217
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,060
ten dispensers each so you hit a button
then ten dispensers get activated and

218
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,070
then ten dispensers get activated and
 

219
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,670
then ten dispensers get activated and
ten let's say nether wart will fall down

220
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
ten let's say nether wart will fall down
 

221
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,110
ten let's say nether wart will fall down
the water above us on to us then we'll

222
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,120
the water above us on to us then we'll
 

223
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,320
the water above us on to us then we'll
put the ten in the brewing stands and

224
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,330
put the ten in the brewing stands and
 

225
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,560
put the ten in the brewing stands and
then say we want it to make haste

226
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,570
then say we want it to make haste
 

227
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,050
then say we want it to make haste
potions we would push another button to

228
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:25,060
potions we would push another button to
 

229
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,950
potions we would push another button to
get 10 sugar to fall down on to us

230
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
get 10 sugar to fall down on to us
 

231
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,129
get 10 sugar to fall down on to us
I don't know that's the plan we'll see

232
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:32,139
I don't know that's the plan we'll see
 

233
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,930
I don't know that's the plan we'll see
how it goes here I'm going to move this

234
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:33,940
how it goes here I'm going to move this
 

235
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,909
how it goes here I'm going to move this
stuff over more to the right though

236
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
stuff over more to the right though
 

237
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,800
stuff over more to the right though
because I will need a bit of space for

238
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:37,810
because I will need a bit of space for
 

239
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,270
because I will need a bit of space for
the wiring and I'll probably go further

240
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
the wiring and I'll probably go further
 

241
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,510
the wiring and I'll probably go further
back too so we'll have some area in the

242
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,520
back too so we'll have some area in the
 

243
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,150
back too so we'll have some area in the
front to put our storage chests because

244
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:45,160
front to put our storage chests because
 

245
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,700
front to put our storage chests because
it'll be a lot of them you can't stack

246
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:47,710
it'll be a lot of them you can't stack
 

247
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,080
it'll be a lot of them you can't stack
these potions so we need a lot of

248
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,090
these potions so we need a lot of
 

249
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,290
these potions so we need a lot of
storage space for mass production

250
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,300

 

251
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,969

alright so I got a bit more space

252
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:56,979
alright so I got a bit more space
 

253
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,559
alright so I got a bit more space
cleared out here we'll probably have to

254
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:58,569
cleared out here we'll probably have to
 

255
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:01,620
cleared out here we'll probably have to
clear some more I just want to show you

256
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:01,630
clear some more I just want to show you
 

257
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,300
clear some more I just want to show you

258
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,310
what I've been doing here though because
 

259
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,310
what I've been doing here though because
I I want to finish this wall up kind of

260
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,320

261
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,589
I I want to finish this wall up kind of
before I position the potion room just

262
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
before I position the potion room just
 

263
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,580
before I position the potion room just
so you know we're not fidgeting with it

264
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:11,590
so you know we're not fidgeting with it
 

265
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,610
so you know we're not fidgeting with it
afterward so I punched holes through it

266
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:14,620
afterward so I punched holes through it
 

267
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,999
afterward so I punched holes through it
put some iron bars and and it just kind

have over here the pumpkin farm so it
 

273
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,990
have over here the pumpkin farm so it
goes lab of water lava lava water lava

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:32,770
all right and then over here I'm going
 

277
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,070
all right and then over here I'm going
to explain this to you around my world

278
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,080
to explain this to you around my world
 

279
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,659
to explain this to you around my world
every so often I'm going to have these

280
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:36,669
every so often I'm going to have these
 

281
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,860
every so often I'm going to have these
dispenser stations and they will have

282
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:40,870
dispenser stations and they will have
 

283
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,600
dispenser stations and they will have
potions inside and I'll walk up they'll

284
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:45,610
potions inside and I'll walk up they'll
 

285
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,610
potions inside and I'll walk up they'll
give me a potion chug it good to go when

286
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:50,620
give me a potion chug it good to go when
 

287
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
give me a potion chug it good to go when
I get more established I'll be filling

288
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,630
I get more established I'll be filling
 

289
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,709
I get more established I'll be filling
these with the splash potions so if you

290
00:07:58,709 --> 00:07:58,719
these with the splash potions so if you
 

291
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,060
these with the splash potions so if you
didn't know this already maybe we'll

292
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,070
didn't know this already maybe we'll
 

293
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,999
didn't know this already maybe we'll
make some see how this works make sure

294
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:03,009
make some see how this works make sure
 

295
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,089
make some see how this works make sure
it works too you can make any potion a

296
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:06,099
it works too you can make any potion a
 

297
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,100
it works too you can make any potion a
splash potion by just putting gunpowder

298
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,110
splash potion by just putting gunpowder
 

299
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,459
splash potion by just putting gunpowder
and so this will become splash splash

300
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:11,469
and so this will become splash splash
 

301
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:13,860
and so this will become splash splash
potions of swiftness it does reduce the

302
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:13,870
potions of swiftness it does reduce the
 

303
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,050
potions of swiftness it does reduce the
length that it lasts slow by I think

304
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,060
length that it lasts slow by I think
 

305
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:22,050
length that it lasts slow by I think
it's 3/4 of the original so yeah I'll

306
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,060
it's 3/4 of the original so yeah I'll
 

307
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,350
it's 3/4 of the original so yeah I'll
have yeah it's it's a redstone and

308
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
have yeah it's it's a redstone and
 

309
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
have yeah it's it's a redstone and
redstone dust here powers this block

310
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,090
redstone dust here powers this block
 

311
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,360
redstone dust here powers this block
which powers the dispenser so that's how

312
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,370
which powers the dispenser so that's how
 

313
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,730
which powers the dispenser so that's how
that works and we'll have one over here

314
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:35,740
that works and we'll have one over here
 

315
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,199
that works and we'll have one over here
as well for instant health

316
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:40,209
as well for instant health
 

317
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,899
as well for instant health
just to I need to I need to make this

318
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:42,909
just to I need to I need to make this
 

319
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,419
just to I need to I need to make this
some space here have to put something

320
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:45,429
some space here have to put something
 

321
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,669
some space here have to put something
for decoration so this is a good

322
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:47,679
for decoration so this is a good
 

323
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,210
for decoration so this is a good
functioning decoration and I'm going to

324
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,220
functioning decoration and I'm going to
 

325
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,749
functioning decoration and I'm going to
color code these two so let's make this

326
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:54,759
color code these two so let's make this
 

327
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,679
color code these two so let's make this
light blue so I don't mix them up I'll

328
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:58,689
light blue so I don't mix them up I'll
 

329
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:02,519
light blue so I don't mix them up I'll
get some light blue dye I would use it

330
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:02,529
get some light blue dye I would use it
 

331
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,379
get some light blue dye I would use it
on a sheep but I don't have any sheep

332
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:04,389
on a sheep but I don't have any sheep
 

333
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:05,720
on a sheep but I don't have any sheep
around

334
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:05,730
around
 

335
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,410
around
yeah this will be light blue then the

336
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:10,420
yeah this will be light blue then the
 

337
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,340
yeah this will be light blue then the
potion of instant health we will do red

338
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,350
potion of instant health we will do red
 

339
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,449
potion of instant health we will do red
because that's what color it is and

340
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:17,459
because that's what color it is and
 

341
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,049
because that's what color it is and
we'll have that over here a little

342
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:22,059
we'll have that over here a little
 

343
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:24,090
we'll have that over here a little
dispenser station and I have these in

344
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,100
dispenser station and I have these in
 

345
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,220
dispenser station and I have these in
set one block just so that if any mobs

346
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,230
set one block just so that if any mobs
 

347
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,259
set one block just so that if any mobs
are wandering around they're a lot less

348
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:28,269
are wandering around they're a lot less
 

349
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:35,960
are wandering around they're a lot less
likely to step on the pressure plates

350
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:35,970

 

351
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,900

and I didn't wire that anyway so then

352
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:39,910
and I didn't wire that anyway so then
 

353
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,059
and I didn't wire that anyway so then
I'll have the wooden planks extend out

354
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:42,069
I'll have the wooden planks extend out
 

355
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:51,059
I'll have the wooden planks extend out
here further oops that's not a plank to

356
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:51,069
here further oops that's not a plank to
 

357
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:53,309
here further oops that's not a plank to
the potion room and then I think what

358
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:53,319
the potion room and then I think what
 

359
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,069
the potion room and then I think what
we'll do just kind of figure out the

360
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:56,079
we'll do just kind of figure out the
 

361
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,869
we'll do just kind of figure out the
shape we should put some clothes down

362
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:00,879
shape we should put some clothes down
 

363
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,169
shape we should put some clothes down
here to just to brighten it up see how

364
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:04,179
here to just to brighten it up see how
 

365
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:08,789
here to just to brighten it up see how
this looks it's a little bit better

366
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:08,799
this looks it's a little bit better
 

367
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,879
this looks it's a little bit better
might put some signs on these blocks

368
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:13,889

 

369
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,369

then we will try get some curve going on

370
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:17,379
then we will try get some curve going on
 

371
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:21,569
then we will try get some curve going on
here so we'll curve it in maybe like

372
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:21,579
here so we'll curve it in maybe like
 

373
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,720
here so we'll curve it in maybe like
that

374
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:25,730

 

375
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,280

actually I don't know if I want the door

376
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,290
actually I don't know if I want the door
 

377
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,490
actually I don't know if I want the door
that small and I did count there's

378
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,500
that small and I did count there's
 

379
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,430
that small and I did count there's
actually eight main potions not seven

380
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
actually eight main potions not seven
 

381
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,889
actually eight main potions not seven
like I thought so we'll probably just

382
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:35,899
like I thought so we'll probably just
 

383
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:41,699
like I thought so we'll probably just
have ten sets of chests and like mmm

384
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:41,709
have ten sets of chests and like mmm
 

385
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,829
have ten sets of chests and like mmm
maybe four double chests for each potion

386
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
maybe four double chests for each potion
 

387
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,960
maybe four double chests for each potion
type so we'll have two extras for like

388
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:49,970
type so we'll have two extras for like
 

389
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,800
type so we'll have two extras for like
glass bottles and stuff and then out

390
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:53,810
glass bottles and stuff and then out
 

391
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,329
glass bottles and stuff and then out
whatever you'll see you'll see what I

392
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:55,339
whatever you'll see you'll see what I
 

393
00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,340

395
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,240
mean I'm rambling a lot here yeah I'm
going to make this wider maybe we'll do

396
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,250
going to make this wider maybe we'll do
 

397
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,730
going to make this wider maybe we'll do
yeah let's do sliding piston doors I

398
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:06,740
yeah let's do sliding piston doors I
 

399
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,040
yeah let's do sliding piston doors I
like those there then the wall continue

400
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,050
like those there then the wall continue
 

401
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:19,259
like those there then the wall continue
this wooden stuff will go in now

402
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:19,269
this wooden stuff will go in now
 

403
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,629
this wooden stuff will go in now
thinking of maybe doing a scheme similar

404
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:22,639
thinking of maybe doing a scheme similar
 

405
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,759
thinking of maybe doing a scheme similar
to my original storage room in this

406

chests on the right and left probably
and further back we'll have this stands

416
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:46,339
and further back we'll have this stands
 

417
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,059
and further back we'll have this stands
so let me work on this a bit because

433
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,110
building this on camera just because
this potion room would drag on over

434
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,120

for some reason I don't know why so I

460
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:50,640
for some reason I don't know why so I
 

461
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,870
for some reason I don't know why so I
put lava here and that I it won't burn

462
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:53,880
put lava here and that I it won't burn
 

463
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,570
put lava here and that I it won't burn
the wool because I have blocks on all

464
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:56,580
the wool because I have blocks on all
 

465
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,090
the wool because I have blocks on all
six sides of the wool so even though it

466
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,100
six sides of the wool so even though it
 

467
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,750
six sides of the wool so even though it
looks like it's exposed it's not so

468
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
looks like it's exposed it's not so
 

469
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,090
looks like it's exposed it's not so
that's the trick behind that and behind

470
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,100
that's the trick behind that and behind
 

471
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,660
that's the trick behind that and behind
it we even have a crafting bench hidden

472
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:07,670
it we even have a crafting bench hidden
 

473
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,240
it we even have a crafting bench hidden
which is very nice because I always

474
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,250
which is very nice because I always
 

475
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,590
which is very nice because I always
always run around looking for crafting

476
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:12,600
always run around looking for crafting
 

477
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,520

benches I need to start putting them
around the place more often alright so

480
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:20,660
around the place more often alright so
 

481
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,940
around the place more often alright so
then this is the layout for inside

482
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:22,950
then this is the layout for inside
 

483
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,920
then this is the layout for inside
that's going to do a sliding door type

484
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:24,930
that's going to do a sliding door type
 

485
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,380
that's going to do a sliding door type
thing I realized though that I need to

486
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,390
thing I realized though that I need to
 

487
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,270
thing I realized though that I need to
make it an odd number I can't have an

488
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,280
make it an odd number I can't have an
 

489
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,690
make it an odd number I can't have an
even to block entrance here either has

490
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:32,700
even to block entrance here either has
 

491
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,360
even to block entrance here either has
to be one block entrance but I thought

492
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,370
to be one block entrance but I thought
 

493
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,840
to be one block entrance but I thought
that would be very cramped feeling so

494
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:38,850
that would be very cramped feeling so
 

495
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,540
that would be very cramped feeling so
I'm going to try and make a three block

496
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:40,550
I'm going to try and make a three block
 

497
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,810
I'm going to try and make a three block
3x3 door sliding door entrance never

498
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:44,820
3x3 door sliding door entrance never
 

499
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,900
3x3 door sliding door entrance never
done that before so it'll be fun you

500
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:47,910
done that before so it'll be fun you
 

501
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,760
done that before so it'll be fun you
walk in and then we'll have chests on

502
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:49,770
walk in and then we'll have chests on
 

503
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,890
walk in and then we'll have chests on
the right these will get stacked on top

504
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:51,900
the right these will get stacked on top
 

505
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,560
the right these will get stacked on top
of each other

506
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:53,570
of each other
 

507
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,520

Dada Dada slurring my words together

508
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:57,530
Dada Dada slurring my words together
 

509
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:03,200

so in 1.0.0 you chin stat chests on top

510
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,210
so in 1.0.0 you chin stat chests on top
 

511
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,560
so in 1.0.0 you chin stat chests on top
of each other now it's really awesome so

512
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:06,570
of each other now it's really awesome so
 

513
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,120
of each other now it's really awesome so
I might go three chests I see how that

514
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,130
I might go three chests I see how that
 

515
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,120
I might go three chests I see how that
looks I was thinking for originally but

516
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,130
looks I was thinking for originally but
 

517
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:20,270
looks I was thinking for originally but
that might just get crazy and something

518
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,280
that might just get crazy and something
 

519
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,720
that might just get crazy and something
like that kind of want to color code the

520
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:23,730
like that kind of want to color code the
 

521
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,760
like that kind of want to color code the
chest tube but then that would take more

522
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:25,770
chest tube but then that would take more
 

523
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:33,250
chest tube but then that would take more
space hmm

524
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,260

 

525
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,120

I don't think about it this is what's on

526
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,130
I don't think about it this is what's on
 

527
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:44,350
I don't think about it this is what's on
the back behind the dispenser area okay

528
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,360
the back behind the dispenser area okay
 

529
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,970
the back behind the dispenser area okay
and you can see we're running into the

530
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:45,980
and you can see we're running into the
 

531
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,260
and you can see we're running into the
pumpkin farm here so might move this all

532
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,270
pumpkin farm here so might move this all
 

533
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,840
pumpkin farm here so might move this all
over one or two blocks to the right

534
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:52,850
over one or two blocks to the right
 

535
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,540
over one or two blocks to the right
this looks really sharp this edge too so

536
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:55,550
this looks really sharp this edge too so
 

537
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,070
this looks really sharp this edge too so
it should be oops

538
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,080
it should be oops
 

539
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,550
it should be oops
should be probably three blocks wide

540
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
should be probably three blocks wide
 

541
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,050
should be probably three blocks wide
here and then he'll start caving in and

542
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,060
here and then he'll start caving in and
 

543
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,540
here and then he'll start caving in and
then the potion stuff the half the

544
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,550
then the potion stuff the half the
 

545
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,060
then the potion stuff the half the
semicircle will be here type thing okay

546
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,070
semicircle will be here type thing okay
 

547
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,720
semicircle will be here type thing okay
oh and yeah let's try out the potions I

548
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:16,730
oh and yeah let's try out the potions I
 

549
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,540
oh and yeah let's try out the potions I
almost forgot so it was three minutes

550
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:19,550
almost forgot so it was three minutes
 

551
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,570
almost forgot so it was three minutes
before now it's 2 minutes and 15 seconds

552
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:24,580
before now it's 2 minutes and 15 seconds
 

553
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,740
before now it's 2 minutes and 15 seconds
what can I toss let's try it I've never

554
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:29,750
what can I toss let's try it I've never
 

555
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,600
what can I toss let's try it I've never
shot one of these of a dispenser before

556
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,610
shot one of these of a dispenser before
 

557
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,070
shot one of these of a dispenser before
yeah three quarters of time that's what

558
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,080
yeah three quarters of time that's what
 

559
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,170
yeah three quarters of time that's what
that is here we go did it hit me it did

560
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,180
that is here we go did it hit me it did
 

561
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:47,560
that is here we go did it hit me it did
and we got we got the full 215 good cool

562
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:47,570
and we got we got the full 215 good cool
 

563
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,780
and we got we got the full 215 good cool
so I'd like to have a few of these

564
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:49,790
so I'd like to have a few of these
 

565
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,590
so I'd like to have a few of these
dispensing stations around my world

566
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:52,600
dispensing stations around my world
 

567
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,110
dispensing stations around my world
every every so often so that if you want

568
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,120
every every so often so that if you want
 

569
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,590
every every so often so that if you want
a speed boost to just walk into it and

570
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:58,600
a speed boost to just walk into it and
 

571
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,080
a speed boost to just walk into it and
then take off type thing and they look

572
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,090
then take off type thing and they look
 

573
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:10,240
then take off type thing and they look
kind of cool in my opinion right so I'll

574
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,250
kind of cool in my opinion right so I'll
 

575
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,490
kind of cool in my opinion right so I'll
work some more and hopefully get a bunch

576
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:12,500
work some more and hopefully get a bunch
 

577
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,930
work some more and hopefully get a bunch
more done I'm going to show you the 3x3

578
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:16,940
more done I'm going to show you the 3x3
 

579
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,720
more done I'm going to show you the 3x3
piston door I made it's it's pretty cool

580
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:19,730
piston door I made it's it's pretty cool
 

581
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,910
piston door I made it's it's pretty cool
it's still in rough format I left it

582
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
it's still in rough format I left it
 

583
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,079
it's still in rough format I left it
open so you can see what's happening

584
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:27,089

 

585
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:34,940

closes its opening I might slow it down

586
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:34,950
closes its opening I might slow it down
 

587
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,130
closes its opening I might slow it down
like half that speed because I had it

588
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,140
like half that speed because I had it
 

589
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,320
like half that speed because I had it
slower before it seems to open a lot

590
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,330
slower before it seems to open a lot
 

591
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,000
slower before it seems to open a lot
better it's cool how it closes but when

592
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,010
better it's cool how it closes but when
 

593
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,199
better it's cool how it closes but when
it opens it's not it's not really even

594
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:49,209
it opens it's not it's not really even
 

595
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,389
it opens it's not it's not really even
you know so there'll be a row of

596
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
you know so there'll be a row of
 

597
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,490
you know so there'll be a row of
pressure plates here to walk on and then

598
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:56,500
pressure plates here to walk on and then
 

599
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,730
pressure plates here to walk on and then
when you go through they'll be another

600
00:16:59,730 --> 00:16:59,740
when you go through they'll be another
 

601
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:07,169
when you go through they'll be another
row over here like that and you can do

602
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:07,179
row over here like that and you can do
 

603
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,559
row over here like that and you can do
this kind of fancy when I walk in door

604
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:10,569
this kind of fancy when I walk in door
 

605
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,630
this kind of fancy when I walk in door
will open then I walk when I walk on

606
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
will open then I walk when I walk on
 

607
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,669
will open then I walk when I walk on
this set of pressure plates it'll close

608
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:14,679
this set of pressure plates it'll close
 

609
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,780
this set of pressure plates it'll close
and it will also lock the door so if

610
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:18,790
and it will also lock the door so if
 

611
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,290
and it will also lock the door so if
anything on this side tries to get in by

612
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,300
anything on this side tries to get in by
 

613
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,030
anything on this side tries to get in by
walking on the pressure plates it'll

614
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,040
walking on the pressure plates it'll
 

615
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,449
walking on the pressure plates it'll
stay closed it will only unlock when I

616
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:27,459
stay closed it will only unlock when I
 

617
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:33,960
stay closed it will only unlock when I
walk back out that's the plan I'll run

618
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:33,970
walk back out that's the plan I'll run
 

619
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,520
walk back out that's the plan I'll run
through the wiring quickly here if you

620
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:35,530
through the wiring quickly here if you
 

621
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,110
through the wiring quickly here if you
want to check it out I'm not going to

622
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
want to check it out I'm not going to
 

623
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,510
want to check it out I'm not going to
explain it it's just basic delays and

624
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
explain it it's just basic delays and
 

625
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,370
explain it it's just basic delays and
obviously this isn't set up right I need

626
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:44,380
obviously this isn't set up right I need
 

627
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,470
obviously this isn't set up right I need
to add T flip-flops and our store

628
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
to add T flip-flops and our store
 

629
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,430
to add T flip-flops and our store
latches and all that fun stuff but

630
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:52,440

 

631
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,950

there's a eight Pistons total and the

632
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:55,960
there's a eight Pistons total and the
 

633
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,140
there's a eight Pistons total and the
center is going to stay open I don't

634
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,150
center is going to stay open I don't
 

635
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,150
center is going to stay open I don't
think it's a big deal it's more for

636
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
think it's a big deal it's more for
 

637
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,940
think it's a big deal it's more for
looks than anything it goes up here and

638
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:05,950
looks than anything it goes up here and
 

639
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,250
looks than anything it goes up here and
I think all the wiring is out of the way

640
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,260
I think all the wiring is out of the way
 

641
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,049
I think all the wiring is out of the way
so it shouldn't interfere with anything

642
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:10,059
so it shouldn't interfere with anything
 

643
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:20,490
so it shouldn't interfere with anything
I hope and that's it

644
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:20,500

 

645
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,430

can we kill it seems to be pretty

646
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:24,440
can we kill it seems to be pretty
 

647
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:31,570
can we kill it seems to be pretty
resilient okay good yeah I should have

648
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:31,580
resilient okay good yeah I should have
 

649
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,610
resilient okay good yeah I should have
known this door giving me a lot of

650
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:33,620
known this door giving me a lot of
 

651
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,510
known this door giving me a lot of
hassle spent a lot of time on it and had

652
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
hassle spent a lot of time on it and had
 

653
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
hassle spent a lot of time on it and had
it almost working right but the thing is

654
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,290
it almost working right but the thing is
 

655
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,110
it almost working right but the thing is
I'd walk on the pressure plates and it'd

656
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
I'd walk on the pressure plates and it'd
 

657
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,390
I'd walk on the pressure plates and it'd
take like three seconds to open the

658
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:43,400
take like three seconds to open the
 

659
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,340
take like three seconds to open the
wiring was pretty slow so I decided to

660
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,350
wiring was pretty slow so I decided to
 

661
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,750
wiring was pretty slow so I decided to
just do a button you press it it opens

662
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:52,760
just do a button you press it it opens
 

663
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,730
just do a button you press it it opens
for four or five seconds and it closes

664
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:56,740
for four or five seconds and it closes
 

665
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,750
for four or five seconds and it closes
there's a little bit of a delay before

666
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:58,760
there's a little bit of a delay before
 

667
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:10,240
there's a little bit of a delay before
you press it again to play but it's it's

668
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,250
you press it again to play but it's it's
 

669
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,770
you press it again to play but it's it's
it's a lot simpler this way big problem

670
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:14,780
it's a lot simpler this way big problem
 

671
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,020
it's a lot simpler this way big problem
I had was space this stupid thing was in

672
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,030
I had was space this stupid thing was in
 

673
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,190
I had was space this stupid thing was in
the way of my wiring but it just comes

674
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
the way of my wiring but it just comes
 

675
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,010
the way of my wiring but it just comes
down to an RS nor latch here with a

676
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,020
down to an RS nor latch here with a
 

677
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,550
down to an RS nor latch here with a
delay on it I think it's a four second

678
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:27,560
delay on it I think it's a four second
 

679
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,570
delay on it I think it's a four second
delay if I remember right and that's it

680
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:33,580
delay if I remember right and that's it
 

681
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,360
delay if I remember right and that's it
and this is a layout I've kind of

682
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,370
and this is a layout I've kind of
 

683
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,770
and this is a layout I've kind of
decided upon chess over on both sides

684
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:41,780
decided upon chess over on both sides
 

685
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,320
decided upon chess over on both sides
it'll be probably three high three

686
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,330
it'll be probably three high three
 

687
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,510
it'll be probably three high three
chests double chests stacked on top of

688
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:46,520
chests double chests stacked on top of
 

689
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,300
chests double chests stacked on top of
each other and then we have the

690
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,310
each other and then we have the
 

691
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,030
each other and then we have the
cauldrons or brewing stands over here

692
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,040
cauldrons or brewing stands over here
 

693
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,220
cauldrons or brewing stands over here
and I probably won't do this out of

694
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,230
and I probably won't do this out of
 

695
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,650
and I probably won't do this out of
stone brick like I have here just use

696
00:19:59,650 --> 00:19:59,660
stone brick like I have here just use
 

697
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,150
stone brick like I have here just use
this for the layout I wanted to try keep

698
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,160
this for the layout I wanted to try keep
 

699
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,690
this for the layout I wanted to try keep
it more wood --is-- if I could so I'll

700
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:07,700
it more wood --is-- if I could so I'll
 

701
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,760
it more wood --is-- if I could so I'll
play around with it some more and I'll

702
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:09,770
play around with it some more and I'll
 

703
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:16,620
play around with it some more and I'll
see you guys in a little bit

704

705
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,820

actually before I play around with the

706
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:18,830
actually before I play around with the
 

707
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,530
actually before I play around with the
looks of this place I'm going to try set

708
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:20,540
looks of this place I'm going to try set
 

709
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,450
looks of this place I'm going to try set
up a actual station here I got water

710
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:25,460
up a actual station here I got water
 

711
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,160
up a actual station here I got water
above already I just added that

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,200
there's about eight different types of
 

717
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,520
there's about eight different types of
potions like main types and different

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,530
potions like main types and different
 

719
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,000
potions like main types and different
degrees of each of those of course and

720
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,010
degrees of each of those of course and
 

721
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,560
degrees of each of those of course and
that's not counting based potions like

722
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,570
that's not counting based potions like
 

723
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,040
that's not counting based potions like
awkward potions so I've got eight of

724
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,050
awkward potions so I've got eight of
 

725
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,730
awkward potions so I've got eight of
those and then there's ten brewing

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:49,740
those and then there's ten brewing
 

727
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,050
those and then there's ten brewing
stands here but there'll be 12 buttons

728
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,060
stands here but there'll be 12 buttons
 

729
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,500
stands here but there'll be 12 buttons
total for the twelve main ingredients

here
 

741
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,840
here
and we can fill them at this water here

742
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:14,850
and we can fill them at this water here
 

743
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,820
and we can fill them at this water here
they'll be thrown straight up and then

744
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:16,830
they'll be thrown straight up and then
 

745
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,270
they'll be thrown straight up and then
we can just go around place them inside

746
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
we can just go around place them inside
 

747
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,810
we can just go around place them inside
nice and easy I can reach all these

748
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:23,820
nice and easy I can reach all these
 

749
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,060
nice and easy I can reach all these
right yeah so all the glass bottles will

750
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,070
right yeah so all the glass bottles will
 

751
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,120
right yeah so all the glass bottles will
be here it'll be easy to fill them and

752
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,130
be here it'll be easy to fill them and
 

753
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,920
be here it'll be easy to fill them and
then each of these will dispense a

754
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:33,930
then each of these will dispense a
 

755
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,870
then each of these will dispense a
different ingredients I know this one I

756
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:35,880
different ingredients I know this one I
 

757
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,390
different ingredients I know this one I
want to dispense nether warts so if you

758
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
want to dispense nether warts so if you
 

759
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,940
want to dispense nether warts so if you
press it then ten nether wart will fall

760
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:40,950
press it then ten nether wart will fall
 

761
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,420
press it then ten nether wart will fall
down and you can make awkward potions

762
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,430
down and you can make awkward potions
 

763
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,730
down and you can make awkward potions
and say you want

764
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:46,740
and say you want
 

765
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,220
and say you want
make haste potions maybe this will

766
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,230
make haste potions maybe this will
 

767
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,240
make haste potions maybe this will
dispense 10 sugar then you go around

768
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,250
dispense 10 sugar then you go around
 

769
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,670
dispense 10 sugar then you go around
fill them all up and that's how it's

770
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:55,680
fill them all up and that's how it's
 

771
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,290
fill them all up and that's how it's
going to work ideally so I'll have to

772
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:00,300
going to work ideally so I'll have to
 

773
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,470
going to work ideally so I'll have to
wire this I think I should set up the

774
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
wire this I think I should set up the
 

775
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,000
wire this I think I should set up the
dispenser area above here but yeah I'm

776
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,010
dispenser area above here but yeah I'm
 

777
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:12,490
dispenser area above here but yeah I'm
going to do that next time maybe I

778
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:12,500
going to do that next time maybe I
 

779
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,930
going to do that next time maybe I
should really be uploading this episode

780
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:14,940
should really be uploading this episode
 

781
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,770
should really be uploading this episode
right now so we'll just maybe do a

782
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:18,780
right now so we'll just maybe do a
 

783
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,560
right now so we'll just maybe do a
little bit filler make that happen it's

784
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,570
little bit filler make that happen it's
 

785
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,100
little bit filler make that happen it's
a bit short I wanted to try what was

786
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,110
a bit short I wanted to try what was
 

787
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,620
a bit short I wanted to try what was
that strength potions in the nether with

788
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:27,630
that strength potions in the nether with
 

789
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,410
that strength potions in the nether with
that sword so give me a second to get

790
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:30,420
that sword so give me a second to get
 

791
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,940
that sword so give me a second to get
that together

792
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:32,950

 

793
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,670
