00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,450
you pretty much have to use up all your
 

63
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,330
you pretty much have to use up all your
levels when you enchant something for it

levels when you enchant something for it
 

65
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,370
levels when you enchant something for it
to be worth it and that makes it

66
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,380
to be worth it and that makes it
 

67
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,990

frustrating and if you feel 15 minutes
and skip past the level when you finally

00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:49,950
and skip past the level when you finally
 

71
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,920
and skip past the level when you finally

Location Location thinking may try to
 

207
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:46,219
Location Location thinking may try to
sneak it in just over here somehow

208
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:46,229
sneak it in just over here somehow
 

209
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,210

make a room over here

210
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,220
make a room over here
 

211
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,010
make a room over here
so there's empty space over here so it

212
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,020
so there's empty space over here so it
 

213
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,760
so there's empty space over here so it
should work out okay

214
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:55,770
should work out okay
 

215
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,409
should work out okay
maybe I'll start clearing that out and

216
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:58,419
maybe I'll start clearing that out and
 

217
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:05,210
maybe I'll start clearing that out and
see see how it goes

218
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,220

 

219
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,950

think the cauldrons are really needed

332
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:03,900
think the cauldrons are really needed
 

333

339
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,600

oh it doesn't use up the water source

340
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,610
oh it doesn't use up the water source
 

341
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,210
oh it doesn't use up the water source
even interesting and do these stack no

342
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:31,220
even interesting and do these stack no
 

343
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,639

uh-huh see on the wiki it said they did

346
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,610

 

347
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,400

that might what how did I throw that

348
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,410
that might what how did I throw that
 

349
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:51,069
that might what how did I throw that
what I'm right-clicking on the water and

350
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:51,079
what I'm right-clicking on the water and
 

351
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:59,369
what I'm right-clicking on the water and
it's throwing my plug oh that is weird

352
00:09:59,369 --> 00:09:59,379

 

353
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:03,249

what I guess because my inventory is

354
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:03,259
what I guess because my inventory is
 

355
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,749
what I guess because my inventory is
full it throws it when you right-click

356
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:04,759
full it throws it when you right-click
 

357
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:07,809
full it throws it when you right-click
on the water yeah that time it didn't

358
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:07,819
on the water yeah that time it didn't
 

359
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:11,949
on the water yeah that time it didn't
that time it did that's cool so you can

360
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:11,959
that time it did that's cool so you can
 

361
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,139
that time it did that's cool so you can
just you just do this to fill your water

362
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:14,149
just you just do this to fill your water
 

363
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,249
just you just do this to fill your water
bottles I like that

364
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:17,259
bottles I like that
 

365
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:23,139
bottles I like that
okay so it probably only Coltrane's what

366
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:23,149
okay so it probably only Coltrane's what
 

367
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:28,629
okay so it probably only Coltrane's what
I want to figure out next is the size of

368
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:28,639
I want to figure out next is the size of
 

369
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,129
I want to figure out next is the size of
the route this room is going to depend

370
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:30,139
the route this room is going to depend
 

371
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,049
the route this room is going to depend
largely on how quick we can actually

372
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:32,059
largely on how quick we can actually
 

373
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,410
largely on how quick we can actually
keep up filling these brewing stands

374
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:35,420
keep up filling these brewing stands
 

375
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,999
keep up filling these brewing stands
with stuff like there's no point having

376
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,009
with stuff like there's no point having
 

377
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,019
with stuff like there's no point having
a hundred of these if we can't keep up

378
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:43,029
a hundred of these if we can't keep up
 

379
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:49,449
a hundred of these if we can't keep up
oops you know what I mean and I also

380
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:49,459
oops you know what I mean and I also
 

381
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,850
oops you know what I mean and I also
want to check one thing do these cause

382
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:51,860
want to check one thing do these cause
 

383
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,280
want to check one thing do these cause
block updates because that might give me

384
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,290
block updates because that might give me
 

385
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,069
block updates because that might give me
a few ideas as well I'm going to get

386
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:57,079
a few ideas as well I'm going to get
 

387
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,069
a few ideas as well I'm going to get
some distance just to check that okay if

388
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:03,079
some distance just to check that okay if
 

389
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,790
some distance just to check that okay if
I was to guess I would say they probably

390
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
I was to guess I would say they probably
 

391
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,939
I was to guess I would say they probably
do cause an update because the graphic

392
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:09,949
do cause an update because the graphic
 

393
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,519
do cause an update because the graphic
updates when you put bottles in I don't

394
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:12,529
updates when you put bottles in I don't
 

395
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,110
updates when you put bottles in I don't
know if it will update though when it

396
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
know if it will update though when it
 

397
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,269
know if it will update though when it
finishes brewing I kind of don't think

398
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
finishes brewing I kind of don't think
 

399
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,110
finishes brewing I kind of don't think
it will

400
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,120
it will
 

401
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,689
it will
we'll see though those are just my

402
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:22,699
we'll see though those are just my
 

403
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:25,400
we'll see though those are just my
guesses

404
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,410

 

405
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,369

okay let's put a bottle in see what

406
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:28,379
okay let's put a bottle in see what
 

407
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,529
okay let's put a bottle in see what
happens when we put an empty bottle in

408
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:30,539
happens when we put an empty bottle in
 

409
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,460
happens when we put an empty bottle in
oh you can yeah so every time you do

410
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,470
oh you can yeah so every time you do
 

411
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:43,219
oh you can yeah so every time you do
that oops every time you put a bottle in

412
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:43,229
that oops every time you put a bottle in
 

413
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,599
that oops every time you put a bottle in
or take a bottle out it'll probably

414
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:44,609
or take a bottle out it'll probably
 

415
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:53,659
or take a bottle out it'll probably
update let's try it again yeah okay I'm

416
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:53,669
update let's try it again yeah okay I'm
 

417
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:58,009
update let's try it again yeah okay I'm
gonna try weapons you put water oh you

418
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:58,019
gonna try weapons you put water oh you
 

419
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,279
gonna try weapons you put water oh you
can't I'm going to try brew something

420
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,289
can't I'm going to try brew something
 

421
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:06,859
can't I'm going to try brew something
here see if that does anything water

422
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:06,869
here see if that does anything water
 

423
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:13,939
here see if that does anything water
bottles are over here oops this will be

424
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:13,949
bottles are over here oops this will be
 

425
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:21,139
bottles are over here oops this will be
our first brewing attempt okay and again

426
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:21,149
our first brewing attempt okay and again
 

427
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:26,169
our first brewing attempt okay and again
I'm going to make an awkward potion see

428
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:26,179
I'm going to make an awkward potion see
 

429
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:31,099
I'm going to make an awkward potion see
that set here we go so no update when it

430
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:31,109
that set here we go so no update when it
 

431
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:35,359
that set here we go so no update when it
starts brewing and probably not one when

432
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:35,369
starts brewing and probably not one when
 

433
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:37,969
starts brewing and probably not one when
it finishes either I'm going to make a

434
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:37,979
it finishes either I'm going to make a
 

435
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:41,779
it finishes either I'm going to make a
cauldron just since we're goofing around

436
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:41,789
cauldron just since we're goofing around
 

437
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:45,859
cauldron just since we're goofing around
here even though I probably won't use

438
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:45,869
here even though I probably won't use
 

439
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:48,529
here even though I probably won't use
any of these i guess 'sir yeah they're

440
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:48,539
any of these i guess 'sir yeah they're
 

441
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,479
any of these i guess 'sir yeah they're
probably just fear brewing in the nether

442
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:50,489
probably just fear brewing in the nether
 

443
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:57,999
probably just fear brewing in the nether
you'll need these let's put it over here

444
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:58,009
you'll need these let's put it over here
 

445
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:03,139
you'll need these let's put it over here
whoa first time I've ever placed the

446
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:03,149
whoa first time I've ever placed the
 

447
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,949
whoa first time I've ever placed the
cauldron in this game so weird you can

448
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
cauldron in this game so weird you can
 

449
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:16,719
cauldron in this game so weird you can
go in it you can put water in it and

450
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:16,729

 

451
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,999

three three uses before it uses the

452
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,009
three three uses before it uses the
 

453
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,579
three three uses before it uses the
water up yeah definitely using a water

454
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:25,589
water up yeah definitely using a water
 

455
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,899
water up yeah definitely using a water
source block is easier okay what happens

456
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:29,909
source block is easier okay what happens
 

457
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:37,539
source block is easier okay what happens
if we can remove these with a piston

458
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:37,549

 

459
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,809

lu-chen
 

461
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:45,499
lu-chen
I try it yeah yeah then when there's

462
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:45,509
I try it yeah yeah then when there's
 

463
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:50,840
I try it yeah yeah then when there's
water in no well maybe I ten seems to be

464
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:50,850
water in no well maybe I ten seems to be
 

465
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,840
water in no well maybe I ten seems to be
more difficult there you know hey I'm

466
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:56,850
more difficult there you know hey I'm
 

467
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,329
more difficult there you know hey I'm
still in it that's cool oh not anymore

468
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:01,339
still in it that's cool oh not anymore
 

469
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,999
still in it that's cool oh not anymore
mmm okay this did not update by the

470
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:05,009
mmm okay this did not update by the
 

471
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,590
mmm okay this did not update by the
looks of it

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,600
looks of it
 

473
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,379
looks of it
can we move these with a piston nope

474
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:14,389

 

475
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:19,210

okay good to know I can't think of any

476
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:19,220
okay good to know I can't think of any
 

477
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,649
okay good to know I can't think of any
well give me a second I think if there's

478
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:21,659
well give me a second I think if there's
 

479
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,979
well give me a second I think if there's
anything I'd want to do with that update

480
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:23,989
anything I'd want to do with that update
 

481
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:28,969
anything I'd want to do with that update
probably not though yeah I don't know I

482
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:28,979
probably not though yeah I don't know I
 

483
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:31,429
probably not though yeah I don't know I
can't really think of any positive or

484
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:31,439
can't really think of any positive or
 

485
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,099
can't really think of any positive or
practical benefit to doing a block

486
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:34,109
practical benefit to doing a block
 

487
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:38,479
practical benefit to doing a block
update on these brewing stands I thought

488
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:38,489
update on these brewing stands I thought
 

489
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:40,549
update on these brewing stands I thought
I'd check out the cauldrons though just

490
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:40,559
I'd check out the cauldrons though just
 

491
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,649
I'd check out the cauldrons though just
in case somebody's interested I'm

492
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:42,659
in case somebody's interested I'm
 

493
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:47,229
in case somebody's interested I'm
guessing they do yep let's try it again

494
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:47,239
guessing they do yep let's try it again
 

495
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:51,620
guessing they do yep let's try it again
yep another time

496
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:51,630
yep another time
 

497
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,240
yep another time
and fulfilling yep so all four of those

498
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,250
and fulfilling yep so all four of those
 

499
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,060
and fulfilling yep so all four of those
cause the block updates and I got

500
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,070
cause the block updates and I got
 

501
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,830
cause the block updates and I got
another thing going on here I got ten

502
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:01,840
another thing going on here I got ten
 

503
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,560
another thing going on here I got ten
brewing stands here now full of water

504
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:04,570
brewing stands here now full of water
 

505
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,650
brewing stands here now full of water
bottles I just want to see how long it

506
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:07,660
bottles I just want to see how long it
 

507
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,860
bottles I just want to see how long it
takes me to put a wart in each of these

508
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:12,870
takes me to put a wart in each of these
 

509
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,200
takes me to put a wart in each of these
see if by the time I get to the end if

510
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,210
see if by the time I get to the end if
 

511
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,079
see if by the time I get to the end if
this one's done or not see how far along

512
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:19,089
this one's done or not see how far along
 

513
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,180
this one's done or not see how far along
it is so here we go because when I do

514
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,190
it is so here we go because when I do
 

515
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,430
it is so here we go because when I do
the brewing I'll probably do it in mass

516
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,440
the brewing I'll probably do it in mass
 

517
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,660
the brewing I'll probably do it in mass
quantities like this so I want to be

518
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:30,670
quantities like this so I want to be
 

519
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,760
quantities like this so I want to be
able to do it as quickly as possible and

520
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:32,770
able to do it as quickly as possible and
 

521
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:39,110
able to do it as quickly as possible and
have isn't brewing stands ready to go

522
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120

 

523
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,460

and I'll probably put the bottles in

524
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,470
and I'll probably put the bottles in
 

525
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,100
and I'll probably put the bottles in
first and then put the ingredients in do

526
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,110
first and then put the ingredients in do
 

527
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,440
first and then put the ingredients in do
a big batch of something and then put it

528
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,450
a big batch of something and then put it
 

529
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:53,400
a big batch of something and then put it
in a storage chest so mmm you see it

530
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,410
in a storage chest so mmm you see it
 

531
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,480
in a storage chest so mmm you see it
just finished so that's ten stands I

532
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,490
just finished so that's ten stands I
 

533
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,930
just finished so that's ten stands I
think that's a good number right there

534
00:15:59,930 --> 00:15:59,940
think that's a good number right there
 

535
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,220
think that's a good number right there
can't really do it any quicker because

536
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,230
can't really do it any quicker because
 

537
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,600
can't really do it any quicker because
going at an average speed there okay

538
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:08,610

 

539
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,860

yeah so I've been thinking about how I

540
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:10,870
yeah so I've been thinking about how I
 

541
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,450
yeah so I've been thinking about how I
want to do the potion room for a few

542
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,460
want to do the potion room for a few
 

543
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,150
want to do the potion room for a few
minutes here and I came up with a plan

544
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,160
minutes here and I came up with a plan
 

545
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,910
minutes here and I came up with a plan
that I think is pretty awesome it's

546
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
that I think is pretty awesome it's
 

547
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,550
that I think is pretty awesome it's
going to be a lot of work though I'm not

548
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
going to be a lot of work though I'm not
 

549
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,900
going to be a lot of work though I'm not
going to go into all the details of it

550
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:21,910
going to go into all the details of it
 

551
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,420
going to go into all the details of it
today just because we'll need at least

552
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,430
today just because we'll need at least
 

553
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,240
today just because we'll need at least
one more episode to do it but I'll give

554
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,250
one more episode to do it but I'll give
 

555
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,950
one more episode to do it but I'll give
you I'll give you at least one detail

556
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:28,960
you I'll give you at least one detail
 

557
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,890
you I'll give you at least one detail
here it seems like the most tedious part

558
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:31,900
here it seems like the most tedious part
 

559
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,890
here it seems like the most tedious part
of brewing these potions is placing the

560
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:34,900
of brewing these potions is placing the
 

561
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,190
of brewing these potions is placing the
water bottles in these brewing stands so

562
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,200
water bottles in these brewing stands so
 

563
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,930
water bottles in these brewing stands so
if we got if we got 10 brewing stands

564
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:39,940
if we got if we got 10 brewing stands
 

565
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,800
if we got if we got 10 brewing stands
we'll have to manually we'll have to

566
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:43,810
we'll have to manually we'll have to
 

567
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,620
we'll have to manually we'll have to
fill the water bottles and then pick

568
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:46,630
fill the water bottles and then pick
 

569
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,210
fill the water bottles and then pick
them up put them into here for all 10 of

570
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,220
them up put them into here for all 10 of
 

571
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,850
them up put them into here for all 10 of
them and that's going to be a huge issue

572
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:53,860
them and that's going to be a huge issue
 

573
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,769
them and that's going to be a huge issue
if the water bottles are all over the

574
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:55,779
if the water bottles are all over the
 

575
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:56,010
if the water bottles are all over the
place

576
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,020
place
 

577
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,970
place
so this is my first idea right where

578
00:16:59,970 --> 00:16:59,980
so this is my first idea right where
 

579
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,670
so this is my first idea right where
this torch is is a really nice spot

580
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:02,680
this torch is is a really nice spot
 

581
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,530
this torch is is a really nice spot
because I can reach

582
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:04,540
because I can reach
 

583
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,650
because I can reach
all the Brewing stands pretty much from

584
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:07,660
all the Brewing stands pretty much from
 

585
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,480
all the Brewing stands pretty much from
this point so I'm thinking have like

586
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,490
this point so I'm thinking have like
 

587
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,930
this point so I'm thinking have like
four on this wall here then three one

588
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:18,940
four on this wall here then three one
 

589
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,170
four on this wall here then three one
two three over on this side and then

590
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,180
two three over on this side and then
 

591
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,939
two three over on this side and then
three on this side for a total of ten

592
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:25,949
three on this side for a total of ten
 

593
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,900
three on this side for a total of ten
probably won't have one in the middle

594
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:27,910
probably won't have one in the middle
 

595
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:35,670
probably won't have one in the middle
here and then I'll have a water source

596
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:35,680
here and then I'll have a water source
 

597
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,810
here and then I'll have a water source
above me here just we'll just test this

598
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:39,820
above me here just we'll just test this
 

599
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,940
above me here just we'll just test this
out like that so when I need to fill the

600
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:44,950
out like that so when I need to fill the
 

601
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,530
out like that so when I need to fill the
water bottles I should be able to kind

602
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:49,540
water bottles I should be able to kind
 

603
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,000
water bottles I should be able to kind
of fill up my inventory here should be

604
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,010
of fill up my inventory here should be
 

605
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,170
of fill up my inventory here should be
able to just right click and it throws

606
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,180
able to just right click and it throws
 

607
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,880
able to just right click and it throws
them straight up and lands right at my

608
00:17:59,880 --> 00:17:59,890
them straight up and lands right at my
 

609
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,330
them straight up and lands right at my
feet like that so when I go to fill the

610
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:03,340
feet like that so when I go to fill the
 

611
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,880
feet like that so when I go to fill the
brewery stands and I take the water

612
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:05,890
brewery stands and I take the water
 

613
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,980
brewery stands and I take the water
bottle out of my inventory to put it in

614
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:07,990
bottle out of my inventory to put it in
 

615
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,310
bottle out of my inventory to put it in
here a new one will go in its place and

616
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,320
here a new one will go in its place and
 

617
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
here a new one will go in its place and
I'll just be able to fill it without

618
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,330
I'll just be able to fill it without
 

619
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,110
I'll just be able to fill it without
having to go to a chest to pick up the

620
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,120
having to go to a chest to pick up the
 

621
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,330
having to go to a chest to pick up the
water bottles or whatever that we all in

622
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,340
water bottles or whatever that we all in
 

623
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,450
water bottles or whatever that we all in
that one spot so that's my first idea

624
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:21,460
that one spot so that's my first idea
 

625
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:29,130
that one spot so that's my first idea
for the water bottles just going to say

626
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,140
for the water bottles just going to say
 

627
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,060
for the water bottles just going to say
something else I can't remember now

628
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,070
something else I can't remember now
 

629
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,200
something else I can't remember now
before we end today though I'm going to

630
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,210
before we end today though I'm going to
 

631
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,790
before we end today though I'm going to
play around with some brewing so I'm

632
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:35,800
play around with some brewing so I'm
 

633
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,920
play around with some brewing so I'm
going to make some haste potions here

634
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:37,930
going to make some haste potions here
 

635
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,590
going to make some haste potions here
maybe some fire resistant ones because

636
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:40,600
maybe some fire resistant ones because
 

637
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,580
maybe some fire resistant ones because
those are the two that appeal to me most

638
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:43,590
