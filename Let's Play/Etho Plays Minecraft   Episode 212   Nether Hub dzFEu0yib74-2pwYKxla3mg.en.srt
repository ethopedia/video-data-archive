okay so i just tuned the note blocks
 

159
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,149
okay so i just tuned the note blocks
there too so let's try those out

160
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
there too so let's try those out
 

161

00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
get around this mess
 

241
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,150
get around this mess
i've given out a lot of thought

242
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
i've given out a lot of thought
 

243
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,909
i've given out a lot of thought
originally i was going to do it like

244
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
originally i was going to do it like
 

245
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,309
originally i was going to do it like
we have on the minecraft server where

246
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
we have on the minecraft server where
 

247
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,110

you have lots of different
 

249
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,990
you have lots of different
um you know things around the hub

250
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
um you know things around the hub
 

251
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,390
um you know things around the hub
destination points that's what i'll say

252
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
destination points that's what i'll say
 

253
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,550
destination points that's what i'll say
destination points around the hub

254
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
destination points around the hub
 

255
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,469
destination points around the hub
and you just put the mine cart on the

256
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
and you just put the mine cart on the
 

257
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,150
and you just put the mine cart on the
one you want to go to hit the button

258
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
one you want to go to hit the button
 

259
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,189
one you want to go to hit the button
and go from point a to point b and point

260
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
and go from point a to point b and point
 

261
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,430
and go from point a to point b and point
b to back to point a type thing

262
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
b to back to point a type thing
 

263
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,990
b to back to point a type thing
very simple works great on the minecraft

264
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
very simple works great on the minecraft
 

265
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,670
very simple works great on the minecraft
server

266
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
server
 

267
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,670
server
and it's very easy to set up

268
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
and it's very easy to set up
 

269
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,029
and it's very easy to set up
however i am on a single player world

270
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
however i am on a single player world
 

271
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,230
however i am on a single player world
here i can do

272
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
here i can do
 

273
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,710
here i can do
i can make this as fancy or as simple as

274
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
i can make this as fancy or as simple as
 

275
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,870
i can make this as fancy or as simple as
i want

276
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
i want
 

277
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,270
i want
and i think i'm going to go try or try

278
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
and i think i'm going to go try or try
 

279
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,510
and i think i'm going to go try or try
go the fancy route wait a minute

280
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
go the fancy route wait a minute
 

281
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,390
go the fancy route wait a minute
so this is at 87. trying to figure out

282
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
so this is at 87. trying to figure out
 

283
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,029
so this is at 87. trying to figure out
how high we want the nether hub

284
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
how high we want the nether hub
 

285
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,950
how high we want the nether hub
i think we want to go a little bit lower

286
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
i think we want to go a little bit lower
 

287
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,990
i think we want to go a little bit lower
so i brought the tnt

288
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
so i brought the tnt
 

289
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,909
so i brought the tnt
yeah i think most of my portals are down

290
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
yeah i think most of my portals are down
 

291
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,589
yeah i think most of my portals are down
lower

292
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
lower
 

293
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,189
lower
well it doesn't actually you know it

294
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
well it doesn't actually you know it
 

295
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,510
well it doesn't actually you know it
doesn't matter what height we do it we

296
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
doesn't matter what height we do it we
 

297
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,990
doesn't matter what height we do it we
can always move

298
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
can always move
 

299
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,189
can always move
these portals um

300
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199

 

301
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,950

maybe

302
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960

 

303
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,749

let's go down to about let's go down to

304
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759

 

305
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,589

i 64. 64 would be a good place for

306
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
i 64. 64 would be a good place for
 

307
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,950
i 64. 64 would be a good place for
another hub

308
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
another hub
 

309
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,629
another hub
um because i may make some tunnels

310
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
um because i may make some tunnels
 

311
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,230
um because i may make some tunnels
where you can look out into the nether

312
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
where you can look out into the nether
 

313
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,390
where you can look out into the nether
and that would be cool

314
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
and that would be cool
 

315
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,629
and that would be cool
if you build in the roof or the ceiling

316
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
if you build in the roof or the ceiling
 

317
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,550
if you build in the roof or the ceiling
it's very easy

318
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
it's very easy
 

319
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,550
it's very easy
to build it without getting interference

320
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
to build it without getting interference
 

321
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,749
to build it without getting interference
from gas

322
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
from gas
 

323
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,350
from gas
and same if you build it way down low

324
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
and same if you build it way down low
 

325
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,869
and same if you build it way down low
uh because you don't encounter these

326
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
uh because you don't encounter these
 

327
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,909
uh because you don't encounter these
open areas but if you want a good view

328
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
open areas but if you want a good view
 

329
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,309
open areas but if you want a good view
i think 64 is probably the way to go

330
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319

 

331
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,510

okay so maybe let's just

332
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520

 

333
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,830

i'm a little well wait a minute wait a

334
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
i'm a little well wait a minute wait a
 

335
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,230
i'm a little well wait a minute wait a
minute

336
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
minute
 

337
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,550
minute
let's let's start in the center

338
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560

 

339
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,110

go down all the way to 64 and then start

340
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
go down all the way to 64 and then start
 

341
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,550
go down all the way to 64 and then start
hollowing out a huge

342
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560

371
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,910
we are down here tnt is placed we're
gonna see how much of this will blow out

372
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
gonna see how much of this will blow out
 

373
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,550

by 25
 

383
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,509
by 25
circle hub i think

384
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
circle hub i think
 

385
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,350
circle hub i think
um so we'll see how this goes

386
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
um so we'll see how this goes
 

387

blow about
 

393
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,949
blow about
four blocks down or so maybe more i i've

394
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
four blocks down or so maybe more i i've
 

395
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,790
four blocks down or so maybe more i i've
never really

396
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
never really
 

397
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,150
never really
used tnt a lot in the nether so

398
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
used tnt a lot in the nether so
 

399
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,269
used tnt a lot in the nether so
i think nether netherrack is much like

400
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
i think nether netherrack is much like
 

401
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,269
i think nether netherrack is much like
soil though

402
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
soil though
 

403
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:53,910

it's pretty good so i think the next

418
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
it's pretty good so i think the next
 

419
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,550
it's pretty good so i think the next
thing i'm going to do is start laying

420
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
thing i'm going to do is start laying
 

421
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:18,870
thing i'm going to do is start laying
down

422
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
down
 

423
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,829
down
a stone brick floor i got to make i want

424
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
a stone brick floor i got to make i want
 

425
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,670
a stone brick floor i got to make i want
to make everything gas proof it's very

426
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
to make everything gas proof it's very
 

427
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,509
to make everything gas proof it's very
important to me

428

i don't want to have to fix anything
 

431
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,829
i don't want to have to fix anything
once i've built it in the nether here

432
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
once i've built it in the nether here
 

433
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,590
once i've built it in the nether here
so maybe at level 63 i will put down

434
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
so maybe at level 63 i will put down
 

435
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,150
so maybe at level 63 i will put down
a 20 25 by 25 circle

436
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
a 20 25 by 25 circle
 

437
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,430
a 20 25 by 25 circle
um out of stone brick and then i'll get

438
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
um out of stone brick and then i'll get
 

439
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,750
um out of stone brick and then i'll get
back to you

ten eleven twelve we got the circle laid

452
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
ten eleven twelve we got the circle laid
 

453
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:46,790
ten eleven twelve we got the circle laid
out let's fill it in

454
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800

 

455
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,910

great so we got our circle

456
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
great so we got our circle
 

457
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,509
great so we got our circle
done here it's a 25 diameter like i said

458
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
done here it's a 25 diameter like i said
 

459
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,550
done here it's a 25 diameter like i said
and it feels like a good size i think

460
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
and it feels like a good size i think
 

461
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,990
and it feels like a good size i think
it's good

462
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000

 

463
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,389

the next thing we got to do is move our

464
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
the next thing we got to do is move our
 

465
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,750
the next thing we got to do is move our
nether portal

466
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
nether portal
 

467
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,509
nether portal
our main one down here

468
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
our main one down here
 

469
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,910
our main one down here
and this is the center point you'll

470
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
and this is the center point you'll
 

471
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,110
and this is the center point you'll
notice so i've been

472
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
notice so i've been
 

473
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,150
notice so i've been
i've been doing this by odd numbers like

474
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
i've been doing this by odd numbers like
 

475
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,750
i've been doing this by odd numbers like
this circle has a 25 diameter so

476
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
this circle has a 25 diameter so
 

477
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,990
this circle has a 25 diameter so
we're gonna have to arrange the portals

478
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
we're gonna have to arrange the portals
 

479
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,990
we're gonna have to arrange the portals
in a way that they're an odd number two

480
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
in a way that they're an odd number two
 

481
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,670
in a way that they're an odd number two
there's a pigment up there i'm gonna hit

482
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
there's a pigment up there i'm gonna hit
 

483
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,629
there's a pigment up there i'm gonna hit
i know it

484
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639

 

485
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,550

see i'm gonna break this portal up here

486
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
see i'm gonna break this portal up here
 

487
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,670
see i'm gonna break this portal up here
get some more obsidian

488

that get some more obsidian
and we're going to make an odd sized

504
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
and we're going to make an odd sized
 

505
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,829
and we're going to make an odd sized
portal

506
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839

 

507
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,069

this is where i had the nether portal it

508
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
this is where i had the nether portal it
 

509
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,069
this is where i had the nether portal it
was in a 4x4

510
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
was in a 4x4
 

511
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,190
was in a 4x4
pattern now we're gonna make it a five

512
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
pattern now we're gonna make it a five
 

513
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,710
pattern now we're gonna make it a five
by five odd number

514
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
by five odd number
 

515
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,590
by five odd number
with this as the center so we will do

516
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
with this as the center so we will do
 

517
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,350
with this as the center so we will do
this

518
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
this
 

519
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,670
this
and let's hope it works or links up

520
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
and let's hope it works or links up
 

521
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,389
and let's hope it works or links up
properly still

522
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399

 

523
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,190

like that unfortunately though you can't

524
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
like that unfortunately though you can't
 

525
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,030
like that unfortunately though you can't
really customize portals they always

526
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
really customize portals they always
 

527
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,110
really customize portals they always
have to be the same way

528
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
have to be the same way
 

529
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,550
have to be the same way
two three four

530
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560

 

531
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,629

two three four so i think we're just

532
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
two three four so i think we're just
 

533
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,230
two three four so i think we're just
going to make it look like a

534
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
going to make it look like a
 

535
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,269
going to make it look like a
one wide by three high thing

536
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
one wide by three high thing
 

537
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,870
one wide by three high thing
you'll see

538
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880

 

539
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,949

okay so that's all the net the obsidian

540
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
okay so that's all the net the obsidian
 

541
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,629
okay so that's all the net the obsidian
we had this is my extra i brought

542
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639

 

543
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,990

be really cool if you could do like a

544
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
be really cool if you could do like a
 

545
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,230
be really cool if you could do like a
three by three portal or something

546
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
three by three portal or something
 

547
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,949
three by three portal or something
i know you can look with like mc edits

548
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
i know you can look with like mc edits
 

549
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,750
i know you can look with like mc edits
or

550
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
or
 

551
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,949
or
other editors but

552
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
other editors but
 

553
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,990
other editors but
not with regular minecraft

554
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
not with regular minecraft
 

555
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,350
not with regular minecraft
uh let's do

556
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
uh let's do
 

557
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,230
uh let's do
that either puts a column on this side

558
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
that either puts a column on this side
 

559
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,110
that either puts a column on this side
or the side

560
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
or the side
 

561
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,870
or the side
it doesn't matter much i guess we'll

562
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
it doesn't matter much i guess we'll
 

563
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:31,030
it doesn't matter much i guess we'll
just do here

564
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
just do here
 

565
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,069
just do here
and let's light it up try it out

566
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079

 

567
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,030

and this should take me back to the man

568
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
and this should take me back to the man
 

569
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,949
and this should take me back to the man
cave

570
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959

 

571
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,509

very good and if this portal is not here

572
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
very good and if this portal is not here
 

573
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,350
very good and if this portal is not here
it takes me to the snowflake

574
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
it takes me to the snowflake
 

575
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,790
it takes me to the snowflake
portal

576
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800

 

577
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,269

all right how does that compare to this

578
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
all right how does that compare to this
 

579
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,750
all right how does that compare to this
circle size it takes up quite a bit of

580
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
circle size it takes up quite a bit of
 

581
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,389
circle size it takes up quite a bit of
the room doesn't it

582
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
the room doesn't it
 

583
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,230
the room doesn't it
we may have to make it bigger i'm not

584
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
we may have to make it bigger i'm not
 

585
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,509
we may have to make it bigger i'm not
sure yet

586
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
sure yet
 

587
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,509
sure yet
uh but what we got to figure out now is

588
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
uh but what we got to figure out now is
 

589
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,350
uh but what we got to figure out now is
what we want to make the nether hub

590
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
what we want to make the nether hub
 

591
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,949
what we want to make the nether hub
out of because i don't really want to

592
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
out of because i don't really want to
 

593
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,550
out of because i don't really want to
make it stone brick it's

594
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
make it stone brick it's
 

595
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,990
make it stone brick it's
it's really dull so we got to put a

596
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
it's really dull so we got to put a
 

597
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,189
it's really dull so we got to put a
lining over top this

598
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
lining over top this
 

599
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,389
lining over top this
uh either wood or or sandstone or

600
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
uh either wood or or sandstone or
 

601
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,990
uh either wood or or sandstone or
something we can get stairs and half

602
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
something we can get stairs and half
 

603
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,430
something we can get stairs and half
slabs out of

604
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
slabs out of
 

605
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,870
slabs out of
and i think i'm going to go with

606
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
and i think i'm going to go with
 

607
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,949
and i think i'm going to go with
sandstone but we also got to figure out

608
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
sandstone but we also got to figure out
 

609
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,749
sandstone but we also got to figure out
another

610
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
another
 

611
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,710
another
block to go with it so i'll mess around

612
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
block to go with it so i'll mess around
 

613
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,470
block to go with it so i'll mess around
with it a bit and figure something out

614
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480

 

615
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,310

the smelting just finished let's get our

616
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
the smelting just finished let's get our
 

617
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,509
the smelting just finished let's get our
xp

618
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
xp
 

619
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,590
xp
we were at 6 i think

620
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600

 

621
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,470

13 16

622
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
13 16
 

623
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,829
13 16
did i miss one oh my mouse keeps going

624
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
did i miss one oh my mouse keeps going
 

625
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,949
did i miss one oh my mouse keeps going
crazy

626
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
crazy
 

627
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,629
crazy
20 oh yeah you quite a bit from smelting

628
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
20 oh yeah you quite a bit from smelting
 

629
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,590
20 oh yeah you quite a bit from smelting
iron in that

630
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
iron in that
 

631
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,430
iron in that
22.

632
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440

 

633
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,110

let's be adventurous with this i think

634
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
let's be adventurous with this i think
 

635
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,110
let's be adventurous with this i think
i'm going to go with purple wool and

636
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
i'm going to go with purple wool and
 

637
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,030
i'm going to go with purple wool and
sandstone

638
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
sandstone
 

639
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,550
sandstone
always wanted to use purple wool with

640
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
always wanted to use purple wool with
 

641
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,870
always wanted to use purple wool with
something very rarely do i use wool

642
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
something very rarely do i use wool
 

643
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,910
something very rarely do i use wool
actually so

644
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
actually so
 

645
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,269
actually so
be nice change and

646
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
be nice change and
 

647
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,030
be nice change and
it goes well with the portal color too

648
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
it goes well with the portal color too
 

649
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,949
it goes well with the portal color too
so as far as this circle size again it's

650
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
so as far as this circle size again it's
 

651
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,110
so as far as this circle size again it's
25 i think we should go up to

652
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
25 i think we should go up to
 

653
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,389
25 i think we should go up to
31. so three blocks each

654
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
31. so three blocks each
 

655
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,310
31. so three blocks each
each side and that will make this feel

656
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
each side and that will make this feel
 

657
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,470
each side and that will make this feel
better because i wanted to put

658
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
better because i wanted to put
 

659
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,949
better because i wanted to put
a skin over the portal as well so it's

660
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
a skin over the portal as well so it's
 

661
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,749
a skin over the portal as well so it's
going to come out

662
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
going to come out
 

663
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,949
going to come out
at least one more block yet so we kind

664
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
at least one more block yet so we kind
 

665
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,230
at least one more block yet so we kind
of get something like

666
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
of get something like
 

667
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,790
of get something like
like that you know just the one wide

668
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
like that you know just the one wide
 

669
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,389
like that you know just the one wide
slit

670
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399

 

671
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,470

but yeah we'll mess with that in a bit

672
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
but yeah we'll mess with that in a bit
 

673
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,230
but yeah we'll mess with that in a bit
um i'm going to cover this with

674
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
um i'm going to cover this with
 

675
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,870
um i'm going to cover this with
sandstone as well

676
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
sandstone as well
 

677
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,710
sandstone as well
and later we'll probably incorporate

678
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
and later we'll probably incorporate
 

679
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,749
and later we'll probably incorporate
some design into it

680
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
some design into it
 

681
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,910
some design into it

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
the portal and it makes it look
 

853
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,110
the portal and it makes it look
wider um

854
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120

 

855
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,750

let's see if we can make it something

856
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
let's see if we can make it something
 

857
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,669
let's see if we can make it something
that looks like a 3x3 i think that would

858
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
that looks like a 3x3 i think that would
 

859
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:47,990
that looks like a 3x3 i think that would
be good

860
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
be good
 

861
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,630
be good
even if it's not really even though it's

862
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
even if it's not really even though it's
 

863

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840

 

867
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,750

three

868
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760

 

869
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,750

yeah come on move quicker

870
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
yeah come on move quicker
 

871
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,070
yeah come on move quicker
it's hard to build while recording

872
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
it's hard to build while recording
 

873
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,590
it's hard to build while recording
because i always wanted to go really

883
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,190

we'll just try this out

884
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200

and put some on this side we'll just see

890
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
and put some on this side we'll just see
 

891
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,470
and put some on this side we'll just see
how that looks

892
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
how that looks
 

893
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,630
how that looks
and go from there

894
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
and go from there
 

895
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,669

see yeah because we have like we're
 

899
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,430
see yeah because we have like we're
utilizing a three by three area so it

900
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
utilizing a three by three area so it
 

901
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,350
utilizing a three by three area so it
sort of makes it look wider

902
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
sort of makes it look wider
 

903
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,830
sort of makes it look wider
even though it's not to me anyway

904
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
even though it's not to me anyway

see i did that here as well where the
stairs are

958
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
stairs are
 

959
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,630
stairs are
are like that and then the block sticks

are like that and then the block sticks
 

961
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,950
are like that and then the block sticks
out

962
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960

 

963
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,710

oh but i did that different that's right

going back something i noticed uh with
 

967
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,549
going back something i noticed uh with
the recent patches

968
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
the recent patches
 

969
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,789
the recent patches
the end loads really quick for me now

970
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
the end loads really quick for me now
 

971
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,590
the end loads really quick for me now
which is cool

972
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,600
which is cool
 

973
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,110
which is cool
like almost as soon as you go in the

974
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
like almost as soon as you go in the
 

975
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,950
like almost as soon as you go in the
portal it loads instantly

976
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960

 

977
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,669

so yeah it could either either do it

978
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
so yeah it could either either do it
 

979
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:35,990
so yeah it could either either do it
like

980
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
like
 

981
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,909
like
that or do it like

982
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
that or do it like
 

983
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:48,630
that or do it like
we had it there like that

984
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640

 

985
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,750

looks more together if it's like this

986
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760

 

987
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,830

but anyway uh something else i thought

988
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
but anyway uh something else i thought
 

989
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,190
but anyway uh something else i thought
would be cool

990
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
would be cool
 

991
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,390
would be cool
if we put a glowstone here not a

992
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
if we put a glowstone here not a
 

993
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,029
if we put a glowstone here not a
glowstone

994

1030
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
just so you could compare but maybe next
 

1031
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,470
just so you could compare but maybe next
time we'll do that i think we're running

1032
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
time we'll do that i think we're running
 

1033
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,549
time we'll do that i think we're running
low on time

1034
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
low on time
 

1035
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,470
low on time
and uh i did want to start on the

1036
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
and uh i did want to start on the
 

1037
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,630
and uh i did want to start on the
station today too but

1038
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
station today too but
 

1039
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,430
station today too but
i think we're running low on time but i

1040
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
i think we're running low on time but i
 

1041
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,990
i think we're running low on time but i
do have that mostly figured out

1042
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
do have that mostly figured out
 

1043
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,149
do have that mostly figured out
oh yeah there's no there's no top on

1044
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
oh yeah there's no there's no top on
 

1045
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,549
oh yeah there's no there's no top on
this thing oop

1046
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
this thing oop
 

1047
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:25,190
this thing oop
there we go

1048
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200

 

1049
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,430

okay that's cool and then

1050
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
okay that's cool and then
 

1051
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:39,269
okay that's cool and then
maybe if we did that

1052
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279

 

1053
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,710

oh yeah i'm liking this you know i think

1054
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
oh yeah i'm liking this you know i think
 

1055
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,549
oh yeah i'm liking this you know i think
i do like this more actually

1056
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559
i do like this more actually
 

1057
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,510
i do like this more actually
than this the eye shape

1058
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520

 

1059
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,430

okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna continue

1060
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna continue
 

1061
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,269
okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna continue
this and

1062
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
this and
 

1063
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,870
this and
wait actually

1064
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880

 

1065
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,549

bounce out bounce it out because you

1066
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
bounce out bounce it out because you
 

1067
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,310
bounce out bounce it out because you
only see the top half now you can just

1068
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
only see the top half now you can just
 

1069
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,269
only see the top half now you can just
see the bottom half

1070
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
see the bottom half
 

1071
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,190
see the bottom half
that's that's probably better too

1072
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200

 

1073
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,950

cool all right i'll work on this some

1074
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
cool all right i'll work on this some
 

1075
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,590
cool all right i'll work on this some
more and i'll get back to you

1076
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600

 

1077
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,990

i found 19 more lamps at my other base

1078
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
i found 19 more lamps at my other base
 

1079
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,909
i found 19 more lamps at my other base
so we were able to finish it and it

1080
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
so we were able to finish it and it
 

1081
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,590
so we were able to finish it and it
gives out a lot of light

1082
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
gives out a lot of light
 

1083
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,789
gives out a lot of light
it's good the only real dark spot is the

1084
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799
it's good the only real dark spot is the
 

1085
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,830
it's good the only real dark spot is the
middle ring

1086
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
middle ring
 

1087
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,269
middle ring
because these give out a lot of light

1088
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,279
because these give out a lot of light
 

1089
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,269
because these give out a lot of light
too

1090
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
too
 

1091
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,830
too
um so i think when this is all done

1092
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
um so i think when this is all done
 

1093
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,310
um so i think when this is all done
we should maybe suspend some lighting

1094
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,320
we should maybe suspend some lighting
 

1095
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,630
we should maybe suspend some lighting
from the ceiling in this middle part

1096
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
from the ceiling in this middle part
 

1097
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,510
from the ceiling in this middle part
if if we want it's it's pretty bright as

1098
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
if if we want it's it's pretty bright as
 

1099
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,909
if if we want it's it's pretty bright as
is

1100
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
is
 

1101
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,549
is
and it doesn't affect spawning at all so

1102
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
and it doesn't affect spawning at all so
 

1103
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,230
and it doesn't affect spawning at all so
it doesn't really matter

1104
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
it doesn't really matter
 

1105
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,590
it doesn't really matter
then with the portal we'll also probably

1106
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600
then with the portal we'll also probably
 

1107
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,990
then with the portal we'll also probably
attach it to the ceiling

1108
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
attach it to the ceiling
 

1109
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,750
attach it to the ceiling
and that'll be cool

1110
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
and that'll be cool
 

1111
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,269
and that'll be cool
i wanted to try this also if we put

1112
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
i wanted to try this also if we put
 

1113
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,669
i wanted to try this also if we put
supports here instead of having it

1114
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
supports here instead of having it
 

1115
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:09,269
supports here instead of having it
floating like that

1116
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279

 

1117
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,950

let's try it out do it here too

1118
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960

 

1119
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,790

that way it looks more complete

1120
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:20,800
that way it looks more complete
 

1121
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,630
that way it looks more complete

if i was to play and record it would

1192
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
if i was to play and record it would
 

1193
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,789
if i was to play and record it would
force me to slow down

1194
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
force me to slow down
 

1195
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,190
force me to slow down
a bit and actually get through the whole

1196
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
a bit and actually get through the whole
 

1197
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,350
a bit and actually get through the whole
map

1198
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360

 

1199
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,510

that would be that'd be pretty good so i

1200
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,520
that would be that'd be pretty good so i
 

1201
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,630
that would be that'd be pretty good so i
would alternate

1202
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
would alternate
 

1203
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,789
would alternate
between uge and my solo thing and do

1204
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
between uge and my solo thing and do
 

1205
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,430
between uge and my solo thing and do
that and in addition to the lps and that

1206
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
that and in addition to the lps and that
 

1207
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,789
that and in addition to the lps and that
because

1208
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
because
 

1209
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,909
because
ctm maps you can i can record it just

1210
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:29,919
ctm maps you can i can record it just
 

1211
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:30,630
ctm maps you can i can record it just
about

1212
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
about
 

1213
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,310
about
real time and get lots of episodes out

1214
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
real time and get lots of episodes out
 

1215
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,389
real time and get lots of episodes out
doing that they don't get nearly the

1216
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,399
doing that they don't get nearly the
 

1217
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,710
doing that they don't get nearly the
views of other things i do

1218
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
