something different
 

87
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,510
something different
i at the moment i'm not really sure what

88
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
i at the moment i'm not really sure what
 

89
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,429
i at the moment i'm not really sure what
i'm doing i kinda don't think i'm gonna

90
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
i'm doing i kinda don't think i'm gonna
 

91
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,429

be doing a spider only
 

93
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,630
be doing a spider only
spawning system my current thoughts

94
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
spawning system my current thoughts
 

95
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,910
spawning system my current thoughts
are just to have

96
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
are just to have
 

97
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,830
are just to have
like my standard water canals with the

98
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
like my standard water canals with the
 

99
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,070
like my standard water canals with the
spider option

100
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
spider option
 

101
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,190
spider option
i'll have the 6x6 pads

102
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
i'll have the 6x6 pads
 

103
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,990
i'll have the 6x6 pads
and i'll probably have like four of them

104
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
and i'll probably have like four of them
 

105
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,510
and i'll probably have like four of them
let's pretend these are 6x6

106
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
let's pretend these are 6x6
 

107
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,550
let's pretend these are 6x6
pads mobs will go to the center

108
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
pads mobs will go to the center
 

109
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,510
pads mobs will go to the center
with the water canals i'll probably have

110
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
with the water canals i'll probably have
 

111
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,030
with the water canals i'll probably have
lighting on the outside

112
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040

 

113
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,869

and the spider option will pop out of

114
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
and the spider option will pop out of
 

115
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,710
and the spider option will pop out of
the floor those half slabs

116
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720

 

117
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,750

and i may make it a spider only thing

118
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
and i may make it a spider only thing
 

119
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,589
and i may make it a spider only thing
but i don't really think it's worth it

120
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
but i don't really think it's worth it
 

121
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,750
but i don't really think it's worth it
to be honest

122
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
to be honest
 

123
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,430
to be honest
uh unless i make a really huge

124
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
uh unless i make a really huge
 

125
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,750
uh unless i make a really huge
spawning system it's just not going to

126
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
spawning system it's just not going to
 

127
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,470
spawning system it's just not going to
be able to keep

128
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
be able to keep
 

129
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,910
be able to keep
up because spiders

130
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
up because spiders
 

131
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,350
up because spiders
only spawn one quarter of the time so

132
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
only spawn one quarter of the time so
 

133
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,949
only spawn one quarter of the time so
not even one quarter of the time so

134
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
not even one quarter of the time so
 

135
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,070
not even one quarter of the time so
probably need a huge system

136
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
probably need a huge system
 

137
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,869
probably need a huge system
if i was to make it a spider only thing

138
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
if i was to make it a spider only thing
 

139
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,910
if i was to make it a spider only thing
because

140
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
because
 

141
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,229
because
like for tall mobs you have zombies

142
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
like for tall mobs you have zombies
 

143
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,149
like for tall mobs you have zombies
skeletons and creepers that's three

144
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
skeletons and creepers that's three
 

145
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,869
skeletons and creepers that's three
different types of mobs

146
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
different types of mobs
 

147
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,670
different types of mobs
so let's say that's so that's like 75

148
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
so let's say that's so that's like 75
 

149
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,430
so let's say that's so that's like 75
percent of the mobs and then spiders

150
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
percent of the mobs and then spiders
 

151
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,149
percent of the mobs and then spiders
are the other 25 and if it's only

152
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
are the other 25 and if it's only
 

153
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,670
are the other 25 and if it's only
spiders then

154
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
spiders then
 

155
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,910
spiders then
you're spawning is a lot lower than if

156
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
you're spawning is a lot lower than if
 

157
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,710
you're spawning is a lot lower than if
you have like the other three spawning

158
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
you have like the other three spawning
 

159
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,550
you have like the other three spawning
or all four of them together you know

160
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
or all four of them together you know
 

161
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,229
or all four of them together you know
so i kind of don't think it's worth it

162
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
so i kind of don't think it's worth it
 

163
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,229
so i kind of don't think it's worth it
but i want your guys's input should i

164
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
but i want your guys's input should i
 

165
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,309
but i want your guys's input should i
bother with it

166
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
bother with it
 

167
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,390
bother with it
um or do you have any other ideas

168
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
um or do you have any other ideas
 

169
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,869
um or do you have any other ideas
because

170
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879

then i'm planning on making it a
 

297
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,790
then i'm planning on making it a
multiple choice like

298
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
multiple choice like
 

299
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,909
multiple choice like
you'll have four options so then i'll

300
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
you'll have four options so then i'll
 

301
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,749
you'll have four options so then i'll
have another sign

302
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
have another sign
 

303
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,830
have another sign
then it'll be like a 100

304
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
then it'll be like a 100
 

305
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,350
then it'll be like a 100
b 120

306
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
b 120
 

307
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,629
b 120
c 150

308
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
c 150
 

309
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,870
c 150
d 180

310
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880

 

311
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,510

okay and you'll have four buttons to

312
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
okay and you'll have four buttons to
 

313
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,029
okay and you'll have four buttons to
choose a b

314
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
choose a b
 

315
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,150
choose a b
c or d and if you

316
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
c or d and if you
 

317
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,270
c or d and if you
hit d the d button then you would be

318
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
hit d the d button then you would be
 

319
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,909
hit d the d button then you would be
correct you would get a point

320
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
correct you would get a point
 

321
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,430
correct you would get a point
and i'm thinking i'll have 11

322
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
and i'm thinking i'll have 11
 

323
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,150
and i'm thinking i'll have 11
questions in total every time i do a

324
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
questions in total every time i do a
 

325
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,830
questions in total every time i do a
trivia

326

335
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,830
all 11 right i don't know we'll see
uh yeah that's idea so we're here to

336
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
uh yeah that's idea so we're here to
 

337
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,189
uh yeah that's idea so we're here to
kind of figure out some of the

338
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
kind of figure out some of the
 

339
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,909
kind of figure out some of the
components some of the logic

340
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
components some of the logic
 

341
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,670
components some of the logic
there will be some redstone involved but

342
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
there will be some redstone involved but
 

343
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,749
there will be some redstone involved but
most of this will be pretty simple

344
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
most of this will be pretty simple
 

345
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,870
most of this will be pretty simple
by using pistons

346
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
by using pistons
 

347
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,270
by using pistons
so if you hate redstone don't worry we

348
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
so if you hate redstone don't worry we
 

349
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,150
so if you hate redstone don't worry we
will be using

350
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
will be using
 

351
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,430
will be using
pistons and block movement for a lot of

352
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
pistons and block movement for a lot of
 

353
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,070
pistons and block movement for a lot of
this

354
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
this
 

355
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,830
this
it's actually pretty simple and i'm

356
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840
it's actually pretty simple and i'm
 

357
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,309
it's actually pretty simple and i'm
hoping

358
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
hoping
 

359
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,230
hoping
so uh let's begin here

360
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240

 

361
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,469

so i just made a world back up so we're

362
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
so i just made a world back up so we're
 

363
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,670
so i just made a world back up so we're
free to play some

364
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
free to play some
 

365
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,070
free to play some
glass or glowstone if we choose without

366
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
glass or glowstone if we choose without
 

367
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,029
glass or glowstone if we choose without
feeling

368
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
feeling
 

369
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,309
feeling
guilty about destroying it after and

370
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
guilty about destroying it after and
 

371
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,189
guilty about destroying it after and
we're going to build our different

372
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
we're going to build our different
 

373
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,110
we're going to build our different
components figure them out each

374
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
components figure them out each
 

375
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,029
components figure them out each
individually and then when

376
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
individually and then when
 

377
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,990
individually and then when
we get it figured out pretty good we'll

378
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
we get it figured out pretty good we'll
 

379
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,710
we get it figured out pretty good we'll
build the

380
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
build the
 

381
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,189
build the
whole thing put everything together at

382
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
whole thing put everything together at
 

383
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,670
whole thing put everything together at
some other location we choose and

384
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
some other location we choose and
 

385
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,510
some other location we choose and
hopefully build a nice building for it

386
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
hopefully build a nice building for it
 

387
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,110
hopefully build a nice building for it
and that kind of thing

388
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120

 

389
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,990

let's begin here our first most

390
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
let's begin here our first most
 

391
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,629
let's begin here our first most
important

392
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
important
 

393
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,790
important
thing will be

394
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800

 

395
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,670

the memory unit so we can do this pretty

396
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
the memory unit so we can do this pretty
 

397
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,150
the memory unit so we can do this pretty
easy

398
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
easy
 

399
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,509
easy
using glass and

400
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519

 

401
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,149

glass pistons and redstone

402
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
glass pistons and redstone
 

403
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,070
glass pistons and redstone
so let's pretend this is our multiple

404
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
so let's pretend this is our multiple
 

405
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,350
so let's pretend this is our multiple
choice let's say

406
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
choice let's say
 

407
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,230
choice let's say
whatever my question is the answer is c

408
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
whatever my question is the answer is c
 

409
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,430
whatever my question is the answer is c
this would

410
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
this would
 

411
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,590
this would
this glass block would be a this would

412
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
this glass block would be a this would
 

413
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,790
this glass block would be a this would
be b

414
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
be b
 

415
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,750
be b
this would be c and then this would be d

416
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
this would be c and then this would be d
 

417
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,190
this would be c and then this would be d
and we can take advantage

418
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
and we can take advantage
 

419
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,110
and we can take advantage
of a nice little trick

420
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
of a nice little trick
 

421
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,550
of a nice little trick
die

422
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560

 

423
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,430

thank you nice little trick we can do

424
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
thank you nice little trick we can do
 

425
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,670
thank you nice little trick we can do
with the redstone

426
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680

 

427
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,190

so here's something cool about redstone

428
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
so here's something cool about redstone
 

429
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,230
so here's something cool about redstone
if you try to send power through a glass

430
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
if you try to send power through a glass
 

431
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,030
if you try to send power through a glass
block

432
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
block
 

433
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,070
block
you can't but if you try to send power

434
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
you can't but if you try to send power
 

435
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,750
you can't but if you try to send power
through a solid block

436
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
through a solid block
 

437
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,190
through a solid block
a non-translucent block

438
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
a non-translucent block
 

439
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,750
a non-translucent block
like cobblestone you can

440
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
like cobblestone you can
 

441
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,710
like cobblestone you can
and so that's how i will be programming

442
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
and so that's how i will be programming
 

443
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,470
and so that's how i will be programming
everything just using glass blocks and

444
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
everything just using glass blocks and
 

445
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,790
everything just using glass blocks and
solid blocks

446
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
solid blocks
 

447
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,910
solid blocks
so um

448
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
so um
 

449
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,470
so um
what i'll do i'll have

450
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480

 

451
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,550

repeaters at all these

452
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
repeaters at all these
 

453
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,230
repeaters at all these
um two of them will have to have

454
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
um two of them will have to have
 

455
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,430
um two of them will have to have
a double and then we'll have wire like

456
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
a double and then we'll have wire like
 

457
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,310
a double and then we'll have wire like
this

458
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
this
 

459
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,590
this
let's try to figure out our

460
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
let's try to figure out our
 

461
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,590
let's try to figure out our
our option switching thing here

462
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600

 

463
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,750

or multiple choice chooser i should say

464
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760

 

465
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,069

let's see so if we were to have

466
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
let's see so if we were to have
 

467
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,470
let's see so if we were to have
buttons i kind of want them set out like

468
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
buttons i kind of want them set out like
 

469
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,389
buttons i kind of want them set out like
this i think

470
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
this i think
 

471
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,990
this i think
if we were to press this one

472
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000

 

473
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,590

and this is how we'll know if we get the

474
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
and this is how we'll know if we get the
 

475
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,990
and this is how we'll know if we get the
right answer if the one we choose

476
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
right answer if the one we choose
 

477
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,030
right answer if the one we choose
sends power to this wire here then we

478
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
sends power to this wire here then we
 

479
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,990
sends power to this wire here then we
got the correct answer

480
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000

 

481
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,389

but we need to be careful not to cause

482
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
but we need to be careful not to cause
 

483
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,870
but we need to be careful not to cause
our wires to interfere

484
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
our wires to interfere
 

485
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,350
our wires to interfere
it's the main challenge

486
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360

 

487
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,190

let's see what's a better way of doing

488
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
let's see what's a better way of doing
 

489
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,509
let's see what's a better way of doing
this

490
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519

 

491
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,550

we'll make these ones go up a level

492
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
we'll make these ones go up a level
 

493
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,230
we'll make these ones go up a level
then we'll cut the wires with the block

494
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
then we'll cut the wires with the block
 

495
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,470
then we'll cut the wires with the block
i suppose and then we'll have our panel

496
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480

 

497
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,069

and these wires will come out further

498
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079

 

499
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,470

so now they all should work i think

500
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480

 

501
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,230

so the correct answer would be c in this

502
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
so the correct answer would be c in this
 

503
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,550
so the correct answer would be c in this
case and you can see it lights up the

504
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
case and you can see it lights up the
 

505
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,829
case and you can see it lights up the
wire on the other side

506
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
wire on the other side
 

507
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,790
wire on the other side
and it's the only one that does so that

508
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
and it's the only one that does so that
 

509
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,470
and it's the only one that does so that
is how we can do it

510
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480

 

511
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,389

so that's one thing figured out we can

512
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
so that's one thing figured out we can
 

513
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,949
so that's one thing figured out we can
make a our chooser like that

514
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959

 

515
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,470

i guess selector was the word i was

516
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
i guess selector was the word i was
 

517
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,150
i guess selector was the word i was
looking for not chooser

518
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
looking for not chooser
 

519
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,190
looking for not chooser
so this is our option selector panel

520
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
so this is our option selector panel
 

521
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,150
so this is our option selector panel
here

522
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
here
 

523
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,550
here
i've added a few things here i'll show

524
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
i've added a few things here i'll show
 

525
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,750
i've added a few things here i'll show
you

526
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
you
 

527
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,990
you
uh first of all i was playing around

528
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
uh first of all i was playing around
 

529
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,910
uh first of all i was playing around
with the wiring

530
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
with the wiring
 

531
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,389
with the wiring
how i'll do it because i have some

532
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
how i'll do it because i have some
 

533
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,750
how i'll do it because i have some
pistons here that'll be

534
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
pistons here that'll be
 

535
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,949
pistons here that'll be
operating and i don't want to hear them

536
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
operating and i don't want to hear them
 

537
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,430
operating and i don't want to hear them
operating when i'm you know making my

538
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
operating when i'm you know making my
 

539
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,590
operating when i'm you know making my
choices

540
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
choices
 

541
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,550
choices
so i need our panel here to be at least

542
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
so i need our panel here to be at least
 

543
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,629
so i need our panel here to be at least
16 blocks away from these pistons so

544
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
16 blocks away from these pistons so
 

545
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,470
16 blocks away from these pistons so
that they won't make any noise

546
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
that they won't make any noise
 

547
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,310
that they won't make any noise
so we'll run our wire 16 blocks and i'm

548
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
so we'll run our wire 16 blocks and i'm
 

549
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,949
so we'll run our wire 16 blocks and i'm
just

550
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
just
 

551
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,670
just
i was just trying to find a way to

552
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
i was just trying to find a way to
 

553
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,350
i was just trying to find a way to
neatly uh

554
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
neatly uh
 

555
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,230
neatly uh
separate our four individual wires here

556
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
separate our four individual wires here
 

557
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,509
separate our four individual wires here
and then rejoin them

558
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
and then rejoin them
 

559
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,069
and then rejoin them
over here and this is what i came up

560
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
over here and this is what i came up
 

561
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,990
over here and this is what i came up
with i got wire

562
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
with i got wire
 

563
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,110
with i got wire
then a torch for

564
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
then a torch for
 

565
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,150
then a torch for
one side and then repeater and regular

566
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
one side and then repeater and regular
 

567
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,509
one side and then repeater and regular
wire

568
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
wire
 

569
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,230
wire
and when you cover up

570
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240

 

571
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,230

these wires it cuts the wires and they

572
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
these wires it cuts the wires and they
 

573
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,949
these wires it cuts the wires and they
stay separate so you notice all these

574
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
stay separate so you notice all these
 

575
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,710
stay separate so you notice all these
went off now they're all

576
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
went off now they're all
 

577
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,870
went off now they're all
they're all separate so

578
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
they're all separate so
 

579
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,790
they're all separate so
that's how i plan on running them a long

580
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
that's how i plan on running them a long
 

581
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,389
that's how i plan on running them a long
distance without them interfering

582
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399

 

583
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,910

the other thing i realized though is i

584
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
the other thing i realized though is i
 

585
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,910
the other thing i realized though is i
need another wire here because

586
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920

 

587
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,310

right now all we can detect is if we get

588
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
right now all we can detect is if we get
 

589
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,269
right now all we can detect is if we get
the right answer

590
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
the right answer
 

591
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,949
the right answer
but we need some way of detecting if we

592
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
but we need some way of detecting if we
 

593
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,710
but we need some way of detecting if we
got the wrong answer as well

594
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
got the wrong answer as well
 

595
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,670
got the wrong answer as well
so we'll have another wire underneath

596
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
so we'll have another wire underneath
 

597
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,870
so we'll have another wire underneath
our panel

598
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880

 

599
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,670

hidden and that will tell us if we've

600
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
hidden and that will tell us if we've
 

601
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,350
hidden and that will tell us if we've
made a choice so it could be the right

602
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
made a choice so it could be the right
 

603
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,710
made a choice so it could be the right
choice could be the wrong choice but we

604
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
choice could be the wrong choice but we
 

605
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,870
choice could be the wrong choice but we
need to know

606
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
need to know
 

607
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,990
need to know
if the player has pushed a button

608
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
if the player has pushed a button
 

609
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,750
if the player has pushed a button
so that's how we'll figure that out and

610
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
so that's how we'll figure that out and
 

611
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,350
so that's how we'll figure that out and
then we'll have

612
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
then we'll have
 

613
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,110
then we'll have
this wire here tells us if they made the

614
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
this wire here tells us if they made the
 

615
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,710
this wire here tells us if they made the
right choice

616
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
right choice
 

617
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,470
right choice
and we'll have to do something fancy

618
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
and we'll have to do something fancy
 

619
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,310
and we'll have to do something fancy
with an and gate

620
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
with an and gate
 

621
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,670
with an and gate
and we'll get to that later this is what

622
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
and we'll get to that later this is what
 

623
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,189
and we'll get to that later this is what
else i've been working on

624
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199

 

625
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,870

this is uh my programmable

626
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
this is uh my programmable
 

627
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,710
this is uh my programmable
memory array i guess

628
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
memory array i guess
 

629
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,910
memory array i guess
glass blocks are the wrong answer

630
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
glass blocks are the wrong answer
 

631
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,150
glass blocks are the wrong answer
cobblestone is the right answer we got

632
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
cobblestone is the right answer we got
 

633
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,870
cobblestone is the right answer we got
four sets of four pistons controlling

634
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
four sets of four pistons controlling
 

635
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,310
four sets of four pistons controlling
everything

636
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
everything
 

637
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,590
everything
and this is a five

638
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
and this is a five
 

639
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,790
and this is a five
by uh well five

640
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
by uh well five
 

641
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,990
by uh well five
five one block in between one of them

642
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
five one block in between one of them
 

643
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,509
five one block in between one of them
has to be

644
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
has to be
 

645
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,350
has to be
an air space so in total we have 11

646
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
an air space so in total we have 11
 

647
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,550
an air space so in total we have 11
rows here for our planned 11

648
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
rows here for our planned 11
 

649
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,509
rows here for our planned 11
questions so it worked out perfect and

650
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
questions so it worked out perfect and
 

651
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,069
questions so it worked out perfect and
in the

652
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
in the
 

653
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,310
in the
between all this is our our

654
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
between all this is our our
 

655
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,110
between all this is our our
you got the question right wire here so

656
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
you got the question right wire here so
 

657
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,629
you got the question right wire here so
we can sneak that in

658
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
we can sneak that in
 

659
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,350
we can sneak that in
in the middle there which is cool and

660
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
in the middle there which is cool and
 

661
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,389
in the middle there which is cool and
these

662
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
these
 

663
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,949
these
four pistons we'll just have a wire over

664
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
four pistons we'll just have a wire over
 

665
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,590
four pistons we'll just have a wire over
top

666
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600

 

667
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,949

and we'll need to connect them all

668
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
and we'll need to connect them all
 

669
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,269
and we'll need to connect them all
together so the way

670
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
together so the way
 

671
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,870
together so the way
this will work we'll need to uh

672
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
this will work we'll need to uh
 

673
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,629
this will work we'll need to uh
so we have the air space here so we

674
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
so we have the air space here so we
 

675
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,990
so we have the air space here so we
would have to activate this

676
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
would have to activate this
 

677
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,110
would have to activate this
one

678
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120

 

679
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,069

then this one would go up and this one

680
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
then this one would go up and this one
 

681
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,629
then this one would go up and this one
go right

682
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
go right
 

683
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,629
go right
and then this one would go down

684
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
and then this one would go down
 

685
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,509
and then this one would go down
and by doing those four switches we will

686
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
and by doing those four switches we will
 

687
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,550
and by doing those four switches we will
iterate through

688
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
iterate through
 

689
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,910
iterate through
one of the questions so we'll make our

690
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
one of the questions so we'll make our
 

691
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,189
one of the questions so we'll make our
choice

692
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
choice
 

693
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,550
choice
for the question we either get it right

694
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
for the question we either get it right
 

695
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,590
for the question we either get it right
or wrong

696
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
or wrong
 

697
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,030
or wrong
we'll figure that out later but then

698
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
we'll figure that out later but then
 

699
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,269
we'll figure that out later but then
we need our next question so that's what

700
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
we need our next question so that's what
 

701
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,030
we need our next question so that's what
this takes care of it switches to our

702
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
this takes care of it switches to our
 

703
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,310
this takes care of it switches to our
next question

704
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
next question
 

705
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,230
next question
and when it gets the airspace that means

706
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
and when it gets the airspace that means
 

707
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,069
and when it gets the airspace that means
you're done

708
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
you're done
 

709
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,670
you're done
type thing so that's what i got figured

710
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
type thing so that's what i got figured
 

711
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,069
type thing so that's what i got figured
out so

712
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
out so
 

713
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,350
out so
far

714
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360

 

715
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,470

this is why we're planning it before we

716
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
this is why we're planning it before we
 

717
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,230
this is why we're planning it before we
actually build it guys because i

718
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
actually build it guys because i
 

719
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,590
actually build it guys because i
found out a mistake i made here uh first

720
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
found out a mistake i made here uh first
 

721
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,230
found out a mistake i made here uh first
of all i have this wired now this button

722
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
of all i have this wired now this button
 

723
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,350
of all i have this wired now this button
goes

724
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
goes
 

725
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,870
goes
first of all to these lower ones

726
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
first of all to these lower ones
 

727
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,670
first of all to these lower ones
then there is a two torch delay here

728
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
then there is a two torch delay here
 

729
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,790
then there is a two torch delay here
goes to this

730
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
goes to this
 

731
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,990
goes to this
set of pistons

732
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000

 

733
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,629

the wire runs up the back up the stairs

734
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
the wire runs up the back up the stairs
 

735
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,670
the wire runs up the back up the stairs
there

736
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
there
 

737
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,790
there
spiral staircase and it

738
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
spiral staircase and it
 

739
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,110
spiral staircase and it
activates uh its top right set

740
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
activates uh its top right set
 

741
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,550
activates uh its top right set
and then another two

742
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
and then another two
 

743
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,870
and then another two
torch delay here goes to this set here

744
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
torch delay here goes to this set here
 

745
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,189
torch delay here goes to this set here
so it does a full loop

746
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
so it does a full loop
 

747
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,590
so it does a full loop
uh but what i realized now is that i

748
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
uh but what i realized now is that i
 

749
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,230
uh but what i realized now is that i
actually need

750
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
actually need
 

751
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,829
actually need
three air spaces and one of them solid

752
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
three air spaces and one of them solid
 

753
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,350
three air spaces and one of them solid
in the corners so we don't have 11

754
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
in the corners so we don't have 11
 

755
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,189
in the corners so we don't have 11
spots here

756
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199

 

757
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,470

we only have one

758
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
we only have one
 

759
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,509
we only have one
no one two three four five six

760
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
no one two three four five six
 

761
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,829
no one two three four five six
seven eight nine it's only nine

762
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
seven eight nine it's only nine
 

763
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,150
seven eight nine it's only nine
questions

764
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
questions
 

765
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,189
questions
of info it's only information for nine

766
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
of info it's only information for nine
 

767
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,630
of info it's only information for nine
questions there

768
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
questions there
 

769
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,230
questions there
so that won't work we either need to

770
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
so that won't work we either need to
 

771
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,549
so that won't work we either need to
expand it or cut down our questions

772
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559

 

773
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,470

but this is what it does

774
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480

 

775
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,909

apparently nothing

776
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919

 

777
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,669

why isn't that one firing i'm not giving

778
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
why isn't that one firing i'm not giving
 

779
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,150
why isn't that one firing i'm not giving
enough time i guess

780
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
enough time i guess
 

781
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,630
enough time i guess
because the pistons are still extended

782
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
because the pistons are still extended
 

783
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,990
because the pistons are still extended
when those ones activate

784
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
when those ones activate
 

785
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,669
when those ones activate
so let's try setting them to

786
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
so let's try setting them to
 

787
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,909
so let's try setting them to
four

788
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919

 

789
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,590

and that should do the trick i think i

790
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
and that should do the trick i think i
 

791
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,590
and that should do the trick i think i
hope

792
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
hope
 

793
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,630
hope
maybe three is what we need

794
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640

 

795
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,990

there we go

796
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
there we go
 

797
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,830
there we go
this is a pretty common way of people

798
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
this is a pretty common way of people
 

799
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,110
this is a pretty common way of people
doing memory now

800
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
doing memory now
 

801
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,310
doing memory now
if you saw that grand piano video that's

802
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
if you saw that grand piano video that's
 

803
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,830
if you saw that grand piano video that's
that's how they did it it's cool because

804
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
that's how they did it it's cool because
 

805
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,909
that's how they did it it's cool because
in the past you didn't

806
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
in the past you didn't
 

807
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,430
in the past you didn't
have to set up these huge giant

808
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
have to set up these huge giant
 

809
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,510
have to set up these huge giant
redstone tower things just to hold

810
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
redstone tower things just to hold
 

811
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,750
redstone tower things just to hold
a few bits of information and now as

812
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
a few bits of information and now as
 

813
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,350
a few bits of information and now as
pistons we can

814
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
pistons we can
 

815
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,510
pistons we can
store one bit of information in each

816
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
store one bit of information in each
 

817
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,870
store one bit of information in each
block

818
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
block
 

819
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:36,390
block
so it's much much more compact

820
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400

 

821
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,669

and a bit if you don't know it's like

822
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
and a bit if you don't know it's like
 

823
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,590
and a bit if you don't know it's like
a yes or a no or on or off it's

824
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
a yes or a no or on or off it's
 

825
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,990
a yes or a no or on or off it's
two states we can store

826
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000

 

827
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,669

so yeah it's iterating through them

828
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
so yeah it's iterating through them
 

829
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,750
so yeah it's iterating through them
so how would i have to adjust this if i

830
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
so how would i have to adjust this if i
 

831
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,870
so how would i have to adjust this if i
wanted 11 i would need

832
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
wanted 11 i would need
 

833
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,390
wanted 11 i would need
i guess i would just need to make this

834
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400
i guess i would just need to make this
 

835
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,390
i guess i would just need to make this
two wide instead of one wide

836
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
two wide instead of one wide
 

837
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,549
two wide instead of one wide
because that would add one extra block

838
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
because that would add one extra block
 

839
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,590
because that would add one extra block
there and one extra

840
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
there and one extra
 

841
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,390
there and one extra
block down there so in the final version

842
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
block down there so in the final version
 

843
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,590
block down there so in the final version
that's what i'll do i'll make

844
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
that's what i'll do i'll make
 

845
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,390
that's what i'll do i'll make
it five by two well five

846
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
it five by two well five
 

847
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,070
it five by two well five
how would it be five by four

848
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
how would it be five by four
 

849
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,230
how would it be five by four
would be the dimension of the spiraling

850
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
would be the dimension of the spiraling
 

851
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,430
would be the dimension of the spiraling
thing

852
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
thing
 

853
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,270
thing
yeah yeah i'm right i'm right here

854
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
yeah yeah i'm right i'm right here
 

855
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,390
yeah yeah i'm right i'm right here
okay this thing

856
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400

 

857
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,430

here is another important

858
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
here is another important
 

859
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,990
here is another important
problem address is another important

860
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
problem address is another important
 

861
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,590
problem address is another important
problem

862
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
problem
 

863
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,750
problem
uh we need a cheat prevention thing

864
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
uh we need a cheat prevention thing
 

865
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,110
uh we need a cheat prevention thing
because uh

866
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
because uh
 

867
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,510
because uh
we don't want a player pressing two

868
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520
we don't want a player pressing two
 

869
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,669
we don't want a player pressing two
buttons or all four buttons and

870
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
buttons or all four buttons and
 

871
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,190
buttons or all four buttons and
always getting the right answers so

872
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
always getting the right answers so
 

873
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,350
always getting the right answers so
that's what this is

874
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
that's what this is
 

875
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,870
that's what this is
what we'll do is we'll have our

876
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
what we'll do is we'll have our
 

877
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,669
what we'll do is we'll have our
wire here the one that says player push

878
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
wire here the one that says player push
 

879
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,669
wire here the one that says player push
to button

880
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
to button
 

881
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,789
to button
it'll go to an rs nor latch which again

882
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
it'll go to an rs nor latch which again
 

883
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,909
it'll go to an rs nor latch which again
just holds a memory state of

884
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
just holds a memory state of
 

885
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,350
just holds a memory state of
yes or no and

886
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360

 

887
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,909

it'll switch rs nor latch and it'll

888
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
it'll switch rs nor latch and it'll
 

889
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,430
it'll switch rs nor latch and it'll
cause these pistons

890
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
cause these pistons
 

891
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,870
cause these pistons
to retract like that

892
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
to retract like that
 

893
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,149
to retract like that
so you'll push your button

894
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159

 

895
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,350

power will go through this block here

896
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
power will go through this block here
 

897
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,110
power will go through this block here
through this cobblestone

898
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120

 

899
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,470

to this wire to your choice whatever

900
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480

 

901
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,430

and as that's going on this wire will

902
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
and as that's going on this wire will
 

903
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,270
and as that's going on this wire will
also be sending a signal at the same

904
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
also be sending a signal at the same
 

905
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,549
also be sending a signal at the same
time

906
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
time
 

907
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,789
time
and it'll be timed so that as soon as

908
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
and it'll be timed so that as soon as
 

909
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,750
and it'll be timed so that as soon as
your

910
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
your
 

911
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,870
your
one signal goes through here it'll

912
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
one signal goes through here it'll
 

913
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,270
one signal goes through here it'll
switch rs nor latch which acts much like

914
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
switch rs nor latch which acts much like
 

915
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,029
switch rs nor latch which acts much like
this lever here

916
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
this lever here
 

917
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,270
this lever here
and it'll cause these to go up and now

918
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
and it'll cause these to go up and now
 

919
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,110
and it'll cause these to go up and now
if you try to send a signal

920
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
if you try to send a signal
 

921
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,110
if you try to send a signal
again like if you try to press two

922
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
again like if you try to press two
 

923
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,270
again like if you try to press two
buttons

924
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
buttons
 

925
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,750
buttons
the blocks not there the power can't go

926
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
the blocks not there the power can't go
 

927
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,430
the blocks not there the power can't go
through so you can't make a second

928
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
through so you can't make a second
 

929
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,310
through so you can't make a second
choice

930
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320

 

931
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,470

and then when the final

932
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
and then when the final
 

933
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,029
and then when the final
when all the processing is done for the

934
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
when all the processing is done for the
 

935
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,270
when all the processing is done for the
button pressing at the end

936
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
button pressing at the end
 

937
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,830
button pressing at the end
it will reset the rs latch and this will

938
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
it will reset the rs latch and this will
 

939
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,549
it will reset the rs latch and this will
come down

940
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
come down
 

941
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,750
come down
ready for our next question

942
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760
ready for our next question
 

943

repeater bug here it looks like
 

951
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,990
repeater bug here it looks like
possibly no

952
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000

 

953
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,950

959
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,270

this is an example of an rs nor latch

960
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
this is an example of an rs nor latch
 

961
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,549
this is an example of an rs nor latch
just in case you're wondering

962

just in case you're wondering
 

963
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,909
just in case you're wondering
again it keeps a yes or no state on or

964
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
again it keeps a yes or no state on or
 

965
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,310
again it keeps a yes or no state on or
off

966
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
off
 

967
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,070
off
that type of thing uh i added

968
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
that type of thing uh i added
 

969
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,750
that type of thing uh i added
i added these buttons on so we can

970
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
i added these buttons on so we can
 

971
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,190
i added these buttons on so we can
switch the state

972
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
switch the state
 

973
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,990
switch the state
so press that you see the power goes

974
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
so press that you see the power goes
 

975
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,350
so press that you see the power goes
there if i press this one

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,149
there if i press this one
it goes over here if i press this one

978
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
it goes over here if i press this one
 

979
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,270
it goes over here if i press this one
several times

980
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
several times
 

981
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,710
several times
it still stays over here and same with

982
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
it still stays over here and same with
 

983
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,549
it still stays over here and same with
this one

984
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
this one
 

985
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,710
this one
so let's stick up a door just to help

986
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
so let's stick up a door just to help
 

987
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,990
so let's stick up a door just to help
you visualize

988
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
you visualize
 

989
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,029
you visualize
how this works

990
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
how this works
 

991
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,430
how this works
our door doesn't want to cooperate there

992
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,440
our door doesn't want to cooperate there
 

993
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,789
our door doesn't want to cooperate there
we go

994
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
we go
 

995
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,149
we go
so this is the yes the door is open

996
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
so this is the yes the door is open
 

997
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:34,870
so this is the yes the door is open
state

998
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
state
 

999
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,149
state
when the power is over there

1000
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
when the power is over there
 

1001
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,029
when the power is over there
and when we hit this one it's the no the

1002
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
and when we hit this one it's the no the
 

1003
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,750
and when we hit this one it's the no the
door is not

1004
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
door is not
 

1005
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,870
door is not
open state so

1006
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
open state so
 

1007
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,909
open state so
that's what that does a lot of people

1008
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:47,919
that's what that does a lot of people
 

1009
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,070
that's what that does a lot of people
don't understand how this difference

1010
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
don't understand how this difference
 

1011
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,310
don't understand how this difference
how this is different from uh lever

1012
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
how this is different from uh lever
 

1013
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,430
how this is different from uh lever
stumbling with my words now i'll

1014
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
stumbling with my words now i'll
 

1015
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:07,430
stumbling with my words now i'll
demonstrate this to you very simply

1016
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440

 

1017
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,549

oops two wires there we go

1018
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559

 

1019
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,190

yes the door is open state no the door

1020
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
yes the door is open state no the door
 

1021
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,870
yes the door is open state no the door
is not open state

1022
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
is not open state
 

1023
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,110
is not open state
this is how it differs there's no way of

1024
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
this is how it differs there's no way of
 

1025
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,470
this is how it differs there's no way of
switching this lever

1026
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
switching this lever
 

1027
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,510
switching this lever
using redstone if i send power to it

1028
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
using redstone if i send power to it
 

1029
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,390
using redstone if i send power to it
it's still in that state there's no way

1030
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
it's still in that state there's no way
 

1031
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,710
it's still in that state there's no way
of

1032
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720
of
 

1033
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,029
of
changing it that's the only difference

1034
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
changing it that's the only difference
 

1035
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,789
changing it that's the only difference
that's why we use these

1036
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
that's why we use these
 

1037
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,470
that's why we use these
when instead of levers at certain times

1038
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
when instead of levers at certain times
 

1039
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,710
when instead of levers at certain times
okay pretty simple

1040
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720

 

1041
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,549

so i just figured out a very important

1042
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
so i just figured out a very important
 

1043
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,470
so i just figured out a very important
part of our trivia minigame

1044
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
part of our trivia minigame
 

1045
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,990
part of our trivia minigame
the logic yes the logic the thing that

1046
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
the logic yes the logic the thing that
 

1047
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,269
the logic yes the logic the thing that
determines if we

1048
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279
determines if we
 

1049
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,710
determines if we
won or lost a question

1050
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
won or lost a question
 

1051
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,310
won or lost a question
so here we have the you just correctly

1052
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
so here we have the you just correctly
 

1053
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,669
so here we have the you just correctly
wire now that alone you could use

1054
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
wire now that alone you could use
 

1055
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,669
wire now that alone you could use
like if you only needed to know if you

1056
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
like if you only needed to know if you
 

1057
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,870
like if you only needed to know if you
won then

1058
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
won then
 

1059
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,310
won then
this wire would suffice but i want to

1060
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
this wire would suffice but i want to
 

1061
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,430
this wire would suffice but i want to
know if we

1062
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
know if we
 

1063
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,630
know if we
won or lost

1064
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640

 

1065
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,350

and so we need to do some logic figuring

1066
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
and so we need to do some logic figuring
 

1067
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,310
and so we need to do some logic figuring
here

1068
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
here
 

1069
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,430
here
because if we lost that will just stay

1070
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
because if we lost that will just stay
 

1071
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,630
because if we lost that will just stay
off it won't switch

1072
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
off it won't switch
 

1073
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,510
off it won't switch
we don't know anything from it but this

1074
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
we don't know anything from it but this
 

1075
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,549
we don't know anything from it but this
one

1076
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
one
 

1077
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,750
one
always comes on it could mean you won or

1078
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
always comes on it could mean you won or
 

1079
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,990
always comes on it could mean you won or
you lost you don't know so that's where

1080
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
you lost you don't know so that's where
 

1081
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,830
you lost you don't know so that's where
i set up this example here to

1082
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
i set up this example here to
 

1083
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,909
i set up this example here to
demonstrate how to do the logic behind

1084
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:31,919
demonstrate how to do the logic behind
 

1085
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,029
demonstrate how to do the logic behind
it

1086
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039
it
 

1087
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,149
it
what we need to do is uh get those two

1088
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
what we need to do is uh get those two
 

1089
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,269
what we need to do is uh get those two
wires in sync

1090
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
wires in sync
 

1091
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,350
wires in sync
so that they have the exact same delay

1092
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
so that they have the exact same delay
 

1093
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,909
so that they have the exact same delay
when they reach a certain point here

1094
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
when they reach a certain point here
 

1095
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,070
when they reach a certain point here
which is uh demonstrated by this button

1096
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
which is uh demonstrated by this button
 

1097
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,350
which is uh demonstrated by this button
here when i press it

1098
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
here when i press it
 

1099
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,269
here when i press it
the two wires come on at the exact same

1100
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
the two wires come on at the exact same
 

1101
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,029
the two wires come on at the exact same
time they're both changed at the same

1102
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
time they're both changed at the same
 

1103
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,070
time they're both changed at the same
time

1104
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
time
 

1105
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,549
time
on the right represents the correct

1106
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
on the right represents the correct
 

1107
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,110
on the right represents the correct
button

1108
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
button
 

1109
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,390
button
was pressed wire so that one over here

1110
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
was pressed wire so that one over here
 

1111
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,830
was pressed wire so that one over here
on the left is the any button was

1112
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
on the left is the any button was
 

1113
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,830
on the left is the any button was
pressed wire

1114
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
pressed wire
 

1115
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,669
pressed wire
that button was pressed wire so that's

1116
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
that button was pressed wire so that's
 

1117
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,390
that button was pressed wire so that's
this one here

1118
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400

 

1119
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,750

so if they're in sync we got two and

1120
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
so if they're in sync we got two and
 

1121
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,870
so if they're in sync we got two and
gates here

1122
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
gates here
 

1123
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,190
gates here
this is the one that represents that you

1124
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
this is the one that represents that you
 

1125
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,710
this is the one that represents that you
won

1126
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
won
 

1127
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,549
won
and this is the one that shows that you

1128
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
and this is the one that shows that you
 

1129
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,789
and this is the one that shows that you
lost right now they're both off like

1130
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
lost right now they're both off like
 

1131
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,110
lost right now they're both off like
they should be

1132
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
they should be
 

1133
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,029
they should be
so if we press this button

1134
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039

 

1135
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,510

it says we won this flight didn't come

1136
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
it says we won this flight didn't come
 

1137
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,470
it says we won this flight didn't come
on only that one did

1138
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
on only that one did
 

1139
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,590
on only that one did
so how did that happen

1140
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
so how did that happen
 

1141
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,830
so how did that happen
the button was pressed wire came on that

1142
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
the button was pressed wire came on that
 

1143
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,950
the button was pressed wire came on that
one always comes on

1144
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
one always comes on
 

1145
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,470
one always comes on
and the correct button was pressed wire

1146
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
and the correct button was pressed wire
 

1147
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,149
and the correct button was pressed wire
came on so this one only comes on

1148
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
came on so this one only comes on
 

1149
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,590
came on so this one only comes on
if you guessed correctly so that makes

1150
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
if you guessed correctly so that makes
 

1151
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:47,990
if you guessed correctly so that makes
sense

1152
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000
sense
 

1153
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,029
sense
we won but now

1154
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
we won but now
 

1155
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,510
we won but now
if we were to lose how would we figure

1156
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
if we were to lose how would we figure
 

1157
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,830
if we were to lose how would we figure
that out

1158
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:54,840
that out
 

1159
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,830
that out
well i just put an inverter there

1160
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
well i just put an inverter there
 

1161
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,909
well i just put an inverter there
so that when the button is pressed that

1162
00:25:59,909 --> 00:25:59,919
so that when the button is pressed that
 

1163
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,710
so that when the button is pressed that
wires off

1164
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720

 

1165
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,470

the correct button was pressed wires off

1166
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,480
the correct button was pressed wires off
 

1167
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,190
the correct button was pressed wires off
and we have an inverted and gate here

1168
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
and we have an inverted and gate here
 

1169
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,029
and we have an inverted and gate here
and so what happens

1170
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039

 

1171
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,390

the you lost came on and

1172
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,400
the you lost came on and
 

1173
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,830
the you lost came on and
the one e1 stays off so it knows

1174
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
the one e1 stays off so it knows
 

1175
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,070
the one e1 stays off so it knows
it knows what happened he knows the

1176
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,080
it knows what happened he knows the
 

1177
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,590
it knows what happened he knows the
truth

1178
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
truth
 

1179
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,110
truth
and if we have these two separate

1180
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
and if we have these two separate
 

1181
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,070
and if we have these two separate
we can cause different things to happen

1182
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
we can cause different things to happen
 

1183
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,430
we can cause different things to happen
depending on whether we win

1184
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
depending on whether we win
 

1185
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,310
depending on whether we win
or lost so if we won you would probably

1186
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,320
or lost so if we won you would probably
 

1187
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,430
or lost so if we won you would probably
get a score

1188
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
get a score
 

1189
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,870
get a score
point added somehow you might have nope

1190
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:40,880
point added somehow you might have nope
 

1191
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,269
point added somehow you might have nope
a note block sequence play a jolly tune

1192
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
a note block sequence play a jolly tune
 

1193

ah okay so we have a lot of this figured

1218
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
ah okay so we have a lot of this figured
 

1219
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,190
ah okay so we have a lot of this figured
out now there's a few

1220
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
out now there's a few
 

1221
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,789
out now there's a few
minor things to figure out yet

1222
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799

1237
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,990

i didn't write up any examples for them

1238
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
i didn't write up any examples for them
 

1239
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,430
i didn't write up any examples for them
all that would

1240
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
all that would
 

1241
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,310
all that would
take a while and i was thinking of

1242
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
take a while and i was thinking of
 

1243
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,110
take a while and i was thinking of
having the

1244
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
having the
 

1245
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,070
having the
selector panel here so you would have

1246
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
selector panel here so you would have
 

1247
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,909
selector panel here so you would have
your choice

1248
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:51,919
your choice
 

1249
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,230
your choice
and you should be able to read all those

1250
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
and you should be able to read all those
 

1251
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,110
and you should be able to read all those
from here

1252
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
from here
 

1253
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,470
from here
it's probably a little bit blurry on

1254
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
it's probably a little bit blurry on
 

1255
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,950
it's probably a little bit blurry on
youtube but in the game

1256
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
youtube but in the game
 

1257
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,830
youtube but in the game
you can clearly read them pretty good at

1258
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
you can clearly read them pretty good at
 

1259
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,389
you can clearly read them pretty good at
this distance

1260
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
this distance
 

1261
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,909
this distance
tell me what you guys think is this a

1262
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
tell me what you guys think is this a
 

1263
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,269
tell me what you guys think is this a
good height for it is that a good

1264
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
good height for it is that a good
 

1265
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,590
good height for it is that a good
distance back for it

1266
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
distance back for it
 

1267
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,669
distance back for it
uh what should i use for the back

1268
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
uh what should i use for the back
 

1269
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,830
uh what should i use for the back
coloring should i use black wool

1270
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
coloring should i use black wool
 

1271
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,950
coloring should i use black wool
or should i use glowstone

1272
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
or should i use glowstone
 

1273
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,389
or should i use glowstone
let me know i want your input on this

1274
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
let me know i want your input on this
 

1275
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,710
let me know i want your input on this
since it's for you

1276
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720

 

1277
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,750

and yeah that's another thing

1278
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
and yeah that's another thing
 

1279
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,110
and yeah that's another thing
as we're going through the questions

1280
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
as we're going through the questions
 

1281
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,870
as we're going through the questions
here there's no way

1282
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
here there's no way
 

1283
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,870
here there's no way
you can possibly expect the player to

1284
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
you can possibly expect the player to
 

1285
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,789
you can possibly expect the player to
remember what question they're on

1286
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
remember what question they're on
 

1287
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,389
remember what question they're on
so i will have an indicator above

1288
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
so i will have an indicator above
 

1289
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,070
so i will have an indicator above
i think of using glowstone

1290
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
i think of using glowstone
 

1291
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,430
i think of using glowstone
so if you're on question one there'll be

1292
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
so if you're on question one there'll be
 

1293
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,789
so if you're on question one there'll be
a glowstone block above that sign

1294
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:46,799
a glowstone block above that sign
 

1295
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,230
a glowstone block above that sign
and as you press a button it would move

1296
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
and as you press a button it would move
 

1297
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,750
and as you press a button it would move
over one to the right

1298
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
over one to the right
 

1299
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,029
over one to the right
to question two and that's how you would

1300
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
to question two and that's how you would
 

1301
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,149
to question two and that's how you would
keep track

1302
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,159
keep track
 

1303
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,230
keep track
maybe i'll set up some pistons to see if

1304
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
maybe i'll set up some pistons to see if
 

1305
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,750
maybe i'll set up some pistons to see if
we can get that working

1306
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760

 

1307
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,669

here's a visualization to help you

1308
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
here's a visualization to help you
 

1309
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,190
here's a visualization to help you
understand what i meant

1310
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,200

 

1311
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,870

so there's the glowstone block above

1312
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
so there's the glowstone block above
 

1313
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,630
so there's the glowstone block above
question six

1314
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
question six
 

1315
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,950
question six
you would not be able to see anything to

1316
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
you would not be able to see anything to
 

1317
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,149
you would not be able to see anything to
the left of

1318
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
the left of
 

1319
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,070
the left of
here or above here

1320
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
here or above here
 

1321
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,350
here or above here
like you wouldn't be able to see the

1322
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
like you wouldn't be able to see the
 

1323
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,750
like you wouldn't be able to see the
second glowstone block

1324
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,760
second glowstone block
 

1325
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,909
second glowstone block
or anything right of here so it would

1326
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
or anything right of here so it would
 

1327
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,990
or anything right of here so it would
all be covered up nicely

1328
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
all be covered up nicely
 

1329
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,870
all be covered up nicely
neatly and i don't plan on using soil i

1330
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
neatly and i don't plan on using soil i
 

1331
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,269
neatly and i don't plan on using soil i
just

1332
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
just
 

1333
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,110
just
that's all i had on me i would probably

1334
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
that's all i had on me i would probably
 

1335
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,190
that's all i had on me i would probably
use something that matches

1336
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
use something that matches
 

1337
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,870
use something that matches
whatever we choose for the back there

1338
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,880
whatever we choose for the back there
 

1339
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,870
whatever we choose for the back there
just so it doesn't stand out

1340
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
just so it doesn't stand out
 

1341
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,789
just so it doesn't stand out
and the glowstone does that's the piston

1342
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
and the glowstone does that's the piston
 

1343
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,750
and the glowstone does that's the piston
loop going counterclockwise

1344
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
loop going counterclockwise
 

1345
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,230
loop going counterclockwise
let's see it going

1346
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240

 

1347
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:58,149

that's how it goes

1348
00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:58,159

 

1349
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,630

so every time you

1350
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:02,640
so every time you
 

1351
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,630
so every time you
answer a question you'll go through all

1352
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,640
answer a question you'll go through all
 

1353
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,750
answer a question you'll go through all
that

1354
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
that
 

1355
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,110
that
stuff over there and then it will also

1356
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,120
stuff over there and then it will also
 

1357
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,870
stuff over there and then it will also
send power to our our switcher here

1358
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
send power to our our switcher here
 

1359
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,230
send power to our our switcher here
and that'll tell us that we're on the

1360
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
and that'll tell us that we're on the
 

1361
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,149
and that'll tell us that we're on the
next question so

1362
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
next question so
 

1363
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,310
next question so
that memory unit will move forward to

1364
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
that memory unit will move forward to
 

1365
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,909
that memory unit will move forward to
the next question this thing will

1366
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:19,919
the next question this thing will
 

1367
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,389
the next question this thing will
show that we move to the next question

1368
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:22,399
show that we move to the next question
 

1369
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,789
show that we move to the next question
it'll all be in synced

1370
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,799
it'll all be in synced
 

1371
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,190
it'll all be in synced
uh so let me know what you think of that

1372
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,200
uh so let me know what you think of that
 

1373
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,190
uh so let me know what you think of that
there was one problem with this so i

1374
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
there was one problem with this so i
 

1375
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,669
there was one problem with this so i
have an

1376
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:29,679
have an
 

1377
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,669
have an
odd number of blocks in the loop there's

1378
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
odd number of blocks in the loop there's
 

1379
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,710
odd number of blocks in the loop there's
no way of avoiding that i think and

1380
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
no way of avoiding that i think and
 

1381
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,350
no way of avoiding that i think and
that's going to

1382
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
that's going to
 

1383
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,549
that's going to
cause a problem because

1384
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:40,559
cause a problem because
 

1385
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,029
cause a problem because
in one of these cases the glowstone's 11

1386
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
in one of these cases the glowstone's 11
 

1387
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,470
in one of these cases the glowstone's 11
blocks ahead and the other one

1388
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
blocks ahead and the other one
 

1389
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,510
blocks ahead and the other one
it's only 10 blocks ahead i think so or

1390
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
it's only 10 blocks ahead i think so or
 

1391
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,190
it's only 10 blocks ahead i think so or
12 blocks ahead

1392
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
12 blocks ahead
 

1393
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,870
12 blocks ahead
i don't know it's off though and it's

1394
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:50,880
i don't know it's off though and it's
 

1395
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,310
i don't know it's off though and it's
going to be a problem

1396
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
going to be a problem
 

1397
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,470
going to be a problem
so i need to find a fix for that

1398
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480

 

1399
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,710

and finally the last thing we are going

1400
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
and finally the last thing we are going
 

1401
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,430
and finally the last thing we are going
to consider today is the score display

1402
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
to consider today is the score display
 

1403
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,269
to consider today is the score display
this is what i was thinking using

1404
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
this is what i was thinking using
 

1405
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,029
this is what i was thinking using
redstone torches

1406
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:07,039
redstone torches
 

1407
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,830
redstone torches
let me know what you think of this this

1408
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
let me know what you think of this this
 

1409
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,190
let me know what you think of this this
is how it works

1410
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
is how it works
 

1411
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,389
is how it works
got to all these

1412
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:14,399
got to all these
 

1413
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,430
got to all these
powered

1414
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440

 

1415
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,669

and then we're using the same glass and

1416
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,679
and then we're using the same glass and
 

1417
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,750
and then we're using the same glass and
solid block trick

1418
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
solid block trick
 

1419
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,750
solid block trick
and these cycle around using pistons

1420
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:25,760
and these cycle around using pistons
 

1421
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,110
and these cycle around using pistons
so let's see it work

1422
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120

 

1423
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,789

you got one point two points

1424
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799

 

1425
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,830

every time you send power to this thing

1426
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
every time you send power to this thing
 

1427
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:50,070
every time you send power to this thing
you get a point

1428
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,080

 

1429
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,269

the problem is uh we will be hearing

1430
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
the problem is uh we will be hearing
 

1431
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,870
the problem is uh we will be hearing
some of this piston noise

1432
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
some of this piston noise
 

1433
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,269
some of this piston noise
i don't think it's avoidable like

1434
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
i don't think it's avoidable like
 

1435
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,509
i don't think it's avoidable like
especially if we do this

1436
00:31:59,509 --> 00:31:59,519
especially if we do this
 

1437
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,750
especially if we do this
because that's not far away from us at

1438
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
because that's not far away from us at
 

1439
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,669
because that's not far away from us at
all

1440
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
all
 

1441
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,350
all
so there will be some piston noise

1442
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,360
so there will be some piston noise
 

1443
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,950
so there will be some piston noise
problem with this thing too is we need

1444
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
problem with this thing too is we need
 

1445
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,590
problem with this thing too is we need
to reset it

1446
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
to reset it
 

1447
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,710
to reset it
so now it starts going in reverse until

1448
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
so now it starts going in reverse until
 

1449
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,029
so now it starts going in reverse until
it

1450
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
it
 

1451
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,549
it
makes it all the way around and it

1452
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
makes it all the way around and it
 

1453
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,509
makes it all the way around and it
starts over

1454
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519

 

1455
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,029

but yeah that's the ideas

1456
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,039
but yeah that's the ideas
 

1457
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,230
but yeah that's the ideas
should be a fun build

1458
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240

 

1459
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,230
