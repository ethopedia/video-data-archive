00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,220
everything without torches now which is
really tough to do I almost do it too

164
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,230
really tough to do I almost do it too
 

165
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,440
really tough to do I almost do it too
much I think in it in a lot of ways it

166
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,450
much I think in it in a lot of ways it
 

167
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,920
much I think in it in a lot of ways it
it makes building tough so I probably

168
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:38,930
it makes building tough so I probably
 

169
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,330
it makes building tough so I probably
shouldn't do it all the time but for the

170
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:40,340
shouldn't do it all the time but for the
 

171
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,990
shouldn't do it all the time but for the
mancave

172
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,000
mancave
 

173
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,450
mancave
we're definitely doing it that way so I

174
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:43,460
we're definitely doing it that way so I
 

175
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,740
we're definitely doing it that way so I
was able to get rid of them all there's

176
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:44,750
was able to get rid of them all there's
 

177
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,830
was able to get rid of them all there's
of course lighting under these Pistons

178
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
of course lighting under these Pistons
 

179
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,860
of course lighting under these Pistons
and we have those every so often I was

180
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:50,870
and we have those every so often I was
 

181
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,440
and we have those every so often I was
kind of wondering maybe I should just I

182
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,450
kind of wondering maybe I should just I
 

183
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,460
kind of wondering maybe I should just I
don't really like how it looks when you

184
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,470
don't really like how it looks when you
 

185
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,530
don't really like how it looks when you
have just a random piston every so often

186
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:56,540
have just a random piston every so often
 

187
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,720
have just a random piston every so often
either it blends in pretty good but

188
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:58,730
either it blends in pretty good but
 

189
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,860
either it blends in pretty good but
maybe I don't know I thinking maybe just

190
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:02,870
maybe I don't know I thinking maybe just
 

191
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,370
maybe I don't know I thinking maybe just
doing the whole thing with pistons but

192
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:06,380
doing the whole thing with pistons but
 

193
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,710
doing the whole thing with pistons but
then I don't know I don't really like

194
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
then I don't know I don't really like
 

195
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,600
then I don't know I don't really like
the white sticking out as much as it

196
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,610
the white sticking out as much as it
 

197
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,280
the white sticking out as much as it
does but anyway so we got rid of the

198
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,290
does but anyway so we got rid of the
 

199
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,240
does but anyway so we got rid of the
torches down here to accomplish that I

200
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,250
torches down here to accomplish that I
 

201
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,440
torches down here to accomplish that I
had to pretty much line in the water

202
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,450
had to pretty much line in the water
 

203
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,340
had to pretty much line in the water

I lined the whole bottom like underneath

210
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,100
I lined the whole bottom like underneath
 

211
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,980
I lined the whole bottom like underneath
all the logs with glowstone here and

212
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:38,990
all the logs with glowstone here and
 

213
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,740
all the logs with glowstone here and
it's just barely enough to keep it above

214
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:41,750
it's just barely enough to keep it above
 

215
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,620
it's just barely enough to keep it above
spawning levels if we look at it block

216
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:44,630
spawning levels if we look at it block
 

217
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,250

like the BL over here goes down to seven

218
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,260
like the BL over here goes down to seven
 

219
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,650
like the BL over here goes down to seven
and a lot of places which seven will

220
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:53,660
and a lot of places which seven will
 

221
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,880

spawn mobs eight will not but it's 7m my

222
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:57,890
spawn mobs eight will not but it's 7m my
 

223

head so since the lighting is coming

224
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:00,229
head so since the lighting is coming
 

225
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,440
head so since the lighting is coming
from down low it's actually eight at the

226
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,450
from down low it's actually eight at the
 

227
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,390
from down low it's actually eight at the
ground here so it's okay that's good we

228
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:07,400
ground here so it's okay that's good we
 

229
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,909
ground here so it's okay that's good we
got wheat here again decided to put it

230
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
got wheat here again decided to put it
 

231
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,909
got wheat here again decided to put it
back and then if we go over here I

232
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:12,919
back and then if we go over here I
 

233
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,430
back and then if we go over here I
polish it up this section this now

234
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
polish it up this section this now
 

235
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,969
polish it up this section this now
connects to the river goes up to here we

236
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:18,979
connects to the river goes up to here we
 

237
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,650
connects to the river goes up to here we
got a lily pad across and then we'll

238
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:20,660
got a lily pad across and then we'll
 

239
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,530
got a lily pad across and then we'll
probably build something here eventually

240
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:22,540
probably build something here eventually
 

241
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,400
probably build something here eventually
but I just I tried my best to do

242
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,410
but I just I tried my best to do
 

243
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,130
but I just I tried my best to do
something it's really again tough to do

244
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,140
something it's really again tough to do
 

245
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,430
something it's really again tough to do
tough to make

246
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
tough to make
 

247
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,410
tough to make
nice here because if if we go right

248
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:35,420
nice here because if if we go right
 

249
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,990
nice here because if if we go right
through here there's not oops not a lot

250
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
through here there's not oops not a lot
 

251
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,290
through here there's not oops not a lot
of space to work and I don't want to get

252
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:41,300
of space to work and I don't want to get
 

253
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,040
of space to work and I don't want to get
rid of that stone so and right here this

254
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,050
rid of that stone so and right here this
 

255
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,960
rid of that stone so and right here this
is actually the stairs so I can't really

256
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:46,970
is actually the stairs so I can't really
 

257
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,050
is actually the stairs so I can't really
change that it's only one thick there

258
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,060
change that it's only one thick there
 

259
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,070
change that it's only one thick there
and we got wheat here some leaves and

260
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
and we got wheat here some leaves and
 

261
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,610
and we got wheat here some leaves and
just some stairs in a pattern there for

262
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:57,620
just some stairs in a pattern there for
 

263
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,400
just some stairs in a pattern there for
some decoration or for some detail I

264
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,410
some decoration or for some detail I
 

265
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,180
some decoration or for some detail I
should say I just for right now I got

266
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,190
should say I just for right now I got
 

267
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,550
should say I just for right now I got
wood it or planks at the back there and

268
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
wood it or planks at the back there and
 

269
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,590
wood it or planks at the back there and
now let's see another small change is

270
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:11,600
now let's see another small change is
 

271
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,210
now let's see another small change is
with the horse stalls here this entrance

272
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:13,220
with the horse stalls here this entrance
 

273
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,980
with the horse stalls here this entrance
wasn't finished like these two blocks

274
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:14,990
wasn't finished like these two blocks
 

275
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,800
wasn't finished like these two blocks
there was stone and gravel and that

276
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:17,810
there was stone and gravel and that
 

277
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,390
there was stone and gravel and that
showing it didn't look too good I just

278
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:19,400
showing it didn't look too good I just
 

279
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,910
showing it didn't look too good I just
added a little wood detail some leaves

280
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:21,920
added a little wood detail some leaves
 

281
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,370
added a little wood detail some leaves
and whatnot just to complete the

282
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:24,380
and whatnot just to complete the
 

283
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,550
and whatnot just to complete the
entrance here we still need to build the

284
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:27,560
entrance here we still need to build the
 

285
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,350
entrance here we still need to build the
elevator here to go up to the surface

286
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
elevator here to go up to the surface
 

287
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,570
elevator here to go up to the surface
with the horses

288
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:30,580
with the horses
 

289
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,950
with the horses
um and then that will be done another

290
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:35,960
um and then that will be done another
 

291
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,590
um and then that will be done another
thing I changed like I said lots of

292
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:38,600
thing I changed like I said lots of
 

293
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,690
thing I changed like I said lots of
small details in the comments a lot of

294
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:40,700
small details in the comments a lot of
 

295
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
small details in the comments a lot of
people suggested I put carpets over

296
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:42,710
people suggested I put carpets over
 

297
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,640
people suggested I put carpets over
these pumpkins green carpets because I

298
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:45,650
these pumpkins green carpets because I
 

299
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,590
these pumpkins green carpets because I
didn't liked how at certain angles you

300
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:47,600
didn't liked how at certain angles you
 

301
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,630
didn't liked how at certain angles you
could still actually see them like from

302
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:49,640
could still actually see them like from
 

303
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,230
could still actually see them like from
here and if it's orange your eyes focus

304
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,240
here and if it's orange your eyes focus
 

305
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,460
here and if it's orange your eyes focus
in on that point because it's a

306
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:54,470
in on that point because it's a
 

307
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,190
in on that point because it's a
different color but if it's green you

308
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,200
different color but if it's green you
 

309
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,230
different color but if it's green you
don't really notice it as much so it's a

310
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,240
don't really notice it as much so it's a
 

311
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,300
don't really notice it as much so it's a
good change and they still let the light

312
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,310
good change and they still let the light
 

313
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,720
good change and they still let the light
through not that you're likely to see

314
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:04,730
through not that you're likely to see
 

315
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,650
through not that you're likely to see
them anyway I think I've never actually

316
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:08,660
them anyway I think I've never actually
 

317
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,510
them anyway I think I've never actually
checked yeah so if you walk by this

318
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:10,520
checked yeah so if you walk by this
 

319
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,490
checked yeah so if you walk by this
you're not going to focus on that little

320
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:12,500
you're not going to focus on that little
 

321
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,530
you're not going to focus on that little
orange speck there I always wanted to

322
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:17,540
orange speck there I always wanted to
 

323
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,840
orange speck there I always wanted to
get rid of this egg station up here

324
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:19,850
get rid of this egg station up here
 

325
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,300
get rid of this egg station up here
because I don't know that it wasn't

326
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,310
because I don't know that it wasn't
 

327
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,920
because I don't know that it wasn't
really working the eggs were coming up

328
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:23,930
really working the eggs were coming up
 

329
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,950
really working the eggs were coming up
all over the floor and they still are

330
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
all over the floor and they still are
 

331
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,480
all over the floor and they still are
actually I haven't killed the chickens

332
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,490
actually I haven't killed the chickens
 

333
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,670
actually I haven't killed the chickens
yet but I wanted to put an ender pearl

334
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:30,680
yet but I wanted to put an ender pearl
 

335
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,520
yet but I wanted to put an ender pearl
station here and but uh finally I did I

336
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,530
station here and but uh finally I did I
 

337
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,959
station here and but uh finally I did I
did it I've been talking about that for

338
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:37,969
did it I've been talking about that for
 

339
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,750
did it I've been talking about that for
a long time so you step on the pressure

340
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:40,760
a long time so you step on the pressure
 

341
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,000
a long time so you step on the pressure
plate use the ender pearls let's just go

342
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,010
plate use the ender pearls let's just go
 

343
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,790
plate use the ender pearls let's just go
take a look at the wire and quickly

344
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
take a look at the wire and quickly
 

345
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,420
take a look at the wire and quickly
pretty simple

346
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,430
pretty simple
 

347
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,250
pretty simple
you got compared our next to the

348
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,260
you got compared our next to the
 

349
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,350
you got compared our next to the
pressure plates it's on subtraction and

350
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
pressure plates it's on subtraction and
 

351
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,990
pressure plates it's on subtraction and
it loops back around so it does the the

352
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
it loops back around so it does the the
 

353
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,670
it loops back around so it does the the
quick pulse sink and you're on the

354
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
quick pulse sink and you're on the
 

355
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,070
quick pulse sink and you're on the
pressure plate but it goes up to a

356
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
pressure plate but it goes up to a
 

357
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,170
pressure plate but it goes up to a
dispenser which shoots enter pearls

358
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,180
dispenser which shoots enter pearls
 

359
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,290
dispenser which shoots enter pearls
through the glowstone at you and there's

360
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,300
through the glowstone at you and there's
 

361
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,910
through the glowstone at you and there's
a hopper and a bunch of chests up here

362
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:04,920
a hopper and a bunch of chests up here
 

363
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,180
a hopper and a bunch of chests up here
to feed the ender pearls down ah did not

364
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,190
to feed the ender pearls down ah did not
 

365
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,270
to feed the ender pearls down ah did not
take long to do oh wait you got to make

366
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,280
take long to do oh wait you got to make
 

367
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,220
take long to do oh wait you got to make
sure though that you have blocks there

368
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,230
sure though that you have blocks there
 

369
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,280
sure though that you have blocks there
otherwise the ender pearls look for the

370
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,290
otherwise the ender pearls look for the
 

371
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,310
otherwise the ender pearls look for the
closest air and they'll go that way

372
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
closest air and they'll go that way
 

373
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,170
closest air and they'll go that way
instead of out that's right okay

374
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,180
instead of out that's right okay
 

375
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,490
instead of out that's right okay
don't waste okay yeah let's go look you

376
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:31,500
don't waste okay yeah let's go look you
 

377
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,900
don't waste okay yeah let's go look you
know what let's go kill those chickens

378
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:32,910
know what let's go kill those chickens
 

379
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,160
know what let's go kill those chickens
because I've been wanting here to them

380
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,170
because I've been wanting here to them
 

381
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,760
because I've been wanting here to them
for a long time and then we're gonna

382
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:37,770
for a long time and then we're gonna
 

383
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,530
for a long time and then we're gonna
grab a looting suit

384
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:40,540
grab a looting suit
 

385
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,600
grab a looting suit
hey you little monsters oh I've been

386
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,610
hey you little monsters oh I've been
 

387
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,290
hey you little monsters oh I've been
wanting to get rid of you for so long if

388
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,300
wanting to get rid of you for so long if
 

389
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,790
wanting to get rid of you for so long if
you didn't know this is the reason I got

390
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
you didn't know this is the reason I got
 

391
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,890
you didn't know this is the reason I got
eggs randomly appearing all over my base

392
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:50,900
eggs randomly appearing all over my base
 

393
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,470
eggs randomly appearing all over my base
because of these guys when they lay an

394
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:53,480
because of these guys when they lay an
 

395
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,800
because of these guys when they lay an
egg it like shoots out randomly and it

396
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:56,810
egg it like shoots out randomly and it
 

397
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,230
egg it like shoots out randomly and it
comes up through the ground the way I

398
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,240
comes up through the ground the way I
 

399
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,450
comes up through the ground the way I
had it set up when I stepped on the

400
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:01,460
had it set up when I stepped on the
 

401
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,980
had it set up when I stepped on the
pressure plate at that ender pearl

402
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:02,990
pressure plate at that ender pearl
 

403
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,280
pressure plate at that ender pearl
station would send a signal down this

404
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,290
station would send a signal down this
 

405
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,020
station would send a signal down this
wire to this piston would make a glass

406
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,030

box come up in the negs will go up to

408
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:13,520
box come up in the negs will go up to
 

409
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,260
box come up in the negs will go up to
the top but we're not going to use this

410
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,270
the top but we're not going to use this
 

411
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,550
the top but we're not going to use this
really because there's way better ways

412
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
really because there's way better ways
 

413
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,950
really because there's way better ways
to do in chicken farms now you can can

414
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:20,960
to do in chicken farms now you can can
 

415
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,590
to do in chicken farms now you can can
use hoppers and dispensers in lava and

416
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
use hoppers and dispensers in lava and
 

417
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
use hoppers and dispensers in lava and
get fully automated once these guys are

418
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:28,570
get fully automated once these guys are
 

419
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,860

00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:56,840
getting away you go a lot of them still
 

429
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,090
getting away you go a lot of them still
sounds like there's more in the ground

430
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:58,100
sounds like there's more in the ground
 

431
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,990
sounds like there's more in the ground
somewhere oh you know I think they ran

432
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
somewhere oh you know I think they ran
 

433
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,240
somewhere oh you know I think they ran
up here didn't they don't sting quieter

434
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,250

 

435
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,610

they're in the ground what

436
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:14,620

 

437
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:21,900

Wow spare no one

438
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:21,910

 

439
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:31,680

what look at them all there so many okay

440
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:31,690
what look at them all there so many okay
 

441
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,870
what look at them all there so many okay
don't mind the mass-murdering it's all

442
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
don't mind the mass-murdering it's all
 

443
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,990
don't mind the mass-murdering it's all
part of the game um cool I'll reclaim

444
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,000
part of the game um cool I'll reclaim
 

445

this redstone stuff later let's set up

446
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,310
this redstone stuff later let's set up
 

447
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,420
this redstone stuff later let's set up
at yen we can get up through here I

448
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,430
at yen we can get up through here I
 

449
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,930
at yen we can get up through here I
think this is Wilson if I remember right

450
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:49,940
think this is Wilson if I remember right
 

451
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,790
think this is Wilson if I remember right
yeah

452
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
yeah
 

453
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,320
yeah
Wilson's over here what what else did we

454
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,330
Wilson's over here what what else did we
 

455
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,340
Wilson's over here what what else did we
do

456
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,350
do
 

457
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,710
do
I added in this piece of redstone

458
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
I added in this piece of redstone
 

459
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,540
I added in this piece of redstone
redstone ore so when you walk on it or

460
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:01,550
redstone ore so when you walk on it or
 

461
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,929
redstone ore so when you walk on it or
clicked it tada

462
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:04,939
clicked it tada
 

463
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,929
clicked it tada
and now I have a maintenance access to

464
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:07,939
and now I have a maintenance access to
 

465
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,420
and now I have a maintenance access to
the arrow dispenser from the creeper

466
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:10,430
the arrow dispenser from the creeper
 

467
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,519
the arrow dispenser from the creeper
eyes and also I can get to the portal

468
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:12,529
eyes and also I can get to the portal
 

469
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,769
eyes and also I can get to the portal
here which I'll probably try to fix one

470
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:14,779
here which I'll probably try to fix one
 

471
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,090
here which I'll probably try to fix one
day I didn't do that yet

472
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,100

 

473
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,710

then after a random amount of time that

474
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
then after a random amount of time that
 

475
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,579
then after a random amount of time that
closes again it's just that let's try to

476
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:24,589
closes again it's just that let's try to
 

477
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,160
closes again it's just that let's try to
take a look at the wiring it's going to

478
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,170
take a look at the wiring it's going to
 

479
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:34,480
take a look at the wiring it's going to
be tough it said it's a tea bud there's

480
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,490

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:54,360
waterfalls trees that you can look down
 

691
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,090
waterfalls trees that you can look down
from the left of the path here and and

692
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,100
from the left of the path here and and
 

693
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,180
from the left of the path here and and
and see like a little lake and and

694
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,190
and see like a little lake and and
 

695
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,150
and see like a little lake and and
something that looks nice and then maybe

696
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
something that looks nice and then maybe
 

697
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,540
something that looks nice and then maybe
set up a fishing shack and I'll do my

698
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:05,550
set up a fishing shack and I'll do my
 

699
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,320
set up a fishing shack and I'll do my
fishing there may be an automatic

700
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,330
fishing there may be an automatic
 

701
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,040
fishing there may be an automatic
fishing thing if that still works but

702
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,050
fishing thing if that still works but
 

703
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,600
fishing thing if that still works but
we'll get to that one when it comes out

704
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,610
we'll get to that one when it comes out
 

705
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,290
we'll get to that one when it comes out
which like I said is probably today when

706
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:18,300
which like I said is probably today when
 

707
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,550
which like I said is probably today when
you're watching this is probably out

708
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:19,560
you're watching this is probably out
 

709
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,870
you're watching this is probably out
already there's also going to be I don't

710
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:23,880
already there's also going to be I don't
 

711
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,130
already there's also going to be I don't
know there's different types of fishing

712
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,140
know there's different types of fishing
 

713
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,500
know there's different types of fishing
rods but I think there is

714
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:27,510
rods but I think there is
 

715
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,050
rods but I think there is
different Chapman so you can get and

716
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,060
different Chapman so you can get and
 

717
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,220
different Chapman so you can get and
depending on what you put on the rod

718
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,230
depending on what you put on the rod
 

719
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,960
depending on what you put on the rod
you'll get different luck with catching

720
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:32,970
you'll get different luck with catching
 

721
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,700
you'll get different luck with catching
different things I think is the way it's

722
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:34,710
different things I think is the way it's
 

723
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,840
different things I think is the way it's
going to work so yeah there's a bit

724
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:38,850
going to work so yeah there's a bit
 

725
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,120
going to work so yeah there's a bit
involved with fishing so cool to have a

726
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,130
involved with fishing so cool to have a
 

727
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,410
involved with fishing so cool to have a
little spot for it actually with

728
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:45,420
little spot for it actually with
 

729
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,080
little spot for it actually with
waterfalls I'm wondering let's let's

730
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,090
waterfalls I'm wondering let's let's
 

731
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,030
waterfalls I'm wondering let's let's
check this out is there some way we can

732
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,040
check this out is there some way we can
 

733
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,000
check this out is there some way we can
make this River here go all the way to

734
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,010
make this River here go all the way to
 

735
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,510
make this River here go all the way to
there and turn into a waterfall or

736
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:56,520
there and turn into a waterfall or
 

737
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,750
there and turn into a waterfall or
something what level is this okay so

738
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
something what level is this okay so
 

739
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,010
something what level is this okay so
it's it's level with this block here mm

740
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,020
it's it's level with this block here mm
 

741
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,160
it's it's level with this block here mm
if it was one or two blocks higher I

742
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,170
if it was one or two blocks higher I
 

743
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,720
if it was one or two blocks higher I
think we could make it go over the path

744
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,730
think we could make it go over the path
 

745
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,130
think we could make it go over the path
here but hmm we could make a go under

746
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,140
here but hmm we could make a go under
 

747
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,760
here but hmm we could make a go under
the path like maybe maybe have some

748
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:16,770
the path like maybe maybe have some
 

749
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,150
the path like maybe maybe have some
water to the left here it may go under

750
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,160
water to the left here it may go under
 

751
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,840
water to the left here it may go under
and then go go all the way here it would

752
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:23,850
and then go go all the way here it would
 

753
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,460
and then go go all the way here it would
have to be a little lower than this path

754
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,470
have to be a little lower than this path
 

755
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,210
have to be a little lower than this path
so maybe we'll go down a few blocks and

756
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:28,220
so maybe we'll go down a few blocks and
 

757
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,220
so maybe we'll go down a few blocks and
this will be like an upper view like a a

758
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,230
this will be like an upper view like a a
 

759
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,820
this will be like an upper view like a a
nice downward view at at the lake in

760
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:34,830
nice downward view at at the lake in
 

761
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,850
nice downward view at at the lake in
that and then maybe have another proper

762
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:37,860
that and then maybe have another proper
 

763
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,030
that and then maybe have another proper
access path to it somewhere else but

764
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,040
access path to it somewhere else but
 

765
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,610
access path to it somewhere else but
yeah I want to build a fishing shack

766
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:43,620
yeah I want to build a fishing shack
 

767
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,150
yeah I want to build a fishing shack
here so today we'll try to do a little

768
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,160
here so today we'll try to do a little
 

769
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,560
here so today we'll try to do a little
terraforming with it I'm going to get

770
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:48,570
terraforming with it I'm going to get
 

771
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,010
terraforming with it I'm going to get
some TNT and we will begin choosing the

772
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,020
some TNT and we will begin choosing the
 

773
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,690
some TNT and we will begin choosing the
spot out so I'm feeling a little bit

774
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:56,700
spot out so I'm feeling a little bit
 

775
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,370
spot out so I'm feeling a little bit
lazy today I really shouldn't do this

776
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:58,380
lazy today I really shouldn't do this
 

777
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,920
lazy today I really shouldn't do this
but usually I'm pretty careful with TNT

778
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:00,930
but usually I'm pretty careful with TNT
 

779
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,620
but usually I'm pretty careful with TNT

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:45,549
port the portal room is going to be this
 

803
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,560
port the portal room is going to be this
way though pretty sure so I want to be

804
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:49,570
way though pretty sure so I want to be

upward or downward I keep saying upward
 

811
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,729
upward or downward I keep saying upward
downward view from here on the size and

812
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:05,739
downward view from here on the size and
 

813
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:10,680
downward view from here on the size and
the shape it is that's good the reason I

814
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:10,690
the shape it is that's good the reason I
 

815
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,749
the shape it is that's good the reason I
want to use TNT to is it makes it a

816
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:12,759
want to use TNT to is it makes it a
 

817
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,529
want to use TNT to is it makes it a
little more random if I was to chisel

818
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:16,539
little more random if I was to chisel
 

819
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:18,930
little more random if I was to chisel

got knocked back this way towards the
 

827
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:40,169
got knocked back this way towards the
explosion more this way and maybe shave

828
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:40,179
explosion more this way and maybe shave
 

829
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:45,810

833
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,299

okay take one more look I'm going to

834
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:57,309
okay take one more look I'm going to
 

835
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,660
okay take one more look I'm going to
work some off-camera here to see I got

836
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,670
work some off-camera here to see I got
 

837
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,430
work some off-camera here to see I got
to get rid of a bunch of land in the

838
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:02,440
to get rid of a bunch of land in the
 

839
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,100
to get rid of a bunch of land in the
front here it's blocking the view yeah

840
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,110
front here it's blocking the view yeah
 

841
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,580
front here it's blocking the view yeah
that's pretty good I like that so if we

842
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:11,590
that's pretty good I like that so if we
 

843
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,460
that's pretty good I like that so if we
get the river here we'll have some kind

844
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:14,470
get the river here we'll have some kind
 

845
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,850
get the river here we'll have some kind
of waterfall on this side to the left

846
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:16,860
of waterfall on this side to the left
 

847
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,420
of waterfall on this side to the left
and we'll have have that connect to some

848
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,430
and we'll have have that connect to some
 

849
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,880
and we'll have have that connect to some
kind of pond and then we might make

850
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:23,890
kind of pond and then we might make
 

851
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,490
kind of pond and then we might make
water like another river flow from the

852
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:26,500
water like another river flow from the
 

853
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,220
water like another river flow from the
pond downward somewhere is what I'm

854
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,230
pond downward somewhere is what I'm
 

855
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:44,730
pond downward somewhere is what I'm
thinking oh darn it did it again it

856
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:44,740
thinking oh darn it did it again it
 

857
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:57,830
thinking oh darn it did it again it
pulled me forward that is so weird

00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:13,320
I like that that's a nice view of
 

865
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,130
I like that that's a nice view of
whatever we build here nice and nice and

866
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,140
whatever we build here nice and nice and
 

867
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,560
whatever we build here nice and nice and
open feeling might want to get rid of

868
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:18,570
open feeling might want to get rid of
 

869
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,470
open feeling might want to get rid of
some of this too I'm liking this thing

up here too there's like another layer
 

873
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,029
up here too there's like another layer
from a old mine shaft or something let's

874
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
from a old mine shaft or something let's
 

875
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,789
from a old mine shaft or something let's
let's look at this for a sec we might

876
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:31,799
let's look at this for a sec we might
 

877
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,000
let's look at this for a sec we might
want to include this somehow oh look at

878
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,010
want to include this somehow oh look at

farm for the wheat farm I'm going to

882
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:51,630
farm for the wheat farm I'm going to
 

883
00:23:51,630 --> 00:24:00,860
farm for the wheat farm I'm going to
make this go back some more okay I'm

make this go back some more okay I'm
 

885
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,750
make this go back some more okay I'm
trying to think of how we should build

886
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:02,760
trying to think of how we should build
 

887
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,490
trying to think of how we should build
this like where should the fishing shack

888
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:04,500
this like where should the fishing shack
 

889
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,649
this like where should the fishing shack
be in that the waterfall is going to be

be in that the waterfall is going to be
 

891
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,010
be in that the waterfall is going to be
there I was thinking we could have a

892
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,020
there I was thinking we could have a
 

893
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,289
there I was thinking we could have a
path going down here and maybe we'll

894
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:12,299
path going down here and maybe we'll
 

895
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,210
path going down here and maybe we'll
make that go straight to the building

896
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,220
make that go straight to the building
 

897
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,480
make that go straight to the building
like have have the building partially

898
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,490
like have have the building partially
 

899
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,110
like have have the building partially
online and partially in water and give

900
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
online and partially in water and give
 

901
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,909
online and partially in water and give
it a dock or something that goes this

902
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:22,919
it a dock or something that goes this
 

903
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:29,539
it a dock or something that goes this
way a little bit yeah so this will be

904
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:29,549
way a little bit yeah so this will be
 

905
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,260
way a little bit yeah so this will be
water can we make this come further out

906
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,270
water can we make this come further out
 

907
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,019
water can we make this come further out
without hitting anything I'm so worried

that's perfect it'll look a lot better
 

921
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,790
that's perfect it'll look a lot better
when we get water and and grass down

922
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:03,800
when we get water and and grass down
 

923
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,650
when we get water and and grass down
here and smooth out all the rough edges

924
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:10,660

 

925
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,510

but anyway that's going to be about it

926
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
but anyway that's going to be about it
 

927
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,340
but anyway that's going to be about it
for this episode I think we got a good

928
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,350
for this episode I think we got a good
 

929
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,590
for this episode I think we got a good
start on this and we will continue it

930
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
start on this and we will continue it
 

931
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,810
start on this and we will continue it
next time and try to get most of it done

932
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:19,820
next time and try to get most of it done
 

933
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,080
next time and try to get most of it done
if we can as well assuming the snapshot

934
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,090
if we can as well assuming the snapshot
 

935
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,420
if we can as well assuming the snapshot
comes out we will probably check out

936
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:25,430
comes out we will probably check out
 

937
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,050
comes out we will probably check out
some changes with that to explore it a

938
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:29,060
some changes with that to explore it a
 

939
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,990
some changes with that to explore it a
bit I'm pretty sure terrain update is

940
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
bit I'm pretty sure terrain update is
 

941
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,170
bit I'm pretty sure terrain update is
not coming with a snapshot so that'll

942
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,180
not coming with a snapshot so that'll
 

943
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,750
not coming with a snapshot so that'll
come later but from what I hear there

944
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
come later but from what I hear there
 

945
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,820
come later but from what I hear there
have been lots of changes without that

946
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:39,830
have been lots of changes without that
 

947
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,410
have been lots of changes without that
even so that brings us to our comments

948
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:44,420
even so that brings us to our comments
 

949
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,090
even so that brings us to our comments
for today let's check out the first one

950
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:46,100
for today let's check out the first one
 

951
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,940
for today let's check out the first one
