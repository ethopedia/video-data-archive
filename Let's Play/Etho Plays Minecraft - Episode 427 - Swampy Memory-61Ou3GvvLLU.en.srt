looks pretty good like when you're
 

239
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,030
looks pretty good like when you're
actually in it like over here I wanted

240
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,040
actually in it like over here I wanted
 

241
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,020
actually in it like over here I wanted
it to feel cluttered and like lots of

242

this ground to me looks mushy I just did

248
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
this ground to me looks mushy I just did
 

249
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,890
this ground to me looks mushy I just did
like path blocks and I think that it's

250

like path blocks and I think that it's
 

251
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,400
like path blocks and I think that it's
like a mushy chaotic path we got going

abandoned mineshaft by the way so we

256
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,360
abandoned mineshaft by the way so we
 

257
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,030
abandoned mineshaft by the way so we
actually have a way of tying it into our

actually have a way of tying it into our
 

259
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,880
actually have a way of tying it into our
worlds like visually which i think is

260
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:54,890
worlds like visually which i think is
 

261
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,200

like some sideways logs and then put
 

291
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,249
like some sideways logs and then put
mushroom blocks around them to make them

292
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:40,259
mushroom blocks around them to make them
 

293
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,770
mushroom blocks around them to make them
look like they're decaying some of them

294
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:42,780
look like they're decaying some of them

310
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:09,629
happy with this one I probably should
 

311
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,909
happy with this one I probably should
have built it out of birch leaves though

312
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:10,919
have built it out of birch leaves though
 

313
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,529
have built it out of birch leaves though
because some of them some of the leaves

314
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:12,539
because some of them some of the leaves
 

315
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,480
because some of them some of the leaves
turned a bit yellow cuz apparently it's

316

a desert over here but overall I think

318
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,430
a desert over here but overall I think
 

319
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,730
a desert over here but overall I think
it's fine I want to add another tree on

320

the blaze farm we worked on that we
 

371
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:26,809
the blaze farm we worked on that we
worked on the nether hub design so we

372
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:26,819
worked on the nether hub design so we
 

373
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,510
worked on the nether hub design so we
got a few of these kind of crossed off

374
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:28,520
got a few of these kind of crossed off
 

375
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,800
got a few of these kind of crossed off
but the one that caught my attention was

episodes ago if I was the yes but we

384
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,180
episodes ago if I was the yes but we
 

385
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,960
episodes ago if I was the yes but we
worked out or we tried to figure out how

386
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:44,970
worked out or we tried to figure out how
 

387
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,860
worked out or we tried to figure out how
do it here played around with some ideas

388
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:48,870
do it here played around with some ideas
 

389
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,879
do it here played around with some ideas
I had a problem though where maybe I'll

390
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:52,889
I had a problem though where maybe I'll
 

391
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,199
I had a problem though where maybe I'll
just give you the quick reference by the

392
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:54,209
just give you the quick reference by the
 

393
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,740
just give you the quick reference by the
way so Simon Simon is a memory game we

394
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:57,750
way so Simon Simon is a memory game we
 

395
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,569
way so Simon Simon is a memory game we
were trying to build it in Minecraft

396
00:08:59,569 --> 00:08:59,579
were trying to build it in Minecraft
 

397
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,980
were trying to build it in Minecraft
here so you got four different colors

398
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:00,990
here so you got four different colors
 

399
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,800
here so you got four different colors
and you have to copy the sequence so it

400
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:03,810
and you have to copy the sequence so it
 

401
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,540
and you have to copy the sequence so it
randomly creates a sequence of like

402
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:05,550
randomly creates a sequence of like
 

403
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,860
randomly creates a sequence of like
maybe red red blue red blue red red blue

404
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:09,870
maybe red red blue red blue red red blue
 

405
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,079
maybe red red blue red blue red red blue
red yellow and every time it adds one on

406
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:12,089
red yellow and every time it adds one on
 

407
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,990
red yellow and every time it adds one on
to the sequence you gotta try copy it

408
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
to the sequence you gotta try copy it
 

409
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,090
to the sequence you gotta try copy it
and memorize the whole thing if you mess

410
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,100
and memorize the whole thing if you mess
 

411
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,840
and memorize the whole thing if you mess
up then you lose so we were trying to do

412
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:20,850
up then you lose so we were trying to do
 

413
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,509
up then you lose so we were trying to do
that in Minecraft here using droppers

414
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
that in Minecraft here using droppers
 

415
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,710
that in Minecraft here using droppers
and clay blocks to represent the colors

416
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
and clay blocks to represent the colors
 

417
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,420
and clay blocks to represent the colors
but I had a problem where no matter how

418
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:29,430
but I had a problem where no matter how
 

419
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,550
but I had a problem where no matter how
I power these droppers they always would

420
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,560
I power these droppers they always would
 

421
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,030
I power these droppers they always would
shoot it's like far further than I

422
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
shoot it's like far further than I
 

423
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,129
shoot it's like far further than I
wanted like if I powered this the

424
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:37,139
wanted like if I powered this the
 

425
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,490
wanted like if I powered this the
dropper which shoot maybe two down the

426
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:40,500
dropper which shoot maybe two down the
 

427
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,960
dropper which shoot maybe two down the
line instead of like the one right next

428
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:41,970
line instead of like the one right next
 

429
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,350
line instead of like the one right next
to it like I wanted you guys gave a good

430
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
to it like I wanted you guys gave a good
 

431
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,970
to it like I wanted you guys gave a good
suggestion though in the comments to

432
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:46,980
suggestion though in the comments to
 

433
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,889
suggestion though in the comments to
just put a hopper between them and I

434
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:48,899
just put a hopper between them and I
 

435
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,290
just put a hopper between them and I
tried playing around and creative that

436
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:51,300
tried playing around and creative that
 

437
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,470
tried playing around and creative that
fixed the problem so we're gonna make a

438
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
fixed the problem so we're gonna make a
 

439
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,960
fixed the problem so we're gonna make a
real attempt at building it today so

440
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:56,970
real attempt at building it today so
 

441
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,030
real attempt at building it today so
let's head back to that area we started

442
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
let's head back to that area we started
 

443
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,160
let's head back to that area we started
that I'll try to clean it up a bit more

444
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,170
that I'll try to clean it up a bit more
 

445
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,319
that I'll try to clean it up a bit more
and then we can get to building this

446
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:03,329
and then we can get to building this
 

447
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,540
and then we can get to building this
hopefully actually make some progress on

448
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:05,550
hopefully actually make some progress on
 

449
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,610
hopefully actually make some progress on
it

450
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,620

what we just did here is a rough very
 

457
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,030
what we just did here is a rough very
rough expansion onto the man cave if you

458
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
rough expansion onto the man cave if you
 

459
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,889
rough expansion onto the man cave if you
didn't know we've like filled every

460
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:54,899
didn't know we've like filled every
 

461
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,189
didn't know we've like filled every
every nook and cranny around here with

462

every nook and cranny around here with
 

463
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,650
every nook and cranny around here with
projects there's not a lot of space left

464
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:00,660
projects there's not a lot of space left
 

465
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,780
projects there's not a lot of space left
to add on like if we want to build

466
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:02,790
to add on like if we want to build
 

467
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,509
to add on like if we want to build
something new so we sort of have to do

like this so we got two doors we can put

474
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:14,519
like this so we got two doors we can put
 

475
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,249
like this so we got two doors we can put
something behind here eventually if we

476
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:16,259
something behind here eventually if we
 

477
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,949
something behind here eventually if we
want and I've started digging out a room

478

481
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,239
for our Simon game in here um and also I
didn't want like a just the hallway

482
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:26,249
didn't want like a just the hallway
 

483
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:27,530
didn't want like a just the hallway
though like we have this super long

484
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:27,540
though like we have this super long
 

485
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,249
though like we have this super long
hallway here which I don't really like

486
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:30,259
hallway here which I don't really like
 

487
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,530
hallway here which I don't really like
it feels it feels too long without any

488
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:33,540
it feels it feels too long without any
 

489
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,110
it feels it feels too long without any
breaks but we have like something built

490
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,120
breaks but we have like something built
 

491
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,910
breaks but we have like something built
here something over here so we can't

492
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
here something over here so we can't
 

493
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,999
here something over here so we can't
really do much about that but I didn't

494
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:41,009
really do much about that but I didn't
 

495
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,939
really do much about that but I didn't
want just another hallway over here so I

496
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:43,949
want just another hallway over here so I
 

497
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,740
want just another hallway over here so I
made it go down some stairs to make it

498
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:45,750
made it go down some stairs to make it
 

499
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,990
made it go down some stairs to make it
feel like it opens up a bit we're gonna

500
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
feel like it opens up a bit we're gonna
 

501
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
feel like it opens up a bit we're gonna
put some water here eventually like a

502
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,490
put some water here eventually like a
 

503
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,540
put some water here eventually like a
little pond and make make more of a room

504
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,550
little pond and make make more of a room
 

505
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,740
little pond and make make more of a room
than a hallway specifically but yeah

506
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:57,750
than a hallway specifically but yeah
 

507
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,069
than a hallway specifically but yeah
anyways and then eventually this can

508
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
anyways and then eventually this can
 

509
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,900
anyways and then eventually this can
connect to the underground village if we

510
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:02,910
connect to the underground village if we
 

511
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,379
connect to the underground village if we
keep going this way but anyways let's

512
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:06,389
keep going this way but anyways let's
 

513
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:09,019
keep going this way but anyways let's
get inside here we'll start working out

514
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,029
get inside here we'll start working out
 

515
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,410
get inside here we'll start working out
the interface to the Simon game what I

516
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:12,420
the interface to the Simon game what I
 

517
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,629
the interface to the Simon game what I
want to do with it's got a rough plan in

518
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
want to do with it's got a rough plan in
 

519
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,350
want to do with it's got a rough plan in
mind so this here is gonna be our

520
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:18,360
mind so this here is gonna be our
 

521
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,150
mind so this here is gonna be our
controls we'll have the four colors let

522
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,160
controls we'll have the four colors let
 

523
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,410
controls we'll have the four colors let
me try to remember what it is I think

524
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,420
me try to remember what it is I think
 

525
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,199
me try to remember what it is I think
it's red red blue yeah I kind of forgot

526
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:30,209
it's red red blue yeah I kind of forgot
 

527
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:37,160
it's red red blue yeah I kind of forgot
now these red blue blue over here I'm

528
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,170
now these red blue blue over here I'm
 

529
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,689
now these red blue blue over here I'm
not I'm not forgetting the colors I'm

530
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:38,699
not I'm not forgetting the colors I'm
 

531
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,100
not I'm not forgetting the colors I'm
forgetting what order they go I think

532
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,110
forgetting what order they go I think
 

533
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,259
forgetting what order they go I think
it's green here then and then yellow

534
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:42,269
it's green here then and then yellow
 

535
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,639
it's green here then and then yellow
below we'll try this I'll fix it after

536
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:46,649
below we'll try this I'll fix it after
 

537
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,679
below we'll try this I'll fix it after
if I got this wrong because I looked at

538
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:48,689
if I got this wrong because I looked at
 

539
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,189
if I got this wrong because I looked at
a picture of the Simon game like a real

540
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:51,199
a picture of the Simon game like a real
 

541
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:53,170
a picture of the Simon game like a real
real-life version of it

542
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,180
real-life version of it
 

543
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,670
real-life version of it
so yeah we'll step on the pressure

544
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:54,680
so yeah we'll step on the pressure
 

545
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,190
so yeah we'll step on the pressure
plates in the corners here to make our

546
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
plates in the corners here to make our
 

547
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,090
plates in the corners here to make our
choice what color we want to pick to do

548
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,100
choice what color we want to pick to do
 

549
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,310
choice what color we want to pick to do
the sequence and then in front of us

550
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:03,320
the sequence and then in front of us
 

551
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,040
the sequence and then in front of us
this is gonna be our screen like our our

552
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,050
this is gonna be our screen like our our
 

553
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,810
this is gonna be our screen like our our
visual feedback of what's going on

554
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:07,820
visual feedback of what's going on
 

555
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,870
visual feedback of what's going on
inside the game so I tried to set this

556
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
inside the game so I tried to set this
 

557
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,570
inside the game so I tried to set this
up in such a way that's not gonna block

558
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:13,580
up in such a way that's not gonna block
 

559
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,100
up in such a way that's not gonna block
what we're looking at here so you'll

560
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,110
what we're looking at here so you'll
 

561
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,060
what we're looking at here so you'll
notice the red blocks there that's like

562
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,070
notice the red blocks there that's like
 

563
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,370
notice the red blocks there that's like
the border of the game what I plan on

564
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:21,380
the border of the game what I plan on
 

565
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,430
the border of the game what I plan on
building I wanted to make sure like at

566
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:24,440
building I wanted to make sure like at
 

567
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,990
building I wanted to make sure like at
the blue blocks there that none of that

568
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
the blue blocks there that none of that
 

569
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,810
the blue blocks there that none of that
is visually blocked like if we're

570
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:28,820
is visually blocked like if we're
 

571
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,150
is visually blocked like if we're
standing over here if we went a little

572
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,160
standing over here if we went a little
 

573
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,100
standing over here if we went a little
bit further back you see it starts our

574
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,110
bit further back you see it starts our
 

575
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,620
bit further back you see it starts our
vision starts to get blocked of the game

576
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:35,630
vision starts to get blocked of the game
 

577
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,900
vision starts to get blocked of the game
itself so we didn't want that I I

578
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:37,910
itself so we didn't want that I I
 

579
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,770
itself so we didn't want that I I
positioned it seven blocks from here

580
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:40,780
positioned it seven blocks from here
 

581
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,790
positioned it seven blocks from here
because of that like if we brought this

582
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
because of that like if we brought this
 

583
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,890
because of that like if we brought this
in closer

584
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:43,900
in closer
 

585
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,080
in closer
we would have problems seeing the game

586
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,090
we would have problems seeing the game
 

587
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,430
we would have problems seeing the game
if we brought it out further then it'll

588
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
if we brought it out further then it'll
 

589
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,770
if we brought it out further then it'll
be unnecessarily far away so I I just

590
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:53,780
be unnecessarily far away so I I just
 

591
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,310
be unnecessarily far away so I I just
use this to try age where to put it

592
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
use this to try age where to put it
 

593
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,220
use this to try age where to put it
it's a nine by nine room by the way and

594
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,230
it's a nine by nine room by the way and
 

595
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,320
it's a nine by nine room by the way and
that is the very center of the nine by

596
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,330
that is the very center of the nine by
 

597
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,530
that is the very center of the nine by
nine so now that we know where we want

598
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:05,540
nine so now that we know where we want
 

599
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,470
nine so now that we know where we want
to position the screen we can start

600
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
to position the screen we can start
 

601
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,420
to position the screen we can start
building it here so this is the design I

602
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,430
building it here so this is the design I
 

603
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,760
building it here so this is the design I
have in mind we're gonna use courts for

604
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:12,770
have in mind we're gonna use courts for
 

605
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,640
have in mind we're gonna use courts for
the border it's a nice clean white block

606
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:15,650
the border it's a nice clean white block
 

607
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,340
the border it's a nice clean white block
goes pretty good with clay like the

608
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,350
goes pretty good with clay like the
 

609
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,610
goes pretty good with clay like the
hardened clay colors I find and will

610
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:21,620
hardened clay colors I find and will
 

611
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,590
hardened clay colors I find and will
make it go up and around this is gonna

612
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:26,600
make it go up and around this is gonna
 

613
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,990
make it go up and around this is gonna
be a very very complicated project by

614
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,000
be a very very complicated project by
 

615
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,230
be a very very complicated project by
the way I am a little scared of it like

616
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
the way I am a little scared of it like
 

617
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,090
the way I am a little scared of it like
even for me the redstone with this is

618
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:34,100
even for me the redstone with this is
 

619
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,250
even for me the redstone with this is
going to be difficult alright so we'll

620
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,260
going to be difficult alright so we'll
 

621
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,050
going to be difficult alright so we'll
do that and then I think we have to put

622
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,060
do that and then I think we have to put
 

623
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,680
do that and then I think we have to put
like a line down the middle like so

624
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:44,690
like a line down the middle like so
 

625
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,570
like a line down the middle like so
maybe connect so this will divide it

626
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:46,580
maybe connect so this will divide it
 

627
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,580
maybe connect so this will divide it
into our four quadrants for the colors

628
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:50,590
into our four quadrants for the colors
 

629
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,790
into our four quadrants for the colors
let's put a block here in there and

630
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
let's put a block here in there and
 

631
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,140
let's put a block here in there and
there and there okay so let's take a

632
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,150
there and there okay so let's take a
 

633
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,970
there and there okay so let's take a
step back oh I missed one break these

634
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:02,980
step back oh I missed one break these
 

635
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,050
step back oh I missed one break these
let's get an idea of what that looks

636
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,060
let's get an idea of what that looks
 

637
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,910
let's get an idea of what that looks
like right now

638
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:06,920
like right now
 

639
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,220
like right now
so that's our basic screen and again we

640
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,230
so that's our basic screen and again we
 

641
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,479
so that's our basic screen and again we
wanted to make sure none of that was

642
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:13,489
wanted to make sure none of that was
 

643
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,639
wanted to make sure none of that was
blocked our view of it looks pretty good

644
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:15,649
blocked our view of it looks pretty good
 

645
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:19,090
blocked our view of it looks pretty good
so let's start filling the colors in so

646
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,100
so let's start filling the colors in so
 

647
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,530
so let's start filling the colors in so
that should be red blue green yellow if

648
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:23,540
that should be red blue green yellow if
 

649
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,549
that should be red blue green yellow if
I if I figured that out right and there

650
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:27,559
I if I figured that out right and there
 

651
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,799
I if I figured that out right and there
we go so that is our interface for the

652
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:29,809
we go so that is our interface for the
 

653
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,499
we go so that is our interface for the
game I think that looks pretty good

654
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:32,509
game I think that looks pretty good
 

655
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:33,669
game I think that looks pretty good
though I'm happy with it

656
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:33,679
though I'm happy with it
 

657
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,159
though I'm happy with it
I inset them one block so that you get

658
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:36,169
I inset them one block so that you get
 

659
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,979
I inset them one block so that you get
the the shadows on the clay blocks

660
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:37,989
the the shadows on the clay blocks
 

661
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:41,489
the the shadows on the clay blocks
because if you keep them flush with the

662
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:41,499
because if you keep them flush with the
 

663
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:43,599
because if you keep them flush with the
screen you know you don't get that it

664
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:43,609
screen you know you don't get that it
 

665
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,759
screen you know you don't get that it
looks really really smooth and really

666
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:45,769
looks really really smooth and really
 

667
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,559
looks really really smooth and really
plain yeah that's why I put them in one

668
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:50,569
plain yeah that's why I put them in one
 

669
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:52,179
plain yeah that's why I put them in one
block I also put the lights one block

670
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:52,189
block I also put the lights one block
 

671
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,210
block I also put the lights one block
further in just for a little bit more

672
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:54,220
further in just for a little bit more
 

673
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,479
further in just for a little bit more
depth or detail to it now you can see

674
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:58,489
depth or detail to it now you can see
 

675
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,729
depth or detail to it now you can see
these buttons or these pressure plates

676
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:00,739
these buttons or these pressure plates
 

677
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,669
these buttons or these pressure plates
correspond with their positions so red

678
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:03,679
correspond with their positions so red
 

679
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,249
correspond with their positions so red
at the top I could have like just put

680
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:06,259
at the top I could have like just put
 

681
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:09,280
at the top I could have like just put
the screen on the floor as well there's

682
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,290
the screen on the floor as well there's
 

683
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,919
the screen on the floor as well there's
a lot of design things a lot of design

684
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:11,929
a lot of design things a lot of design
 

685
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,590
a lot of design things a lot of design
choices that go into this if we have it

686
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:14,600
choices that go into this if we have it
 

687
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,970
choices that go into this if we have it
on the floor I think it would be harder

688
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:15,980
on the floor I think it would be harder
 

689
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,799
on the floor I think it would be harder
to see what's happening though so that's

690
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:17,809
to see what's happening though so that's
 

691
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,169
to see what's happening though so that's
why I decided to put it like in a wall

692
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:20,179
why I decided to put it like in a wall
 

693
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,919
why I decided to put it like in a wall
like that and also the reason I didn't

694
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:23,929
like that and also the reason I didn't
 

695
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:26,679
like that and also the reason I didn't
use buttons for this like I could have

696
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:26,689
use buttons for this like I could have
 

697
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:30,850
use buttons for this like I could have
had green red yellow blue buttons for

698
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:30,860
had green red yellow blue buttons for
 

699
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,699
had green red yellow blue buttons for
different buttons to make our choice but

700
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:33,709
different buttons to make our choice but
 

701
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,799
different buttons to make our choice but
when we do that we're forced to move our

702
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:35,809
when we do that we're forced to move our
 

703
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:38,559
when we do that we're forced to move our
mouse that to pick to press the button

704
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:38,569
mouse that to pick to press the button
 

705
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:41,109
mouse that to pick to press the button
you know if we use pressure plates we

706
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:41,119
you know if we use pressure plates we
 

707
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,309
you know if we use pressure plates we
don't have to move the mouse we just

708
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:42,319
don't have to move the mouse we just
 

709
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:43,659
don't have to move the mouse we just
have to move our character so it just

710
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:43,669
have to move our character so it just
 

711
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,460
have to move our character so it just
looks a lot smoother when you make your

712
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,470
looks a lot smoother when you make your
 

713
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,259
looks a lot smoother when you make your
choice well that's why I did it that way

714
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:49,269
choice well that's why I did it that way
 

715
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:54,189
choice well that's why I did it that way
anyways to to like give visual feedback

716
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:54,199
anyways to to like give visual feedback
 

717
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,109
anyways to to like give visual feedback
we want a visual feedback in audio

718
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:56,119
we want a visual feedback in audio
 

719
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,119
we want a visual feedback in audio
feedback when we make a choice or when

720
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:58,129
feedback when we make a choice or when
 

721
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,309
feedback when we make a choice or when
it's trying to show us something here so

722
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:00,319
it's trying to show us something here so
 

723
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,499
it's trying to show us something here so
I want to make these pop-out one blocked

724
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:02,509
I want to make these pop-out one blocked
 

725
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:06,189
I want to make these pop-out one blocked
as well if it's selected so we're to do

726
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:06,199
as well if it's selected so we're to do
 

727
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,689
as well if it's selected so we're to do
that we're gonna put some slime blocks

728
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:07,699
that we're gonna put some slime blocks
 

729
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,829
that we're gonna put some slime blocks
in the back here kind of like so and

730
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
in the back here kind of like so and
 

731
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,600
in the back here kind of like so and
then wire this up let's put the city in

732
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:15,610
then wire this up let's put the city in
 

733
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,199
then wire this up let's put the city in
actually let's figure out where the

734
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:17,209
actually let's figure out where the
 

735
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,420
actually let's figure out where the
Pistons go first before we do that

736
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,430
Pistons go first before we do that
 

737
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,670
Pistons go first before we do that
it's very important if you ever build a

738
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:22,680
it's very important if you ever build a
 

739
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,160
it's very important if you ever build a
game like this that you figure out the

740
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,170
game like this that you figure out the
 

741
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,260
game like this that you figure out the
interface before you do the redstone

742
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,270
interface before you do the redstone
 

743
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,390
interface before you do the redstone
otherwise it's not gonna it's not gonna

744
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
otherwise it's not gonna it's not gonna
 

745
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,180
otherwise it's not gonna it's not gonna
fall into place correctly oh why did I

746
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,190
fall into place correctly oh why did I
 

747
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,180
fall into place correctly oh why did I
do that I put that in the wrong spots

748
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,190
do that I put that in the wrong spots
 

749
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,820
do that I put that in the wrong spots
okay let's put how do I get this piston

750
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:43,830
okay let's put how do I get this piston
 

751
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,910
okay let's put how do I get this piston
down this is the most difficult parts

752
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:46,920
down this is the most difficult parts
 

753
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,340
down this is the most difficult parts
most difficult challenge we faced yet

754
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:49,350
most difficult challenge we faced yet
 

755
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,010
most difficult challenge we faced yet
okay there we go the two Pistons for

756
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,020
okay there we go the two Pistons for
 

757
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,590
okay there we go the two Pistons for
each I guess will do and now we gotta

758
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:54,600
each I guess will do and now we gotta
 

759
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,610
each I guess will do and now we gotta
try connecting together so let's put how

760
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:01,620
try connecting together so let's put how
 

761
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,100
try connecting together so let's put how
do we do this we will put a piece of

762
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,110
do we do this we will put a piece of
 

763
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,260
do we do this we will put a piece of
obsidian there we got to use obsidian so

764
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,270
obsidian there we got to use obsidian so
 

765
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,540
obsidian there we got to use obsidian so
the slime doesn't stick to it put

766
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:08,550
the slime doesn't stick to it put
 

767
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,770
the slime doesn't stick to it put
another one there

768
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:09,780
another one there
 

769
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,350
another one there
redstone above on those two pieces oops

770
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:14,360
redstone above on those two pieces oops
 

771
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,080
redstone above on those two pieces oops
that's one way to stack up but yes

772
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,090
that's one way to stack up but yes
 

773
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,590
that's one way to stack up but yes
alright and then this was the blue one I

774
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
alright and then this was the blue one I
 

775
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,000
alright and then this was the blue one I
just will put a blue wire thing for it

776
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,010
just will put a blue wire thing for it
 

777
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,250
just will put a blue wire thing for it
alright and then redstone repeater into

778
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:28,260
alright and then redstone repeater into
 

779
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,780
alright and then redstone repeater into
there and that's and I think that should

780
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:32,790
there and that's and I think that should
 

781
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,320
there and that's and I think that should
work just go see what that did

782
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,330
work just go see what that did
 

783
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,400
work just go see what that did
alright that popped it out and it popped

784
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,410
alright that popped it out and it popped
 

785
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,230
alright that popped it out and it popped
the light out that's good let's make it

786
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
the light out that's good let's make it
 

787
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,650
the light out that's good let's make it
so the light turns on as well the light

788
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:45,660
so the light turns on as well the light
 

789
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,510
so the light turns on as well the light
is over there so we would we could just

790
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
is over there so we would we could just
 

791
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,260
is over there so we would we could just
throw a torch down below like that's

792
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,270
throw a torch down below like that's
 

793
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,330
throw a torch down below like that's
alright and then make sure it retracts

794
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:53,340
alright and then make sure it retracts
 

795
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,680
alright and then make sure it retracts
properly so it's on power it's alright

796
00:18:59,680 --> 00:18:59,690
properly so it's on power it's alright
 

797
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,760
properly so it's on power it's alright
yeah that looks good so I'm gonna do

798
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:01,770
yeah that looks good so I'm gonna do
 

799
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,520
yeah that looks good so I'm gonna do
that with all four of them alright so

800
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:04,530
that with all four of them alright so
 

801
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,990
that with all four of them alright so
we're off to a good start here check

802
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
we're off to a good start here check
 

803
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,610
we're off to a good start here check
this out I hooked up the pressure plates

804
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:07,620
this out I hooked up the pressure plates
 

805
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,310
this out I hooked up the pressure plates
to each of their colors now when we step

806
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
to each of their colors now when we step
 

807
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,919
to each of their colors now when we step
on them we can see see what happens and

808
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:12,929
on them we can see see what happens and
 

809
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,799
on them we can see see what happens and
that's pretty clear I can tell pretty

810
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:15,809
that's pretty clear I can tell pretty
 

811
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,040
that's pretty clear I can tell pretty
easily when when a color is chosen here

812
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,050
easily when when a color is chosen here
 

813
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,390
easily when when a color is chosen here
right so it's a good visual indicator I

814
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:23,400
right so it's a good visual indicator I
 

815
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,320
right so it's a good visual indicator I
would say I'm happy with that so as it

816
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,330
would say I'm happy with that so as it
 

817
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,540
would say I'm happy with that so as it
is right now we could probably start

818
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:29,550
is right now we could probably start
 

819
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,410
is right now we could probably start
applying some logic stuff to this now

820
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:32,420
applying some logic stuff to this now
 

821
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,340
applying some logic stuff to this now
let me show you the

822
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,350
let me show you the
 

823
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,320
let me show you the
the basic form of it right now so we

824
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,330
the basic form of it right now so we
 

825
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,600
the basic form of it right now so we
have the the wires just running out to

826
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,610
have the the wires just running out to
 

827
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,550
have the the wires just running out to
the little gizmo we set up earlier here

828
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:42,560
the little gizmo we set up earlier here
 

829
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,590
the little gizmo we set up earlier here
so basically just runs up connects to

830
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
so basically just runs up connects to
 

831
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,110
so basically just runs up connects to
each of these and that's all there is to

832
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,120
each of these and that's all there is to
 

833
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,850
each of these and that's all there is to
it right now but we have we have to do

834
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:49,860
it right now but we have we have to do
 

835
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,120
it right now but we have we have to do
some checks and and some complicated

836
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,130
some checks and and some complicated
 

837
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,720
some checks and and some complicated
stuff now so very the very first basic

838
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:56,730
stuff now so very the very first basic
 

839
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,060
stuff now so very the very first basic
thing you'll notice when I step on the

840
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,070
thing you'll notice when I step on the
 

841
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,950
thing you'll notice when I step on the
pressure plate this just stays out as

842
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
pressure plate this just stays out as
 

843
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,390
pressure plate this just stays out as
long as I stand on it right let's let's

844
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,400
long as I stand on it right let's let's
 

845
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,580
long as I stand on it right let's let's
add a monostable circuit to it so

846
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:09,590
add a monostable circuit to it so
 

847
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,610
add a monostable circuit to it so
typically the way I do these is I'll use

848
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:13,620
typically the way I do these is I'll use
 

849
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,820
typically the way I do these is I'll use
a sticky piston and then the block like

850
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:16,830
a sticky piston and then the block like
 

851
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,050
a sticky piston and then the block like
that and then we pull it through take

852
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,060
that and then we pull it through take
 

853
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,910
that and then we pull it through take
the signal out here we'll set this to 4

854
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:22,920
the signal out here we'll set this to 4
 

855
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,970
the signal out here we'll set this to 4
I'll just show you what this does so now

856
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:25,980
I'll just show you what this does so now
 

857
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,310
I'll just show you what this does so now
it's like a button almost you when you

858
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
it's like a button almost you when you
 

859
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,950
it's like a button almost you when you
step on it it only applies signal once

860
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
step on it it only applies signal once
 

861
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,490
step on it it only applies signal once
and for a certain amount of time so in

862
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:34,500
and for a certain amount of time so in
 

863
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,380
and for a certain amount of time so in
order to do it again you actually have

864
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,390
order to do it again you actually have
 

865
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,200
order to do it again you actually have
to get off the pressure plate the floor

866
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,210
to get off the pressure plate the floor
 

867
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,540
to get off the pressure plate the floor
tiles accept another input that way if

868
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:41,550
tiles accept another input that way if
 

869
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,150
tiles accept another input that way if
we like sit on blue for example it's not

870
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,160
we like sit on blue for example it's not
 

871
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,840
we like sit on blue for example it's not
gonna like keep keep picking blue is our

872
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:47,850
gonna like keep keep picking blue is our
 

873
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,210
gonna like keep keep picking blue is our
answer until we get off and then either

874
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,220
answer until we get off and then either
 

875
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,500
answer until we get off and then either
select it again or a different color

876
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,510
select it again or a different color
 

877
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,100
select it again or a different color
rights so that's very simple ah the one

878
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,110
rights so that's very simple ah the one
 

879
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,870
rights so that's very simple ah the one
thing though

880
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880

 

881
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,460

there's piston sounds right we want to

882
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,470
there's piston sounds right we want to
 

883
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,170
there's piston sounds right we want to
maybe get rid of those because it's

884
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:03,180
maybe get rid of those because it's
 

885
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,280
maybe get rid of those because it's
close to where we're standing there for

886
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,290
close to where we're standing there for
 

887
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,460
close to where we're standing there for
basically every circuit in this game

888
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,470
basically every circuit in this game
 

889
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,140
basically every circuit in this game
there's a redstone version and there's a

890
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,150
there's a redstone version and there's a
 

891
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,300
there's a redstone version and there's a
piston version so we just saw a piston

892
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,310
piston version so we just saw a piston
 

893
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,890
piston version so we just saw a piston
monostable circuit I'm gonna do a

894
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:15,900
monostable circuit I'm gonna do a
 

895
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,700
monostable circuit I'm gonna do a
redstone 1ho piston circuits are usually

896
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:19,710
redstone 1ho piston circuits are usually
 

897
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,010
redstone 1ho piston circuits are usually
more compact than their Redstone

898
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,020
more compact than their Redstone
 

899
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,760
more compact than their Redstone
counterparts but redstone circuits are

900
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:25,770
counterparts but redstone circuits are
 

901
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,270
counterparts but redstone circuits are
quiet they're silent which is usually a

902
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
quiet they're silent which is usually a
 

903
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,650
quiet they're silent which is usually a
nice feature ok so I just put a redstone

904
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:33,660
nice feature ok so I just put a redstone
 

905
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
nice feature ok so I just put a redstone
monostable circuit on all four of the

906
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:35,670
monostable circuit on all four of the
 

907
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,060
monostable circuit on all four of the
wires here this is it right here it's

908
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,070
wires here this is it right here it's
 

909
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,040
wires here this is it right here it's
pretty simple a little bit bigger than

910
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,050
pretty simple a little bit bigger than
 

911
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,370
pretty simple a little bit bigger than
the piston version but is quiets very

912
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:43,380
the piston version but is quiets very
 

913
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,100
the piston version but is quiets very
important does the same thing though as

914
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,110
important does the same thing though as
 

915
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,270
important does the same thing though as
you can see

916
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,280
you can see
 

917
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,370
you can see
we're gonna have noteblocks playing like

918
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,380
we're gonna have noteblocks playing like
 

919
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
we're gonna have noteblocks playing like
near here and we want to be able to hear

920
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,390
near here and we want to be able to hear
 

921
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,510
near here and we want to be able to hear
them so if we can cut down on piston

922
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
them so if we can cut down on piston
 

923
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,690
them so if we can cut down on piston
noise we definitely want to do that's

924
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:55,700
noise we definitely want to do that's
 

925
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,050
noise we definitely want to do that's
alright now the next step I don't know

926
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,060
alright now the next step I don't know
 

927
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,160
alright now the next step I don't know
how many of you are actually familiar

928
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,170
how many of you are actually familiar
 

929
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,370
how many of you are actually familiar
with the Simon game but there's like two

930
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:04,380
with the Simon game but there's like two
 

931
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,920
with the Simon game but there's like two
states to it basically the first one is

932
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:06,930
states to it basically the first one is
 

933
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,000
states to it basically the first one is
a place through the sequence so you know

934
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,010
a place through the sequence so you know
 

935
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,960
a place through the sequence so you know
green blue red yellow red whatever then

936
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:14,970
green blue red yellow red whatever then
 

937
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,140
green blue red yellow red whatever then
when is done well actually during that

938
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,150
when is done well actually during that
 

939
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,680
when is done well actually during that
sequence we we we don't want to accept

940
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:21,690
sequence we we we don't want to accept
 

941
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,470
sequence we we we don't want to accept
any inputs because it's just showing us

942
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
any inputs because it's just showing us
 

943
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,510
any inputs because it's just showing us
what we have to copy so we want to

944
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:26,520
what we have to copy so we want to
 

945
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,220
what we have to copy so we want to
disable these pressure plates while it's

946
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,230
disable these pressure plates while it's
 

947
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,220
disable these pressure plates while it's
doing that then after it's done that

948
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,230
doing that then after it's done that
 

949
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,800
doing that then after it's done that
then it's our turn to enter what we just

950
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:33,810
then it's our turn to enter what we just
 

951
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,650
then it's our turn to enter what we just
saw in copy it's right so then we want

952
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:36,660
saw in copy it's right so then we want
 

953
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,740
saw in copy it's right so then we want
to re in a ballades and we want to check

954
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:39,750
to re in a ballades and we want to check
 

955
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,490
to re in a ballades and we want to check
if we pick the right answer or not and

956
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:43,500
if we pick the right answer or not and
 

957
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,370
if we pick the right answer or not and
we can combine all those all those

958
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:46,380
we can combine all those all those
 

959
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,110
we can combine all those all those
things we want pretty simply here I

960
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,120
things we want pretty simply here I
 

961
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,000
things we want pretty simply here I
think all we're gonna do is maybe cut

962
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,010
think all we're gonna do is maybe cut
 

963
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,070
think all we're gonna do is maybe cut
the wire here and let's put a sticky

964
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
the wire here and let's put a sticky
 

965
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,720
the wire here and let's put a sticky
piston here we will use a sticky piston

966
00:22:59,720 --> 00:22:59,730
piston here we will use a sticky piston
 

967
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,030
piston here we will use a sticky piston
for this just cuz it's a lot simpler

968
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,040
for this just cuz it's a lot simpler
 

969
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,490
for this just cuz it's a lot simpler
and this is kind of a complicated thing

970
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,500
and this is kind of a complicated thing
 

971
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,000
and this is kind of a complicated thing
we're doing alright so if for example

972
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,010
we're doing alright so if for example
 

973
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,530
we're doing alright so if for example
green is the right answer then below

974
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:12,540
green is the right answer then below
 

975
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,680
green is the right answer then below
here we're gonna send power to it and

976
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:14,690
here we're gonna send power to it and
 

977
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,740
here we're gonna send power to it and
that's pretty much all we have to do

978
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:17,750
that's pretty much all we have to do
 

979
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,500
that's pretty much all we have to do
alright so then only if this is up will

980
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:21,510
alright so then only if this is up will
 

981
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,640
alright so then only if this is up will
will power be sent through so yeah this

982
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:25,650
will power be sent through so yeah this
 

983
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,740
will power be sent through so yeah this
is a nice way of simplifying it guys

984
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:27,750
is a nice way of simplifying it guys
 

985
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,350
is a nice way of simplifying it guys
basically if all these Pistons are down

986
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,360
basically if all these Pistons are down
 

987
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,230
basically if all these Pistons are down
it's disabling our input tray now so it

988
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,240
it's disabling our input tray now so it
 

989
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,820
it's disabling our input tray now so it
like when it's showing us what to copy

990
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:34,830
like when it's showing us what to copy
 

991
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,280
like when it's showing us what to copy
we want the input disabled all we got to

992
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,290
we want the input disabled all we got to
 

993
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,990
we want the input disabled all we got to
do is keep all the Pistons down that's

994
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,000
do is keep all the Pistons down that's
 

995
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
do is keep all the Pistons down that's
nice and simple if we want to check for

996
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:41,910
nice and simple if we want to check for
 

997
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,600
nice and simple if we want to check for
a correct answer like let's say Green is

998
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:44,610
a correct answer like let's say Green is
 

999
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,000
a correct answer like let's say Green is
the right answer at the moment then all

1000
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,010
the right answer at the moment then all
 

1001
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,950
the right answer at the moment then all
we're gonna do is send power to this

1002
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
we're gonna do is send power to this
 

1003
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,740
we're gonna do is send power to this
piston right you might be thinking

1004
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:51,750
piston right you might be thinking
 

1005
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,040
piston right you might be thinking
though etho you fool we're gonna destroy

1006
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,050
though etho you fool we're gonna destroy
 

1007
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,080
though etho you fool we're gonna destroy
all the wrong answers until we find the

1008
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,090
all the wrong answers until we find the
 

1009
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,870
all the wrong answers until we find the
right one right well no because I've

1010
00:23:59,870 --> 00:23:59,880
right one right well no because I've
 

1011
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,980
right one right well no because I've
added something else

1012
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:00,990
added something else
 

1013
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,210
added something else
here only if it's the right answer like

1014
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,220
here only if it's the right answer like
 

1015
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,160
here only if it's the right answer like
only if the power can get sent through

1016
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,170
only if the power can get sent through
 

1017
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,870
only if the power can get sent through
here does this wire turn on right and I

1018
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:11,880
here does this wire turn on right and I
 

1019
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,710
here does this wire turn on right and I
just set up like a triple triple nd to

1020
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:15,720
just set up like a triple triple nd to
 

1021
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,560
just set up like a triple triple nd to
lose detection system here so we have we

1022
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:21,570
lose detection system here so we have we
 

1023
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,060
lose detection system here so we have we
have three conditions that are checked

1024
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,070
have three conditions that are checked
 

1025
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,710
have three conditions that are checked
the first one is if we're accepting

1026
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
the first one is if we're accepting
 

1027
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,210
the first one is if we're accepting
input or nuts on the game then if if the

1028
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,220
input or nuts on the game then if if the
 

1029
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,890
input or nuts on the game then if if the
game is waiting us for us to make us a

1030
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:30,900
game is waiting us for us to make us a
 

1031
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,360
game is waiting us for us to make us a
choice then this torch will be off okay

1032
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,370
choice then this torch will be off okay
 

1033
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,760
choice then this torch will be off okay
the other wire here is if any of the

1034
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:37,770
the other wire here is if any of the
 

1035
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,430
the other wire here is if any of the
pressure plates are stepped on its gonna

1036
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:40,440
pressure plates are stepped on its gonna
 

1037
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,310
pressure plates are stepped on its gonna
disable this torch and if this torch is

1038
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,320
disable this torch and if this torch is
 

1039
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,620
disable this torch and if this torch is
off and this one's off well then this

1040
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,630
off and this one's off well then this
 

1041
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,700
off and this one's off well then this
light turns on and we lose GG let me

1042
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:49,710
light turns on and we lose GG let me
 

1043
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,580
light turns on and we lose GG let me
show you how this works Oh green is the

1044
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:52,590
show you how this works Oh green is the
 

1045
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,060
show you how this works Oh green is the
correct answer right now so we step on

1046
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,070
correct answer right now so we step on
 

1047
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,500
correct answer right now so we step on
red wrong answer that torch turns off

1048
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,510
red wrong answer that torch turns off
 

1049
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,590
red wrong answer that torch turns off
game over right but if we step on green

1050
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
game over right but if we step on green
 

1051
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,340
game over right but if we step on green
look what happens you see that it

1052
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,350
look what happens you see that it
 

1053
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,549
look what happens you see that it
cancels it out so since this is the

1054
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
cancels it out so since this is the
 

1055
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,470
cancels it out so since this is the
right answer it sends power down this

1056
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
right answer it sends power down this
 

1057
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,799
right answer it sends power down this
line and at the same moment that torch

1058
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:15,809
line and at the same moment that torch
 

1059
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:19,130
line and at the same moment that torch
turns off powers sent to the repeater

1060
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:19,140
turns off powers sent to the repeater
 

1061
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,350
turns off powers sent to the repeater
and it keeps that on prevents the torch

1062
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
and it keeps that on prevents the torch
 

1063
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,840
and it keeps that on prevents the torch
from from triggering the game over

1064
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:23,850
from from triggering the game over
 

1065
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,160
from from triggering the game over
events all right that's the basic lose

1066
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,170
events all right that's the basic lose
 

1067
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,080
events all right that's the basic lose
detection logic it's not not too crazy

1068
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,090
detection logic it's not not too crazy
 

1069
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,080
detection logic it's not not too crazy
all right

1070
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,090
all right
 

1071
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,230
all right
we're probably gonna want to wait before

1072
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,240
we're probably gonna want to wait before
 

1073
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,200
we're probably gonna want to wait before
we do this other part of the game this

1074
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,210
we do this other part of the game this
 

1075
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,020
we do this other part of the game this
is the tough part over here but we got

1076
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,030
is the tough part over here but we got
 

1077
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,799
is the tough part over here but we got
to set up the memory and the the thing

1078
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:48,809
to set up the memory and the the thing
 

1079
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,190
to set up the memory and the the thing
that sequences through the stuff and

1080
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,200
that sequences through the stuff and
 

1081
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,160
that sequences through the stuff and
chooses the right answer all this stuff

1082
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,170
chooses the right answer all this stuff
 

1083
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,440
chooses the right answer all this stuff
that controls these Pistons here we have

1084
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,450
that controls these Pistons here we have
 

1085
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,350
that controls these Pistons here we have
to implement now all right

1086
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,360
to implement now all right
 

1087
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,810
to implement now all right
we'll do that next next episode i'll

1088
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:02,820
we'll do that next next episode i'll
 

1089
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,340
we'll do that next next episode i'll
probably do most of it off camera cuz

1090
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,350
probably do most of it off camera cuz
 

1091
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,919
probably do most of it off camera cuz
it's gonna be boring i hate to say it

1092
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:06,929
it's gonna be boring i hate to say it
 

1093
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:09,950
it's gonna be boring i hate to say it
but it's it's redstone stuff so i'll try

1094
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:09,960
but it's it's redstone stuff so i'll try
 

1095
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
but it's it's redstone stuff so i'll try
to get that done and we'll check it out

1096
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:11,970
to get that done and we'll check it out
 

1097
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,510
to get that done and we'll check it out
later

1098
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
later
 

1099
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,230
later

guys it's that time again let's check
 

1103
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,430
guys it's that time again let's check
out the comment for today

1104
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
out the comment for today
 

1105
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,160
out the comment for today
it says etho have you ever considered

1106
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,170
it says etho have you ever considered
 

1107
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,090
it says etho have you ever considered
making a new current intro just the

1108
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,100
