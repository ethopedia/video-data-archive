I'll try do level 50 enchantments on it

162
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,180
I'll try do level 50 enchantments on it
 

163
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,990
I'll try do level 50 enchantments on it
as my redstone supply will grab some of

164
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,000
as my redstone supply will grab some of
 

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,720
as my redstone supply will grab some of
this

166
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:20,730
this
 

167
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,170
this
and we'll grab some gold gold blocks and

168
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,180
and we'll grab some gold gold blocks and
 

169
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,270
and we'll grab some gold gold blocks and
let's head up to where the door is going

170
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
let's head up to where the door is going
 

171
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,190
let's head up to where the door is going
to go that we were planning had some

172
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,200
to go that we were planning had some
 

173
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,890
to go that we were planning had some
good suggestions for it I ripped out the

174
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:36,900
good suggestions for it I ripped out the
 

175
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,590
good suggestions for it I ripped out the
wall looks a little bit weird right now

176
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
wall looks a little bit weird right now
 

177
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,590
wall looks a little bit weird right now
but I think when I polish this area out

178
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:42,600
but I think when I polish this area out
 

179
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,110
but I think when I polish this area out
it'll look pretty good it's just a flat

180
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
it'll look pretty good it's just a flat
 

181
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,080
it'll look pretty good it's just a flat
stone slab at the moment I put the grass

182
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,090
stone slab at the moment I put the grass
 

183
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,510
stone slab at the moment I put the grass
here glowstone I don't know if I'll keep

184
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:50,520
here glowstone I don't know if I'll keep
 

185
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,540
here glowstone I don't know if I'll keep
the glowstone there it's kind of nice

186
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:53,550
the glowstone there it's kind of nice
 

187
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,420
the glowstone there it's kind of nice
and this wall on the right will be

188
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,430
and this wall on the right will be
 

189
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,880
and this wall on the right will be
removed slightly too so the fence gate

190
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:58,890
removed slightly too so the fence gate
 

191
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,950
removed slightly too so the fence gate
or the fences don't attach like they are

192
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
or the fences don't attach like they are
 

193
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,020
or the fences don't attach like they are
here okay let's let's try out this door

194
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,030
here okay let's let's try out this door
 

195
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,000
here okay let's let's try out this door
here so people suggest that I should try

196
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,010
here so people suggest that I should try
 

197
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,220
here so people suggest that I should try
sandstone and gold instead of like the

198
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,230
sandstone and gold instead of like the
 

199
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,070
sandstone and gold instead of like the
nether brick and iron that I have at the

200
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
nether brick and iron that I have at the
 

201
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,030
nether brick and iron that I have at the
potion room down there

202
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,040
potion room down there
 

203
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,770
potion room down there
since we're going for a warmer feeling

204
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:18,780
since we're going for a warmer feeling
 

205
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,260
since we're going for a warmer feeling
in this area without the constant use a

206
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,270
in this area without the constant use a
 

207
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,190
in this area without the constant use a
constant use of stone bricks try we'll

208
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,200
constant use of stone bricks try we'll
 

209
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,020
constant use of stone bricks try we'll
try something different here so it would

210
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,030
try something different here so it would
 

211
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:38,950
try something different here so it would
look your frame would be like this and I

212
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
look your frame would be like this and I
 

213
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,800
look your frame would be like this and I
have been looking on YouTube for I did

214
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:42,810
have been looking on YouTube for I did
 

215
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,750
have been looking on YouTube for I did
search for different doors people have

216
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:44,760
search for different doors people have
 

217
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,420
search for different doors people have
made and apparently there's like 4 by 4

218
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,430
made and apparently there's like 4 by 4
 

219
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,220
made and apparently there's like 4 by 4
doors and 5 by 5 doors I am aware of CNB

220
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,230
doors and 5 by 5 doors I am aware of CNB
 

221

Minecrafts 3 by 3 door it's really nice

222
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,510
Minecrafts 3 by 3 door it's really nice
 

223
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,890
Minecrafts 3 by 3 door it's really nice
he's he did a good job on it and also I

224
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:57,900
he's he did a good job on it and also I
 

225
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,650
he's he did a good job on it and also I
saw a Minecraft addict also did a nice 3

226
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,660
saw a Minecraft addict also did a nice 3
 

227
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,740
saw a Minecraft addict also did a nice 3
by 3 door but I will still do it my way

228
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:03,750
by 3 door but I will still do it my way
 

229
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,530
by 3 door but I will still do it my way
is a just funner for me that way so this

230
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:09,540
is a just funner for me that way so this
 

231
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,960
is a just funner for me that way so this
is what it would look like but yeah

232
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:11,970
is what it would look like but yeah
 

233
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,420
is what it would look like but yeah
people made like 5 by 5 doors and it

234
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,430
people made like 5 by 5 doors and it
 

235
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,740
people made like 5 by 5 doors and it
takes just like 15 seconds of Pistons

236
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:18,750
takes just like 15 seconds of Pistons
 

237
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,180
takes just like 15 seconds of Pistons
moving around or putting the door it

238
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,190
moving around or putting the door it
 

239
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,280
moving around or putting the door it
looks really cool and the wiring is

240
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,290
looks really cool and the wiring is
 

241
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,700
looks really cool and the wiring is
crazy I guess this is what it would look

242
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:25,710
crazy I guess this is what it would look
 

243
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,060
crazy I guess this is what it would look
like

244
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,070

 

245
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,380

okay it's different that's for sure

246
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,390

 

247
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,660

might be good I don't know let me know

248
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:37,670
might be good I don't know let me know
 

249
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,850
might be good I don't know let me know
what you think I think for this episode

250
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:39,860
what you think I think for this episode
 

251
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,960
what you think I think for this episode
I'll keep it like that

252
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:40,970
I'll keep it like that
 

253
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,030
I'll keep it like that
while I build it here and I'll have to

254
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,040
while I build it here and I'll have to
 

255
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,940
while I build it here and I'll have to
do mostly soft camera probably so like I

256
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:48,950
do mostly soft camera probably so like I
 

257
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,550
do mostly soft camera probably so like I
said I want that the middle wants to

258
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:51,560
said I want that the middle wants to
 

259
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,510
said I want that the middle wants to
retract first then the corners and then

260
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,520
retract first then the corners and then
 

261
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,800
retract first then the corners and then
the sides so that's all aim for here and

262
00:07:59,800 --> 00:07:59,810
the sides so that's all aim for here and
 

263
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,760
the sides so that's all aim for here and
I think my Pistons going and I'll give

264
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:03,770
I think my Pistons going and I'll give
 

265
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,170
I think my Pistons going and I'll give
you an update after I've worked on this

266
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,180
you an update after I've worked on this
 

267
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,730
you an update after I've worked on this
for a little bit I got it pretty close

268
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:09,740
for a little bit I got it pretty close
 

269
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,190
for a little bit I got it pretty close
to working properly now it's a lot

270
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,200
to working properly now it's a lot
 

271
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,140
to working properly now it's a lot
easier to build in that spiraling door

272
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,150
easier to build in that spiraling door
 

273
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,940
easier to build in that spiraling door
that's for sure a lot quicker to some of

274
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:18,950
that's for sure a lot quicker to some of
 

275
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,440
that's for sure a lot quicker to some of
this redstone will need to be moved

276
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,450
this redstone will need to be moved
 

277
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,870
this redstone will need to be moved
here's a here's what it looks like at

278
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:22,880
here's a here's what it looks like at
 

279
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,620
here's a here's what it looks like at
the moment I'm having a few issues

280
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:25,630
the moment I'm having a few issues
 

281
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:36,340
the moment I'm having a few issues
that's opening that's closing so closing

282
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,350
that's opening that's closing so closing
 

283
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,440
that's opening that's closing so closing
is working perfectly exactly like I

284
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,450
is working perfectly exactly like I
 

285
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,600
is working perfectly exactly like I
wanted it to like spot-on opening

286
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:43,610
wanted it to like spot-on opening
 

287
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,840
wanted it to like spot-on opening
there's one issue with it

288
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:46,850
there's one issue with it
 

289
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,620
there's one issue with it
few if you watch a bottom ones that's

290
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:50,630
few if you watch a bottom ones that's
 

291
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,170
few if you watch a bottom ones that's
the way it's supposed to work but then

292
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,180
the way it's supposed to work but then
 

293
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,470
the way it's supposed to work but then
if you watch the top ones you'll see the

294
00:08:59,470 --> 00:08:59,480
if you watch the top ones you'll see the
 

295
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,190
if you watch the top ones you'll see the
bottom one retracts first for for the

296
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
bottom one retracts first for for the
 

297
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,740
bottom one retracts first for for the
middle but at the top one the corners

298
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:05,750
middle but at the top one the corners
 

299
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,540
middle but at the top one the corners
retract first so it doesn't match and

300
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:10,550
retract first so it doesn't match and
 

301
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,620
retract first so it doesn't match and
that's all has to do with the way the

302
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:14,630
that's all has to do with the way the
 

303
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,050
that's all has to do with the way the
repeaters are positioned with the

304
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,060
repeaters are positioned with the
 

305
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,490
repeaters are positioned with the
Pistons so Pistons are below these

306
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:21,500
Pistons so Pistons are below these
 

307
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,290
Pistons so Pistons are below these
blocks I'm sending power into the blocks

308
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,300
blocks I'm sending power into the blocks
 

309
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,970
blocks I'm sending power into the blocks
with these repeaters and the wire here

310
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:27,980
with these repeaters and the wire here
 

311
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,810
with these repeaters and the wire here
and down below the way I'm doing it is

312
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:31,820
and down below the way I'm doing it is
 

313
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,700
and down below the way I'm doing it is
slightly different and that's what's

314
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:33,710
slightly different and that's what's
 

315
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,690
slightly different and that's what's
causing it a little bit of variation I

316
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:37,700
causing it a little bit of variation I
 

317
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,210
causing it a little bit of variation I
think so down here I have the repeaters

318
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,220
think so down here I have the repeaters
 

319
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,670
think so down here I have the repeaters
going directly into the Pistons I think

320
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:42,680
going directly into the Pistons I think
 

321
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,220
going directly into the Pistons I think
I was to do that at the top it would be

322
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,230
I was to do that at the top it would be
 

323
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,389
I was to do that at the top it would be
perfect but then it might look a little

324
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:49,399
perfect but then it might look a little
 

325
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:54,750
perfect but then it might look a little
strange

326
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:54,760

 

327
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,480

like the repeaters that have to go down

328
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,490
like the repeaters that have to go down
 

329
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,269
like the repeaters that have to go down
lower which would mess up with my

330
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
lower which would mess up with my
 

331
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,820
lower which would mess up with my
doorframe whoops so I'll try move them

332
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:06,830
doorframe whoops so I'll try move them
 

333
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,050
doorframe whoops so I'll try move them
and see if that would fix the problem

334
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,060
and see if that would fix the problem
 

335
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,130
and see if that would fix the problem
just out of curiosity

336
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,140
just out of curiosity
 

337
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,230
just out of curiosity
yep changing that around has fixed it

338
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
yep changing that around has fixed it
 

339
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,810
yep changing that around has fixed it
for sure so this is what this is how I

340
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:16,820
for sure so this is what this is how I
 

341
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,460
for sure so this is what this is how I
wanted the door to function just like

342
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:18,470
wanted the door to function just like
 

343
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,769
wanted the door to function just like
this that's opening that's closing

344
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:22,779
this that's opening that's closing
 

345
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:30,340
this that's opening that's closing
working perfectly now only downside is I

346
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:30,350
working perfectly now only downside is I
 

347
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,440
working perfectly now only downside is I
have this overhang here which I can't

348
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,450
have this overhang here which I can't
 

349
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,600
have this overhang here which I can't
get rid of what the way I have this but

350
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,610
get rid of what the way I have this but
 

351
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,210
get rid of what the way I have this but
I've realized the reason it was a

352
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,220

 

353
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,300

behaving inconsistently is because the

354
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,310
behaving inconsistently is because the
 

355
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,810
behaving inconsistently is because the
wiring was powering the Pistons

356
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:45,820
wiring was powering the Pistons
 

357
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,699
wiring was powering the Pistons
diagonally so that causes weird effects

358
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:48,709
diagonally so that causes weird effects
 

359
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:51,300
diagonally so that causes weird effects
if I raised the repeaters even higher

360
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,310
if I raised the repeaters even higher
 

361
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,050
if I raised the repeaters even higher
like before I had the repeaters at this

362
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,060
like before I had the repeaters at this
 

363
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,890
like before I had the repeaters at this
height did I fall through the block or I

364
00:10:59,890 --> 00:10:59,900
height did I fall through the block or I
 

365
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,510
height did I fall through the block or I
walk off there that was weird

366
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:01,520
walk off there that was weird
 

367
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,040
walk off there that was weird
I had it like this ah but the repeater

368
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,050
I had it like this ah but the repeater
 

369
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:13,120
I had it like this ah but the repeater
or hmm how did that work it's very

370
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,130
or hmm how did that work it's very
 

371
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,890
or hmm how did that work it's very
strange if you send redstone power

372
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:14,900
strange if you send redstone power
 

373
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,710
strange if you send redstone power
diagonally to a piston it causes

374
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
diagonally to a piston it causes
 

375
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,390
diagonally to a piston it causes
inconsistencies so I was to raise the

376
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:19,400
inconsistencies so I was to raise the
 

377
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,600
inconsistencies so I was to raise the
repeaters one block higher that would

378
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:22,610
repeaters one block higher that would
 

379
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,180
repeaters one block higher that would
fix the problem I think as well and then

380
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,190
fix the problem I think as well and then
 

381
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,630
fix the problem I think as well and then
I could get rid of this overhang so I'll

382
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
I could get rid of this overhang so I'll
 

383
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,790
I could get rid of this overhang so I'll
do that nice thing about how this turned

384
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:33,800
do that nice thing about how this turned
 

385
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,150
do that nice thing about how this turned
out the middle of the stairs aligns

386
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,160
out the middle of the stairs aligns
 

387
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,300
out the middle of the stairs aligns
perfectly with this walkway here so

388
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,310
perfectly with this walkway here so
 

389
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,389
perfectly with this walkway here so
don't have to walk to the side to get

390
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:43,399
don't have to walk to the side to get
 

391
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,790
don't have to walk to the side to get
away from the water streams and

392
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:45,800
away from the water streams and
 

393
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,680
away from the water streams and
something a lot of people commented on

394
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:47,690
something a lot of people commented on
 

395
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,050
something a lot of people commented on
as I should put two half slabs over top

396
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,060
as I should put two half slabs over top
 

397
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,930
as I should put two half slabs over top
the water it's definitely something I

398
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:52,940
the water it's definitely something I
 

399
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,730
the water it's definitely something I
was going to do when I originally made

400
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:54,740
was going to do when I originally made
 

401
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,199
was going to do when I originally made
this but

402
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:56,209
this but
 

403
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:59,559
this but
then you have a problem because the way

404
00:11:59,559 --> 00:11:59,569
then you have a problem because the way
 

405
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,829
then you have a problem because the way
I did like a trick to get the redstone

406
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:02,839
I did like a trick to get the redstone
 

407
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,100
I did like a trick to get the redstone
wire on these dispensers and the game

408
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,110
wire on these dispensers and the game
 

409
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,850
wire on these dispensers and the game
will not allow you to right-click the

410
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:09,860
will not allow you to right-click the
 

411
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,769
will not allow you to right-click the
dispensers if there's wire on it it sees

412
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:11,779
dispensers if there's wire on it it sees
 

413
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,889
dispensers if there's wire on it it sees
it like like a full block so you don't

414
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:14,899
it like like a full block so you don't
 

415
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,900
it like like a full block so you don't
have line of sight through that is to

416
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:16,910
have line of sight through that is to
 

417
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,299
have line of sight through that is to
the dispenser so the only way to

418
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:19,309
the dispenser so the only way to
 

419
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:22,569
the dispenser so the only way to
actually open these or to access these

420
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:22,579
actually open these or to access these
 

421
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:26,679
actually open these or to access these
dispensers is from the sides where the

422
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:26,689
dispensers is from the sides where the
 

423
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,049
dispensers is from the sides where the
water is so I can't cover these water

424
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:29,059
water is so I can't cover these water
 

425
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,519
water is so I can't cover these water
streams otherwise I won't be able to

426
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:30,529
streams otherwise I won't be able to
 

427
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,679
streams otherwise I won't be able to
fill the dispensers that's the way that

428
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:32,689
fill the dispensers that's the way that
 

429
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:38,919
fill the dispensers that's the way that
works anyway still don't know what I'm

430
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:38,929
works anyway still don't know what I'm
 

431
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,559
works anyway still don't know what I'm
going to do here I'll definitely clean

432
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:41,569
going to do here I'll definitely clean
 

433
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,119
going to do here I'll definitely clean
up the walls I'm not sure about the

434
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,129
up the walls I'm not sure about the
 

435
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,609
up the walls I'm not sure about the
floor though it really won't match if I

436
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:45,619
floor though it really won't match if I
 

437
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:53,199
floor though it really won't match if I
do sandstone it's raining again this

438
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:53,209
do sandstone it's raining again this
 

439
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,660
do sandstone it's raining again this
wiring here I will change around a

440
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:55,670
wiring here I will change around a
 

441
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,869
wiring here I will change around a
little bit so that I get the moment I

442
00:12:58,869 --> 00:12:58,879
little bit so that I get the moment I
 

443
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,359
little bit so that I get the moment I
can't cover this without going up one

444
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:01,369
can't cover this without going up one
 

445
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:03,850
can't cover this without going up one
block so I'll probably move it out one

446
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:03,860
block so I'll probably move it out one
 

447
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:16,840
block so I'll probably move it out one
more and leg okay I think it's done I'm

448
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:16,850
more and leg okay I think it's done I'm
 

449
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,819
more and leg okay I think it's done I'm
done messing with the wiring here I

450
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:18,829
done messing with the wiring here I
 

451
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:23,379
done messing with the wiring here I
think yeah it'll have to do so works

452
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:23,389
think yeah it'll have to do so works
 

453
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,239
think yeah it'll have to do so works
exactly like I wanted it to how I

454
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:25,249
exactly like I wanted it to how I
 

455
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:29,919
exactly like I wanted it to how I
imagined I'm happy about that all this

456
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:29,929
imagined I'm happy about that all this
 

457
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:32,499
imagined I'm happy about that all this
wiring can be covered now I've changed

458
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:32,509
wiring can be covered now I've changed
 

459
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:36,960
wiring can be covered now I've changed
it around a bit so that flat ground here

460
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:36,970
it around a bit so that flat ground here
 

461
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,919
it around a bit so that flat ground here
probably could have done it a little

462
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:38,929
probably could have done it a little
 

463
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:41,379
probably could have done it a little
more efficiently somehow but I'm done

464
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:41,389
more efficiently somehow but I'm done
 

465
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,600
more efficiently somehow but I'm done
messing with it today this is the way

466
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:45,610
messing with it today this is the way
 

467
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,929
messing with it today this is the way
well these are the delays so this the

468
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:49,939
well these are the delays so this the
 

469
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:53,410
well these are the delays so this the
middle blocks are at two all the corners

470
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,420
middle blocks are at two all the corners
 

471
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,049
middle blocks are at two all the corners
are at four and then the sides are at

472
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:56,059
are at four and then the sides are at
 

473
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:59,379
are at four and then the sides are at
six that's the total delays torch delays

474
00:13:59,379 --> 00:13:59,389
six that's the total delays torch delays
 

475
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:04,230
six that's the total delays torch delays
so right below the lever is this wire

476
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
so right below the lever is this wire
 

477
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,759
so right below the lever is this wire
that's the middle one it's at two then

478
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:06,769
that's the middle one it's at two then
 

479
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:09,650
that's the middle one it's at two then
these corner ones the bottom corners are

480
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:09,660
these corner ones the bottom corners are
 

481
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,780
these corner ones the bottom corners are
four goes off to the right side here so

482
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:13,790
four goes off to the right side here so
 

483
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,900
four goes off to the right side here so
the wires at zero and four then five and

484
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:17,910
the wires at zero and four then five and
 

485
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,050
the wires at zero and four then five and
six and goes to the piston on this side

486
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,060
six and goes to the piston on this side
 

487
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,820
six and goes to the piston on this side
it's at zero here one two and there's a

488
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:28,830
it's at zero here one two and there's a
 

489
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,120
it's at zero here one two and there's a
repeater takes it to six and that's the

490
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,130
repeater takes it to six and that's the
 

491
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,640
repeater takes it to six and that's the
other side but at this point here it's

492
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:34,650
other side but at this point here it's
 

493
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,870
other side but at this point here it's
still at two and it goes up to the top

494
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:37,880
still at two and it goes up to the top
 

495
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,530
still at two and it goes up to the top
and I just did the overhang on the other

496
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:42,540
and I just did the overhang on the other
 

497
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,860
and I just did the overhang on the other
side I did try to bring it up and it

498
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:45,870
side I did try to bring it up and it
 

499
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,210
side I did try to bring it up and it
seemed like it was going to work but the

500
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,220
seemed like it was going to work but the
 

501
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,300
seemed like it was going to work but the
wire would have to be a little bit

502
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,310
wire would have to be a little bit
 

503
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,460
wire would have to be a little bit
sloppy so I just decided to simplify it

504
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,470
sloppy so I just decided to simplify it
 

505
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,700
sloppy so I just decided to simplify it
here so it goes it's a two at this point

506
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:55,710
here so it goes it's a two at this point
 

507
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,730
here so it goes it's a two at this point
then it goes this would be for this one

508
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:58,740
then it goes this would be for this one
 

509
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,000
then it goes this would be for this one
would be for wait what

510
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,010
would be for wait what
 

511
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,170
would be for wait what
yeah that's right I want these at four

512
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,180
yeah that's right I want these at four
 

513
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,530
yeah that's right I want these at four
and this would be a 2 oops

514
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:08,540
and this would be a 2 oops
 

515
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,800
and this would be a 2 oops
so that's the wiring and I I made it

516
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:12,810
so that's the wiring and I I made it
 

517
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,680
so that's the wiring and I I made it
sure that I could have a flush wall here

518
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:15,690
sure that I could have a flush wall here
 

519
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,870
sure that I could have a flush wall here
if I want so I have space to work and

520
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:19,880
if I want so I have space to work and
 

521
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,570
if I want so I have space to work and
that's the door the golden door so let

522
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:26,580
that's the door the golden door so let
 

523
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,160
that's the door the golden door so let
me know what you think of it if I should

524
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,170
me know what you think of it if I should
 

525
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,760
me know what you think of it if I should
change the block types now's the time to

526
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:31,770
change the block types now's the time to
 

527
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,000
change the block types now's the time to
say I'm not going to mess around with

528
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,010
say I'm not going to mess around with
 

529
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,010
say I'm not going to mess around with
this room today until I get your

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,020
this room today until I get your
 

531
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,950
this room today until I get your
feedback on this on these sandstone and

532
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:39,960
feedback on this on these sandstone and
 

533
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,700
feedback on this on these sandstone and
gold I don't really care too much how

534
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:43,710
gold I don't really care too much how
 

535
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,480
gold I don't really care too much how
this room looks mainly this outside is

536
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:47,490
this room looks mainly this outside is
 

537
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,370
this room looks mainly this outside is
what I'm concerned about and I don't

538
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,380
what I'm concerned about and I don't
 

539
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,830
what I'm concerned about and I don't
know if transitioning from grass to the

540
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:51,840
know if transitioning from grass to the
 

541
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,270
know if transitioning from grass to the
sandstone is good either

542
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:53,280
sandstone is good either
 

543
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,390
sandstone is good either
usually I like to do wood but it might

544
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:56,400
usually I like to do wood but it might
 

545
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,300
usually I like to do wood but it might
look a little funny if I have wood here

546
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,310
look a little funny if I have wood here
 

547
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:04,460
look a little funny if I have wood here
I could do if people don't like the gold

548
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,470
I could do if people don't like the gold
 

549
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,650
I could do if people don't like the gold
the golden door I might change it to a

550
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:06,660
the golden door I might change it to a
 

551
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,230
the golden door I might change it to a
wooden door or something I don't know

552
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
wooden door or something I don't know
 

553
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,269
wooden door or something I don't know
just ideas come check this out this is a

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:14,279
just ideas come check this out this is a
 

555

this is my spider eye collection full

556
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:16,769
this is my spider eye collection full
 

557
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:23,840

full that's I was trying to eat spider

560
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:27,899
full that's I was trying to eat spider
 

561
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,360
full that's I was trying to eat spider
eyes so that I wouldn't run out of space

562
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,370
eyes so that I wouldn't run out of space
 

563
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,049
eyes so that I wouldn't run out of space
in my dispensers and I have so just

564
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:33,059
in my dispensers and I have so just
 

565
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,059
in my dispensers and I have so just
through a chest down here and I'm

566
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:35,069
through a chest down here and I'm
 

567
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:39,129
through a chest down here and I'm
starting to fill it too

568
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:39,139

 

569
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,989

yeah I got lots of spider eyes I I'm the

570
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:41,999
yeah I got lots of spider eyes I I'm the
 

571
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,460
yeah I got lots of spider eyes I I'm the
type of person that can't throw anything

572
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:43,470
type of person that can't throw anything
 

573
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,860
type of person that can't throw anything
away even if it's garbage I just have to

574
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:45,870
away even if it's garbage I just have to
 

575
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,739
away even if it's garbage I just have to
collect it okay so we got to figure out

576
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:51,749
collect it okay so we got to figure out
 

577
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,509
collect it okay so we got to figure out
a locking mechanism for this I don't

578
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
a locking mechanism for this I don't
 

579
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
a locking mechanism for this I don't
know if I'll do it today I was kind of

580
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:55,769
know if I'll do it today I was kind of
 

581
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:01,819
know if I'll do it today I was kind of
thinking of maybe doing reads a weird

582
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:01,829
thinking of maybe doing reads a weird
 

583
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:08,779
thinking of maybe doing reads a weird
read system so maybe have a read on the

584
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:08,789
read system so maybe have a read on the
 

585
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,090
read system so maybe have a read on the
left side and a read on the right side

586
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:11,100
left side and a read on the right side
 

587
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,720
left side and a read on the right side
and at the very top have a bud switch so

588
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:14,730
and at the very top have a bud switch so
 

589
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,240
and at the very top have a bud switch so
that to open the door you would have to

590
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,250
that to open the door you would have to
 

591
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,569
that to open the door you would have to
break to the left and the right read

592
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:19,579
break to the left and the right read
 

593
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,399
break to the left and the right read
that would trigger the piston and the

594
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:22,409
that would trigger the piston and the
 

595
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,929
that would trigger the piston and the
door would open and then when the reads

596
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:23,939
door would open and then when the reads
 

597
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,600
door would open and then when the reads
regrow maybe it'll close the door I

598
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:26,610
regrow maybe it'll close the door I
 

599
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,250
regrow maybe it'll close the door I
don't know could be interesting that'd

600
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,260
don't know could be interesting that'd
 

601
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,380
don't know could be interesting that'd
be one way to make a timer for the door

602
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,390
be one way to make a timer for the door
 

603
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,680
be one way to make a timer for the door
that that's really well and all that

604
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:36,690
that that's really well and all that
 

605
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,590
that that's really well and all that
wouldn't be simple just an idea

606
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
wouldn't be simple just an idea
 

607
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,610
wouldn't be simple just an idea
something fun to do mmm

608
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:45,620
something fun to do mmm
 

609
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,440
something fun to do mmm
what should I do now

610
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,450

 

611
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,810

it's like 1:00 a.m. here so I'm trying

612
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:53,820
it's like 1:00 a.m. here so I'm trying
 

613
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,279
it's like 1:00 a.m. here so I'm trying
to decide if I should just wrap this

614
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:55,289
to decide if I should just wrap this
 

615
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,380
to decide if I should just wrap this
episode up or start working on a walk I

616
00:17:59,380 --> 00:17:59,390
episode up or start working on a walk I
 

617
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,180
episode up or start working on a walk I
feel bad I feels like I haven't done a

618
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,190
feel bad I feels like I haven't done a
 

619

too so they'll be footage of it so I'm
 

679
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,039
too so they'll be footage of it so I'm
not going to spoil it this doesn't seem

680
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,049
not going to spoil it this doesn't seem
 

681
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,760
not going to spoil it this doesn't seem
to be burning it's good let me know what

682
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,770
to be burning it's good let me know what
 

683
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,200
to be burning it's good let me know what
you think of this if I should rip it out

684
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,210
you think of this if I should rip it out
 

685
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,330
you think of this if I should rip it out
do something else I was talking about

686
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:52,340
do something else I was talking about
 

687
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,100
do something else I was talking about
doing an information board there before

688
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,110
doing an information board there before
 

689
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,250
doing an information board there before
but I don't think there's enough space

690
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:56,260
but I don't think there's enough space
 

691
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,770
but I don't think there's enough space
to include everything I'd like so you

692
00:19:59,770 --> 00:19:59,780
to include everything I'd like so you
 

693
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,820
to include everything I'd like so you
should probably build it somewhere else

694
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:00,830
should probably build it somewhere else
 

695
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,930
should probably build it somewhere else
and I anything I build here is really

696
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:04,940
and I anything I build here is really
 

697
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,630
and I anything I build here is really
going to block the view so if I have a

698
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:07,640
going to block the view so if I have a
 

699
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,930
going to block the view so if I have a
whole bunch of signs and stuff it'll get

700
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:10,940
whole bunch of signs and stuff it'll get
 

701
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,960
whole bunch of signs and stuff it'll get
really big yeah and this isn't burning

702
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:16,970
really big yeah and this isn't burning
 

703
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,020
really big yeah and this isn't burning
because it's a taking advantage of a

704
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,030
because it's a taking advantage of a
 

705
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,090
because it's a taking advantage of a
trick with fire if there's no air spaces

706
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:22,100
trick with fire if there's no air spaces
 

707
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,910
trick with fire if there's no air spaces
for

708
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:23,920
for
 

709
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,620
for
fire to spread it can't spread and so if

710
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:29,630
fire to spread it can't spread and so if
 

711
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,150
fire to spread it can't spread and so if
you have fire in the middle of something

712
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:34,160
you have fire in the middle of something
 

713
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,450
you have fire in the middle of something
it will do a three by threes you can

714
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:37,460
it will do a three by threes you can
 

715
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,490
it will do a three by threes you can
only set fire to three by three areas so

716
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:39,500
only set fire to three by three areas so
 

717
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,570
only set fire to three by three areas so
the fire here would be the middle block

718
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:42,580
the fire here would be the middle block
 

719
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,510
the fire here would be the middle block
and all these other blocks are solid so

720
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:46,520
and all these other blocks are solid so
 

721
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,400
and all these other blocks are solid so
fire can't spread to them and it can

722
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,410
fire can't spread to them and it can
 

723
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,550
fire can't spread to them and it can
spread to blocks one one block below

724
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:54,560
spread to blocks one one block below
 

725
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,290
spread to blocks one one block below
itself so these again are all solid and

726
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:58,300
itself so these again are all solid and
 

727
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,860
itself so these again are all solid and
four blocks above which is also all

728
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:02,870
four blocks above which is also all
 

729
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,530
four blocks above which is also all
solid so there's no air spaces for it to

730
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:05,540
solid so there's no air spaces for it to
 

731
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,440
solid so there's no air spaces for it to
spread to so it it won't or at least I

732
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,450
spread to so it it won't or at least I
 

733
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,130
spread to so it it won't or at least I
don't think it will

734
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,140
don't think it will
 

735
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:15,250
don't think it will
ah my teams aren't so bad here not

736
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,260
ah my teams aren't so bad here not
 

737
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,390
ah my teams aren't so bad here not
better it's better okay so if these

738
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:19,400
better it's better okay so if these
 

739
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,460
better it's better okay so if these
pressure plates or these pressure plates

740
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,470
pressure plates or these pressure plates
 

741
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,830
pressure plates or these pressure plates
weren't here this catch fire is there'd

742
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
weren't here this catch fire is there'd
 

743
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,980
weren't here this catch fire is there'd
be air spaces but seems to be okay

744
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:31,990

 

745
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,960
