range thing for the snow golems

68
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
range thing for the snow golems
 

69
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,990
range thing for the snow golems
basically these guys will be shooting at

70
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
basically these guys will be shooting at
 

71
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
basically these guys will be shooting at
the silver fish when i let them out so

72
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
the silver fish when i let them out so
 

73
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,590
the silver fish when i let them out so
that i don't uh

74
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
that i don't uh
 

75
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,749
that i don't uh
have to hit them myself these guys will

76
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
have to hit them myself these guys will
 

77
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,230
have to hit them myself these guys will
take care of it for me

78
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
take care of it for me
 

79
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,749
take care of it for me
and it works out really well because the

80
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
and it works out really well because the
 

81
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,670
and it works out really well because the
snowballs don't do any damage to them so

82
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
snowballs don't do any damage to them so
 

83
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,749
snowballs don't do any damage to them so
they can hit them all day

84
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
they can hit them all day
 

85
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,069
they can hit them all day
no problem and basically

86
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
no problem and basically
 

87
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,310
no problem and basically
it's just like uh i got half slabs

88
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
it's just like uh i got half slabs
 

89
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,630
it's just like uh i got half slabs
surrounding them

90
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
surrounding them
 

91
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,029
surrounding them
and above i just did like a little

92
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
and above i just did like a little
 

93
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,990
and above i just did like a little
pattern thing here

94
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
pattern thing here
 

95
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,710
pattern thing here
the snow block will probably get

96
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
the snow block will probably get
 

97
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,790
the snow block will probably get
replaced with the glass block

98
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
replaced with the glass block
 

99
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,229
replaced with the glass block
and then put a sticky piston above him

100
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
and then put a sticky piston above him
 

101
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,430
and then put a sticky piston above him
and that way i can control

102
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
and that way i can control
 

103
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,750
and that way i can control
when i want them shooting when i don't

104
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
when i want them shooting when i don't
 

105
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,869
when i want them shooting when i don't
because if the sticky

106
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
because if the sticky
 

107
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,030
because if the sticky
or if the glass block gets pushed down

108
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
or if the glass block gets pushed down
 

109
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,430
or if the glass block gets pushed down
into their head i don't think

110
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
into their head i don't think
 

111
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,470
into their head i don't think
they'll be able to see anymore without

112
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
they'll be able to see anymore without
 

113
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,750
they'll be able to see anymore without
taking any suffocation so i think that's

114
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
taking any suffocation so i think that's
 

115
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,030
taking any suffocation so i think that's
the way i'll do it and hopefully that

116
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
the way i'll do it and hopefully that
 

117
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,030
the way i'll do it and hopefully that
won't cause any problems with lotting

118
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
won't cause any problems with lotting
 

119
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,350
won't cause any problems with lotting
off or anything

120
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
off or anything
 

121
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,390
off or anything
and this wooden stuff is mostly just for

122
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
and this wooden stuff is mostly just for
 

123
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,750
and this wooden stuff is mostly just for
looks but

124
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
looks but
 

125
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,229
looks but
it's really important that it's a block

126
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
it's really important that it's a block
 

127
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,430
it's really important that it's a block
and a half high so the silver fish can't

128
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
and a half high so the silver fish can't
 

129
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,509
and a half high so the silver fish can't
jump and get the snow golems over here

130
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
jump and get the snow golems over here
 

131
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,030
jump and get the snow golems over here
because they only get they can only jump

132
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
because they only get they can only jump
 

133
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,670
because they only get they can only jump
one block up

134
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
one block up
 

135
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,229
one block up
so that works out pretty good and

136
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
so that works out pretty good and
 

137
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,149
so that works out pretty good and
i think i got rid of all the lava around

138
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
i think i got rid of all the lava around
 

139
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,509
i think i got rid of all the lava around
here so i

140
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
here so i
 

141
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,070
here so i
had a lot of fires while building this i

142
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
had a lot of fires while building this i
 

143
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,470
had a lot of fires while building this i
think that's taken care of now

144
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
think that's taken care of now
 

145
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,910
think that's taken care of now
this is all cobble where the lava was

146
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
this is all cobble where the lava was
 

147
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,830
this is all cobble where the lava was
and this isn't done yet this wooden

148
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
and this isn't done yet this wooden
 

149
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,390
and this isn't done yet this wooden
stuff i just

150
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
stuff i just
 

151
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,149
stuff i just
want to get this all settled the problem

152
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
want to get this all settled the problem
 

153
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,830
want to get this all settled the problem
is i believe i'm going to have to

154
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
is i believe i'm going to have to
 

155
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,390
is i believe i'm going to have to
lower everything one block

156
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
lower everything one block
 

157
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,470
lower everything one block
because when this room fills up with

158
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
because when this room fills up with
 

159
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,710
because when this room fills up with
these silverfish blocks

160
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
these silverfish blocks
 

161
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,149
these silverfish blocks
uh it's going to be right in these

162
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
uh it's going to be right in these
 

163
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,789
uh it's going to be right in these
guys's face and they won't be able to

164
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
guys's face and they won't be able to
 

165
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,110
guys's face and they won't be able to
see the silverfish

166
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
see the silverfish
 

167
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,229
see the silverfish
so gotta lower the floor gotta lower

168
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
so gotta lower the floor gotta lower
 

169
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,030
so gotta lower the floor gotta lower
this wooden stuff

170
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
this wooden stuff
 

171
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,270
this wooden stuff

can stay though

174
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
can stay though
 

175
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,550
can stay though
because i originally planned on having

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
because i originally planned on having
 

177
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,670

them shoot through like these little
 

179
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,990
them shoot through like these little
half half block gaps or whatever near

180
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
half half block gaps or whatever near
 

181
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,429
half half block gaps or whatever near
the floor

182
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
the floor
 

183
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,509
the floor
but they just don't i tried it they

184
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
but they just don't i tried it they
 

185
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,270
but they just don't i tried it they
can't really see through them

186
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
can't really see through them
 

187
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,509
can't really see through them
and even if you can get them to target a

188
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
and even if you can get them to target a
 

189
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,350
and even if you can get them to target a
silver fish they

190
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
silver fish they
 

191
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,630
silver fish they
uh almost always hit the walls

192
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
uh almost always hit the walls
 

193
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,710
uh almost always hit the walls
there's just not enough space so now i

194
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
there's just not enough space so now i
 

195
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,750
there's just not enough space so now i
got them

196
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
got them
 

197
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,710
got them
a nice open area around them so that

198
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
a nice open area around them so that
 

199
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,310
a nice open area around them so that
they can hit the silver fish

200
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
they can hit the silver fish
 

201
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,909
they can hit the silver fish
fairly fairly often

202
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
fairly fairly often
 

203
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,390
fairly fairly often
and i blocked that off there because i

204
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
and i blocked that off there because i
 

205
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,790
and i blocked that off there because i
kept being creepered

206
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
kept being creepered
 

207
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,150
kept being creepered
and now mobs just pour in there and get

208
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
and now mobs just pour in there and get
 

209
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,230
and now mobs just pour in there and get
stuck

210
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
stuck
 

211
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,790
stuck
anyway i i hate to do it but i will

212
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
anyway i i hate to do it but i will
 

213
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,070
anyway i i hate to do it but i will
lower the floor now

214
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
lower the floor now
 

215
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,749
lower the floor now
it's going to take me a little while and

216
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
it's going to take me a little while and
 

217
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,830
it's going to take me a little while and
then we will

218
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
then we will
 

219
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,710
then we will
be back and do something here

220
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720

 

221
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,550

all right so i did it i lowered the

222
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
all right so i did it i lowered the
 

223
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,710
all right so i did it i lowered the
floor on everything by one block

224
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
floor on everything by one block
 

225
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,469
floor on everything by one block
uh which took a bit of time but it's

226
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
uh which took a bit of time but it's
 

227
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,310
uh which took a bit of time but it's
very important

228
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
very important

dealt with it before i haven't seen it

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,070
dealt with it before i haven't seen it
with all them yet

253
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,990

oh i saw a silver fish appear back there

254
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
oh i saw a silver fish appear back there
 

255
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,390
oh i saw a silver fish appear back there
now i've noticed

256
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
now i've noticed
 

257
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,029
now i've noticed
stucco with each other you see that that

00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
stucco with each other you see that that
 

259
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,830
stucco with each other you see that that

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840

 

261
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,189

um oh now they're popping

262
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199

 

263
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,510

okay

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520

 

265
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,749

it's really weird how this works i

266
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
it's really weird how this works i
 

267
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,950
it's really weird how this works i
almost think it works better if i'm

268
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
almost think it works better if i'm
 

269
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,189
almost think it works better if i'm
standing next to the silverfish

00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
standing next to the silverfish

i'm not sure

00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919

 

277
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,110

i'm not like uh they only break out of

278
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
i'm not like uh they only break out of
 

279
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,749
i'm not like uh they only break out of
the blocks

280
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
the blocks
 

281
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,830
the blocks
if uh within that

282
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
if uh within that
 

283
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,830
if uh within that
i think 10 blocks of the silver fish or

284
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
i think 10 blocks of the silver fish or
 

285
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,469
i think 10 blocks of the silver fish or
it might be

286
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479

 

287
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,189

10 10 blocks of me or 10 blocks of the

288
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
10 10 blocks of me or 10 blocks of the
 

289
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:30,740
10 10 blocks of me or 10 blocks of the
snow globes i'm not sure which one it is

290
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:30,750

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,110
like when i get close to it they start
popping out

296
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120

 

297
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,510

actually they might be too low

298
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520

 

299
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,749

okay i'm gonna pause the game and check

300
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
okay i'm gonna pause the game and check
 

301
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,189
okay i'm gonna pause the game and check
what the range is

302
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
what the range is
 

303
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,830
what the range is
on these guys

304
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840

 

305
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,230

all right so i checked the wiki oh no

306
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
all right so i checked the wiki oh no
 

307
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,830
all right so i checked the wiki oh no
that one got up there

308
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840

 

309
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,390

that must have been from outside

310
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
that must have been from outside
 

311
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,469
that must have been from outside
i checked the wiki and it says they

312
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
i checked the wiki and it says they
 

313
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,070
i checked the wiki and it says they
appear

314
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
appear
 

315
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,749
appear
in that 21 by 11 by 21

316
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
in that 21 by 11 by 21
 

317
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,909
in that 21 by 11 by 21
space so that's like 10 blocks

318
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
space so that's like 10 blocks
 

319
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,830
space so that's like 10 blocks
horizontally

320
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
horizontally
 

321
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,670
horizontally
and either five blocks above or below

322
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
and either five blocks above or below
 

323
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,749
and either five blocks above or below
them

324
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
them
 

325
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,909
them
so it seems like they're chasing me

326
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
so it seems like they're chasing me
 

327
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,390
so it seems like they're chasing me
mostly

328
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
mostly
 

329
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,469

snow golems

330
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479

 

331
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,870

it's really hard to do anything here

332
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880

 

333
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,990

i missed i want to get on top of that

334
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000

 

335
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,469

dang it

336
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479

 

337
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,589

yes okay

338
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599

 

339
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,150

so now these higher ones are breaking if

340
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
so now these higher ones are breaking if
 

341
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,629
so now these higher ones are breaking if
it's

342
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
it's
 

343
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,589
it's
of the silverfish uh five blocks above

344
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
of the silverfish uh five blocks above
 

345
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,390
of the silverfish uh five blocks above
them would be

346
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
them would be
 

347
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,430
them would be
one two three four

348
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
one two three four
 

349
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,629
one two three four
five so that would be the limit now

350
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
five so that would be the limit now
 

351
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,230
five so that would be the limit now
they're breaking no

352
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
they're breaking no
 

353
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,070
they're breaking no
above that

354
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080

 

355
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,670

maybe we'll just hang out around here

356
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
maybe we'll just hang out around here
 

357
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,589
maybe we'll just hang out around here
don't let it popped off

358
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599

 

359
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,230

and see if these continue breaking could

360
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
and see if these continue breaking could
 

361
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,270
and see if these continue breaking could
be they

362
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
be they
 

363
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:35,430
be they
they break when the silverfish jump

364
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440

 

365
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,589

yeah no more really popping off so it

366
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
yeah no more really popping off so it
 

367
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,269
yeah no more really popping off so it
must be of the silverfish

368
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
must be of the silverfish
 

369
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,509
must be of the silverfish
taking damage

370
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519

 

371
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,750

all right and i think when the snow

372
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
all right and i think when the snow
 

373
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,509
all right and i think when the snow
golems shoot them they chase the snow

374
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
golems shoot them they chase the snow
 

375
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,470
golems shoot them they chase the snow
goal

00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480

 

377
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,230

for a little while and then they start

378
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
for a little while and then they start
 

379
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,590
for a little while and then they start
following me oh

380
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
following me oh
 

381
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,630
following me oh
great you see that light just went off

382
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
great you see that light just went off
 

383
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
great you see that light just went off
there must have been a silver fish under

384
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:04,730
there must have been a silver fish under
 

385
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,829

389
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,269

okay so that might be a problem we'll

390
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
okay so that might be a problem we'll
 

391
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,870
okay so that might be a problem we'll
have to deal with trying to get the rest

392
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
have to deal with trying to get the rest
 

393
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,949
have to deal with trying to get the rest
of them to break at that height

394
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959

 

395
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,870

okay i'm noticing another problem here

396
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
okay i'm noticing another problem here
 

397
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,550
okay i'm noticing another problem here
uh when the silverfish gets

398
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
uh when the silverfish gets
 

399
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,190
uh when the silverfish gets
shot and they're in the middle of a jump

400
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
shot and they're in the middle of a jump
 

401
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,949
shot and they're in the middle of a jump
they can get launched up

402
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959

 

403
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,190

above the barrier and start attacking

404
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
above the barrier and start attacking
 

405
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,030
above the barrier and start attacking
snow golems

406
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
snow golems
 

407
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,150
snow golems
which is a big problem

408
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
which is a big problem
 

409
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,470
which is a big problem
it's amazing the damage these things do

410
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
it's amazing the damage these things do
 

411
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,910
it's amazing the damage these things do
like just one silver fish will make

412
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
like just one silver fish will make
 

413
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,230
like just one silver fish will make
such a mess

414
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
such a mess
 

415
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,310
such a mess
there's a big hole over here too that

416
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
there's a big hole over here too that
 

417
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,230
there's a big hole over here too that
has appeared

418
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
has appeared
 

419
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,350
has appeared
in a very short amount of time

420
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360

 

421
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,230

and it keeps going by the looks of it oh

422
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
and it keeps going by the looks of it oh
 

423
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,269
and it keeps going by the looks of it oh
there we go

424
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279

 

425
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,310

and these guys are tougher to work with

426
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
and these guys are tougher to work with
 

427
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,310
and these guys are tougher to work with
than i thought they would be

428
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320

 

429
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,269

i have to redesign this a little bit

430
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279

 

431
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,630

let's see

432
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
let's see
 

433
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,530
let's see
what to do what to do

434
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:34,540
what to do what to do
 

435
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,230
what to do what to do

yeah there goes the snow golem

438
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920

 

439
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,949

all right well i'm going to kill all

440
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
all right well i'm going to kill all
 

441
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,310
all right well i'm going to kill all
these guys i think we're done with them

442
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
these guys i think we're done with them
 

443
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,990
these guys i think we're done with them
snow golems are doing a good job of

444
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
snow golems are doing a good job of
 

445
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,949
snow golems are doing a good job of
where they're at though they're

446
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
where they're at though they're
 

447
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,829
where they're at though they're
hitting them pretty consistently

448
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

449
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,389

um

450
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399

 

451
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,509

so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

452
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
 

453
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,509
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
run wire to all those pistons and then

454
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
run wire to all those pistons and then
 

455
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,790
run wire to all those pistons and then
they will all just

456
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
they will all just
 

457
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,910
they will all just
go down when they're powered and go up

458
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
go down when they're powered and go up
 

459
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,509
go down when they're powered and go up
when they're unpowered

460
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519

 

461
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,430

i'll probably do that pretty quick

462
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440

 

463
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,069

this spot over here where i keep hearing
 

469
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,790
this spot over here where i keep hearing
the mobs because

470
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
the mobs because
 

471
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,550
the mobs because
i haven't left this area since i started

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
i haven't left this area since i started
 

473
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,550
i haven't left this area since i started
working on it really or since i lowered

474
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
working on it really or since i lowered
 

475
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,550
working on it really or since i lowered
the floor

the floor
 

477
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,630
the floor
and more and more keep funneling there

478
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
and more and more keep funneling there
 

479
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,949
and more and more keep funneling there
and i want to see how many

480
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
and i want to see how many
 

481
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:44,150
and i want to see how many
there actually is now

482
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160

 

483
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,230

497
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,629

silverfish damage

silverfish problem this is the line of
 

511
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,750
silverfish problem this is the line of
wire i gotta run yet

for the pistons all along here oh
 

515
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,310
for the pistons all along here oh
looks like a silver fish got up here

516

517
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,629

um i don't really know how to fix that

um i don't really know how to fix that
 

519
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,710
um i don't really know how to fix that
though because if they get much higher

520
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
though because if they get much higher
 

521
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,509
though because if they get much higher
they won't be able

522
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519

 

523
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,629

to really hit them

524
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639

 

525
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,230

and i'll have to lower everything again

526
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
and i'll have to lower everything again
 

527
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,829
and i'll have to lower everything again
that's going to be annoying if i do

528
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839
that's going to be annoying if i do
 

529
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,310
that's going to be annoying if i do
changes

530
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320

 

531
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,990

okay so i thought about this for a

532
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
okay so i thought about this for a
 

533
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,750
okay so i thought about this for a
little bit and i think we can make it

534
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
little bit and i think we can make it
 

535
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,190
little bit and i think we can make it
work still

536
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
work still
 

537
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,750
work still
i believe if i'm not down there the

538
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
i believe if i'm not down there the
 

539
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,350
i believe if i'm not down there the
silverfish won't jump

540
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
silverfish won't jump
 

541
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,829
silverfish won't jump
that's what we want to test out here

542
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839

 

543
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,670

so we'll see if we can spot

544
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680

 

545
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,310

the silverfish jumping

546
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
the silverfish jumping
 

547
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,430
the silverfish jumping
maybe we'll just branch out here

548
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
maybe we'll just branch out here
 

549
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,949
maybe we'll just branch out here
get a better view

550
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959

 

551
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,310

um what i'll probably do

552
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
um what i'll probably do
 

553
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,790
um what i'll probably do
is put a layer of glass above above

554
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
is put a layer of glass above above
 

555
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,670
is put a layer of glass above above
these

556
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
these
 

557
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,670
these
pistons here at that level like at this

558
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
pistons here at that level like at this
 

559
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,829
pistons here at that level like at this
level here

560
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
level here
 

561
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,269
level here
and cover this whole room with it

562
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
and cover this whole room with it
 

563
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,670
and cover this whole room with it
so then i can walk above here and

564
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
so then i can walk above here and
 

565
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,470
so then i can walk above here and
observe from above

566
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480

 

567
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,150

i'm pretty sure they won't be able to

568
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
i'm pretty sure they won't be able to
 

569
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,670
i'm pretty sure they won't be able to
get up to the snowball

570
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
get up to the snowball
 

571
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,509
get up to the snowball
unless i'm down there oh oh he's jumping

572
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
unless i'm down there oh oh he's jumping
 

573
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,230
unless i'm down there oh oh he's jumping
he's jumping

574
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240

 

575
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,990

it's hard to say they lose their

576
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
it's hard to say they lose their
 

577
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,509
it's hard to say they lose their
attention really quick when the snow

578
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
attention really quick when the snow
 

579
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,150
attention really quick when the snow
golems hit them

580
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160

 

581
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,829

that guy got ticked off he's going for

582
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
that guy got ticked off he's going for
 

583
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,670
that guy got ticked off he's going for
him he's going for him

584
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
him he's going for him
 

585
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,829
him he's going for him
oh

586
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839

 

587
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,350

um

588
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360

 

589
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,269

it's hard to say so the snow golems

590
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
it's hard to say so the snow golems
 

591
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,550
it's hard to say so the snow golems
could take care of the bottom

592
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
could take care of the bottom
 

593
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,269
could take care of the bottom
four layers for me and a little bit of

594
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
four layers for me and a little bit of
 

595
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,790
four layers for me and a little bit of
the fifth one even

596
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
the fifth one even
 

597
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,550
the fifth one even
and then i think i should set up another

598
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
and then i think i should set up another
 

599
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,710
and then i think i should set up another
room up above here to hit the

600
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
room up above here to hit the
 

601
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,949
room up above here to hit the
the silverfish as well to take care of

602
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
the silverfish as well to take care of
 

603
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,990
the silverfish as well to take care of
the top layer

604
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
the top layer
 

605
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,389
the top layer
or top two layers

606
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399

 

607
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,829

setup now we should check it out
see if they still attack while

636

see if they still attack while
 

637
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,110
see if they still attack while
being inside the glass but basically

638
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120

okay so that's a good shut off for them
 

669
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,829
okay so that's a good shut off for them
very simple uh

it's crazy uh yeah i'm kind of on the

694
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
it's crazy uh yeah i'm kind of on the
 

695
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,470
it's crazy uh yeah i'm kind of on the
boundary of

696
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
boundary of
 

697
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,590
boundary of
more over there my discovered world

698
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600

 

699
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,909

i've only found wolves once in my lp

700
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
i've only found wolves once in my lp
 

701
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,110
i've only found wolves once in my lp
world so far

702
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
world so far
 

703
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,189
world so far
and i don't remember where it was i

704
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
and i don't remember where it was i
 

705
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,350
and i don't remember where it was i
don't think they despawn anymore from

706
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360
don't think they despawn anymore from
 

707
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,150
don't think they despawn anymore from
what i can tell

708
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160

 

709
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,990

so if i could find that spot again i

710
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
so if i could find that spot again i
 

711
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,750
so if i could find that spot again i
could get some otherwise i gotta

712
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
could get some otherwise i gotta
 

713
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,310
could get some otherwise i gotta
probably generate new world here

714
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320

 

715
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,710

so i finally stumbled across a wolf pack

716
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
so i finally stumbled across a wolf pack
 

717
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,590
so i finally stumbled across a wolf pack
here

718
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
here
 

719
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,070
here
um oh

720
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
um oh
 

721
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,230
um oh
that was bad i was wondering if you can

722
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
that was bad i was wondering if you can
 

723
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,110
that was bad i was wondering if you can
breed them while they're still wild

724
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120

 

725
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,750

breed

726
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760

 

727
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,270

doesn't look like it

728
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280

 

729
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,110

730
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120

they don't do good against spiders they
 

747
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,430
they don't do good against spiders they
never do

never do
 

749
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,630
never do
spiders have too big of a

750
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
spiders have too big of a
 

751
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,150
spiders have too big of a
collision box

752
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160

 

753
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,909

okay so i'm gonna take these guys back

754
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
okay so i'm gonna take these guys back
 

755
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,390
okay so i'm gonna take these guys back
to my skeleton trap

756
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
to my skeleton trap
 

757
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,590
to my skeleton trap
and we're gonna check a few things

758
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600

 

759
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,510

and then uh i'll see you in a bit here

760
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520

 

761
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,990

all right here we are at the skeleton

762
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
all right here we are at the skeleton
 

763
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,950
all right here we are at the skeleton
farm with

764
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
farm with
 

765
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,950
farm with
our wolves and we even have a baby wolf

766
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
our wolves and we even have a baby wolf
 

767
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,070
our wolves and we even have a baby wolf
now with a

768
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
now with a
 

769
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,950
now with a
giant freak head um

770
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
giant freak head um
 

771
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,310
giant freak head um
i was thinking you could make an

772
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
i was thinking you could make an
 

773
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,150
i was thinking you could make an
automatic xp farm with them

774
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
automatic xp farm with them
 

775
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,470
automatic xp farm with them
but they don't seem to be going after

776
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
but they don't seem to be going after
 

777
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,789
but they don't seem to be going after
the skellies

778
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
the skellies
 

779
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,310
the skellies
so i'm guessing the skellies actually

780
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
so i'm guessing the skellies actually
 

781
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,070
so i'm guessing the skellies actually
have to hit me for them to

782
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
have to hit me for them to
 

783
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,070
have to hit me for them to
to attack the skeletons

784
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080

 

785
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,830

or else they have to be shooting i don't

786
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
or else they have to be shooting i don't
 

787
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,950
or else they have to be shooting i don't
know

788
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960

 

789
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,549

let's see how can we do this

790
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559

 

791
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,190

i don't want to lose all my wolves um

792
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200

 

793
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,710

yeah they're gonna kill each other

794
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
yeah they're gonna kill each other
 

795
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:01,270
yeah they're gonna kill each other
though

796
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280

 

797
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:11,909

there's got to be a way of doing this

798
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919

 

799
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,750

no they don't attack when they're

800
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
no they don't attack when they're
 

801
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,430
no they don't attack when they're
shooting either

802
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440

 

803
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,110

i was walking through the forest at

804
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
i was walking through the forest at
 

805
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,110
i was walking through the forest at
night and they were attacking mobs

806
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
night and they were attacking mobs
 

807
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:29,590
night and they were attacking mobs
all over the place

808
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600

 

809
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:38,549

that'll do it

810
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559

 

811
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,270

hmm they only attack the ones that hit

812
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
hmm they only attack the ones that hit
 

813
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,230
hmm they only attack the ones that hit
me though

814
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240

 

815
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,990

okay well yeah this probably won't work

816
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
okay well yeah this probably won't work
 

817
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,390
okay well yeah this probably won't work
it's just an idea

818
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400

 

819
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,669

actually there's one more thing i wanted

820
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
actually there's one more thing i wanted
 

821
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,950
actually there's one more thing i wanted
to check too uh

822
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
to check too uh
 

823
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,350
to check too uh
get xp from mobs that the wolves kill

824
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
get xp from mobs that the wolves kill
 

825
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,870
get xp from mobs that the wolves kill
i'm wondering if you also get the rare

826
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
i'm wondering if you also get the rare
 

827
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,470
i'm wondering if you also get the rare
drops like the bose

828
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
drops like the bose
 

829
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,750
drops like the bose
from skeletons so i'm gonna stay here

830
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
from skeletons so i'm gonna stay here
 

831
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,190
from skeletons so i'm gonna stay here
for a little while with the wolves and

832
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
for a little while with the wolves and
 

833
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,750
for a little while with the wolves and
see if we can get

834
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
see if we can get
 

835
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,149
see if we can get
a bow drop from the from the wolves

836
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
a bow drop from the from the wolves
 

837
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:26,230
a bow drop from the from the wolves
killing the skeletons

838
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240

 

839
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,750

oh it does work amazing

840
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
oh it does work amazing
 

841
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,830
oh it does work amazing
yeah so the only real way of doing the

842
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
yeah so the only real way of doing the
 

843
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,950
yeah so the only real way of doing the
automatic xp

844
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
automatic xp
 

845
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,149
automatic xp
thing is if you let the mobs attack you

846
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
thing is if you let the mobs attack you
 

847
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,029
thing is if you let the mobs attack you
first

848
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
first
 

849
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,350
first
then the wolves will do their job

850
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
then the wolves will do their job
 

851
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,789
then the wolves will do their job
which is too bad uh it's possible but

852
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
which is too bad uh it's possible but
 

853
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,750
which is too bad uh it's possible but
not very practical

854
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760

 

855
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,430

all right well we figured out a few new

856
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
all right well we figured out a few new
 

857
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,310
all right well we figured out a few new
things today um

858
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
things today um
 

859
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,669
things today um
this project is going to be pretty cool

860
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
this project is going to be pretty cool
 

861
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,710
this project is going to be pretty cool

the way we're going to get the

864
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
the way we're going to get the
 

865
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,230
the way we're going to get the
silverfish out of here is uh over there

866
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
silverfish out of here is uh over there
 

867
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,870
silverfish out of here is uh over there
