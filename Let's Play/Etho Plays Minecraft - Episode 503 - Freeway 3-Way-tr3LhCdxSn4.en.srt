00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:13,570
of testing it it failed usually when it
fails it should keep going though I

164
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:13,580
fails it should keep going though I
 

165
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,120
fails it should keep going though I
wonder I might need to make some

166
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,130
wonder I might need to make some
 

167
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,140
wonder I might need to make some
modifications that one did it too

168
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,150

 

169
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,520

there is a way to make this go a bit

170
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:28,530
there is a way to make this go a bit
 

171
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,909
there is a way to make this go a bit
longer if we just put a block here then

172
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
longer if we just put a block here then
 

173
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,860
longer if we just put a block here then
this delay signal is gonna last longer

174
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:33,870
this delay signal is gonna last longer
 

175
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,900
this delay signal is gonna last longer
and it'll shoot more bonemeal so

176
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:35,910
and it'll shoot more bonemeal so
 

177
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,820
and it'll shoot more bonemeal so
hopefully that little change will make a

178
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:37,830
hopefully that little change will make a
 

179
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,490
hopefully that little change will make a
fix make the fix here I don't know we'll

180
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:43,500
fix make the fix here I don't know we'll
 

181
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,610
fix make the fix here I don't know we'll
try that out I got the burps one second

182
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:45,620
try that out I got the burps one second
 

183
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,840
try that out I got the burps one second
okay let's try this again with the

184
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:47,850
okay let's try this again with the
 

185
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,600
okay let's try this again with the
changes I also moved those tree Stoppers

186
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:50,610
changes I also moved those tree Stoppers
 

187
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,430
changes I also moved those tree Stoppers
up two blocks because we got one jungle

188
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,440
up two blocks because we got one jungle
 

189
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,870
up two blocks because we got one jungle
tree that was only four blocks tall

190
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:53,880
tree that was only four blocks tall
 

191
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,550
tree that was only four blocks tall
there we kind of want them around the

192
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
there we kind of want them around the
 

193
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,420
there we kind of want them around the
seven or eight range and having them

194
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,430
seven or eight range and having them
 

195
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,040
seven or eight range and having them
lower makes it less likely the trees

196
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,050
lower makes it less likely the trees
 

197
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:07,270
lower makes it less likely the trees
gonna grow here with with the bonemeal

198
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280

 

199
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,260

this is like the perfect height that's

200
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,270
this is like the perfect height that's
 

201
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,120
this is like the perfect height that's
what I want

202
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,130
what I want
 

203
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,800
what I want
let's try again it's not failing now

204
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:12,810
let's try again it's not failing now
 

205
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,610
let's try again it's not failing now
that's good last one all right those are

206
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:19,620
that's good last one all right those are
 

207
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,470
that's good last one all right those are
all pretty much the right height I think

208
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:21,480
all pretty much the right height I think
 

209
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,590
all pretty much the right height I think
right let's try top it down I can't

210
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,600
right let's try top it down I can't
 

211
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,140
right let's try top it down I can't
reach that one unless I hop up okay it's

212
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,150
reach that one unless I hop up okay it's
 

213
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,080
reach that one unless I hop up okay it's
one block too tall maybe we lowered

214
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,090
one block too tall maybe we lowered
 

215
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,430
one block too tall maybe we lowered
these by one block so there's gonna be

216
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
these by one block so there's gonna be
 

217
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,860
these by one block so there's gonna be
nine air spaces between the sapling down

218
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:33,870
nine air spaces between the sapling down
 

219
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,870
nine air spaces between the sapling down
there and then the tree stopper here I

220
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
there and then the tree stopper here I
 

221
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,969
there and then the tree stopper here I
think that'll be perfect for this tree

222
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:37,979
think that'll be perfect for this tree
 

223
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,760
think that'll be perfect for this tree
farm and I was just trying something

224
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:40,770
farm and I was just trying something
 

225
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,920
farm and I was just trying something
here I saw an interesting idea on the

226
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:42,930
here I saw an interesting idea on the
 

227
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,270
here I saw an interesting idea on the
Minecraft right I thought I'd share it

228
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,280
Minecraft right I thought I'd share it
 

229
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,540
Minecraft right I thought I'd share it
with you guys if you didn't see it

230
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,550
with you guys if you didn't see it
 

231
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,800
with you guys if you didn't see it
somebody had the idea of making a

232
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:48,810
somebody had the idea of making a
 

233
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,750
somebody had the idea of making a
sapling farm not a tree farm

234
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:50,760
sapling farm not a tree farm
 

235
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,450
sapling farm not a tree farm
specifically a farm for farming saplings

236
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:53,460
specifically a farm for farming saplings
 

237
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,430
specifically a farm for farming saplings
and the way that it works is you set up

238
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,440
and the way that it works is you set up
 

239
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,219
and the way that it works is you set up
a column of dirt like this basically

240
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:00,229
a column of dirt like this basically
 

241
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:04,130
a column of dirt like this basically
trees can grow they'll ignore like air

242
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,140
trees can grow they'll ignore like air
 

243
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,469
trees can grow they'll ignore like air
spaces they ignore dirt blocks and wood

244
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
spaces they ignore dirt blocks and wood
 

245
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,750
spaces they ignore dirt blocks and wood
blocks if for example there was a piece

246
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:08,760
blocks if for example there was a piece
 

247
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,310
blocks if for example there was a piece
of stone here this tree would not be

248
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,320
of stone here this tree would not be
 

249
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,219
of stone here this tree would not be
able to grow but since it ignores dirt

250
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:13,229
able to grow but since it ignores dirt
 

251
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:16,490
able to grow but since it ignores dirt
blocks it will naturally grow or with

252
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,500
blocks it will naturally grow or with
 

253
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,130
blocks it will naturally grow or with
bone meal here and none of the dirt

254
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,140
bone meal here and none of the dirt
 

255
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,290
bone meal here and none of the dirt
blocks get replaced with wood so these

256
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:21,300
blocks get replaced with wood so these
 

257
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,779
blocks get replaced with wood so these
leaves have nothing to attach to and

258
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:23,789
leaves have nothing to attach to and
 

259
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,820
leaves have nothing to attach to and
they'll just be spawn and then you catch

260
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:25,830
they'll just be spawn and then you catch
 

261
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,159
they'll just be spawn and then you catch
the saplings that fall so that's kind of

262
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:28,169
the saplings that fall so that's kind of
 

263
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,390
the saplings that fall so that's kind of
a cool idea you don't have to chop down

264
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:29,400
a cool idea you don't have to chop down
 

265
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,730
a cool idea you don't have to chop down
the tree that way

266
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:30,740
the tree that way
 

267
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,070
the tree that way
one thing I I've noticed here like that

268
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
one thing I I've noticed here like that
 

269
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,540
one thing I I've noticed here like that
is this testing it to see how it works

270
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:35,550
is this testing it to see how it works
 

271
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,390
is this testing it to see how it works
and the leaves don't seem to de-spawn

272
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
and the leaves don't seem to de-spawn
 

273
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,980
and the leaves don't seem to de-spawn
after it grows here even though they

274
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:42,990
after it grows here even though they
 

275
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,710
after it grows here even though they
should until they receive some sort of

276
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,720
should until they receive some sort of
 

277
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,490
should until they receive some sort of
updates so you see nothing is the

278
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:49,500
updates so you see nothing is the
 

279
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,990
updates so you see nothing is the
spawning and I think is the spawning if

280
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,000
spawning and I think is the spawning if
 

281
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,820
spawning and I think is the spawning if
we break the wood block down here it

282
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:52,830
we break the wood block down here it
 

283
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,490
we break the wood block down here it
seems to trigger them up here you see

284
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:55,500
seems to trigger them up here you see
 

285
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,490
seems to trigger them up here you see
now that now they're going that's

286
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,500
now that now they're going that's
 

287
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,950
now that now they're going that's
interesting so if we were to make a farm

288
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
interesting so if we were to make a farm
 

289
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,800
interesting so if we were to make a farm
like this I I think you would want some

290
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:03,810
like this I I think you would want some
 

291
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,180
like this I I think you would want some
way of removing this wood block here

292
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,190
way of removing this wood block here
 

293
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,190
way of removing this wood block here
either you burn it or push it away with

294
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,200
either you burn it or push it away with
 

295
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,430
either you burn it or push it away with
pistons and maybe some way of collecting

296
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,440
pistons and maybe some way of collecting
 

297
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,230
pistons and maybe some way of collecting
the saplings when they fall might be a

298
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
the saplings when they fall might be a
 

299
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,180
the saplings when they fall might be a
fun idea to try out in the future here

300
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,190
fun idea to try out in the future here
 

301
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,770
fun idea to try out in the future here
but I thought it was pretty interesting

302
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:18,780
but I thought it was pretty interesting
 

303
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,140
but I thought it was pretty interesting
anyways around the base here what else

304
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,150
anyways around the base here what else
 

305
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,360
anyways around the base here what else
did we do I tried putting some orange

306
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,370
did we do I tried putting some orange
 

307
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,279
did we do I tried putting some orange
clay down there just for some color I

308
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:25,289
clay down there just for some color I
 

309
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:27,589
clay down there just for some color I
like the color but I don't like how that

310
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
like the color but I don't like how that
 

311
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:27,980
like the color but I don't like how that
looks

312
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:27,990
looks
 

313
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,770
looks
need to change that figure out something

314
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:30,780
need to change that figure out something
 

315
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,770
need to change that figure out something
else and I added a couple new slabs over

316
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:33,780
else and I added a couple new slabs over
 

317
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,220
else and I added a couple new slabs over
there

318
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,230
there
 

319
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,660
there
we'll probably build a bridge between

320
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:35,670
we'll probably build a bridge between
 

321
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,960
we'll probably build a bridge between
here and there and the main thing is I

322
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:38,970
here and there and the main thing is I
 

323
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,930
here and there and the main thing is I
tried detailing this overhang area again

324
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
tried detailing this overhang area again
 

325
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,150
tried detailing this overhang area again
I'm not really sure how to do that I

326
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm not really sure how to do that I
 

327
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,610
I'm not really sure how to do that I
don't know if this looks good I think

328
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:49,620
don't know if this looks good I think
 

329
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,300
don't know if this looks good I think
it's okay we made like some pipes there

330
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,310
it's okay we made like some pipes there
 

331
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,100
it's okay we made like some pipes there
that stick out and some planters on that

332
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,110
that stick out and some planters on that
 

333
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,470
that stick out and some planters on that
side from the top here though I like how

334
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:57,480
side from the top here though I like how
 

335
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,420
side from the top here though I like how
it looks from the top and we turned it

336
00:07:59,420 --> 00:07:59,430
it looks from the top and we turned it
 

337
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,130
it looks from the top and we turned it
into like a pond or whatever Andy that's

338
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,140
into like a pond or whatever Andy that's
 

339
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,040
into like a pond or whatever Andy that's
cool I like that but the stuff on the

340
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,050
cool I like that but the stuff on the
 

341
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,370
cool I like that but the stuff on the
side I'm not really sure yet and well I

342
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:10,380
side I'm not really sure yet and well I
 

343
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,970
side I'm not really sure yet and well I
put some leaves over here I had the

344
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:13,980
put some leaves over here I had the
 

345
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,680
put some leaves over here I had the
leaves originally like hanging down from

346
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:15,690
leaves originally like hanging down from
 

347
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,900
leaves originally like hanging down from
the very top there all the way down it

348
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:17,910
the very top there all the way down it
 

349
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,520
the very top there all the way down it
looked really weird though so I tried to

350
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,530
looked really weird though so I tried to
 

351
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:19,970
looked really weird though so I tried to
it

352
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:19,980
it
 

353
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,380
it
make it look like they're growing into

354
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,390
make it look like they're growing into
 

355
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,980
make it look like they're growing into
the side of this piece of stone or

356
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:24,990
the side of this piece of stone or
 

357
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,560
the side of this piece of stone or
whatever I don't know whatever still I

358
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,570
whatever I don't know whatever still I
 

359
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,720
whatever I don't know whatever still I
don't know if I should focus so much on

360
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:32,730
don't know if I should focus so much on
 

361
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,040
don't know if I should focus so much on
detailing things or if we should just

362
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,050
detailing things or if we should just
 

363
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,240
detailing things or if we should just
focus on expanding the base first what I

364
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,250
focus on expanding the base first what I
 

365
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,370
focus on expanding the base first what I
would like to do to begin with here is

366
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,380
would like to do to begin with here is
 

367
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,610
would like to do to begin with here is
set up a beacon somewhere so I'm gonna

368
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:43,620
set up a beacon somewhere so I'm gonna
 

369
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,970
set up a beacon somewhere so I'm gonna
put it on top of a building over here

370
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:45,980
put it on top of a building over here
 

371
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,040
put it on top of a building over here
and I brought the stuff for the beacon I

372
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,050
and I brought the stuff for the beacon I
 

373
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,500
and I brought the stuff for the beacon I
think we'll make this pop out one slab

374
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,510
think we'll make this pop out one slab
 

375
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:59,570
think we'll make this pop out one slab
so five six seven I always got to figure

376
00:08:59,570 --> 00:08:59,580
so five six seven I always got to figure
 

377
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,070
so five six seven I always got to figure
it out I think we need one more this is

378
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,080
it out I think we need one more this is
 

379
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,910
it out I think we need one more this is
where the border would be right so

380
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
where the border would be right so
 

381
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,880
where the border would be right so
that'll come out and then let's probably

382
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:07,890
that'll come out and then let's probably
 

383
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,430
that'll come out and then let's probably
go over two slabs this way and make like

384
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,440
go over two slabs this way and make like
 

385
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:18,710
go over two slabs this way and make like
a 2x2 area very good so we got ourselves

386
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
a 2x2 area very good so we got ourselves
 

387
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,750
a 2x2 area very good so we got ourselves
a bit of a structure here nothing too

388
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:20,760
a bit of a structure here nothing too
 

389
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,180
a bit of a structure here nothing too
fancy it's just like a shell of a

390
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,190
fancy it's just like a shell of a
 

391
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,130
fancy it's just like a shell of a
building right now put the beacon on the

392
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,140
building right now put the beacon on the
 

393
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,290
building right now put the beacon on the
top there with haste - so we can dig

394
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
top there with haste - so we can dig
 

395
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,350
top there with haste - so we can dig
fast now around around the area and as

396
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
fast now around around the area and as
 

397
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,180
fast now around around the area and as
you can see I tried to stagger the tiles

398
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,190
you can see I tried to stagger the tiles
 

399
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,870
you can see I tried to stagger the tiles
as much as possible not like everything

400
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
as much as possible not like everything
 

401
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,910
as much as possible not like everything
square and at the same level I think

402
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
square and at the same level I think
 

403
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,020
square and at the same level I think
it's going to look better in the end of

404
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,030
it's going to look better in the end of
 

405
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,270
it's going to look better in the end of
things if we do that so I lowered it

406
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,280
things if we do that so I lowered it
 

407
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,600
things if we do that so I lowered it
here

408
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,610
here
 

409
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,340
here
for example would have been easier just

410
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,350
for example would have been easier just
 

411
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,990
for example would have been easier just
to keep it at that level but I dropped

412
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,000
to keep it at that level but I dropped
 

413
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,340
to keep it at that level but I dropped
it down and raised it up here possibly

414
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,350
it down and raised it up here possibly
 

415
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,690
it down and raised it up here possibly
will move this beacon down below and do

416
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:53,700
will move this beacon down below and do
 

417
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,540
will move this beacon down below and do
something fun with color-changing to try

418
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:56,550
something fun with color-changing to try
 

419
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,509
something fun with color-changing to try
to give information of some sorts but I

420
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
to give information of some sorts but I
 

421
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,699
to give information of some sorts but I
don't know what's what yet like you can

422
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:04,709
don't know what's what yet like you can
 

423
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,889
don't know what's what yet like you can
use beacons to send information visually

424
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:06,899
use beacons to send information visually
 

425
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,500
use beacons to send information visually
right but what what would they signal I

426
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,510
right but what what would they signal I
 

427
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,920
right but what what would they signal I
don't know maybe in the future if I

428
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:12,930
don't know maybe in the future if I
 

429
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,060
don't know maybe in the future if I
figure it out we'll move it though

430
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,070
figure it out we'll move it though
 

431
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,920
figure it out we'll move it though
that's what I'm trying to say

432
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:15,930
that's what I'm trying to say
 

433
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,740
that's what I'm trying to say
if not we'll try to look or try to make

434
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:18,750
if not we'll try to look or try to make
 

435
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,930
if not we'll try to look or try to make
it look like it's being held in place

436
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:20,940
it look like it's being held in place
 

437
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,009
it look like it's being held in place
here I guess with stairs and stuff does

438
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:25,019
here I guess with stairs and stuff does
 

439
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,250
here I guess with stairs and stuff does
this look like kind of goofy needs lots

440
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,260
this look like kind of goofy needs lots
 

441
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:36,110
this look like kind of goofy needs lots
of detailing probably I don't know we

442
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,120
of detailing probably I don't know we
 

443
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,490
of detailing probably I don't know we
might be able to make it look cool if we

444
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:37,500
might be able to make it look cool if we
 

445
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,920
might be able to make it look cool if we
keep it there on top of here we'll

446
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:39,930
keep it there on top of here we'll
 

447
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,069
keep it there on top of here we'll
probably put some trees and some Park

448
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:43,079
probably put some trees and some Park
 

449
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,800
probably put some trees and some Park
Park dish area saying what's over here

450
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:44,810
Park dish area saying what's over here
 

451
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,579
Park dish area saying what's over here
try to make it feel like we're in a bit

452
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:49,589
try to make it feel like we're in a bit
 

453
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,250
try to make it feel like we're in a bit
of a forest area to not just open like

454
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:52,260
of a forest area to not just open like
 

455
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,980
of a forest area to not just open like
it is right now above there maybe a

456
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:54,990
it is right now above there maybe a
 

457
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,560
it is right now above there maybe a
skylight and this is what it looks like

458
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,570
skylight and this is what it looks like
 

459
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,870
skylight and this is what it looks like
on the inside here so I want to talk to

460
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
on the inside here so I want to talk to
 

461
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,460
on the inside here so I want to talk to
you guys about something with our build

462
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:01,470
you guys about something with our build
 

463
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,439
you guys about something with our build
with our city here I definitely want to

with our city here I definitely want to
do a minecart track and probably like

466
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:05,790
do a minecart track and probably like
 

467
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,610
do a minecart track and probably like
boat stuff again I want to get back into

468
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:07,620
boat stuff again I want to get back into
 

469
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,210
boat stuff again I want to get back into
the boat both things cuz in 1.13 boat

470
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,220

471
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,280
the boat both things cuz in 1.13 boat
elevators are gonna be back it seems and

472
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,290
elevators are gonna be back it seems and
 

473
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,009
elevators are gonna be back it seems and
also like water ladders and and that

474
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,019
also like water ladders and and that
 

475
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,300
also like water ladders and and that
sort of thing it's it's gonna be much

476
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,310
sort of thing it's it's gonna be much
 

477
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,980
sort of thing it's it's gonna be much
like it was in the past so I think we're

478
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:18,990
like it was in the past so I think we're
 

479
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,650
like it was in the past so I think we're
gonna have fun with that but if you're

480
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:21,660
gonna have fun with that but if you're
 

481
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,889
gonna have fun with that but if you're
doing like a minecart system and a boat

482
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:24,899
doing like a minecart system and a boat
 

483
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,810
doing like a minecart system and a boat
system you gotta do it early with your

484
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:26,820
system you gotta do it early with your
 

485
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,699
system you gotta do it early with your
base building you don't build your base

486
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:28,709
base building you don't build your base
 

487
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,199
base building you don't build your base
and add them later that usually doesn't

488
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:30,209
and add them later that usually doesn't
 

489
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:33,079
and add them later that usually doesn't
work out so good so the question is guys

490
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:33,089
work out so good so the question is guys
 

491
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:35,090
work out so good so the question is guys
what kind of minecart system should we

492
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,100
what kind of minecart system should we
 

493
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,790
what kind of minecart system should we
build at our new base here like a point

494
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:37,800
build at our new base here like a point
 

495
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,280
build at our new base here like a point
A to point B system or a selection panel

496
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,290
A to point B system or a selection panel
 

497
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,350
A to point B system or a selection panel
you remember a while ago we looked into

498
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,360
you remember a while ago we looked into
 

499
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,939
you remember a while ago we looked into
the idea of doing a ticketing system

500
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:43,949
the idea of doing a ticketing system
 

501
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:47,060
the idea of doing a ticketing system
like like you do in rail crafts and we

502
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,070
like like you do in rail crafts and we
 

503
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,650
like like you do in rail crafts and we
still haven't really put that to use

504
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:48,660
still haven't really put that to use
 

505
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,230
still haven't really put that to use
anywhere so I thought might might use it

506
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,240
anywhere so I thought might might use it
 

507
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,910
anywhere so I thought might might use it
at this base but I think it'll take up

508
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:52,920
at this base but I think it'll take up
 

509
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,100
at this base but I think it'll take up
too much space or

510
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,110
too much space or
 

511
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,259
too much space or
too complicated so I want something a

512
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:57,269
too complicated so I want something a
 

513
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:59,780
too complicated so I want something a
bit more simple and I had the idea like

514
00:11:59,780 --> 00:11:59,790
bit more simple and I had the idea like
 

515
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,350
bit more simple and I had the idea like
can we design a minecart system that you

516
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
can we design a minecart system that you
 

517
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,949
can we design a minecart system that you
drive like if you hold forward and a

518
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
drive like if you hold forward and a
 

519
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,380
drive like if you hold forward and a
minecart you move now all right so is

520
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,390
minecart you move now all right so is
 

521
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,800
minecart you move now all right so is
there a way to do an intersection where

522
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:12,810
there a way to do an intersection where
 

523
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,210
there a way to do an intersection where
if you hold forward you go straight

524
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,220
if you hold forward you go straight
 

525
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,490
if you hold forward you go straight
through but if you don't hold forward

526
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,500
through but if you don't hold forward
 

527
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,310
through but if you don't hold forward
you take the turn is is basically all we

528
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,320
you take the turn is is basically all we
 

529
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,829
you take the turn is is basically all we
want need to figure out with this so I

530
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
want need to figure out with this so I
 

531
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,389
want need to figure out with this so I
just set up a little test here with the

532
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:23,399
just set up a little test here with the
 

533
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,740
just set up a little test here with the
detector rail hop in hold forward the

534
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:27,750
detector rail hop in hold forward the
 

535
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,380
detector rail hop in hold forward the
whole way through we go forward through

536
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,390
whole way through we go forward through
 

537
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,340
whole way through we go forward through
good and ideally if we don't hold

538
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,350
good and ideally if we don't hold
 

539
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,470
good and ideally if we don't hold
forward we take a turn here we still go

540
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,480
forward we take a turn here we still go
 

541
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,170
forward we take a turn here we still go
through so what we got to find is the

542
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,180
through so what we got to find is the
 

543
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,050
through so what we got to find is the
exact sweet spot where that'll happen

544
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,060
exact sweet spot where that'll happen
 

545
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,210
exact sweet spot where that'll happen
it's because it's such a subtle change

546
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:47,220
it's because it's such a subtle change
 

547
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,860
it's because it's such a subtle change
between holding forward and not I don't

548
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:48,870
between holding forward and not I don't
 

549
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,889
between holding forward and not I don't
know if we will be able to actually do

550
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:51,899
know if we will be able to actually do
 

551
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:52,840
know if we will be able to actually do
it

552
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:52,850
it
 

553
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,690
it
so if we move this back one we'll just

554
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:56,700
so if we move this back one we'll just
 

555
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,310
so if we move this back one we'll just
try a few things here and see if we can

556
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
try a few things here and see if we can
 

557
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,139
try a few things here and see if we can
figure it out move this back and now

558
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:03,149
figure it out move this back and now
 

559
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,090
figure it out move this back and now
let's try hold forward

560
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,100
let's try hold forward
 

561
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,620
let's try hold forward
we went through goods if we don't hold

562
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,630
we went through goods if we don't hold
 

563
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:17,810
we went through goods if we don't hold
forward hopefully we don't go through

564
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:17,820

 

565
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,350

wait

566
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
wait
 

567
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:28,050
wait
did it actually work Oh Kate a second do

568
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,060
did it actually work Oh Kate a second do
 

569
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,310
did it actually work Oh Kate a second do
we go through the first time I got to

570
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,320
we go through the first time I got to
 

571
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,450
we go through the first time I got to
watch a video back I thought we went

572
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:30,460
watch a video back I thought we went
 

573
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,120
watch a video back I thought we went
through the first time okay so I checked

574
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,130
through the first time okay so I checked
 

575
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,650
through the first time okay so I checked
and we definitely went through there the

576
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:34,660
and we definitely went through there the
 

577
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,320
and we definitely went through there the
first time holding forward and I've done

578
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,330
first time holding forward and I've done
 

579
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,580
first time holding forward and I've done
this test several times now and we have

580
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:41,590
this test several times now and we have
 

581
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,860
this test several times now and we have
discovered our first problem

582
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:42,870
discovered our first problem
 

583
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,730
discovered our first problem
unfortunately so it's inconsistent

584
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:46,740
unfortunately so it's inconsistent
 

585
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,080
unfortunately so it's inconsistent
inconsistency is always terrible so you

586
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,090
inconsistency is always terrible so you
 

587
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,580
inconsistency is always terrible so you
see we went through that time the first

588
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:50,590
see we went through that time the first
 

589
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,370
see we went through that time the first
time we didn't they're like why not as

590
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:53,380
time we didn't they're like why not as
 

591
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,010
time we didn't they're like why not as
six times or so we're going through here

592
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,020
six times or so we're going through here
 

593
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,440
six times or so we're going through here
and it can happen even if we're not

594
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,450
and it can happen even if we're not
 

595
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,170
and it can happen even if we're not
holding forward

596
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,180
holding forward
 

597
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,720
holding forward
so our current setup here is no good no

598
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:03,730
so our current setup here is no good no
 

599
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,030
so our current setup here is no good no
bueno by the way I figured out a new

600
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,040
bueno by the way I figured out a new
 

601
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,640
bueno by the way I figured out a new
trick here I guess you can do the light

602
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:08,650
trick here I guess you can do the light
 

603
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,500
trick here I guess you can do the light
rowing thing just like that you just sit

604
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,510
rowing thing just like that you just sit
 

605
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,090
rowing thing just like that you just sit
space bar before you enter the minecart

606
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,100
space bar before you enter the minecart
 

607
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,500
space bar before you enter the minecart
and it keeps you in crawling mode or

608
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:19,510
and it keeps you in crawling mode or
 

609
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,680
and it keeps you in crawling mode or
whatever kind of cool so what I think we

610
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,690
whatever kind of cool so what I think we
 

611
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,630
whatever kind of cool so what I think we
gotta do is get rid of some of these

612
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:24,640
gotta do is get rid of some of these
 

613
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,850
gotta do is get rid of some of these
power drills and make make our pushing

614
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:26,860
power drills and make make our pushing
 

615
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,300
power drills and make make our pushing
forward a bigger impact might even need

616
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,310
forward a bigger impact might even need
 

617
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,250
forward a bigger impact might even need
to have like a dead zone that we have to

618
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,260
to have like a dead zone that we have to
 

619
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,420
to have like a dead zone that we have to
hold forward through I'm not sure

620
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,430

 

621
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,200

and since we're just very rarely

622
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,210
and since we're just very rarely
 

623
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,000
and since we're just very rarely
actually getting through this definitely

624
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,010
actually getting through this definitely
 

625
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,400
actually getting through this definitely
needs to be forward one like we had

626
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,410
needs to be forward one like we had
 

627
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,690
needs to be forward one like we had
originally okay so this is a sweet spot

628
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:48,700
originally okay so this is a sweet spot
 

629
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,500
originally okay so this is a sweet spot
for the detector rail let's actually get

630
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:52,510
for the detector rail let's actually get
 

631
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,610
for the detector rail let's actually get
rid of all these because I'm guessing

632
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:53,620
rid of all these because I'm guessing
 

633
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,450
rid of all these because I'm guessing
it's probably not gonna work

634
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:56,460
it's probably not gonna work
 

635
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,350
it's probably not gonna work
so if we hold forward we got through

636
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
so if we hold forward we got through
 

637
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,360
so if we hold forward we got through
good let's try not hold forward and if

638
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,370
good let's try not hold forward and if
 

639
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,710
good let's try not hold forward and if
this doesn't work then we have to

640
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:07,720
this doesn't work then we have to
 

641
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,640
this doesn't work then we have to
introduce dead spots holding forward

642
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:10,650
introduce dead spots holding forward
 

643
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,970
introduce dead spots holding forward
okay we still went through okay so I got

644
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:14,980
okay we still went through okay so I got
 

645
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,120
okay we still went through okay so I got
one kind of solution here but man I tell

646
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,130
one kind of solution here but man I tell
 

647
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,440
one kind of solution here but man I tell
you this has been a lot more difficult

648
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,450
you this has been a lot more difficult
 

649
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,970
you this has been a lot more difficult
to do than I expected because the

650
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:20,980
to do than I expected because the
 

651
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,040
to do than I expected because the
holding forward is just so subtle

652
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,050
holding forward is just so subtle
 

653
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,130
holding forward is just so subtle
compared to not like the change and then

654
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,140
compared to not like the change and then
 

655
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,740
compared to not like the change and then
there's that inconsistency I think cuz

656
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:28,750
there's that inconsistency I think cuz
 

657
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,400
there's that inconsistency I think cuz
like the detector rail I don't know what

658
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,410
like the detector rail I don't know what
 

659
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,370
like the detector rail I don't know what
it is maybe like the redstone powers the

660
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:35,380
it is maybe like the redstone powers the
 

661
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,320
it is maybe like the redstone powers the
junction but it only flips at certain

662
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,330
junction but it only flips at certain
 

663
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,530
junction but it only flips at certain
ticks like there's 20 ticks in a second

664
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:40,540
ticks like there's 20 ticks in a second
 

665
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,960
ticks like there's 20 ticks in a second
maybe only triggers every two or every

666
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:42,970
maybe only triggers every two or every
 

667
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,670
maybe only triggers every two or every
four or something like that and the in

668
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:44,680
four or something like that and the in
 

669
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,830
four or something like that and the in
the code not like every game tick and

670
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:48,840
the code not like every game tick and
 

671
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,500
the code not like every game tick and
that's where our problem is so in order

672
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:52,510
that's where our problem is so in order
 

673
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,820
that's where our problem is so in order
to get this to work I've had to

674
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:53,830
to get this to work I've had to
 

675
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,900
to get this to work I've had to
introduce two dead spots I couldn't get

676
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:57,910
introduce two dead spots I couldn't get
 

677
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,150
introduce two dead spots I couldn't get
to go with just one so we have two

678
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
to go with just one so we have two
 

679
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,180
to go with just one so we have two
unpowered power rails let's really slow

680
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,190
unpowered power rails let's really slow
 

681
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,380
unpowered power rails let's really slow
you down and that's kind of a problem

682
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,390
you down and that's kind of a problem
 

683
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,760
you down and that's kind of a problem
like if we hold forward we go through

684
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:08,770
like if we hold forward we go through
 

685
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,970
like if we hold forward we go through
now

686
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:09,980
now
 

687
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,540
now
every time and it had to fail yet and if

688
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:13,550
every time and it had to fail yet and if
 

689
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,130
every time and it had to fail yet and if
we don't hold forward we don't go

690
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,140
we don't hold forward we don't go
 

691
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,410
we don't hold forward we don't go
through butts

692
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,420
through butts
 

693
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,250
through butts
because we have to use the two power

694
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,260
because we have to use the two power
 

695
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,290
because we have to use the two power
wheels we actually totally stop and then

696
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,300
wheels we actually totally stop and then
 

697
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,700
wheels we actually totally stop and then
you have to hit forward again to get

698
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:21,710
you have to hit forward again to get
 

699
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,570
you have to hit forward again to get
going but it works let's call this

700
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:25,580
going but it works let's call this
 

701
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,730
going but it works let's call this
potential solution number one I'm going

702
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:27,740
potential solution number one I'm going
 

703
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,600
potential solution number one I'm going
to try maybe find a better one even

704
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:31,610
to try maybe find a better one even
 

705
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,350
to try maybe find a better one even
though this does work it's not as fast

706
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
though this does work it's not as fast
 

707
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:44,830
though this does work it's not as fast
or as smooth as I would like hmm you

708
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:44,840
or as smooth as I would like hmm you
 

709
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,660
or as smooth as I would like hmm you
know what after thinking about it for a

710
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:46,670
know what after thinking about it for a
 

711
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,460
know what after thinking about it for a
bit here we need a new plan we need a

712
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,470
bit here we need a new plan we need a
 

713
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,240
bit here we need a new plan we need a
better idea

714
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,250
better idea
 

715
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,950
better idea
because we've only been trying to do it

716
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:50,960
because we've only been trying to do it
 

717
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,150
because we've only been trying to do it
make it work for go in one direction

718
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
make it work for go in one direction
 

719
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,100
make it work for go in one direction
here like going this way either straight

720
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,110
here like going this way either straight
 

721
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,380
here like going this way either straight
or rights if we're holding forward or

722
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,390
or rights if we're holding forward or
 

723
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,000
or rights if we're holding forward or
not but we also got to make it work

724
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,010
not but we also got to make it work
 

725
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,380
not but we also got to make it work
going this direction either left or

726
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,390
going this direction either left or
 

727
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,080
going this direction either left or
right if we're holding forward or not or

728
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,090
right if we're holding forward or not or
 

729
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,670
right if we're holding forward or not or
straight or left from this direction and

730
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
straight or left from this direction and
 

731
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,310
straight or left from this direction and
that makes it way more complicated

732
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,320
that makes it way more complicated
 

733
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,810
that makes it way more complicated
because we have to set it up for all

734
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:07,820
because we have to set it up for all
 

735
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,449
because we have to set it up for all
three directions and it's also gonna

736
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:10,459
three directions and it's also gonna
 

737
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,980
three directions and it's also gonna
slow it down way more because we'll have

738
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:11,990
slow it down way more because we'll have
 

739
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,720
slow it down way more because we'll have
to have a slowdown on this side over

740
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:13,730
to have a slowdown on this side over
 

741
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,120
to have a slowdown on this side over
here and over here as gonna make the

742
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,130
here and over here as gonna make the
 

743
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,189
here and over here as gonna make the
intersection a lot slower I think unless

744
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:18,199
intersection a lot slower I think unless
 

745
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,280
intersection a lot slower I think unless
we come up with some clever idea which

746
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,290
we come up with some clever idea which
 

747
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,750
we come up with some clever idea which
I'm not gonna do I'm gonna leave that up

748
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:22,760
I'm not gonna do I'm gonna leave that up
 

749
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,579
I'm not gonna do I'm gonna leave that up
to you guys maybe you want to tackle

750
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:24,589
to you guys maybe you want to tackle
 

751
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,260
to you guys maybe you want to tackle
this problem can you make a three-way

752
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,270
this problem can you make a three-way
 

753
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,360
this problem can you make a three-way
intersection that works by holding

754
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,370
intersection that works by holding
 

755
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,730
intersection that works by holding
forward or not

756
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:29,740
forward or not
 

757
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,930
forward or not
that's that's your challenge because I'm

758
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:31,940
that's that's your challenge because I'm
 

759
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,720
that's that's your challenge because I'm
not doing it instead I had another idea

760
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:34,730
not doing it instead I had another idea
 

761
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,020
not doing it instead I had another idea
here we are gonna make an intersection

762
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,030
here we are gonna make an intersection
 

763
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,580
here we are gonna make an intersection
that works by triggering a fence gate

764
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:41,590
that works by triggering a fence gate
 

765
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,140
that works by triggering a fence gate
this isn't a new idea this is something

766
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,150
this isn't a new idea this is something
 

767
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,760
this isn't a new idea this is something
people have been doing for a while but

768
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:45,770
people have been doing for a while but
 

769
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,350
people have been doing for a while but
now that we have observers I think we

770
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
now that we have observers I think we
 

771
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,190
now that we have observers I think we
can get it to work

772
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,200
can get it to work
 

773
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,490
can get it to work
very very easily and very quickly

774
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:51,500
very very easily and very quickly
 

775
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,520
very very easily and very quickly
because observers are fast while the old

776
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,530
because observers are fast while the old
 

777
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,510
because observers are fast while the old
bud switches are kind of slow like this

778
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:58,520
bud switches are kind of slow like this
 

779
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,650
bud switches are kind of slow like this
is a thing people have been doing for a

780
00:17:59,650 --> 00:17:59,660
is a thing people have been doing for a
 

781
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,120
is a thing people have been doing for a
while where you go down the track and

782
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,130
while where you go down the track and
 

783
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,410
while where you go down the track and
you try to hit a button as you go by

784
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:02,420
you try to hit a button as you go by
 

785
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,140
you try to hit a button as you go by
before you get to the junction and it

786
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,150
before you get to the junction and it
 

787
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,330
before you get to the junction and it
switches it's a lot of times the buttons

788
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:07,340
switches it's a lot of times the buttons
 

789
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,550
switches it's a lot of times the buttons
too small you miss it so people start

790
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:09,560
too small you miss it so people start
 

791
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,470
too small you miss it so people start
using fence gates instead because it's

792
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:11,480
using fence gates instead because it's
 

793
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,950
using fence gates instead because it's
got a full block collision here it's

794
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
got a full block collision here it's
 

795
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,520
got a full block collision here it's
easy to trigger it but again you kind of

796
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:18,530
easy to trigger it but again you kind of
 

797
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,040
easy to trigger it but again you kind of
have to have like it way back here and

798
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,050
have to have like it way back here and
 

799
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,960
have to have like it way back here and
another one over here and another one

800
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:22,970
another one over here and another one
 

801
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,220
another one over here and another one
over here

802
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,230
over here
 

803
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,799
over here
and that makes it more complicated but

804
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:26,809
and that makes it more complicated but
 

805
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,570
and that makes it more complicated but
now that we have observers I think we

806
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:28,580
now that we have observers I think we
 

807
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,159
now that we have observers I think we
can just put it right above the junction

808
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:30,169
can just put it right above the junction
 

809
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,349
can just put it right above the junction
here it'll be easy to hit going in all

810
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:32,359
here it'll be easy to hit going in all
 

811
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,609
here it'll be easy to hit going in all
three directions all right and all we

812
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:36,619
three directions all right and all we
 

813
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:40,840
three directions all right and all we
got to do very simple actually is make a

814
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:40,850
got to do very simple actually is make a
 

815
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,259
got to do very simple actually is make a
t flip-flop here so just sticky piston

816
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:44,269
t flip-flop here so just sticky piston
 

817
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:47,619
t flip-flop here so just sticky piston
and redstone block and then just run

818
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:47,629
and redstone block and then just run
 

819
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,499
and redstone block and then just run
redstone to the junction that's it so

820
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:50,509
redstone to the junction that's it so
 

821
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:53,099
redstone to the junction that's it so
now when we've we flip it switches

822
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:53,109
now when we've we flip it switches
 

823
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:56,320
now when we've we flip it switches
pretty simple all right now I want to

824
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,330
pretty simple all right now I want to
 

825
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,989
pretty simple all right now I want to
expand on this a little bit cuz it well

826
00:18:58,989 --> 00:18:58,999
expand on this a little bit cuz it well
 

827
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,399
expand on this a little bit cuz it well
I've actually let's test it out first

828
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:00,409
I've actually let's test it out first
 

829
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:04,629
I've actually let's test it out first
cuz I don't know it might be hard to hit

830
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:04,639
cuz I don't know it might be hard to hit
 

831
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:05,950
cuz I don't know it might be hard to hit
it so right now it's going to the left

832
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:05,960
it so right now it's going to the left
 

833
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,840
it so right now it's going to the left
and just barely see it is another

834
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:07,850
and just barely see it is another
 

835
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,930
and just barely see it is another
problem so we got to try to switch it to

836
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:10,940
problem so we got to try to switch it to
 

837
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,150
problem so we got to try to switch it to
go to the right here

838
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160

 

839
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,870

yet it's doable that's quick enough

840
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:17,880
yet it's doable that's quick enough
 

841
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,180
yet it's doable that's quick enough
oh that's that my sister so she's gonna

842
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,190
oh that's that my sister so she's gonna
 

843
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,810
oh that's that my sister so she's gonna
left let's try again

844
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:23,820

 

845
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,289

oh that was weird okay so you still got

846
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:27,299
oh that was weird okay so you still got
 

847
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,639
oh that was weird okay so you still got
to be kind of quick with it left there

848
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:31,649
to be kind of quick with it left there
 

849
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,229
to be kind of quick with it left there
it's gonna take some practice maybe but

850
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:33,239
it's gonna take some practice maybe but
 

851
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:38,419
it's gonna take some practice maybe but
it's definitely doable I switched it

852
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:38,429
it's definitely doable I switched it
 

853
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,930
it's definitely doable I switched it
straight

854
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:40,940
straight
 

855
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,120
straight
against which to go straight so I think

856
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,130
against which to go straight so I think
 

857
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,680
against which to go straight so I think
it's it's good it's quick enough so

858
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:44,690
it's it's good it's quick enough so
 

859
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,830
it's it's good it's quick enough so
that's cool but what I want to do in

860
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
that's cool but what I want to do in
 

861
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,190
that's cool but what I want to do in
addition is add some lights to it so we

862
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
addition is add some lights to it so we
 

863
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,450
addition is add some lights to it so we
don't have to look at the Junction's

864
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:52,460
don't have to look at the Junction's
 

865
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,760
don't have to look at the Junction's
because it's barely barely visible from

866
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:54,770
because it's barely barely visible from
 

867
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,920
because it's barely barely visible from
a distance it's hard to see especially

868
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:56,930
a distance it's hard to see especially
 

869
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,890
a distance it's hard to see especially
on video I'm guessing so I want to add

870
00:19:59,890 --> 00:19:59,900
on video I'm guessing so I want to add
 

871
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,480
on video I'm guessing so I want to add
an indicator system some lamps up here

872
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:03,490
an indicator system some lamps up here
 

873
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,540
an indicator system some lamps up here
and like if you're over here and it's to

874
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:07,550
and like if you're over here and it's to
 

875
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,920
and like if you're over here and it's to
the left like it is right now then I

876
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:08,930
the left like it is right now then I
 

877
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,390
the left like it is right now then I
want this lamp to be on if it's to the

878
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
want this lamp to be on if it's to the
 

879
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,590
want this lamp to be on if it's to the
right I want this one on instead I think

880
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:14,600
right I want this one on instead I think
 

881
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,480
right I want this one on instead I think
oh we got to do to do that is let's hook

882
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:19,490
oh we got to do to do that is let's hook
 

883
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,690
oh we got to do to do that is let's hook
up some redstone to the block here and

884
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:22,700
up some redstone to the block here and
 

885
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,950
up some redstone to the block here and
we got to run up to the lights we will

886
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
we got to run up to the lights we will
 

887
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,590
we got to run up to the lights we will
put a block here and then

888
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
put a block here and then
 

889
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,120
put a block here and then
oh yeah just two slabs right up here so

890
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,130
oh yeah just two slabs right up here so
 

891
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,100
oh yeah just two slabs right up here so
we do a little redstone staircase up to

892
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,110
we do a little redstone staircase up to
 

893
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,950
we do a little redstone staircase up to
the lamps same on this side

894
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
the lamps same on this side
 

895
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,770
the lamps same on this side
and on one of these we want redstone

896
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:41,780
and on one of these we want redstone
 

897
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,410
and on one of these we want redstone
torch so I guess it would be this one

898
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:44,420
torch so I guess it would be this one
 

899
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:50,530
torch so I guess it would be this one
right oh and a block above - okay so now

900
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:50,540
right oh and a block above - okay so now
 

901
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,050
right oh and a block above - okay so now
I can get you can go up there and if we

902
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,060
I can get you can go up there and if we
 

903
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,450
I can get you can go up there and if we
switch it

904
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:54,460
switch it
 

905
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,990
switch it
there we go that's pretty simple right

906
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
there we go that's pretty simple right
 

907
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,730
there we go that's pretty simple right
so if we're going straight through here

908
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:00,740
so if we're going straight through here
 

909
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,640
so if we're going straight through here
I guess the light would be off I would

910
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:03,650
I guess the light would be off I would
 

911
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,590
I guess the light would be off I would
prefer if it was on but I don't think we

912
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
prefer if it was on but I don't think we
 

913
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,710
prefer if it was on but I don't think we
can can help that all right and this

914
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
can can help that all right and this
 

915
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,690
can can help that all right and this
direction the same rule applies light

916
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:10,700
direction the same rule applies light
 

917
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,410
direction the same rule applies light
light is off that means we go straight

918
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:13,420
light is off that means we go straight
 

919
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,730
light is off that means we go straight
cool all right so I'm pretty happy with

920
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:15,740
cool all right so I'm pretty happy with
 

921
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,840
cool all right so I'm pretty happy with
this actually I've tried it out of the

922
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:16,850
this actually I've tried it out of the
 

923
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,340
this actually I've tried it out of the
bunch now it seems to work good it's

924
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,350
bunch now it seems to work good it's
 

925
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,110
bunch now it seems to work good it's
quick we don't have to slow down the

926
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,120
quick we don't have to slow down the
 

927
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,290
quick we don't have to slow down the
minecart at all it's fairly easy to set

928
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:23,300
minecart at all it's fairly easy to set
 

929
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,940
minecart at all it's fairly easy to set
up there's not much redstone to it and

930
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:24,950
up there's not much redstone to it and
 

931
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,790
up there's not much redstone to it and
I've tried like hiding the wiring to see

932
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:27,800
I've tried like hiding the wiring to see
 

933
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,070
I've tried like hiding the wiring to see
what kind of footprint it'll take up and

934
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
what kind of footprint it'll take up and
 

935
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,920
what kind of footprint it'll take up and
it's it's not bad because again we got

936
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:32,930
it's it's not bad because again we got
 

937
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,140
it's it's not bad because again we got
to try align it with our chunks and like

938
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,150
to try align it with our chunks and like
 

939
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,970
to try align it with our chunks and like
if this is the center of the chunk here

940
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:36,980
if this is the center of the chunk here
 

941
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,550
if this is the center of the chunk here
it goes one two three blocks over so

942
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:39,560
it goes one two three blocks over so
 

943
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,250
it goes one two three blocks over so
this would be the border and from this

944
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,260
this would be the border and from this
 

945
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,430
this would be the border and from this
way one two three border would be here

946
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
way one two three border would be here
 

947
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,250
way one two three border would be here
this way one two three border here so it

948
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,260
this way one two three border here so it
 

949
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,650
this way one two three border here so it
fits within and it's only four blocks

950
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:50,660
fits within and it's only four blocks
 

951
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,330
fits within and it's only four blocks
tall so this is like the the

952
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,340
tall so this is like the the
 

953
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,180
tall so this is like the the
top border of the chunk or the tile or

954
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,190
top border of the chunk or the tile or
 

955
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,549
top border of the chunk or the tile or
slab or whatever we're calling it so

956
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:57,559
slab or whatever we're calling it so
 

957
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,539
slab or whatever we're calling it so
yeah I think we're good all right it's

958
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:01,549
yeah I think we're good all right it's
 

959
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:02,950
yeah I think we're good all right it's
very good so I think we got that figured

960
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
very good so I think we got that figured
 

961
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
very good so I think we got that figured
out and we still got a couple minutes

962
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:04,970
out and we still got a couple minutes
 

963
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,519
out and we still got a couple minutes
left we might be able to do one or two

964
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:06,529
left we might be able to do one or two
 

965
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,649
left we might be able to do one or two
more things before we wrap up today and

966
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:08,659
more things before we wrap up today and
 

967
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,720
more things before we wrap up today and
I wanted to do a bridge across here so

968
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:10,730
I wanted to do a bridge across here so
 

969
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,669
I wanted to do a bridge across here so
let's let's experiment with that I think

970
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:12,679
let's let's experiment with that I think
 

971
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,049
let's let's experiment with that I think
we'll start it here and with a lot of

972
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:17,059
we'll start it here and with a lot of
 

973
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,700
we'll start it here and with a lot of
the stuff we build in the space like

974
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:18,710
the stuff we build in the space like
 

975
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,850
the stuff we build in the space like
staircases paths bridges I think four

976
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:21,860
staircases paths bridges I think four
 

977
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,850
staircases paths bridges I think four
wide is kind of gonna be the the ideal

978
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:24,860
wide is kind of gonna be the the ideal
 

979
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,100
wide is kind of gonna be the the ideal
size like if it's five wide I think it's

980
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,110
size like if it's five wide I think it's
 

981
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,169
size like if it's five wide I think it's
gonna feel too fat if it's three wide

982
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:29,179
gonna feel too fat if it's three wide
 

983
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:35,230
gonna feel too fat if it's three wide
it's gonna feel too narrow maybe so yeah

984
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,240
it's gonna feel too narrow maybe so yeah
 

985
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,019
it's gonna feel too narrow maybe so yeah
let's let's aim for four wide in general

986
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:38,029
let's let's aim for four wide in general
 

987
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,970
let's let's aim for four wide in general
then we can keep it more ace in it

988
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:39,980
then we can keep it more ace in it
 

989
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,830
then we can keep it more ace in it
symmetrical too so it's not in the

990
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
symmetrical too so it's not in the
 

991
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,260
symmetrical too so it's not in the
center of the tile it's kind of ops up

992
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,270
center of the tile it's kind of ops up
 

993
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,480
center of the tile it's kind of ops up
sided here I think that's fine I'm okay

994
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,490
sided here I think that's fine I'm okay
 

995
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,340
sided here I think that's fine I'm okay
with that

996
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,350
with that
 

997
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,360
with that
so let's just do it like this in order

998
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,370
so let's just do it like this in order
 

999
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,139
so let's just do it like this in order
to make it Bend the bits I don't know

1000
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:56,149
to make it Bend the bits I don't know
 

1001
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:59,019
to make it Bend the bits I don't know
when you when you work with the small

1002
00:22:59,019 --> 00:22:59,029
when you when you work with the small
 

1003
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,210
when you when you work with the small
small detail like this you can't do too

1004
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,220
small detail like this you can't do too
 

1005
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,230
small detail like this you can't do too
much can't do anything too fancy so

1006
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,240
much can't do anything too fancy so
 

1007
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,570
much can't do anything too fancy so
we'll just do a simple bridge and maybe

1008
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:07,580
we'll just do a simple bridge and maybe
 

1009
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,779
we'll just do a simple bridge and maybe
let's actually get rid of the stone here

1010
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:09,789
let's actually get rid of the stone here
 

1011
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,510
let's actually get rid of the stone here
and up to here we'll put in some dark

1012
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
and up to here we'll put in some dark
 

1013
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,260
and up to here we'll put in some dark
oak and some slabs on top there so you

1014
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,270
oak and some slabs on top there so you
 

1015
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,899
oak and some slabs on top there so you
don't see that the Rings although I

1016
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:19,909
don't see that the Rings although I
 

1017
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,669
don't see that the Rings although I
guess in 1.13 we're gonna have the new

1018
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:21,679
guess in 1.13 we're gonna have the new
 

1019
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,370
guess in 1.13 we're gonna have the new
blocks where you have log the bark on

1020
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:24,380
blocks where you have log the bark on
 

1021
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,220
blocks where you have log the bark on
all all six sides that's gonna be nice

1022
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,230
all all six sides that's gonna be nice
 

1023
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,799
all all six sides that's gonna be nice
we got a lot of cool new blocks in the

1024
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:28,809
we got a lot of cool new blocks in the
 

1025
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,539
we got a lot of cool new blocks in the
new update here like the stripped bark

1026
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:31,549
new update here like the stripped bark
 

1027
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:38,049
new update here like the stripped bark
looks really good oh I gotta get used to

1028
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:38,059
looks really good oh I gotta get used to
 

1029
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:39,039
looks really good oh I gotta get used to
that hey speaking now I'm breaking

1030
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,049
that hey speaking now I'm breaking
 

1031
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,769
that hey speaking now I'm breaking
everything yeah let's do that

1032
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:41,779
everything yeah let's do that
 

1033
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:45,700
everything yeah let's do that
and some slabs on top very very nice

1034
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:45,710
and some slabs on top very very nice
 

1035
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,360
and some slabs on top very very nice
very simple all right and this will

1036
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,370
very simple all right and this will
 

1037
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,820
very simple all right and this will
probably be passed here too

1038
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:50,830
probably be passed here too
 

1039
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,139
probably be passed here too
how does that look how's that feel I

1040
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:53,149
how does that look how's that feel I
 

1041
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:56,769
how does that look how's that feel I
think I think I'm okay with that from a

1042
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:56,779
think I think I'm okay with that from a
 

1043
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:00,130
think I think I'm okay with that from a
distance

1044
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,140

 

1045
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,139

actually it's it needs more decoration

1046
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:02,149
actually it's it needs more decoration
 

1047
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,419
actually it's it needs more decoration
bottom not that you can really see it

1048
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:04,429
bottom not that you can really see it
 

1049
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:06,250
bottom not that you can really see it
but maybe let's make

1050
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:06,260
but maybe let's make
 

1051
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,610
but maybe let's make
come down one more to show I decided

1052
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:09,620
come down one more to show I decided
 

1053
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
come down one more to show I decided
instead of making the bridge go straight

1054
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:11,630
instead of making the bridge go straight
 

1055
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,360
instead of making the bridge go straight
across I add in a little bit of a curve

1056
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,370
across I add in a little bit of a curve
 

1057
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,370
across I add in a little bit of a curve
to it I think that looks better and I'm

1058
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:15,380
to it I think that looks better and I'm
 

1059
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,960
to it I think that looks better and I'm
pretty happy with that I think it's a

1060
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:16,970
pretty happy with that I think it's a
 

1061
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,570
pretty happy with that I think it's a
nice simple bridge now we might end up

1062
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:19,580
nice simple bridge now we might end up
 

1063
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,820
nice simple bridge now we might end up
getting rid of the slab there and and

1064
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:21,830
getting rid of the slab there and and
 

1065
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,620
getting rid of the slab there and and
lowering it one and then having a walk

1066
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:23,630
lowering it one and then having a walk
 

1067
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,350
lowering it one and then having a walk
through from the tree farm to some other

1068
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,360
through from the tree farm to some other
 

1069
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,180
through from the tree farm to some other
part of the base I was gonna put the

1070
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,190
part of the base I was gonna put the
 

1071
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,370
part of the base I was gonna put the
walkthrough over there because otherwise

1072
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:30,380
walkthrough over there because otherwise
 

1073
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,260
walkthrough over there because otherwise
this tree farms totally enclosed you

1074
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,270
this tree farms totally enclosed you
 

1075
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,270
this tree farms totally enclosed you
know and you can't get to it

1076
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:34,280
know and you can't get to it
 

1077
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,540
know and you can't get to it
except by falling down here but we might

1078
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:37,550
except by falling down here but we might
 

1079
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,850
except by falling down here but we might
change a walk through - over over here

1080
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:39,860
change a walk through - over over here
 

1081
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,060
change a walk through - over over here
instead and go under the bridge now I

1082
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,070
instead and go under the bridge now I
 

1083
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,300
instead and go under the bridge now I
tried something over here and it's one

1084
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,310
tried something over here and it's one
 

1085
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,040
tried something over here and it's one
of those one of those cases where it's

1086
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,050
of those one of those cases where it's
 

1087
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,240
of those one of those cases where it's
like well I want to see what it looks

1088
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,250
like well I want to see what it looks
 

1089
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,710
like well I want to see what it looks
like and then when it's done it's like

1090
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
like and then when it's done it's like
 

1091
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,880
like and then when it's done it's like
hmm I don't really like that so we'll

1092
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:54,890
hmm I don't really like that so we'll
 

1093
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,650
hmm I don't really like that so we'll
probably have to change it but I think

1094
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:56,660
probably have to change it but I think
 

1095
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,070
probably have to change it but I think
the the issue is is we have so much so

1096
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
the the issue is is we have so much so
 

1097
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,870
the the issue is is we have so much so
many of the tiles go straight across

1098
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:01,880
many of the tiles go straight across
 

1099
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,770
many of the tiles go straight across
here like we have one two three four and

1100
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:05,780
here like we have one two three four and
 

1101
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,500
here like we have one two three four and
there'll be another one over there five

1102
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:07,510
there'll be another one over there five
 

1103
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,210
there'll be another one over there five
in a straight line basically I don't

1104
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:10,220
in a straight line basically I don't
 

1105
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,620
in a straight line basically I don't
think that looks too good so I think

1106
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:11,630
think that looks too good so I think
 

1107
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,160
think that looks too good so I think
