00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:11,720

hey how's it going yeah I'm talking to

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:11,730
hey how's it going yeah I'm talking to
 

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,430
hey how's it going yeah I'm talking to
you how's it going what's going on

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
you how's it going what's going on
 

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,480
you how's it going what's going on
what's new how's the family you guys

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,490
what's new how's the family you guys
 

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,590
what's new how's the family you guys
remember that old intro okay we're here

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:20,600
remember that old intro okay we're here
 

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,929
remember that old intro okay we're here
working on the egg farm some more found

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:26,939
working on the egg farm some more found
 

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,009
working on the egg farm some more found
out it's not going to work

12
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:28,019
out it's not going to work
 

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,759
out it's not going to work
like I wanted it to I'll tell you why so

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:31,769
like I wanted it to I'll tell you why so
 

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,240
like I wanted it to I'll tell you why so
first of all actually I'm going to run

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,250
first of all actually I'm going to run
 

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,410
first of all actually I'm going to run
I think the wiring down here so we'll

18
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:39,420
I think the wiring down here so we'll
 

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,030
I think the wiring down here so we'll
have this covered up so we just run some

20
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
have this covered up so we just run some
 

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,639
have this covered up so we just run some
redstone to the right of this block and

22
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:43,649
redstone to the right of this block and
 

23
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,910
redstone to the right of this block and
we can get it to go down down here

24
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:46,920
we can get it to go down down here
 

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,680
we can get it to go down down here
somewhat somehow to these Pistons the

26
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:50,690
somewhat somehow to these Pistons the
 

27
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,270
somewhat somehow to these Pistons the
reason this isn't quite working right

28
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
reason this isn't quite working right
 

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,270
reason this isn't quite working right
like the idea was to keep the chickens

30
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
like the idea was to keep the chickens
 

31
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,200
like the idea was to keep the chickens
inside of the glass block all the time

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,210
inside of the glass block all the time
 

33
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,610
inside of the glass block all the time
so that when they would lay an egg it

34
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:01,620
so that when they would lay an egg it
 

35
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,219
so that when they would lay an egg it
would shoot up the top but when they lay

36
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:07,229
would shoot up the top but when they lay
 

37
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,850
would shoot up the top but when they lay
an egg it has like the sideways velocity

38
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:10,860
an egg it has like the sideways velocity
 

39
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,140
an egg it has like the sideways velocity
to it so if it's moving slightly to the

40
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,150
to it so if it's moving slightly to the
 

41
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,080
to it so if it's moving slightly to the
left for example it'll go upwards but it

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,090
left for example it'll go upwards but it
 

43
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,570
left for example it'll go upwards but it
will keep going to the left through

44
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:22,580
will keep going to the left through
 

45
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,999
will keep going to the left through
however many blocks you have in front of

46
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:26,009
however many blocks you have in front of
 

47
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,179
however many blocks you have in front of
it so even if this was like five blocks

48
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:29,189
it so even if this was like five blocks
 

49
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,219
it so even if this was like five blocks
thick this wall it would just keep

50
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:31,229
thick this wall it would just keep
 

51
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,660
thick this wall it would just keep
moving through those blocks and

52
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:32,670
moving through those blocks and
 

53
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,410
moving through those blocks and
eventually it would like move like that

54
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,420
eventually it would like move like that
 

55
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,210
eventually it would like move like that
all the way up nope but if the egg is

56
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:41,220
all the way up nope but if the egg is
 

57
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,490
all the way up nope but if the egg is
standing still when the glass block hits

58
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:43,500
standing still when the glass block hits
 

59
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,289
standing still when the glass block hits
it it goes straight up that's important

60
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:48,299
it it goes straight up that's important
 

61
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,830
it it goes straight up that's important
we got to nullify its velocity before we

62
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
we got to nullify its velocity before we
 

63
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,569
we got to nullify its velocity before we
put it inside a block otherwise it's

64
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:53,579
put it inside a block otherwise it's
 

65
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,789
put it inside a block otherwise it's
going to go random directions because

66
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:55,799
going to go random directions because
 

67
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,100
going to go random directions because
they they lay the eggs in random

68
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,110
they they lay the eggs in random
 

69
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,430
they they lay the eggs in random
directions

70
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:00,440

 

71
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,190

oh boy so yeah I think what we'll end up

72
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,200
oh boy so yeah I think what we'll end up
 

73
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,480
oh boy so yeah I think what we'll end up
doing did it make it all the way up no

74
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,490
doing did it make it all the way up no
 

75
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:19,090
doing did it make it all the way up no
where did it go yeah we're going to have

76
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,100
where did it go yeah we're going to have
 

77
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,520
where did it go yeah we're going to have
to try figure a few things out here but

78
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:21,530
to try figure a few things out here but
 

79
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,660
to try figure a few things out here but
I'll probably just set up a pressure

80
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:22,670
I'll probably just set up a pressure
 

81
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,340
I'll probably just set up a pressure
plate up here and when we go over that

82
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,350
plate up here and when we go over that
 

83
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,740
plate up here and when we go over that
it'll make a piston extend down there

84
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:26,750
it'll make a piston extend down there
 

85
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,870
it'll make a piston extend down there
and the eggs will go straight up

86
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:28,880
and the eggs will go straight up
 

87
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,730
and the eggs will go straight up
hopefully to where we want them to go

88
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:32,740
hopefully to where we want them to go
 

89
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,530
hopefully to where we want them to go
whatever that egg went there's an egg

90
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:35,540
whatever that egg went there's an egg
 

91
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,440
whatever that egg went there's an egg
out here there's one egg over there so

92
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,450
out here there's one egg over there so
 

93
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,660
out here there's one egg over there so
one of these chickens laid an egg and it

94
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:40,670
one of these chickens laid an egg and it
 

95
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,550
one of these chickens laid an egg and it
shot out to the left and eventually just

96
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:45,560
shot out to the left and eventually just
 

97
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,400
shot out to the left and eventually just
fell out here I just alright so I'm

98
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,410
fell out here I just alright so I'm
 

99
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,230
fell out here I just alright so I'm
going to try make a few adjustments here

100
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,240
going to try make a few adjustments here
 

101
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,220
going to try make a few adjustments here
and we'll see how that works okay let's

102
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,230
and we'll see how that works okay let's
 

103
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,410
and we'll see how that works okay let's
try this out guys we have the lever all

104
00:02:59,410 --> 00:02:59,420
try this out guys we have the lever all
 

105
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,410
try this out guys we have the lever all
wired all right let's go down still

106
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,420
wired all right let's go down still
 

107
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,780
wired all right let's go down still
don't have a nice way of getting down

108
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:06,790
don't have a nice way of getting down
 

109
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:14,970
don't have a nice way of getting down
this is okay though so I put the piston

110
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:14,980
this is okay though so I put the piston
 

111
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,210
this is okay though so I put the piston
holy that was a loud one put the piston

112
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,220
holy that was a loud one put the piston
 

113
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,740
holy that was a loud one put the piston
down in the middle instead of pushing

114
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:20,750
down in the middle instead of pushing
 

115
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,570
down in the middle instead of pushing
the eggs from the sides because I think

116
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:22,580
the eggs from the sides because I think
 

117
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,930
the eggs from the sides because I think
if you push them from the sides they get

118
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:25,940
if you push them from the sides they get
 

119
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,590
if you push them from the sides they get
a sideways velocity as they rise and

120
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:28,600
a sideways velocity as they rise and
 

121
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,710
a sideways velocity as they rise and
will not go up straight so I think this

122
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
will not go up straight so I think this
 

123
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,530
will not go up straight so I think this
works out better we're actually going to

124
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:35,540
works out better we're actually going to
 

125
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:44,680
works out better we're actually going to
try this out yeah let's throw in Wow

126
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:44,690
try this out yeah let's throw in Wow
 

127
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,620
try this out yeah let's throw in Wow
is it just me or is that really loud for

128
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:47,630
is it just me or is that really loud for
 

129
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:54,240
is it just me or is that really loud for
some reason I think we had 27

130
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,250

 

131
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,940

27 dirt okay so the wire it runs all the

132
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:57,950
27 dirt okay so the wire it runs all the
 

133
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,680
27 dirt okay so the wire it runs all the
way down here and to it over there so

134
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:02,690
way down here and to it over there so
 

135
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,589
way down here and to it over there so
let's go up we'll flip that lever and

136
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
let's go up we'll flip that lever and
 

137
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,240
let's go up we'll flip that lever and
see if we get all our dirts or some of

138
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,250
see if we get all our dirts or some of
 

139
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:15,270
see if we get all our dirts or some of
its lost or what happens exactly oh

140
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280

 

141
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,729

let's go let's go

142
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:17,739
let's go let's go
 

143
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:25,570
let's go let's go
that is some storm I tell you oh yeah

144
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:25,580
that is some storm I tell you oh yeah
 

145
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:34,379
that is some storm I tell you oh yeah
also worst noise ever

146
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:34,389

 

147
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:41,620

okay so much noise here we go should we

148
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:41,630
okay so much noise here we go should we
 

149
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,590
okay so much noise here we go should we
go we'll try it watch as it comes up we

150
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,600
go we'll try it watch as it comes up we
 

151
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,260
go we'll try it watch as it comes up we
probably won't be able to see anything

152
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,270
probably won't be able to see anything
 

153
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,180
probably won't be able to see anything
if it comes up it didn't come up yeah

154
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,190
if it comes up it didn't come up yeah
 

155
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,640
if it comes up it didn't come up yeah
they it oh I didn't think it would be

156
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,650
they it oh I didn't think it would be
 

157
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,150
they it oh I didn't think it would be
this hard to transport items what's

158
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
this hard to transport items what's
 

159
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,690
this hard to transport items what's
wrong

160
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:58,700
wrong
 

161

right before we put the chickens in
 

165
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,520
right before we put the chickens in
otherwise we're gonna have to kill them

166
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,530
otherwise we're gonna have to kill them
 

167
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,540

where they keep disappearing too I

172
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,590
where they keep disappearing too I
 

173
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,140
where they keep disappearing too I
wonder maybe we'll find them in the wire

174
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,150
wonder maybe we'll find them in the wire
 

175
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,750
wonder maybe we'll find them in the wire
track somewhere oh yeah we just picked

176
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:22,760
track somewhere oh yeah we just picked
 

177
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,420
track somewhere oh yeah we just picked
them up hmm so I think they were up

178
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,430
them up hmm so I think they were up
 

179
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,450
them up hmm so I think they were up
there somehow they still didn't go up

180
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:31,460
there somehow they still didn't go up
 

181
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,210
there somehow they still didn't go up
Straits that's not good mmm well I think

182
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,220
Straits that's not good mmm well I think
 

183
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,360
Straits that's not good mmm well I think
let's just try this out a few times and

184
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,370
let's just try this out a few times and
 

185
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,790
let's just try this out a few times and
see if we can spot a hole let's cut the

186
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
see if we can spot a hole let's cut the
 

187
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,010
see if we can spot a hole let's cut the
stuff escaping to or something I don't

188
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,020
stuff escaping to or something I don't
 

189
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,909
stuff escaping to or something I don't
know where it's going

190
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
know where it's going
 

191
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,990
know where it's going
fill that in okay it went up should be

192
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,000
fill that in okay it went up should be
 

193
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,670
fill that in okay it went up should be
going straight up I don't know why we

194
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
going straight up I don't know why we
 

195
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,779
going straight up I don't know why we
got it again right from there okay

196
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:02,789
got it again right from there okay
 

197
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,489
got it again right from there okay
let's try it again see if it does it

198
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:04,499
let's try it again see if it does it
 

199
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:06,140
let's try it again see if it does it
again I think that was the same spot as

200
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,150
again I think that was the same spot as
 

201
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:16,570
again I think that was the same spot as
before yeah you see it you see it

202
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:16,580
before yeah you see it you see it
 

203
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,279
before yeah you see it you see it
because I have a hole here from the

204
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,289
because I have a hole here from the
 

205
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:24,920
because I have a hole here from the
Redstone I guess yeah hmm okay I can fix

206
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:24,930
Redstone I guess yeah hmm okay I can fix
 

207
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,299
Redstone I guess yeah hmm okay I can fix
this okay I got that plugged let's try

208
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:29,309
this okay I got that plugged let's try
 

209
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,659
this okay I got that plugged let's try
it again

210
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:31,669

 

211
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:39,290

and fill it and now hopefully hopefully

212
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,300
and fill it and now hopefully hopefully
 

213
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,360
and fill it and now hopefully hopefully
it's at the top otherwise I don't know

214
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,370
it's at the top otherwise I don't know
 

215
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,639
it's at the top otherwise I don't know
what to do and I'm running out of ideas

216
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:46,649
what to do and I'm running out of ideas
 

217
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,549
what to do and I'm running out of ideas
I thought it was just going to be really

218
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:49,559
I thought it was just going to be really
 

219
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,920
I thought it was just going to be really
simple to do this but there's more to it

220
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:51,930
simple to do this but there's more to it
 

221
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,589
simple to do this but there's more to it
than I expected

222
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
than I expected
 

223
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,860
than I expected
hey you don't steal any blocks okay I

224
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:57,870
hey you don't steal any blocks okay I
 

225
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,460
hey you don't steal any blocks okay I
don't trust them

226
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,470

 

227
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,250

no they're still not here hmm

228
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,260
no they're still not here hmm
 

229
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,110
no they're still not here hmm
there's another hole over there it looks

230
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
there's another hole over there it looks
 

231
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,810
there's another hole over there it looks
like it might be doing going to that I

232
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:15,820
like it might be doing going to that I
 

233
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,850
like it might be doing going to that I
should try go and just seal this all up

234
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:20,860
should try go and just seal this all up
 

235
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,360
should try go and just seal this all up
let's see if we pick it up when we go by

236
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,370
let's see if we pick it up when we go by
 

237
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,350
let's see if we pick it up when we go by
yeah look that's what it is okay so it's

238
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,360
yeah look that's what it is okay so it's
 

239
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,990
yeah look that's what it is okay so it's
got to be solid that's the trick and it

240
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
got to be solid that's the trick and it
 

241
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,210
got to be solid that's the trick and it
might shoot into these stairs I should

242
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,220
might shoot into these stairs I should
 

243
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,270
might shoot into these stairs I should
change these maybe okay where you at die

244
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
change these maybe okay where you at die
 

245
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,280
change these maybe okay where you at die
and hit him he's going to teleport yeah

246
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,290

 

247
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,810

how do you take damage I hate it when

248
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:54,820
how do you take damage I hate it when
 

249
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,360
how do you take damage I hate it when
these guys steal my grass blocks and

250
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,370
these guys steal my grass blocks and
 

251
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,390
these guys steal my grass blocks and

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
he's gone okay
 

253
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,750
he's gone okay
holes are sealed its wired let's try it

254
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:05,760
holes are sealed its wired let's try it
 

255
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,040
holes are sealed its wired let's try it
come on make it up make it up it didn't

256
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,050
come on make it up make it up it didn't
 

257
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,920
come on make it up make it up it didn't
make it oh it did make it where was it

258
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:16,930
make it oh it did make it where was it
 

259
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,980
make it oh it did make it where was it
I must have been in the stair hmm okay I

260
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:22,990
I must have been in the stair hmm okay I
 

261
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,560
I must have been in the stair hmm okay I
got rid of all those chests and also the

262
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:25,570
got rid of all those chests and also the
 

263
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,780
got rid of all those chests and also the
stairs it's all solid and I also

264
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:27,790
stairs it's all solid and I also
 

265
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,490
stairs it's all solid and I also
replaced the lever with the pressure

266
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:29,500
replaced the lever with the pressure
 

267
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,010
replaced the lever with the pressure
plates and change the wiring up a little

268
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,020
plates and change the wiring up a little
 

269
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,820
plates and change the wiring up a little
bit so let's try it out again I think

270
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:38,830
bit so let's try it out again I think
 

271
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,480
bit so let's try it out again I think
it'll work

272
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,490
it'll work
 

273
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:46,860
it'll work
come on come on yes finally great okay

274
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:46,870
come on come on yes finally great okay
 

275
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,540
come on come on yes finally great okay
so we can load it up with chickens I

276
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:48,550
so we can load it up with chickens I
 

277
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,600
so we can load it up with chickens I
think and should be good now this is the

278
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:54,610
think and should be good now this is the
 

279
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,290
think and should be good now this is the
wiring path whew

280
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:57,300
wiring path whew
 

281
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,180
wiring path whew
got one repeater in to extend it OOP

282
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,190
got one repeater in to extend it OOP
 

283
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,840
got one repeater in to extend it OOP
and it comes all the way down so now to

284
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:06,850
and it comes all the way down so now to
 

285
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,980
and it comes all the way down so now to
get the chickens in

286
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:08,990
get the chickens in
 

287
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,040
get the chickens in
I wanted to do a few other fancy things

288
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,050
I wanted to do a few other fancy things
 

289
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:19,090
I wanted to do a few other fancy things
but maybe I'll do this another day yeah

290
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,100
but maybe I'll do this another day yeah
 

291
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,560
but maybe I'll do this another day yeah
just to get the chickens in it's kind of

292
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:20,570
just to get the chickens in it's kind of
 

293
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,260
just to get the chickens in it's kind of
take them up like 20 minutes to grow and

294
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,270
take them up like 20 minutes to grow and
 

295
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,760
take them up like 20 minutes to grow and
another five minutes to lay eggs so

296
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:24,770
another five minutes to lay eggs so
 

297
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,220
another five minutes to lay eggs so
it'll probably take too long to do this

298
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,230
it'll probably take too long to do this
 

299
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:34,810
it'll probably take too long to do this
episode but we'll load them up Wow

300
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:34,820
episode but we'll load them up Wow
 

301
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,410
episode but we'll load them up Wow
not the best okay we got one at least

302

not the best okay we got one at least
 

303
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:44,110
not the best okay we got one at least

00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,080
from that one egg oh yeah gonna be great
 

311
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:07,840
from that one egg oh yeah gonna be great
guys a terrible noise good last stack I

312
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:07,850
guys a terrible noise good last stack I
 

313
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,220
guys a terrible noise good last stack I
got I'm not sure we might be able to

314
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,230
got I'm not sure we might be able to
 

315
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,860
got I'm not sure we might be able to
breed them somehow through the glass

316
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:16,870

 

317
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,230

okay because this all has to be solid

318
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
okay because this all has to be solid
 

319
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,010
okay because this all has to be solid
I think otherwise it will find a way to

320
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,020
I think otherwise it will find a way to
 

321
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,980
I think otherwise it will find a way to
escape on its way up and there's about

322
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:29,990
escape on its way up and there's about
 

323
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:42,720
escape on its way up and there's about
18 or so in there that works okay good

324
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:42,730

 

325
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,160

326
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,170
all right you know what I think we
 

327

all right you know what I think we
should work on this for a little bit

343
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,799
that was weird yeah let's let's put
trees alongside the river this sandy

344
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:16,809
trees alongside the river this sandy
 

345
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,290
trees alongside the river this sandy
part I think I'm going to switch out -

346
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,300
part I think I'm going to switch out -
 

347
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:26,509
part I think I'm going to switch out -
we'll put some soil here all along maybe

348
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:26,519
we'll put some soil here all along maybe
 

349
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,340
we'll put some soil here all along maybe
just make it come out four or five

350
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,350
just make it come out four or five
 

351
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,619
just make it come out four or five
blocks from the water and then we'll

352
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:31,629
blocks from the water and then we'll
 

353
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:39,269
blocks from the water and then we'll
leave it as sand see how that goes huh

354
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
leave it as sand see how that goes huh
 

355
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,129
leave it as sand see how that goes huh
so I'll switch this over I'll get back

356
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:41,139
so I'll switch this over I'll get back
 

357
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,989
so I'll switch this over I'll get back
to you and we'll plant some trees it's

358

I would like I would like the trees that

362
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:47,740
I would like I would like the trees that
 

363
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,799
I would like I would like the trees that
vines on to that kind of overhang in the

364
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:49,809
vines on to that kind of overhang in the
 

365
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:58,110
vines on to that kind of overhang in the
water that guy really wants me can't

366
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,120
water that guy really wants me can't
 

367
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,889
water that guy really wants me can't
have me there we go I got a whole bunch

368
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:04,899
have me there we go I got a whole bunch
 

369
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,769
have me there we go I got a whole bunch
of it replaced over there in this big

370
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:07,779
of it replaced over there in this big
 

371
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,150
of it replaced over there in this big
section here let's try get some trees

372
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
section here let's try get some trees
 

373
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,540
section here let's try get some trees
down and see how it looks I think let's

374
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,550
down and see how it looks I think let's
 

375
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,679
down and see how it looks I think let's
put them about the third block from the

376
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:19,689
put them about the third block from the
 

377
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:25,280
put them about the third block from the
water so here does have to be perfect

378
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,290
water so here does have to be perfect
 

379
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,549
water so here does have to be perfect
actually it's better if it's not okay

380
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:29,559
actually it's better if it's not okay
 

381
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,889
actually it's better if it's not okay
and hopefully we'll get a few big ones

382
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:31,899
and hopefully we'll get a few big ones
 

383
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,369
and hopefully we'll get a few big ones
at least I wonder if that might be too

384
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:35,379
at least I wonder if that might be too
 

385
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,169
at least I wonder if that might be too
close together let's just see what that

386
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:37,179
close together let's just see what that
 

387
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:45,350
close together let's just see what that
looks like and over there and they're

388
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
looks like and over there and they're
 

389
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,169
looks like and over there and they're
all little ones so far oh there we go

390
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:51,179
all little ones so far oh there we go
 

391
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,369
all little ones so far oh there we go
let's see what that looks like from the

392
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:53,379
let's see what that looks like from the
 

393
00:12:53,379 --> 00:13:00,360
let's see what that looks like from the
water that's kind of cool yeah I like

394
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,370
water that's kind of cool yeah I like
 

395
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,689
water that's kind of cool yeah I like
that so we'll do that all along here

396
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:03,699
that so we'll do that all along here
 

397
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:12,809
that so we'll do that all along here
just trying to make this prettier a lot

398
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:12,819
just trying to make this prettier a lot
 

399
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:13,949
just trying to make this prettier a lot
of people are saying I should replace

400
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:13,959
of people are saying I should replace
 

401
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,139
of people are saying I should replace
that remember that overhang also with

402
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:16,149
that remember that overhang also with
 

403
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,629
that remember that overhang also with
stone and I might end up doing that too

404
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
stone and I might end up doing that too
 

405
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,040
stone and I might end up doing that too
just so it looks more natural

406
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,050
just so it looks more natural
 

407
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,870
just so it looks more natural

so we'll probably skip this area
 

479
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,060
so we'll probably skip this area
although maybe maybe we could sneak one
