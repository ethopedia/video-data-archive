let's play series I was on my way over
to the Enderman farm to fix up my tools

10
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:19,859
to the Enderman farm to fix up my tools
 

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,099
to the Enderman farm to fix up my tools
and that this thing caught my attention

12
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:22,109
and that this thing caught my attention
 

13
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,720

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:31,289
you stole the music I can't believe that
 

17
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,880
you stole the music I can't believe that
I had an idea though maybe we should

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:34,890
I had an idea though maybe we should
 

19
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,639
I had an idea though maybe we should
move this because if I ever spawn the

20
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:37,649
move this because if I ever spawn the
 

21
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,080
move this because if I ever spawn the
dragon in this things get destroyed

22
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,090
dragon in this things get destroyed
 

23
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,240
dragon in this things get destroyed
anyway and it's not in a good place and

24
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,250
anyway and it's not in a good place and
 

25
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,869
anyway and it's not in a good place and
this portal got moved maybe we should

26
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
this portal got moved maybe we should
 

27
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,720
this portal got moved maybe we should
move our music randomizer over to the

28
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:47,730
move our music randomizer over to the
 

29
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,630
move our music randomizer over to the
Enderman farm I think that would be a

30
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
Enderman farm I think that would be a
 

31
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,760
Enderman farm I think that would be a
good idea I'm gonna do that to begin

32
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:52,770
good idea I'm gonna do that to begin
 

33
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,430
good idea I'm gonna do that to begin
with here today but first I'm gonna fix

34
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
with here today but first I'm gonna fix
 

35
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,220
with here today but first I'm gonna fix
up my tools like maybe maybe down here

36
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,230
up my tools like maybe maybe down here
 

37
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:09,620
up my tools like maybe maybe down here
would be a pretty cool spot for it ah I

38
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,630
would be a pretty cool spot for it ah I
 

39
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,289

just did something really stupid I set

40
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:12,299
just did something really stupid I set
 

41
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,330
just did something really stupid I set
up a comparator clock here and without

42
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:14,340
up a comparator clock here and without
 

43
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,830
up a comparator clock here and without
even thinking about it I just flipped

44
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
even thinking about it I just flipped
 

45
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,200
even thinking about it I just flipped
the lever try it out make sure it works

46
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,210
the lever try it out make sure it works
 

47
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,539
the lever try it out make sure it works
except I had already put all the items

48
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:20,549
except I had already put all the items
 

49
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,160
except I had already put all the items
in the in the droppers here now they're

50
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,170
in the in the droppers here now they're
 

51
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,280
in the in the droppers here now they're
all over the place and I have to put

52
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,290
all over the place and I have to put
 

53
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,170
all over the place and I have to put
them back in which was really annoying

54
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,180
them back in which was really annoying
 

55
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,539
them back in which was really annoying
because I basically got to put one at a

56
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:32,549
because I basically got to put one at a
 

57
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,550
because I basically got to put one at a
time alright awesome so I fixed my

58
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
time alright awesome so I fixed my
 

59
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,289
time alright awesome so I fixed my
little mistake there I got all the items

60
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:39,299
little mistake there I got all the items
 

61
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,630
little mistake there I got all the items
back into the droppers here I got 9

62
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
back into the droppers here I got 9
 

63
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,700
back into the droppers here I got 9
items in total whenever it's Alexis

64
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:43,710
items in total whenever it's Alexis
 

65
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,550
items in total whenever it's Alexis
stone sword then this comparator sends a

66
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
stone sword then this comparator sends a
 

67
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,859
stone sword then this comparator sends a
signal a distance of 3 and activates the

68
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:48,869
signal a distance of 3 and activates the
 

69
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,410
signal a distance of 3 and activates the
note block so that's kind of how this

70
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,420
note block so that's kind of how this
 

71
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,060
note block so that's kind of how this
all works it's actually really simple if

72
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,070
all works it's actually really simple if
 

73
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,219
all works it's actually really simple if
you guys ever want to try to copy this

74
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:55,229
you guys ever want to try to copy this
 

75
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,310
you guys ever want to try to copy this
it's it's not too hard to set up so what

76
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
it's it's not too hard to set up so what
 

77
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,020
it's it's not too hard to set up so what
I have to do now is put the hoppers

78
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,030
I have to do now is put the hoppers
 

79
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,200
I have to do now is put the hoppers
above here we got a Enderman proof this

80
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,210
above here we got a Enderman proof this
 

81
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,670
above here we got a Enderman proof this
as well we don't want them teleporting

82
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:04,680
as well we don't want them teleporting
 

83
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,170
as well we don't want them teleporting
down here and picking up the dirt blocks

84
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,180
down here and picking up the dirt blocks
 

85
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,749
down here and picking up the dirt blocks
or you know getting out of a farm so

86
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:08,759
or you know getting out of a farm so
 

87
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,190
or you know getting out of a farm so
we're going to cover over everything

88
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
we're going to cover over everything
 

89
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,809
we're going to cover over everything
here with water as well when we're all

90
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:11,819
here with water as well when we're all
 

91
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,080
here with water as well when we're all
done

92
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,090
done
 

93
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,009
done
so I'm just going to put like glass

94
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:16,019
so I'm just going to put like glass
 

95
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,050
so I'm just going to put like glass
probably at this level here and then

96
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,060
probably at this level here and then
 

97
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,119
probably at this level here and then
can't put it right above the note blocks

98
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:20,129
can't put it right above the note blocks
 

99
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,360
can't put it right above the note blocks
but I can put it one above and then more

100
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,370
but I can put it one above and then more
 

101
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,070
but I can put it one above and then more
water above that maybe is what we'll do

102
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,080
water above that maybe is what we'll do
 

103
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,039
water above that maybe is what we'll do
and I got the note box positioned on the

104
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,049
and I got the note box positioned on the
 

105
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,420
and I got the note box positioned on the
left and the right so it's kind of like

106
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,430
left and the right so it's kind of like
 

107
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,180
left and the right so it's kind of like
stereo sound got our comparator clock

108
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,190
stereo sound got our comparator clock
 

109
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,710
stereo sound got our comparator clock
over here which activates all the

110
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:33,720
over here which activates all the
 

111
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,160
over here which activates all the
droppers down the middle and we're going

112
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,170
droppers down the middle and we're going
 

113
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,369
droppers down the middle and we're going
to tune it to the G B major pentatonic

114
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:40,379
to tune it to the G B major pentatonic
 

115
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,949
to tune it to the G B major pentatonic

117
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,509

copying what you guys told me so we got

122
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:48,989
copying what you guys told me so we got
 

123
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,619
copying what you guys told me so we got
ten note blocks in total and then we're

124
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:51,629
ten note blocks in total and then we're
 

125
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,880
ten note blocks in total and then we're
just going to copy it on the other side

126
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:52,890
just going to copy it on the other side
 

127
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,910
just going to copy it on the other side
but we're going to tune it so zero

128
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
but we're going to tune it so zero

if I switch it to the one tick like it

if I switch it to the one tick like it
 

151
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:49,460
if I switch it to the one tick like it
sounds really cool

at first the the increased tempo I like

154
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:52,859
at first the the increased tempo I like
 

155
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,369
at first the the increased tempo I like
it a lot but I can't keep it at one tick

156
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:55,379
it a lot but I can't keep it at one tick
 

157
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,920
it a lot but I can't keep it at one tick
because then these repeaters they get

158
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:57,930
because then these repeaters they get
 

159
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,599
because then these repeaters they get
stuck on right because it's sending the

160
00:03:59,599 --> 00:03:59,609
stuck on right because it's sending the
 

161
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,280
stuck on right because it's sending the
items into the hopper faster than they

162
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,290
items into the hopper faster than they
 

163
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,569
items into the hopper faster than they
can flow back out so so yeah the fastest

164
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:05,579
can flow back out so so yeah the fastest
 

165
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,559
can flow back out so so yeah the fastest
we can do it is at 2 but I got 9 items

166
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:09,569
we can do it is at 2 but I got 9 items
 

167
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,449
we can do it is at 2 but I got 9 items
in the randomizer if I decrease the

168
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:11,459
in the randomizer if I decrease the
 

169
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,099
in the randomizer if I decrease the
number of items we can get a faster

170
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:13,109
number of items we can get a faster
 

171
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,850
number of items we can get a faster
tempo and I think I'm going to try that

172
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:15,860
tempo and I think I'm going to try that
 

173
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,440
tempo and I think I'm going to try that
because I really like tell that sounds

174
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,450
because I really like tell that sounds
 

175
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,420
because I really like tell that sounds
great when you turn it on before they

176
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,430
great when you turn it on before they
 

177
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,950
great when you turn it on before they
all get locked up you know alright so we

178
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
all get locked up you know alright so we
 

179
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,500
all get locked up you know alright so we
got six items in each of these and with

180
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,510
got six items in each of these and with
 

181
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,360
got six items in each of these and with
the set two ticks let's try it again oh

182
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,370
the set two ticks let's try it again oh
 

183
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,730
the set two ticks let's try it again oh
I oh I did it again I didn't put the

184
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:36,740
I oh I did it again I didn't put the
 

185
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:47,560
I oh I did it again I didn't put the
hoppers back oh you know what it's

186
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,570
hoppers back oh you know what it's
 

187
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,330
hoppers back oh you know what it's
activating more note blocks but it's not

188
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:52,340
activating more note blocks but it's not
 

189
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,390
activating more note blocks but it's not
a faster tempo we can't get the faster

190
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:55,400
a faster tempo we can't get the faster
 

191
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,390
a faster tempo we can't get the faster
tempo gently darn it

192
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
tempo gently darn it
 

193
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,550
tempo gently darn it
it's this activating more note blocks at

194
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
it's this activating more note blocks at
 

195
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:09,640
it's this activating more note blocks at
once let's think about this if we how

196
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:09,650
once let's think about this if we how
 

197
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:16,030
once let's think about this if we how
about we send it I like how that sounds

198
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,040
about we send it I like how that sounds
 

199
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:24,370
about we send it I like how that sounds
I want to do that it's okay I did it on

200
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:24,380
I want to do that it's okay I did it on
 

201
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,690
I want to do that it's okay I did it on
purpose this time okay guys so here's

202
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:28,700
purpose this time okay guys so here's
 

203
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,550
purpose this time okay guys so here's
the deal I tried one or two other things

204
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
the deal I tried one or two other things
 

205
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,409
the deal I tried one or two other things
with the the randomizers there but I

206
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:32,419
with the the randomizers there but I
 

207
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,870
with the the randomizers there but I
just couldn't get anything to work

208
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:33,880
just couldn't get anything to work
 

209
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,070
just couldn't get anything to work
because of the speed limit of hoppers

210
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
because of the speed limit of hoppers
 

211
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,340
because of the speed limit of hoppers
they can only go so fast so in this in

212
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,350
they can only go so fast so in this in
 

213
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,920
they can only go so fast so in this in
this case we needed something something

214
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:41,930
this case we needed something something
 

215
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,130
this case we needed something something
better so I think I might have invented

216
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,140
better so I think I might have invented
 

217
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,350
better so I think I might have invented
a new type of randomizer here or at

218
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
a new type of randomizer here or at
 

219
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,820
a new type of randomizer here or at
least it's one I've never seen you know

220
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:48,830
least it's one I've never seen you know
 

221
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,560
least it's one I've never seen you know
there's millions of people playing

222
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,570
there's millions of people playing
 

223
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,560
there's millions of people playing
Minecraft I'm sure someone out there has

224
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,570
Minecraft I'm sure someone out there has
 

225
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,900
Minecraft I'm sure someone out there has
done this too but it's a design I've

226
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:55,910
done this too but it's a design I've
 

227
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,430
done this too but it's a design I've
never seen it's going to be my new go-to

228
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
never seen it's going to be my new go-to
 

229
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
never seen it's going to be my new go-to
design for randomizers I think because

230
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,450
design for randomizers I think because
 

231
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,110
design for randomizers I think because
it's in a lot of ways better than the

232
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,120
it's in a lot of ways better than the
 

233
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,719
it's in a lot of ways better than the
hopper dropper one this is a dropper

234
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:04,729
hopper dropper one this is a dropper
 

235
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,800
hopper dropper one this is a dropper
dropper randomizer so the idea is this

236
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:08,810
dropper randomizer so the idea is this
 

237
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,540
dropper randomizer so the idea is this
redstone line activates this first

238
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,550
redstone line activates this first
 

239
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,090
redstone line activates this first
dropper and then this one's facing into

240
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,100
dropper and then this one's facing into
 

241
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,610
dropper and then this one's facing into
it right they're both facing each other

242
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:14,620
it right they're both facing each other
 

243
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,380
it right they're both facing each other
one tick later one redstone tick later

244
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,390
one tick later one redstone tick later
 

245
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,780
one tick later one redstone tick later
it shoots the item back into this one

246
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:19,790
it shoots the item back into this one
 

247
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,480
it shoots the item back into this one
alright so

248
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,490
alright so
 

249
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,719
alright so
the cool thing is like it randomizes

250
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:24,729
the cool thing is like it randomizes
 

251
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,890
the cool thing is like it randomizes
going into this dropper and then it

252
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:26,900
going into this dropper and then it
 

253
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,870
going into this dropper and then it
randomizes coming back all in the same

254
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
randomizes coming back all in the same
 

255
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,980
randomizes coming back all in the same
sequence so it's like a double

256
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:29,990
sequence so it's like a double
 

257
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,760
sequence so it's like a double
randomizer which means you can do more

258
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:33,770
randomizer which means you can do more
 

259
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,400
randomizer which means you can do more
with less compared to the hopper dropper

260
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,410
with less compared to the hopper dropper
 

261
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,939
with less compared to the hopper dropper
ones anyway I think so

262
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:39,949
ones anyway I think so
 

263
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,980
ones anyway I think so
the only catch with this that I found is

264
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:41,990
the only catch with this that I found is
 

265
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,600
the only catch with this that I found is
you have to start it with one item in in

266
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:46,610
you have to start it with one item in in
 

267
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,370
you have to start it with one item in in
the dropper that you're detecting the

268
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:48,380
the dropper that you're detecting the
 

269
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,409
the dropper that you're detecting the
signal from otherwise the comparator

270
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,419
signal from otherwise the comparator
 

271
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,990
signal from otherwise the comparator
doesn't seem to update if it's because

272
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,000
doesn't seem to update if it's because
 

273
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,320
doesn't seem to update if it's because
it goes keep you real fast in out um and

274
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,330
it goes keep you real fast in out um and
 

275
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,659
it goes keep you real fast in out um and
in that one tick the comparator doesn't

276
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:58,669
in that one tick the comparator doesn't
 

277
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,080
in that one tick the comparator doesn't
change unless there's an item in already

278
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,090
change unless there's an item in already
 

279
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,860
change unless there's an item in already
alright so let's give it a try here ooh

280
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:04,870
alright so let's give it a try here ooh
 

281
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,640
alright so let's give it a try here ooh
super speed

282
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:06,650
super speed
 

283
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:16,089
super speed
randomizer haha you know that's not bad

284
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:16,099
randomizer haha you know that's not bad
 

285
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:22,180
randomizer haha you know that's not bad
just as it is yeah we might leave it

286
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,190
just as it is yeah we might leave it
 

287
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,010
just as it is yeah we might leave it
like that like I can add more items into

288
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,020
like that like I can add more items into
 

289
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,450
like that like I can add more items into
here if we were to put so if I want to

290
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:28,460
here if we were to put so if I want to
 

291
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,939
here if we were to put so if I want to
add items I'd put it into this one you

292
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:30,949
add items I'd put it into this one you
 

293
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:37,409
add items I'd put it into this one you
put in even stack them like that alright

294
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:37,419

 

295
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,909

you see it's kind of randomized to put

296
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
you see it's kind of randomized to put
 

297
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:47,370
you see it's kind of randomized to put
the sword back into here so pretty cool

298
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,380

 

299
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,390

so here's another really cool thing

300
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,400
so here's another really cool thing
 

301
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,640
so here's another really cool thing
because we're using a faster randomizer

302
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:51,650
because we're using a faster randomizer
 

303
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,860
because we're using a faster randomizer
I think we have avoided a problem I was

304
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:53,870
I think we have avoided a problem I was
 

305
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,379
I think we have avoided a problem I was
having with this one um you can see it's

306
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:56,389
having with this one um you can see it's
 

307
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,149
having with this one um you can see it's
still running but you don't hear any

308
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:58,159
still running but you don't hear any
 

309
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,370
still running but you don't hear any
music because I have left the end and

310
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:00,380
music because I have left the end and
 

311
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,649
music because I have left the end and
came back and sometimes when I do this

312
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:02,659
came back and sometimes when I do this
 

313
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:07,060
came back and sometimes when I do this
this gets stuck on even though it's not

314
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,070
this gets stuck on even though it's not
 

315
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,580
this gets stuck on even though it's not
supposed to but just from the chunks

316
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:09,590
supposed to but just from the chunks
 

317
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,700
supposed to but just from the chunks
unloading and reloading it messes it up

318
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:11,710
unloading and reloading it messes it up
 

319
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,529
unloading and reloading it messes it up
so I I constantly have to restart it

320
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:14,539
so I I constantly have to restart it
 

321
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,050
so I I constantly have to restart it
this one I've tried leaving and coming

322
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,060
this one I've tried leaving and coming
 

323
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,150
this one I've tried leaving and coming
back a few times and it doesn't suit

324
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,160
back a few times and it doesn't suit
 

325
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,430
back a few times and it doesn't suit
be affected by that see the clocks still

326
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
be affected by that see the clocks still
 

327
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,220
be affected by that see the clocks still
running oh never mind

328
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,230
running oh never mind
 

329
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:33,880
running oh never mind
really uh-oh because the items got

330
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:33,890
really uh-oh because the items got
 

331
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,940
really uh-oh because the items got
messed up

332
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:35,950
messed up
 

333
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,260
messed up
it's the comparators that the bearers

334
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,270
it's the comparators that the bearers
 

335
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,760
it's the comparators that the bearers
are messed up for some reason

336
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:42,770

 

337
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,350

if we shut off there should only be one

338
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,360
if we shut off there should only be one
 

339
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,620
if we shut off there should only be one
item in here there's two now okay so

340
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:47,630
item in here there's two now okay so
 

341
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,690
item in here there's two now okay so
this might have another problem if we

342
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:49,700
this might have another problem if we
 

343
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,790
this might have another problem if we
leave it running

344
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
leave it running
 

345
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,750
leave it running
darn it now it works that we restarted

346
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
darn it now it works that we restarted
 

347
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,190
darn it now it works that we restarted
it nope here's what I'm gonna do guys

348
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,200
it nope here's what I'm gonna do guys
 

349
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,050
it nope here's what I'm gonna do guys
I'm gonna put a stone pressure plate

350
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,060
I'm gonna put a stone pressure plate
 

351
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,410
I'm gonna put a stone pressure plate
right over here right over here there we

352
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:08,420
right over here right over here there we
 

353
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,680
right over here right over here there we
go

354
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:08,690
go
 

355
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,770
go
and the Enderman are going to land on

356
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:11,780
and the Enderman are going to land on
 

357
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,070
and the Enderman are going to land on
that if there's any Enderman here there

358
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,080
that if there's any Enderman here there
 

359
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,170
that if there's any Enderman here there
will be music and then when I fly away

360
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,180
will be music and then when I fly away
 

361
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,300
will be music and then when I fly away
they will be spawn once I get over 128

362
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,310
they will be spawn once I get over 128
 

363
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,250
they will be spawn once I get over 128
blocks away and that is before the

364
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,260
blocks away and that is before the
 

365
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,210
blocks away and that is before the
chunks unload so as long as I don't fall

366
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:28,220
chunks unload so as long as I don't fall
 

367
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,710
chunks unload so as long as I don't fall
in the void or something and die this

368
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:29,720
in the void or something and die this
 

369
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,610
in the void or something and die this
shouldn't mess up I think oh yeah let's

370
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:36,620
shouldn't mess up I think oh yeah let's
 

371
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,840
shouldn't mess up I think oh yeah let's
turn this down it's actually pretty loud

372
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:37,850
turn this down it's actually pretty loud
 

373
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,930
turn this down it's actually pretty loud
when when you have so many going here's

374
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:40,940
when when you have so many going here's
 

375
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,850
when when you have so many going here's
the next thing I want to try out

376
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:42,860
the next thing I want to try out
 

377
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,860
the next thing I want to try out
typically with Enderman farms you have

378
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,870
typically with Enderman farms you have
 

379
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,290
typically with Enderman farms you have
to put a roof over them and you can't

380
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,300
to put a roof over them and you can't
 

381
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,670
to put a roof over them and you can't
have more than like two and a half

382
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:48,680
have more than like two and a half
 

383
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,680
have more than like two and a half
blocks spaced like between the roofs and

384
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,690
blocks spaced like between the roofs and
 

385
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,990
blocks spaced like between the roofs and
that kind of sucks honestly so what I'm

386
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
that kind of sucks honestly so what I'm
 

387
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
that kind of sucks honestly so what I'm
gonna try here if you don't put the roof

388
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,490
gonna try here if you don't put the roof
 

389
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,860
gonna try here if you don't put the roof
on you get intermittent like all over

390
00:09:59,860 --> 00:09:59,870
on you get intermittent like all over
 

391
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,540
on you get intermittent like all over
the place like this they teleport out of

392
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:01,550
the place like this they teleport out of
 

393
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,300
the place like this they teleport out of
their holding chamber here I'm gonna

394
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,310
their holding chamber here I'm gonna
 

395
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,030
their holding chamber here I'm gonna
take over the world I brought over some

396
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
take over the world I brought over some
 

397
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,060
take over the world I brought over some
maple blocks what happens if we

398
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,070
maple blocks what happens if we
 

399
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:18,000
maple blocks what happens if we
let's try this for right now I'm going

400
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,010
let's try this for right now I'm going
 

401
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,690
let's try this for right now I'm going
to do that

402
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:18,700
to do that
 

403
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,270
to do that
they only teleports when they hit the

404
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,280
they only teleports when they hit the
 

405
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,530
they only teleports when they hit the
ground here I've noticed or probably if

406
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:25,540
ground here I've noticed or probably if
 

407
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,780
ground here I've noticed or probably if
I punch up to land and they die for some

408
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:27,790
I punch up to land and they die for some
 

409
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,930
I punch up to land and they die for some
reason oh I just going to stop every

410
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:30,940
reason oh I just going to stop every
 

411
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,450
reason oh I just going to stop every
time I kill him - I didn't think about

412
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:33,460
time I kill him - I didn't think about
 

413
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,850
time I kill him - I didn't think about
that oh hey how did he do that he walked

414
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:38,860
that oh hey how did he do that he walked
 

415
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,570
that oh hey how did he do that he walked
over the magma block without dying

416
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:44,580

 

417
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,190

alright guys so I've been testing this

418
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
alright guys so I've been testing this
 

419
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,050
alright guys so I've been testing this
out here the magma blocks they seem to

420
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,060
out here the magma blocks they seem to
 

421
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,660
out here the magma blocks they seem to
be working pretty good actually

422
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:51,670
be working pretty good actually
 

423
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,340
be working pretty good actually
I don't think I need to put a roof on

424
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,350
I don't think I need to put a roof on
 

425
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,040
I don't think I need to put a roof on
this the idea is pretty simple basically

426
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,050
this the idea is pretty simple basically
 

427
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,540
this the idea is pretty simple basically
the Enderman up there they're in there a

428
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:00,550
the Enderman up there they're in there a
 

429
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,760
the Enderman up there they're in there a
grow at an endermite in a minecart right

430
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:02,770
grow at an endermite in a minecart right
 

431
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,290
grow at an endermite in a minecart right
and then they fall down they can't

432
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,300
and then they fall down they can't
 

433
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,780
and then they fall down they can't
actually get them but they stay agro at

434
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:06,790
actually get them but they stay agro at
 

435
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,010
actually get them but they stay agro at
them and when they hit the ground

436
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,020
them and when they hit the ground
 

437
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,020
them and when they hit the ground
because they're a grow they have a

438
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,030
because they're a grow they have a
 

439
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,150
because they're a grow they have a
chance to teleporting out of the holding

440
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
chance to teleporting out of the holding
 

441
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,060
chance to teleporting out of the holding
area they're on to the you know whatever

442
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,070
area they're on to the you know whatever
 

443
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,640
area they're on to the you know whatever
I build over here typically you got to

444
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:17,650
I build over here typically you got to
 

445
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,950
I build over here typically you got to
put a roof on this and then put water on

446
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:19,960
put a roof on this and then put water on
 

447
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,390
put a roof on this and then put water on
top of the roof to keep them from like

448
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,400
top of the roof to keep them from like
 

449
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,450
top of the roof to keep them from like
this watering your Enderman farm but

450
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:27,460
this watering your Enderman farm but
 

451
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,730
this watering your Enderman farm but
because they stay agro on the endermite

452
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:29,740
because they stay agro on the endermite
 

453
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,530
because they stay agro on the endermite
they also try to attack it and they'll

454
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:31,540
they also try to attack it and they'll
 

455
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,770
they also try to attack it and they'll
run to where he is which is like right

456
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:34,780
run to where he is which is like right
 

457
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,140
run to where he is which is like right
above here so they run right into the

458
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,150
above here so they run right into the
 

459
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,330
above here so they run right into the
magma blocks as soon as they teleport

460
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:39,340
magma blocks as soon as they teleport
 

461
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,110
magma blocks as soon as they teleport
[Music]

462
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,120
[Music]
 

463
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,940
[Music]
the only downside of course is you have

464
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:44,950
the only downside of course is you have
 

465
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,590
the only downside of course is you have
these stupid magma blocks right where

466
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,600
these stupid magma blocks right where
 

467
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,190
these stupid magma blocks right where
you want to click your stop but I kind

468
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,200
you want to click your stop but I kind
 

469
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,150
you want to click your stop but I kind
of liked it actually I think I'm going

470
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,160
of liked it actually I think I'm going
 

471
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,230
of liked it actually I think I'm going
to keep it okay guys so we're gonna do

472
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,240
to keep it okay guys so we're gonna do
 

473
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,480
to keep it okay guys so we're gonna do
something else now we're back over at

474
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,490

then put that back down and it's this

520
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:00,689
then put that back down and it's this
 

521
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:03,109
then put that back down and it's this
whole big process to do all this

522
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:03,119
whole big process to do all this
 

523
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,729
whole big process to do all this
eventually I figured out of course you

524
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:04,739
eventually I figured out of course you
 

525
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:08,109
eventually I figured out of course you
can shift-click can't you

526
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:08,119
can shift-click can't you
 

527
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,239
can shift-click can't you
okay you can't shift-click you should be

528
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:11,249
okay you can't shift-click you should be
 

529
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,209
okay you can't shift-click you should be
able to I thought you could if you put 2

530
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:14,219
able to I thought you could if you put 2
 

531
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:17,539
able to I thought you could if you put 2
in here it doesn't work so basically you

532
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:17,549
in here it doesn't work so basically you
 

533
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:19,369
in here it doesn't work so basically you
get one emerald at a time and you have

534
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:19,379
get one emerald at a time and you have
 

535
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,949
get one emerald at a time and you have
to click like 5 times it's really

536
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:21,959
to click like 5 times it's really
 

537
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,319
to click like 5 times it's really
annoying so we're gonna build a machine

538
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:24,329
annoying so we're gonna build a machine
 

539
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,219
annoying so we're gonna build a machine
to do this for us a little easier I

540
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:27,229
to do this for us a little easier I
 

541
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:31,489
to do this for us a little easier I
realized today while trading you could

542
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:31,499
realized today while trading you could
 

543
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,309
realized today while trading you could
do it like this you could have exactly

544
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:34,319
do it like this you could have exactly
 

545
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:39,949
do it like this you could have exactly
36 zombie flesh or however many they

546
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:39,959
36 zombie flesh or however many they
 

547
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,679
36 zombie flesh or however many they
take then you just have to press 1 while

548
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:42,689
take then you just have to press 1 while
 

549
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,960
take then you just have to press 1 while
hovering over the window you want press

550
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:44,970
hovering over the window you want press
 

551
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,719
hovering over the window you want press
1 to put it in there and then you press

552
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:47,729
1 to put it in there and then you press
 

553
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,569
1 to put it in there and then you press
Q on the emerald to throw it out and

554
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:49,579
Q on the emerald to throw it out and
 

555
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,109
Q on the emerald to throw it out and
then get 36 more that seems like a much

556
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:54,119
then get 36 more that seems like a much
 

557
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,339
then get 36 more that seems like a much
better way of doing it so we're gonna

558
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:55,349
better way of doing it so we're gonna
 

559
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:57,799
better way of doing it so we're gonna
try setup a machine to do that here in

560
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:57,809
try setup a machine to do that here in
 

561
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,189
try setup a machine to do that here in
our village hmmm

562
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
our village hmmm
 

563
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,379
our village hmmm
you know what I'm looking around our

564
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:03,389
you know what I'm looking around our
 

565
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,729
you know what I'm looking around our
village here I'm trying to find a spot

566
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:04,739
village here I'm trying to find a spot
 

567
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,879
village here I'm trying to find a spot
for our little gizmo but this place is

568
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:07,889
for our little gizmo but this place is
 

569
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,969
for our little gizmo but this place is
pretty cluttered already not a lot of

570
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:10,979
pretty cluttered already not a lot of
 

571
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:13,879
pretty cluttered already not a lot of
free spots left I think this is the best

572
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:13,889
free spots left I think this is the best
 

573
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,449
free spots left I think this is the best
place for it maybe right over here so

574
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:17,459
place for it maybe right over here so
 

575
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,369
place for it maybe right over here so
well dig in and we'll get started on it

576
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:19,379
well dig in and we'll get started on it
 

577
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,829
well dig in and we'll get started on it
a fairly simple idea really

578
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
a fairly simple idea really
 

579
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,289
a fairly simple idea really
but basically maybe we'll go in over to

580
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:27,299
but basically maybe we'll go in over to
 

581
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,889
but basically maybe we'll go in over to
here what I want to happen is I'm going

582
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:30,899
here what I want to happen is I'm going
 

583
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,189
here what I want to happen is I'm going
to set it up so that there'll be a trap

584
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:34,199
to set it up so that there'll be a trap
 

585
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,110
to set it up so that there'll be a trap
door above us

586
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,120
door above us
 

587
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,440
door above us
this will open up upwards any items on

588
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,450
this will open up upwards any items on
 

589
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,329
this will open up upwards any items on
top of the trapdoor will then fall down

590
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:41,339
top of the trapdoor will then fall down
 

591
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,000
top of the trapdoor will then fall down
on to us so we want 36 zombie flesh

592
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,010
on to us so we want 36 zombie flesh
 

593
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,420
on to us so we want 36 zombie flesh
ready to go we don't want it we don't

594
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:47,430
ready to go we don't want it we don't
 

595
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,070
ready to go we don't want it we don't
want to wait for it to get dispensed we

596
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,080
want to wait for it to get dispensed we
 

597
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,829
want to wait for it to get dispensed we
want it's like as soon as we throw the

598
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
want it's like as soon as we throw the
 

599
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,170
want it's like as soon as we throw the
Emerald in we get 36 more hopefully so

600
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,180
Emerald in we get 36 more hopefully so
 

601
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,570
Emerald in we get 36 more hopefully so
then we're going to have hopper in front

602
00:14:59,570 --> 00:14:59,580
then we're going to have hopper in front
 

603
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,550
then we're going to have hopper in front
of us over here probably that we throw

604
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,560
of us over here probably that we throw
 

605
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,290
of us over here probably that we throw
the Emerald in once we throw an emerald

606
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,300
the Emerald in once we throw an emerald
 

607
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,780
the Emerald in once we throw an emerald
in we get this will open up drop 36 Dom

608
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:05,790
in we get this will open up drop 36 Dom
 

609
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,700
in we get this will open up drop 36 Dom
be flesh on us and then probably like

610
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:10,710
be flesh on us and then probably like
 

611
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,860
be flesh on us and then probably like
right over here there'll be a cleric

612
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:12,870
right over here there'll be a cleric
 

613
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,840
right over here there'll be a cleric
villager that we're trading with locked

614
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:14,850
villager that we're trading with locked
 

615
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,540
villager that we're trading with locked
behind a block or something and then

616
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:19,550
behind a block or something and then
 

617
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,050
behind a block or something and then
have I said and then I think I have will

618
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,060
have I said and then I think I have will
 

619
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,640
have I said and then I think I have will
have a bunch of droppers full zombie

620
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:25,650
have a bunch of droppers full zombie
 

621
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,790
have a bunch of droppers full zombie
flesh that shoot items out so if we're

622
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
flesh that shoot items out so if we're
 

623
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,760
flesh that shoot items out so if we're
doing 36 we might go for like 9 droppers

624
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:31,770
doing 36 we might go for like 9 droppers
 

625
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,070
doing 36 we might go for like 9 droppers
9 times 4 is 36 so we'd have to activate

626
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,080
9 times 4 is 36 so we'd have to activate
 

627
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,900
9 times 4 is 36 so we'd have to activate
the droppers 4 times to get what we need

628
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:41,910
the droppers 4 times to get what we need
 

629
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,240
the droppers 4 times to get what we need
or we could do 18 droppers that seems

630

or we could do 18 droppers that seems
 

631
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,550
or we could do 18 droppers that seems
excessive though we'll try it with with

this guy down he almost got away from us

638
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:00,920
this guy down he almost got away from us
 

639

we got them into a spot here and I think

640
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:03,779
we got them into a spot here and I think
 

641
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,380
we got them into a spot here and I think
I got this setup now so this is our

642
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,390
I got this setup now so this is our
 

643
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,680
I got this setup now so this is our
little circuits I decided to use a

644
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:09,690
little circuits I decided to use a
 

645
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,960
little circuits I decided to use a
piston to pushes up into the trapdoor

646
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:11,970
piston to pushes up into the trapdoor
 

647
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,880
piston to pushes up into the trapdoor
because I forgot when a trapdoor opens

648
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:13,890
because I forgot when a trapdoor opens
 

649
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,820
because I forgot when a trapdoor opens
up upwards if there's any on the part

650
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,830
up upwards if there's any on the part
 

651
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,320
up upwards if there's any on the part
that's like the thin slice the items

652
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,330
that's like the thin slice the items
 

653
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,230
that's like the thin slice the items
just go up like an item elevator so yeah

654
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
just go up like an item elevator so yeah
 

655
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,449
just go up like an item elevator so yeah
I was thinking of old old game mechanics

656
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:28,459
I was thinking of old old game mechanics
 

657
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,030
I was thinking of old old game mechanics
where stuff will just fall through so

658
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,040
where stuff will just fall through so
 

659
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,910
where stuff will just fall through so
that that's a good way of dealing with

660
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:34,920
that that's a good way of dealing with
 

661
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,810
that that's a good way of dealing with
it basically if there are any items

662
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:38,820
it basically if there are any items
 

663
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,570
it basically if there are any items
going through this item hopper then

664
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:40,580
going through this item hopper then
 

665
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:46,160
going through this item hopper then
comparator turns on which then activates

brain for a second here's the other
 

723
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,480
brain for a second here's the other
problem though it's gonna get to the

724
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,490
problem though it's gonna get to the
 

725
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,190
problem though it's gonna get to the
point where you can't trade anymore so

726
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
point where you can't trade anymore so
 

727
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,050
point where you can't trade anymore so
maybe I should carry some extra emeralds

728
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,060
maybe I should carry some extra emeralds
 

729
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,890
maybe I should carry some extra emeralds
with me when I do the trading and I am

730
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:18,900
with me when I do the trading and I am
 

731
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,050
with me when I do the trading and I am
by some random garbage and refresh your

732

by some random garbage and refresh your
 

733
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,920
by some random garbage and refresh your
trade that way so yeah I'll keep 64 on

good 1 and Q 1 and Q how fast can we do

738
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:34,440
good 1 and Q 1 and Q how fast can we do
 

739
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,400

it oh I messed it up alright throw an

740
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,410
it oh I messed it up alright throw an
 

741
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,430
it oh I messed it up alright throw an
extra one in I guess 1 in Q I'm throwing

742
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
extra one in I guess 1 in Q I'm throwing
 

743
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,730
extra one in I guess 1 in Q I'm throwing
them up there maybe yeah let's do like

744
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:46,740
them up there maybe yeah let's do like
 

745
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,260
them up there maybe yeah let's do like
this guys this is a good idea I put a

746
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,270
this guys this is a good idea I put a
 

747
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,170
this guys this is a good idea I put a
trap door over there and then a slab

748
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:51,180
trap door over there and then a slab
 

749
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,910
trap door over there and then a slab
above it this allows us to collect the

750
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:52,920
above it this allows us to collect the
 

751
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,610
above it this allows us to collect the
XP nice and easy and it'll prevent me

752
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:55,620
XP nice and easy and it'll prevent me
 

753
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,490
XP nice and easy and it'll prevent me
from throwing the emeralds on top of the

754
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:58,500
from throwing the emeralds on top of the
 

755
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,960
from throwing the emeralds on top of the
block like I was doing there so let's

756
00:18:59,960 --> 00:18:59,970
block like I was doing there so let's
 

757
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,210
block like I was doing there so let's
try this again I got some

758
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:02,220
try this again I got some
 

759
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:11,930
try this again I got some
we fish on me 1 and Q yeah good okay so

760
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:11,940
we fish on me 1 and Q yeah good okay so
 

761
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,669
we fish on me 1 and Q yeah good okay so
much easier Oh are we out of zombie

762
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
much easier Oh are we out of zombie
 

763
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,090
much easier Oh are we out of zombie
flesh already started but you get the

764
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,100
flesh already started but you get the
 

765
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,389
flesh already started but you get the
idea I think it's a cool little thing

766
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:19,399
idea I think it's a cool little thing
 

767
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,529
idea I think it's a cool little thing
yeah I didn't fill these all the way I

768
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:21,539
yeah I didn't fill these all the way I
 

769
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:26,419
yeah I didn't fill these all the way I
bet you one of these is low oh no wait a

770
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:26,429
bet you one of these is low oh no wait a
 

771
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,779
bet you one of these is low oh no wait a
minute yeah this one was empty okay that

772
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:29,789
minute yeah this one was empty okay that
 

773
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,820
minute yeah this one was empty okay that
makes sense so I got to make sure I fill

774
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:31,830
makes sense so I got to make sure I fill
 

775
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,730
makes sense so I got to make sure I fill
this up all the way

776
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:33,740
this up all the way
 

777
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,430
this up all the way

past this points alright guys so now
 

801
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,639
past this points alright guys so now
we've headed over to the amplified

802
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:10,649
we've headed over to the amplified
 

803
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:15,350
we've headed over to the amplified
terrain base and got something to try

804
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
terrain base and got something to try
 

805
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,960
terrain base and got something to try
out over here last last thing we did

806
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:17,970
out over here last last thing we did
 

807
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,519
out over here last last thing we did
over here is we built this kind of mind

808
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:19,529
over here is we built this kind of mind
 

809
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:22,909
over here is we built this kind of mind
thing we got started on it guys pretty

810
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:22,919
thing we got started on it guys pretty
 

811
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,240
thing we got started on it guys pretty
cool I like it something I've had a lot

812
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,250
cool I like it something I've had a lot
 

813
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,759
cool I like it something I've had a lot
of trouble with though with the

814
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:28,769
of trouble with though with the
 

815
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:34,009
of trouble with though with the
amplified bass here who is picking out a

816
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:34,019
amplified bass here who is picking out a
 

817
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,180
amplified bass here who is picking out a
building theme and also just building an

818
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,190
building theme and also just building an
 

819
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,430
building theme and also just building an
amplified ring kind of sucks to be

820
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:40,440
amplified ring kind of sucks to be
 

821
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,879
amplified ring kind of sucks to be
honest because there's like nowhere to

822
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:43,889
honest because there's like nowhere to
 

823
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:49,399
honest because there's like nowhere to
build I find I'll give you an example

824
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:49,409
build I find I'll give you an example
 

825
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:51,320
build I find I'll give you an example
like everywhere you go is these little

826
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,330
like everywhere you go is these little
 

827
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,009
like everywhere you go is these little
like tiny slanted slopes and there's not

828
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:55,019
like tiny slanted slopes and there's not
 

829
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:57,289
like tiny slanted slopes and there's not
really much flat ground beyond what I've

830
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:57,299
really much flat ground beyond what I've
 

831
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,180
really much flat ground beyond what I've
done over here this is like the only

832
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,190
done over here this is like the only
 

833
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,480
done over here this is like the only
good spot I've really been able to find

834
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,490
good spot I've really been able to find
 

835
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,769
good spot I've really been able to find
so I think we're gonna have to create

836
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:03,779
so I think we're gonna have to create
 

837
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,749
so I think we're gonna have to create
terrain and like put in midair so I'm

838
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:08,759
terrain and like put in midair so I'm
 

839
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,740
terrain and like put in midair so I'm
gonna try build or maybe not today but

840
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:12,750
gonna try build or maybe not today but
 

841
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,509
gonna try build or maybe not today but
we're going to try to get some houses

842
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:14,519
we're going to try to get some houses
 

843
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,910
we're going to try to get some houses
over on the side of the

844
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:15,920
over on the side of the
 

845
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,030
over on the side of the
Hildur if we can the main thing I want

846
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,040
Hildur if we can the main thing I want
 

847
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,470
Hildur if we can the main thing I want
to show you though here today is the

848
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
to show you though here today is the
 

849
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,370
to show you though here today is the
building theme I have recently thought

850
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:24,380
building theme I have recently thought
 

851
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,960
building theme I have recently thought
of that I think is going to be pretty

852
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:25,970
of that I think is going to be pretty
 

853
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,280
of that I think is going to be pretty
cool if you watch my modded series we

854
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,290
cool if you watch my modded series we
 

855
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,660
cool if you watch my modded series we
got the diesel bunker steampunk city and

856
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:33,670
got the diesel bunker steampunk city and
 

857
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,430
got the diesel bunker steampunk city and
I really like the color scheme we have

858
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:36,440
I really like the color scheme we have
 

859
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,310
I really like the color scheme we have
with that and I got thinking you know we

860
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,320
with that and I got thinking you know we
 

861
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,280
with that and I got thinking you know we
could probably do that here in vanilla

862
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,290
could probably do that here in vanilla
 

863
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,480
could probably do that here in vanilla
actually so let's give it a try here

864
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,490
actually so let's give it a try here
 

865
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,900
actually so let's give it a try here
then I've build a little bit more and

866
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:48,910
then I've build a little bit more and
 

867
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,270
then I've build a little bit more and
then underneath this dirt we'll have to

868
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,280
then underneath this dirt we'll have to
 

869
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,070
then underneath this dirt we'll have to
give it some sort of supporting

870
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
give it some sort of supporting
 

871
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,790
give it some sort of supporting
structure to make it look cool but

872
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:56,800
structure to make it look cool but
 

873
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,810
structure to make it look cool but
basically how we can do brick

874
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:01,820
basically how we can do brick
 

875
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,610
basically how we can do brick
I think brick would look pretty good

876
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:03,620
I think brick would look pretty good
 

877
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,300
I think brick would look pretty good
nice red people don't use brick a lot in

878
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,310
nice red people don't use brick a lot in
 

879
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,880
nice red people don't use brick a lot in
Minecraft mostly because it kind of

880
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:09,890
Minecraft mostly because it kind of
 

881
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,530
Minecraft mostly because it kind of
sucks to to collect it but yeah you can

882
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:14,540
sucks to to collect it but yeah you can
 

883
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,780
sucks to to collect it but yeah you can
do brick and then you can do the dark

884
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:16,790
do brick and then you can do the dark
 

885
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,450
do brick and then you can do the dark
oak like we have in the modded series

886
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:19,460
oak like we have in the modded series
 

887
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,210
oak like we have in the modded series
and the main other thing though is the

888
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:25,220
and the main other thing though is the
 

889
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,270
and the main other thing though is the
yellow yellow ground the Sandy bricks we

890
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,280
yellow yellow ground the Sandy bricks we
 

891
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,700
yellow yellow ground the Sandy bricks we
don't have that here but we can do path

892
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:30,710
don't have that here but we can do path
 

893
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,080
don't have that here but we can do path
blocks which are yellow so this is kind

894
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,090
blocks which are yellow so this is kind
 

895
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,790
blocks which are yellow so this is kind
of a good color combo we got here but

896
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:39,800
of a good color combo we got here but
 

897
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,860
of a good color combo we got here but
yeah here's a quick little sample I just

898
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:41,870
yeah here's a quick little sample I just
 

899
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,270
yeah here's a quick little sample I just
rigged together to give you an idea what

900
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
rigged together to give you an idea what
 

901
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,600
rigged together to give you an idea what
I what I had in mind really not much to

902
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:46,610
I what I had in mind really not much to
 

903
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,150
I what I had in mind really not much to
it we got some brick mixing some stairs

904
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,160
it we got some brick mixing some stairs
 

905
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,340
it we got some brick mixing some stairs
every now and then to make it look more

906
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,350
every now and then to make it look more
 

907
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,980
every now and then to make it look more
interesting mixed in some hardened clay

908
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:53,990
interesting mixed in some hardened clay
 

909
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,450
interesting mixed in some hardened clay
to make it look like the bricks falling

910
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:55,460
to make it look like the bricks falling
 

911
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,080
to make it look like the bricks falling
off

912
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,090
off
 

913
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,620
off
um maybe spruce fence windows I'm not

914
00:22:59,620 --> 00:22:59,630
um maybe spruce fence windows I'm not
 

915
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,830
um maybe spruce fence windows I'm not
sure then you can do some nature stuff

916
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:02,840
sure then you can do some nature stuff
 

917
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,230
sure then you can do some nature stuff
like leaves and grass got some coarse

918
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,240
like leaves and grass got some coarse
 

919
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,690
like leaves and grass got some coarse
dirts spruce planks every now and then

920
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:07,700
dirts spruce planks every now and then
 

921
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,130
dirts spruce planks every now and then
would look good then use note blocks

922
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,140
would look good then use note blocks
 

923
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,330
would look good then use note blocks
like in the modern series I'd like to

924
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:13,340
like in the modern series I'd like to
 

925
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,430
like in the modern series I'd like to
hang a light from this - that would look

926
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
hang a light from this - that would look
 

927
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,850
hang a light from this - that would look
cool and we could do like oh you did

928
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:18,860
cool and we could do like oh you did
 

929
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,030
cool and we could do like oh you did
there and have have it kind of climbing

930
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,040
there and have have it kind of climbing
 

931
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,550
there and have have it kind of climbing
up the mountain and may go forward a

932
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:24,560
up the mountain and may go forward a
 

933
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,460
up the mountain and may go forward a
little bit as it goes up kind of a

934
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:27,470
little bit as it goes up kind of a
 

935
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,680
little bit as it goes up kind of a
rickety crazy-looking build

936
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:29,690
rickety crazy-looking build
 

937
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,810
rickety crazy-looking build
but yeah I think that might be cool let

938
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:31,820
but yeah I think that might be cool let
 

939
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,860
but yeah I think that might be cool let
me get know what you guys think of that

940
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:32,870
me get know what you guys think of that
 

941
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,379
me get know what you guys think of that
we don't have much time to get into it

942
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:35,389
we don't have much time to get into it
 

943
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:37,240
we don't have much time to get into it
today but I just thought I'd show it off

944
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,250
today but I just thought I'd show it off
