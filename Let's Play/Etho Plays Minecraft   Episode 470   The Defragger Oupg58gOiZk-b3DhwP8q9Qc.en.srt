so up over here we got a ladder this is
 

411
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,629
so up over here we got a ladder this is
where i can

412
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
where i can
 

413
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,230

all right so this potion lab also has a
 

485
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,790
all right so this potion lab also has a
built-in netherwort farm

486

built-in netherwort farm
 

487
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,110
built-in netherwort farm
which is uh mostly for decoration but

488
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
which is uh mostly for decoration but
 

489
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,070
which is uh mostly for decoration but
it's

490
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
it's
 

491
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,630
it's
also very useful to have nearby so you

492
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
also very useful to have nearby so you
 

493
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,070
also very useful to have nearby so you
get some netherwart nice and easy

494
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
get some netherwart nice and easy
 

495
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,190
get some netherwart nice and easy
nice and close put that in there refill

496
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
nice and close put that in there refill
 

497
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,910
nice and close put that in there refill
those

498
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
those
 

499
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,350
those
if any of these things run out of

500
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
if any of these things run out of
 

501
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,269
if any of these things run out of
ingredients it really messes things up

502
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
ingredients it really messes things up
 

503
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,949
ingredients it really messes things up
so i got to watch it carefully

504
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
so i got to watch it carefully
 

505
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,110
so i got to watch it carefully
uh these lights turn off if it runs out

506
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
uh these lights turn off if it runs out
 

507
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,190
uh these lights turn off if it runs out
of awkward potions i believe

508
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
of awkward potions i believe
 

509
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,829
of awkward potions i believe
aha so over here is our main switch

510
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
aha so over here is our main switch
 

511
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,430
aha so over here is our main switch
let's flip it

512
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
let's flip it
 

513
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,949
let's flip it
and that gets that gets the game lagging

514
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
and that gets that gets the game lagging
 

515
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,269
and that gets that gets the game lagging
very nicely uh but it activates all

516
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
very nicely uh but it activates all
 

517
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,269
very nicely uh but it activates all
these brewing stands over here for the

518
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
these brewing stands over here for the
 

519
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,069
these brewing stands over here for the
the main brewing um so all the awkward

520
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
the main brewing um so all the awkward
 

521
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,470
the main brewing um so all the awkward
potions get converted into

522
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
potions get converted into
 

523
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,069
potions get converted into
to their steps here it does it in a

to their steps here it does it in a
 

525
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,829
to their steps here it does it in a
chain so for

526
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
chain so for
 

527
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,069
chain so for
instant healing for example we have the

528
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
instant healing for example we have the
 

529
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,310
instant healing for example we have the
glycerin melon added first

530
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
glycerin melon added first
 

531
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,870
glycerin melon added first
then the glowstone and gunpowder and

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,590
then the glowstone and gunpowder and
each step

534
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
each step
 

535
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,470
each step
of the brewing process you can access uh

536
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
of the brewing process you can access uh
 

537
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,790

potions there
 

547
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,870
potions there
so it's a pretty cool little system and

548
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
so it's a pretty cool little system and
 

549
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,430
so it's a pretty cool little system and
i think i added something here too

550
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
i think i added something here too
 

551
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,190
i think i added something here too
for sending potions to the nether but i

552
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
for sending potions to the nether but i
 

553
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,069
for sending potions to the nether but i
don't know if it really works

554
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
don't know if it really works
 

555
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,230
don't know if it really works
let's try that out i'm curious so you

556
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
let's try that out i'm curious so you
 

557
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,389
let's try that out i'm curious so you
could

558
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
could
 

559
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,190
could
let's go get some fire resistant potions

560
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
let's go get some fire resistant potions
 

561
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,750
let's go get some fire resistant potions
those

562
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
those
 

563
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,269
those
i think the only time i really use

564
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279

i think the only time i really use
potions is in the nether actually

potions is in the nether actually
i i usually will use uh fire resistance

i i usually will use uh fire resistance
 

569
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,670
i i usually will use uh fire resistance
and uh speed potions

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,430

anyways let's move on here last episode

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,310
or i showed you a a new system i built
here i think we're going to call it the

608
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
here i think we're going to call it the
 

609
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,269
here i think we're going to call it the
pixel

610
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
pixel
 

611
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,750
pixel
seem to be the the common thing but it's

612
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
seem to be the the common thing but it's
 

613
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,389
seem to be the the common thing but it's
a

614
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
a
 

615
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,750
a
shulker box storage system and i

616
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
shulker box storage system and i
 

617
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,470
shulker box storage system and i
tried to explain it as but i didn't do a

618
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
tried to explain it as but i didn't do a
 

619
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,069
tried to explain it as but i didn't do a
very good job

620
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
very good job
 

621
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,069
very good job
so there was a bunch of questions about

622
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
so there was a bunch of questions about
 

623
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,350
so there was a bunch of questions about
it that uh

624
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
it that uh
 

625
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,190
it that uh
maybe you could answer a few of them

626
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
maybe you could answer a few of them
 

627
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,110
maybe you could answer a few of them
here okay so i think one

628
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
here okay so i think one
 

629
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,949
here okay so i think one
question that came up was what happens

630
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
question that came up was what happens
 

631
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,310
question that came up was what happens
if you put an item in

632
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
if you put an item in
 

633
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,509
if you put an item in
that doesn't stack like

634
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
that doesn't stack like
 

635
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,910
that doesn't stack like
armor or enchanted books or that sort of

636
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
armor or enchanted books or that sort of
 

637
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,550
armor or enchanted books or that sort of
thing

638
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
thing
 

639
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,389
thing
i don't know if i actually tested that

640
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
i don't know if i actually tested that
 

641
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,990
i don't know if i actually tested that
so let's let's go ahead and give it a

642
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
so let's let's go ahead and give it a
 

643
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,949
so let's let's go ahead and give it a
try here

644
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
try here
 

645
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,670
try here
hopefully it doesn't wreck everything i

646
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
hopefully it doesn't wreck everything i
 

647
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,670
hopefully it doesn't wreck everything i
think it'll be okay though

648
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
think it'll be okay though
 

649
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,829
think it'll be okay though
what would probably mess it up is if you

650
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
what would probably mess it up is if you
 

651
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,230
what would probably mess it up is if you
had something that's stacked to 16 like

652
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
had something that's stacked to 16 like
 

653
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,990
had something that's stacked to 16 like
ender pearls

654
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
ender pearls
 

655
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,790
ender pearls
or eggs or that sort of thing probably

656
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
or eggs or that sort of thing probably
 

657
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,629
or eggs or that sort of thing probably
mess up the item filter

658
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
mess up the item filter
 

659
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,269
mess up the item filter
oh wait um let's search for gravel

660
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
oh wait um let's search for gravel
 

661
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,509
oh wait um let's search for gravel
you cannot search for items that that

662
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
you cannot search for items that that
 

663
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,030
you cannot search for items that that
don't stack though

664
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
don't stack though
 

665
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,430
don't stack though
that's a limitation of the system so i

666
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
that's a limitation of the system so i
 

667
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,990
that's a limitation of the system so i
can't search for armor for example

668
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
can't search for armor for example
 

669
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,629
can't search for armor for example
we got gravel we searched for gravel

670
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639

 

671
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,269

in here it's still searching

672
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279

 

673
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,949

oh

674
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959

 

675
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,269

that was a long search

676
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279

 

677
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,870

i'm wondering if it did it twice

678
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880

 

679
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,310

uh good question no i think

680
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
uh good question no i think
 

681
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,829
uh good question no i think
it's just long because we had so many

682
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
it's just long because we had so many
 

683
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,150
it's just long because we had so many
choker boxes right

684
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
choker boxes right
 

685
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,550
choker boxes right
uh it didn't seem to mess it up let's

686
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
uh it didn't seem to mess it up let's
 

687
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,150
uh it didn't seem to mess it up let's
just double check there's no items on

688
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
just double check there's no items on
 

689
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,190
just double check there's no items on
the ground anywhere

690
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200

 

691
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,030

yeah i think we're okay we did get the

692
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
yeah i think we're okay we did get the
 

693
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,629
yeah i think we're okay we did get the
gravel we searched for so i think that's

694
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
gravel we searched for so i think that's
 

695
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,269
gravel we searched for so i think that's
not an issue

696
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
not an issue
 

697
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,190
not an issue
actually i should probably clarify i

698
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
actually i should probably clarify i
 

699
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,470
actually i should probably clarify i
think we can have

700
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
think we can have
 

701
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,870
think we can have
ender pearls in our shulker boxes we

702
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
ender pearls in our shulker boxes we
 

703
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,110
ender pearls in our shulker boxes we
just can't do a search for them

704
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
just can't do a search for them
 

705
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,629
just can't do a search for them
because if we do a search for them it's

706
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
because if we do a search for them it's
 

707
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,230
because if we do a search for them it's
going to put an ender pearl in the item

708
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
going to put an ender pearl in the item
 

709
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,509
going to put an ender pearl in the item
filter

710
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
filter
 

711
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,110
filter
like if we if we have an ender pearl

712
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
like if we if we have an ender pearl
 

713
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,269
like if we if we have an ender pearl
here and throw it in because it stacks

714
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
here and throw it in because it stacks
 

715
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,430
here and throw it in because it stacks
the 16 it'll mess up the item filter if

716
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
the 16 it'll mess up the item filter if
 

717
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,189
the 16 it'll mess up the item filter if
it's allowed to enter it

718
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
it's allowed to enter it
 

719
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,750
it's allowed to enter it
uh but if it's just like an item in the

720
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
uh but if it's just like an item in the
 

721
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,829
uh but if it's just like an item in the
chest we're not looking for

722
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
chest we're not looking for
 

723
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,310
chest we're not looking for
it won't go into the item filter so

724
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
it won't go into the item filter so
 

725
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,509
it won't go into the item filter so
that's not a problem um

726
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
that's not a problem um
 

727
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,110
that's not a problem um
the other question is if we add more

728
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
the other question is if we add more
 

729
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,790
the other question is if we add more
shulker boxes does the search take

730
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
shulker boxes does the search take
 

731
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,829
shulker boxes does the search take
longer and yes

732
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
longer and yes
 

733
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,949
longer and yes
as we saw it can take longer also

734
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
as we saw it can take longer also
 

735
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,949
as we saw it can take longer also
a big question was what prevents it from

736
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
a big question was what prevents it from
 

737
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,870
a big question was what prevents it from
going into an infinite loop

738
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
going into an infinite loop
 

739
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,910
going into an infinite loop
because like

740
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
because like
 

741
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,990
because like
this shulker box gets searched first and

742
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
this shulker box gets searched first and
 

743
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,829
this shulker box gets searched first and
then it can re-enter here before it's

744
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
then it can re-enter here before it's
 

745
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,389
then it can re-enter here before it's
done

746
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
done
 

747
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,629
done
going through all all these other ones

748
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
going through all all these other ones
 

749
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,590
going through all all these other ones
right

750
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
right
 

751
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,829
right
uh no there's actually a system here to

752
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
uh no there's actually a system here to
 

753
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,350
uh no there's actually a system here to
prevent that that

754
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
prevent that that
 

755
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,150
prevent that that
redstone block there is a lock and

756
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
redstone block there is a lock and
 

757
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,590
redstone block there is a lock and
there's another one down there to hold

758
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
there's another one down there to hold
 

759
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,670
there's another one down there to hold
the items into

760
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
the items into
 

761
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,030
the items into
the chest over here and they alternate

762
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
the chest over here and they alternate
 

763
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,030
the chest over here and they alternate
from each other so basically

764
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
from each other so basically
 

765
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,949
from each other so basically
this is six chests tall over here right

766
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
this is six chests tall over here right
 

767
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,629
this is six chests tall over here right
six chests of shocker

768
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
six chests of shocker
 

769
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,350
six chests of shocker
box storage and then there's another six

770
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
box storage and then there's another six
 

771
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,670
box storage and then there's another six
chests above that so

772
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
chests above that so
 

773
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,710
chests above that so
uh double the storage above that

774
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
uh double the storage above that
 

775
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,790
uh double the storage above that
or not double but you know like copy

776
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
or not double but you know like copy
 

777
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,189
or not double but you know like copy
i'm great at explaining things aren't i

778
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
i'm great at explaining things aren't i
 

779
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,509
i'm great at explaining things aren't i
um there's an equal amount of storage

780
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
um there's an equal amount of storage
 

781
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,269
um there's an equal amount of storage
above that as a reserve it waits until

782
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
above that as a reserve it waits until
 

783
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:07,750
above that as a reserve it waits until
it

784
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
it
 

785
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,269
it
finishes searching through all the

786
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
finishes searching through all the
 

787
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,590
finishes searching through all the
shulker boxes and then it allows them to

788
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
shulker boxes and then it allows them to
 

789
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,350
shulker boxes and then it allows them to
re-enter

790
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
re-enter
 

791
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,430
re-enter
this bottom half uh we'll try to see

792
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
this bottom half uh we'll try to see
 

793
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,949
this bottom half uh we'll try to see
that happening here

794
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
that happening here
 

795
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,750
that happening here
um but i've recorded this a few times

796
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
um but i've recorded this a few times
 

797
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,269
um but i've recorded this a few times
and failed

798
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
and failed
 

799
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,269
and failed
so yeah you see that that redstone block

800
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
so yeah you see that that redstone block
 

801
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,110
so yeah you see that that redstone block
is over there so it's blocking this

802
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
is over there so it's blocking this
 

803
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,550
is over there so it's blocking this
chest here i think anything in here

804
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
chest here i think anything in here
 

805
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,470
chest here i think anything in here
oh not that chest

806
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
oh not that chest
 

807
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,829
oh not that chest
 some hopper oh darn

808
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839

 

809
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,949

yeah i'm great at explaining things

810
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
yeah i'm great at explaining things
 

811
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,629
yeah i'm great at explaining things
part of the problem is i can't actually

812
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
part of the problem is i can't actually
 

813
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,910
part of the problem is i can't actually
see anything

814
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920

 

815
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,670

wait a second what does this redstone

816
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
wait a second what does this redstone
 

817
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,829
wait a second what does this redstone
block do guys it locks this hopper so

818
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
block do guys it locks this hopper so
 

819
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,310
block do guys it locks this hopper so
it's

820
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
it's
 

821
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,189
it's
oh so it prevents items from this chest

822
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
oh so it prevents items from this chest
 

823
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,749
oh so it prevents items from this chest
going down not this one

824
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
going down not this one
 

825
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,790
going down not this one
uh maybe we'll try that again

826
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
uh maybe we'll try that again
 

827
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,310
uh maybe we'll try that again
there's my steak let's try it again

828
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
there's my steak let's try it again
 

829
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,710
there's my steak let's try it again
also uh question was can i do a research

830
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
also uh question was can i do a research
 

831
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,910
also uh question was can i do a research
so can we search

832
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
so can we search
 

833
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,110
so can we search
uh stone blocks again i added this

834
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
uh stone blocks again i added this
 

835
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,629
uh stone blocks again i added this
button here to do that but i

836
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
button here to do that but i
 

837
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,990
button here to do that but i
think it's not working

838
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
think it's not working
 

839
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,069
think it's not working
i think we would have to activate it

840
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
i think we would have to activate it
 

841
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,990
i think we would have to activate it
over here

842
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000

 

843
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,629

nope oh yeah yeah it's going i think

844
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
nope oh yeah yeah it's going i think
 

845
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,949
nope oh yeah yeah it's going i think
that's searching for stone blocks again

846
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959

 

847
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,470

we'll see no

848
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
we'll see no
 

849
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,470
we'll see no
no it didn't work nothing showed up here

850
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
no it didn't work nothing showed up here
 

851
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,550
no it didn't work nothing showed up here
it was like an empty search wait a

852
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
it was like an empty search wait a
 

853
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,710
it was like an empty search wait a
minute actually it was in there

854
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
minute actually it was in there
 

855
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,150
minute actually it was in there
it just didn't shoot it from the

856
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
it just didn't shoot it from the
 

857
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,269
it just didn't shoot it from the
dispenser

858
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279

 

859
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,670

okay so it kind of worked this thing has

860
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
okay so it kind of worked this thing has
 

861
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,030
okay so it kind of worked this thing has
a bunch of flaws though i'm gonna have

862
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
a bunch of flaws though i'm gonna have
 

863
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,430
a bunch of flaws though i'm gonna have
to

864
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
to
 

865
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,150
to
fix up and i'm like picking up shulker

866
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
fix up and i'm like picking up shulker
 

867
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,749
fix up and i'm like picking up shulker
boxes that are shooting out of it

868
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
boxes that are shooting out of it
 

869
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,389
boxes that are shooting out of it
because that's still an issue right now

870
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
because that's still an issue right now
 

871
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,030
because that's still an issue right now
but my plan with the system guys after

872
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
but my plan with the system guys after
 

873
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,310
but my plan with the system guys after
looking at your feedback

874
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
looking at your feedback
 

875
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,429
looking at your feedback
and like after building one of these and

876
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
and like after building one of these and
 

877
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,990
and like after building one of these and
seeing ways of improving it kind of want

878
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
seeing ways of improving it kind of want
 

879
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,829
seeing ways of improving it kind of want
to redesign it

880
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
to redesign it
 

881
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,510
to redesign it
and see if i can make it better because

882
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
and see if i can make it better because
 

883
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,150
and see if i can make it better because
at the moment it's like

884
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
at the moment it's like
 

885
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,630
at the moment it's like
on the verge of being practical and good

886
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
on the verge of being practical and good
 

887
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,549
on the verge of being practical and good
but i don't know it could be improved

888
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
but i don't know it could be improved
 

889
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,549
but i don't know it could be improved
because like if we look through these

890
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
because like if we look through these
 

891
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,189
because like if we look through these
shulker boxes just manually

892
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
shulker boxes just manually
 

893
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,029
shulker boxes just manually
it's about the same speed as the system

894
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
it's about the same speed as the system
 

895
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,590
it's about the same speed as the system
can run there's a speed limit to it

896
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
can run there's a speed limit to it
 

897
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,830
can run there's a speed limit to it
which is the speed of hoppers

898
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
which is the speed of hoppers
 

899
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,830
which is the speed of hoppers
at the absolute fastest you can search

900
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
at the absolute fastest you can search
 

901
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,310
at the absolute fastest you can search
is two and a half shocker boxes a

902
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
is two and a half shocker boxes a
 

903
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,070
is two and a half shocker boxes a
second which we can manually do

904
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
second which we can manually do
 

905
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,830
second which we can manually do
way faster than that so that's kind of

906
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
way faster than that so that's kind of
 

907
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,150
way faster than that so that's kind of
an issue

908
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
an issue
 

909
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,549
an issue
it is pulse possible to combine more

910
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
it is pulse possible to combine more
 

911
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,070
it is pulse possible to combine more
than one search engine

912
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
than one search engine
 

913
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,909
than one search engine
together the problem with that though is

914
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
together the problem with that though is
 

915
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,750
together the problem with that though is
once you take the boxes you've searched

916
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
once you take the boxes you've searched
 

917
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,230
once you take the boxes you've searched
and

918
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
and
 

919
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,230
and
re-entered them into the system like

920
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
re-entered them into the system like
 

921
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,669
re-entered them into the system like
let's say they have to go through the

922
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
let's say they have to go through the
 

923
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,789
let's say they have to go through the
chest

924
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
chest
 

925
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,789
chest
and hopper chain we have over there

926
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
and hopper chain we have over there
 

927
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,710
and hopper chain we have over there
again you're limited by the speed of the

928
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
again you're limited by the speed of the
 

929
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,950
again you're limited by the speed of the
hoppers so if you have

930
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
hoppers so if you have
 

931
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,230
hoppers so if you have
10 items entering a hopper you still got

932
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
10 items entering a hopper you still got
 

933
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,350
10 items entering a hopper you still got
to wait for them to go through that

934
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
to wait for them to go through that
 

935
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,110
to wait for them to go through that
hopper

936
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
hopper
 

937
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,789
hopper
so there's this kind of limitations in

938
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
so there's this kind of limitations in
 

939
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,150
so there's this kind of limitations in

other thing i would do different if i
redesign this is get rid of these manual

944
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
redesign this is get rid of these manual

947
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,549

elevators or these the ones that rely on

948
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
elevators or these the ones that rely on
 

949
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,070
elevators or these the ones that rely on
physics i would actually put in a

950
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
physics i would actually put in a
 

951
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,350
physics i would actually put in a
dropper

952
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
dropper
 

953
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,870
dropper
elevator here instead because you could

954
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
elevator here instead because you could
 

955
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,470
elevator here instead because you could
do that much faster

956
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
do that much faster
 

957
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,549
do that much faster
that would cut down on the startup and

958
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
that would cut down on the startup and
 

959
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,350
that would cut down on the startup and
ending times of the search

960
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
ending times of the search
 

961
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,590
ending times of the search
and another big thing you guys mentioned

962
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
and another big thing you guys mentioned
 

963
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,830
and another big thing you guys mentioned
is we need to set up some sort of deep

964
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
is we need to set up some sort of deep
 

965
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,950
is we need to set up some sort of deep
fragger

966
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
fragger
 

967
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,310
fragger
so this is kind of like a hard drive um

968
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
so this is kind of like a hard drive um
 

969
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,990
so this is kind of like a hard drive um
in our example here we have a lot of

970
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
in our example here we have a lot of
 

971
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,270
in our example here we have a lot of
chests with empty space in

972
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
chests with empty space in
 

973
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,830
chests with empty space in
let's let's take a look at these over

974
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
let's let's take a look at these over
 

975
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,630
let's let's take a look at these over
here we have

976
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
here we have
 

977
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,310
here we have
only one third of the chest is full

978
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
only one third of the chest is full
 

979
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,990
only one third of the chest is full
right over here this

980
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
right over here this
 

981
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,750
right over here this
we only got three stacks of items in

982
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
we only got three stacks of items in
 

983
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,909
we only got three stacks of items in
here there's a lot of wasted space and

984
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
here there's a lot of wasted space and
 

985
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,950
here there's a lot of wasted space and
that slows down the search time

986
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:03,960
that slows down the search time
 

987
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,789
that slows down the search time
significantly so if we wanted to make a

988
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
significantly so if we wanted to make a
 

989
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,270
significantly so if we wanted to make a
good

990
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
good
 

991
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,110
good
practical fast system we would want some

992
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
practical fast system we would want some
 

993
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,549
practical fast system we would want some
way of combining

994
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
way of combining
 

995
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,310
way of combining
these shulker boxes together the

996
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
these shulker boxes together the
 

997
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,549
these shulker boxes together the
contents together so

998
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
contents together so
 

999
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,710
contents together so
we could easily fit these three into one

1000
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
we could easily fit these three into one
 

1001
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,789
we could easily fit these three into one
and that would make the search

1002
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
and that would make the search
 

1003
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,830
and that would make the search
like three times faster for this case

1004
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:23,840
like three times faster for this case
 

1005
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,270
like three times faster for this case
here i tell you what guys we're going to

1006
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
here i tell you what guys we're going to
 

1007
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,190
here i tell you what guys we're going to
actually try to design that together we

1008
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
actually try to design that together we
 

1009
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,870
actually try to design that together we
want to make a device

1010
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
want to make a device
 

1011
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,510
want to make a device
to combine shocker boxes together

1012
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
to combine shocker boxes together
 

1013
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,950
to combine shocker boxes together
somehow

1014
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
somehow
 

1015
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,350
somehow
sounds like a fun little project so

1016
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
sounds like a fun little project so
 

1017
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,310
sounds like a fun little project so
probably start off with a chest of

1018
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
probably start off with a chest of
 

1019
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,630
probably start off with a chest of
shocker boxes right that are

1020
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
shocker boxes right that are
 

1021
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,470
shocker boxes right that are
not not totally full there'll be some

1022
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
not not totally full there'll be some
 

1023
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,909
not not totally full there'll be some
empty space in them or they might be

1024
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
empty space in them or they might be
 

1025
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,710
empty space in them or they might be
full

1026
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
full
 

1027
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,830
full
um and then we got to sort through them

1028
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
um and then we got to sort through them
 

1029
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,950
um and then we got to sort through them
and try to combine their content somehow

1030
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
and try to combine their content somehow
 

1031
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,750
and try to combine their content somehow
so

1032
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
so
 

1033
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,510
so
oh let's keep this locked for right now

1034
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
oh let's keep this locked for right now
 

1035
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,870
oh let's keep this locked for right now
so they'll kind of just wait in here

1036
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
so they'll kind of just wait in here
 

1037
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,950
so they'll kind of just wait in here
until we unlock it

1038
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960
until we unlock it
 

1039
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,549
until we unlock it
all right and this is an empty shulker

1040
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
all right and this is an empty shulker
 

1041
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,830
all right and this is an empty shulker
box right yeah

1042
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840

 

1043
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,430

oh there's the other one i was like man

1044
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
oh there's the other one i was like man
 

1045
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,310
oh there's the other one i was like man
i thought i brought five boxes

1046
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
i thought i brought five boxes
 

1047
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,149
i thought i brought five boxes
okay so these are probably gonna go into

1048
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
okay so these are probably gonna go into
 

1049
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,630
okay so these are probably gonna go into
a dispenser to place them in the world

1050
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
a dispenser to place them in the world
 

1051
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,149
a dispenser to place them in the world
and then we have to shift the contents

1052
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
and then we have to shift the contents
 

1053
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,470
and then we have to shift the contents
from the semi-full boxes or the full

1054
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
from the semi-full boxes or the full
 

1055
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,830
from the semi-full boxes or the full
boxes

1056
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
boxes
 

1057
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,110
boxes
into the

1058
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
into the
 

1059
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,590
into the
the totally full boxes we're trying to

1060
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
the totally full boxes we're trying to
 

1061
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,630
the totally full boxes we're trying to
fill up

1062
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
fill up
 

1063
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,029
fill up
does that make sense so we're probably

1064
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
does that make sense so we're probably
 

1065
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,870
does that make sense so we're probably
gonna need another

1066
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
gonna need another
 

1067
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,270
gonna need another
dispenser mechanism down here for

1068
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
dispenser mechanism down here for
 

1069
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,750
dispenser mechanism down here for
placing an empty shulker box

1070
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
placing an empty shulker box
 

1071
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,630
placing an empty shulker box
so like this one over here that'll place

1072
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
so like this one over here that'll place
 

1073
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,990
so like this one over here that'll place
it in the world

1074
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
it in the world
 

1075
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,830
it in the world
and then we'll have our semi-full ones

1076
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
and then we'll have our semi-full ones
 

1077
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,110
and then we'll have our semi-full ones
or full ones up here

1078
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120

 

1079
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,830

oh yeah that's empty right now that will

1080
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
oh yeah that's empty right now that will
 

1081
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,230
oh yeah that's empty right now that will
get placed and then we need to

1082
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
get placed and then we need to
 

1083
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,230
get placed and then we need to
like shift the contents from the one

1084
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
like shift the contents from the one
 

1085
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,390
like shift the contents from the one
above down below now if we just use a

1086
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
above down below now if we just use a
 

1087
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,390
above down below now if we just use a
hopper that'll work

1088
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
hopper that'll work
 

1089
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,590
hopper that'll work
but it'd be pretty slow okay so the

1090
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
but it'd be pretty slow okay so the
 

1091
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,950
but it'd be pretty slow okay so the
trick to getting around

1092
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
trick to getting around
 

1093
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,590
trick to getting around
the slow nature of hoppers is to use

1094
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
the slow nature of hoppers is to use
 

1095
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,950
the slow nature of hoppers is to use
hopper mine carts because you can

1096
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
hopper mine carts because you can
 

1097
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,590
hopper mine carts because you can
combine a bunch of them together

1098
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
combine a bunch of them together
 

1099
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,870
combine a bunch of them together
in like no space at all the problem

1100
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
in like no space at all the problem
 

1101
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,870
in like no space at all the problem
here though is i don't think you can

1102
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
here though is i don't think you can
 

1103
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,870
here though is i don't think you can
place a track

1104
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
place a track
 

1105
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,710
place a track
on a shulker box no you can't so we

1106
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
on a shulker box no you can't so we
 

1107
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,710
on a shulker box no you can't so we
can't just put it right above this

1108
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
can't just put it right above this
 

1109
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,270
can't just put it right above this
we're gonna have to offset it like half

1110
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
we're gonna have to offset it like half
 

1111
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,149
we're gonna have to offset it like half
a block

1112
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
a block
 

1113
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,430
a block
so we'll put a fence there that way we

1114
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
so we'll put a fence there that way we
 

1115
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:25,909
so we'll put a fence there that way we
can

1116
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
can
 

1117
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,549
can
align it somehow and then we can have

1118
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
align it somehow and then we can have
 

1119
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,270
align it somehow and then we can have
like a piston here

1120
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
like a piston here
 

1121
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,789
like a piston here
put our track here and then we can

1122
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
put our track here and then we can
 

1123
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,950
put our track here and then we can
combine as many

1124
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
combine as many
 

1125
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,110
combine as many
hopper mine carts as we want here the

1126
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
hopper mine carts as we want here the
 

1127
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,789
hopper mine carts as we want here the
more we put the faster it'll transfer

1128
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
more we put the faster it'll transfer
 

1129
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,230
more we put the faster it'll transfer
the items between the two boxes

1130
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
the items between the two boxes
 

1131
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,510
the items between the two boxes
yeah that seems to be working good okay

1132
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
yeah that seems to be working good okay
 

1133
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,830
yeah that seems to be working good okay
and then we gotta like break the chest

1134
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
and then we gotta like break the chest
 

1135
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,870
and then we gotta like break the chest
or the

1136
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
or the
 

1137
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,830
or the
track yeah there we go that works and

1138
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
track yeah there we go that works and
 

1139
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,230
track yeah there we go that works and
then with the piston we can

1140
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
then with the piston we can
 

1141
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,310
then with the piston we can
hopefully just push him over

1142
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
hopefully just push him over
 

1143
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,590
hopefully just push him over
was that not a button i'm confused i

1144
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
was that not a button i'm confused i
 

1145
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,230
was that not a button i'm confused i
thought i placed the button down

1146
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240
thought i placed the button down
 

1147
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,669
thought i placed the button down
i'm losing my mind i thought i just made

1148
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
i'm losing my mind i thought i just made
 

1149
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,470
i'm losing my mind i thought i just made
one button

1150
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
one button
 

1151
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,029
one button
oh piston translocation

1152
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
oh piston translocation
 

1153
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,430
oh piston translocation
i love piston translocation but it's

1154
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
i love piston translocation but it's
 

1155
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,470
i love piston translocation but it's
really been uh

1156
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
really been uh
 

1157
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,750
really been uh
it's getting me lately okay i got those

1158
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
it's getting me lately okay i got those
 

1159
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,430
it's getting me lately okay i got those
set up again let's try this again

1160
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
set up again let's try this again
 

1161
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,430
set up again let's try this again
i'm gonna use a lever this time though

1162
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
i'm gonna use a lever this time though
 

1163
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,029
i'm gonna use a lever this time though
so when we pull that

1164
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
so when we pull that
 

1165
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,669
so when we pull that
kind of offsets it half a block and then

1166
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
kind of offsets it half a block and then
 

1167
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,350
kind of offsets it half a block and then
we break the piston

1168
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
we break the piston
 

1169
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,990
we break the piston
so now any

1170
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000

 

1171
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,430

you know i shouldn't have placed it

1172
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
you know i shouldn't have placed it
 

1173
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,070
you know i shouldn't have placed it
there

1174
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080

 

1175
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,270

because it's going to pull items out of

1176
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
because it's going to pull items out of
 

1177
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,590
because it's going to pull items out of
the dispenser too not just the shulker

1178
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
the dispenser too not just the shulker
 

1179
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,510
the dispenser too not just the shulker
box

1180
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
box
 

1181
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,029
box
oh it's not even placing them in there

1182
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
oh it's not even placing them in there
 

1183
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,520
oh it's not even placing them in there
ew

1184
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:47,530

why would that be i'm not really sure

1188
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
why would that be i'm not really sure
 

1189
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,470
why would that be i'm not really sure
okay okay i moved it to the other side

1190
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
okay okay i moved it to the other side
 

1191
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,390
okay okay i moved it to the other side
here but it's still not doing what i

1192
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
here but it's still not doing what i
 

1193
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,310
here but it's still not doing what i
want to do it's not placing the items in

1194
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
want to do it's not placing the items in
 

1195
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,190
want to do it's not placing the items in
the shulker box here

1196
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
the shulker box here
 

1197
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,230
the shulker box here
and honestly i'm not really sure why

1198
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
and honestly i'm not really sure why
 

1199
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,630
and honestly i'm not really sure why
so we're going to try maybe a trapdoor

1200
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
so we're going to try maybe a trapdoor
 

1201
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,350
so we're going to try maybe a trapdoor
instead

1202
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
instead
 

1203
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,390
instead
of a fence gate

1204
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
of a fence gate
 

1205
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,310
of a fence gate
and let's try this one more time

1206
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
and let's try this one more time
 

1207
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,149
and let's try this one more time
oh i did it again so stupid

1208
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
oh i did it again so stupid
 

1209
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,710
oh i did it again so stupid
okay let's just let's leave the one

1210
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
okay let's just let's leave the one
 

1211
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,549
okay let's just let's leave the one
minecart there at least

1212
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
minecart there at least
 

1213
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,270
minecart there at least
okay so now if we put items in here

1214
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,280
okay so now if we put items in here
 

1215
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,270
okay so now if we put items in here
still don't go into the shulker box oh

1216
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
still don't go into the shulker box oh
 

1217
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,149
still don't go into the shulker box oh
because it can't open now right

1218
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
because it can't open now right
 

1219
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,070
because it can't open now right
let's break that still doesn't go in

1220
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080

 

1221
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,830

does it need to be on a rail

1222
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840

 

1223
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,070

even on a rail it's not working i'm so

1224
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,080
even on a rail it's not working i'm so
 

1225
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,710
even on a rail it's not working i'm so
confused

1226
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720

 

1227
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,149

this is one we won't put the items in

1228
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159
this is one we won't put the items in
 

1229
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,950
this is one we won't put the items in
so admittedly my memory in this game is

1230
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
so admittedly my memory in this game is
 

1231
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,630
so admittedly my memory in this game is
not the best but i thought

1232
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
not the best but i thought
 

1233
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,789
not the best but i thought
at one point you could transfer items

1234
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
at one point you could transfer items
 

1235
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,390
at one point you could transfer items
from a hopper mine carts

1236
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
from a hopper mine carts
 

1237
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,390
from a hopper mine carts
into like a chest or something by

1238
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
into like a chest or something by
 

1239
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,149
into like a chest or something by
putting it on top

1240
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
putting it on top
 

1241
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,510
putting it on top
could be wrong on that could be wrong

1242
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
could be wrong on that could be wrong
 

1243
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,909
could be wrong on that could be wrong
it does work if you do it to a hopper

1244
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
it does work if you do it to a hopper
 

1245
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,789
it does work if you do it to a hopper
though

1246
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
though
 

1247
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,350
though
uh problem is we're trying to do this to

1248
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
uh problem is we're trying to do this to
 

1249
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,070
uh problem is we're trying to do this to
avoid the speed limit of a hopper

1250
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,080
avoid the speed limit of a hopper
 

1251
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,510
avoid the speed limit of a hopper
so we may as well just use a normal

1252
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
so we may as well just use a normal
 

1253
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,470
so we may as well just use a normal
hopper then

1254
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
hopper then
 

1255
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,549
hopper then
we can't really get around this the slow

1256
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
we can't really get around this the slow
 

1257
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,710
we can't really get around this the slow
nature of it then

1258
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
nature of it then
 

1259
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,950
nature of it then
unfortunately so

1260
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960

 

1261
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,029

wait where did uh oh i got it on me

1262
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039
wait where did uh oh i got it on me
 

1263
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,310
wait where did uh oh i got it on me
again

1264
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
again
 

1265
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,029
again
okay so basically shulker box will get

1266
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
okay so basically shulker box will get
 

1267
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,990
okay so basically shulker box will get
placed there

1268
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,000
placed there
 

1269
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,909
placed there
contents will start draining down into

1270
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
contents will start draining down into
 

1271
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,909
contents will start draining down into
here very slowly

1272
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919
here very slowly
 

1273
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,870
here very slowly
and then what do we need to do i guess

1274
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
and then what do we need to do i guess
 

1275
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,430
and then what do we need to do i guess
we gotta detect when this empties

1276
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
we gotta detect when this empties
 

1277
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,110
we gotta detect when this empties
and when it empties then we

1278
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,120
and when it empties then we
 

1279
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,990
and when it empties then we
break it and change it out with another

1280
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
break it and change it out with another
 

1281
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,870
break it and change it out with another
one

1282
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
one
 

1283
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,390
one
from the q here right

1284
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
from the q here right
 

1285
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,750
from the q here right
likewise when this one is is full

1286
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
likewise when this one is is full
 

1287
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,669
likewise when this one is is full
or when items stop transferring into it

1288
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
or when items stop transferring into it
 

1289
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,149
or when items stop transferring into it
then we need to switch it out with a new

1290
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
then we need to switch it out with a new
 

1291
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,350
then we need to switch it out with a new
empty

1292
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
empty
 

1293
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,470
empty
shocker box right so we could do that by

1294
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
shocker box right so we could do that by
 

1295
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,230
shocker box right so we could do that by
detecting

1296
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
detecting
 

1297
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,830
detecting
if items are flowing through this hopper

1298
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:26,840
if items are flowing through this hopper
 

1299
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,070
if items are flowing through this hopper
maybe

1300
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
maybe
 

1301
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,070
maybe
so once there's no items flowing through

1302
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
so once there's no items flowing through
 

1303
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,149
so once there's no items flowing through
here then

1304
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
here then
 

1305
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,870
here then
it switches this box with the new one so

1306
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
it switches this box with the new one so
 

1307
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,230
it switches this box with the new one so
this shut off now

1308
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
this shut off now
 

1309
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,430
this shut off now
so then this would break and it would

1310
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
so then this would break and it would
 

1311
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,549
so then this would break and it would
maybe place a new one

1312
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:44,559

 

1313
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,669

it's actually a little bit of a

1314
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
it's actually a little bit of a
 

1315
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,390
it's actually a little bit of a
complicated thing we also need to know

1316
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
complicated thing we also need to know
 

1317
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,350
complicated thing we also need to know
when we're done

1318
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
when we're done
 

1319
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,190
when we're done
like when there's no more boxes here so

1320
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
like when there's no more boxes here so
 

1321
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,549
like when there's no more boxes here so
we would need another

1322
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
we would need another
 

1323
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,990
we would need another
detector here when there's no more items

1324
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
detector here when there's no more items
 

1325
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,269
detector here when there's no more items
flowing through here

1326
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279

 

1327
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,110

then we know we're done

1328
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120

 

1329
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,669

okay so i might have uh figured out one

1330
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
okay so i might have uh figured out one
 

1331
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,110
okay so i might have uh figured out one
part of this anyway

1332
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
part of this anyway
 

1333
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,870
part of this anyway
it's actually a little bit of a tricky

1334
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
it's actually a little bit of a tricky
 

1335
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,950
it's actually a little bit of a tricky
puzzle uh so

1336
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
puzzle uh so
 

1337
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,789
puzzle uh so
let's do a little test run here we'll

1338
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
let's do a little test run here we'll
 

1339
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,870
let's do a little test run here we'll
put a couple items in here

1340
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
put a couple items in here
 

1341
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,070
put a couple items in here
a couple items in here a few in there

1342
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
a couple items in here a few in there
 

1343
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,590
a couple items in here a few in there
so we're going to take these three boxes

1344
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
so we're going to take these three boxes
 

1345
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,230
so we're going to take these three boxes
we'll put them in the dispenser

1346
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
we'll put them in the dispenser
 

1347
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,070
we'll put them in the dispenser
and then it should automatically

1348
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
and then it should automatically
 

1349
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,669
and then it should automatically
put them into our shulker box down here

1350
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
put them into our shulker box down here
 

1351
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,149
put them into our shulker box down here
so let's give it a try

1352
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
so let's give it a try
 

1353
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,830
so let's give it a try
so that turns this comparator on over

1354
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
so that turns this comparator on over
 

1355
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,789
so that turns this comparator on over
here

1356
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799

 

1357
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,310

and then when it runs out of items it

1358
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,320
and then when it runs out of items it
 

1359
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,470
and then when it runs out of items it
does that so that put the

1360
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
does that so that put the
 

1361
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,470
does that so that put the
chalker box into this hopper on the side

1362
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
chalker box into this hopper on the side
 

1363
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,430
chalker box into this hopper on the side
here

1364
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,440

 

1365
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,310

these are all empty yeah that's good

1366
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
these are all empty yeah that's good
 

1367
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,230
these are all empty yeah that's good
okay yeah so those items went down into

1368
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
okay yeah so those items went down into
 

1369
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,710
okay yeah so those items went down into
the shulker box down here

1370
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
the shulker box down here
 

1371
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,149
the shulker box down here
this is what the redstone looks like

1372
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
this is what the redstone looks like
 

1373
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,390
this is what the redstone looks like
currently so what we

1374
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
currently so what we
 

1375
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,630
currently so what we
could do then is detect

1376
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
could do then is detect
 

1377
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,190
could do then is detect
when this hopper goes from no items to

1378
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
when this hopper goes from no items to
 

1379
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,430
when this hopper goes from no items to
items passing through

1380
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
items passing through
 

1381
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,470
items passing through
i suppose so we put a block here

1382
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
i suppose so we put a block here
 

1383
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,230
i suppose so we put a block here
and just run it to the dropper or the

1384
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
and just run it to the dropper or the
 

1385
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,950
and just run it to the dropper or the
dispenser here right

1386
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
dispenser here right
 

1387
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,269
dispenser here right
oh i don't know why that scared me

1388
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
oh i don't know why that scared me
 

1389
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,269
oh i don't know why that scared me
i can't get used to that sound that's a

1390
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
i can't get used to that sound that's a
 

1391
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,029
i can't get used to that sound that's a
zombie villager it's just

1392
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
zombie villager it's just
 

1393
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,710
zombie villager it's just
it's like the most scary sound in the

1394
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
it's like the most scary sound in the
 

1395
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,870
it's like the most scary sound in the
game right now to me

1396
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
game right now to me
 

1397
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,470
game right now to me
i don't know why okay we only need this

1398
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
i don't know why okay we only need this
 

1399
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,149
i don't know why okay we only need this
to activate once

1400
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,159
to activate once
 

1401
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,750
to activate once
all right and then it does its own loop

1402
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
all right and then it does its own loop
 

1403
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,750
all right and then it does its own loop
thing so let's try this again we've got

1404
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,760
thing so let's try this again we've got
 

1405
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,149
thing so let's try this again we've got
some boxes

1406
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
some boxes
 

1407
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,510
some boxes
let's put them in the chest this time

1408
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,520
let's put them in the chest this time
 

1409
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,870
let's put them in the chest this time
uh this is locked i think okay so when

1410
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
uh this is locked i think okay so when
 

1411
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,549
uh this is locked i think okay so when
we unpower this

1412
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
we unpower this
 

1413
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,909
we unpower this
should do it all on its own now

1414
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919

 

1415
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,590

nope oh we need a delay here

1416
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
nope oh we need a delay here
 

1417
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,510
nope oh we need a delay here
a little bit of a delay

1418
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520

 

1419
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,230

okay because it activates the dispenser

1420
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
okay because it activates the dispenser
 

1421
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,630
okay because it activates the dispenser
before the shocker boxes actually get to

1422
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
before the shocker boxes actually get to
 

1423
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,909
before the shocker boxes actually get to
it i think

1424
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
it i think
 

1425
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,750
it i think
try one more time

1426
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760

 

1427
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,149

there we go place the first one it's

1428
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
there we go place the first one it's
 

1429
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,269
there we go place the first one it's
draining

1430
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
draining
 

1431
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,029
draining
items are going into here

1432
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:15,039

 

1433
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,070

good

1434
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080

 

1435
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,430

aha okay so here's the problem whenever

1436
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
aha okay so here's the problem whenever
 

1437
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,430
aha okay so here's the problem whenever
you make something with redstone you

1438
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
you make something with redstone you
 

1439
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,590
you make something with redstone you
always got to think of what is the worst

1440
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
always got to think of what is the worst
 

1441
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,990
always got to think of what is the worst
case what could possibly break the thing

1442
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
case what could possibly break the thing
 

1443
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,070
case what could possibly break the thing
you've made

1444
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
you've made
 

1445
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,110
you've made
and because this by default is off

1446
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
and because this by default is off
 

1447
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,149
and because this by default is off
if we put an empty shulker box in here

1448
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:36,159
if we put an empty shulker box in here
 

1449
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,190
if we put an empty shulker box in here
nothing changes so this gets placed

1450
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
nothing changes so this gets placed
 

1451
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,389
nothing changes so this gets placed
and then that's it it breaks it

1452
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
and then that's it it breaks it
 

1453
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,950
and then that's it it breaks it
not really sure what to do about that so

1454
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:44,960
not really sure what to do about that so
 

1455
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,789
not really sure what to do about that so
in our storage room if we had any empty

1456
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:46,799
in our storage room if we had any empty
 

1457
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,710
in our storage room if we had any empty
shulker boxes it would break this

1458
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
shulker boxes it would break this
 

1459
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,590
shulker boxes it would break this
this thing we would have to add

1460
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
this thing we would have to add
 

1461
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,389
this thing we would have to add
something else

1462
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
something else
 

1463
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,350
something else
for that also i realized if we

1464
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360
for that also i realized if we
 

1465
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,389
for that also i realized if we
uh just detect if items are flowing

1466
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:00,399
uh just detect if items are flowing
 

1467
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,789
uh just detect if items are flowing
through here

1468
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
through here
 

1469
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,149
through here
that's not gonna work either i'm not

1470
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
that's not gonna work either i'm not
 

1471
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,029
that's not gonna work either i'm not
sure how to tell when this box is full

1472
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
sure how to tell when this box is full
 

1473
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,950
sure how to tell when this box is full
because it might be like we have three

1474
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
because it might be like we have three
 

1475
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,430
because it might be like we have three
birch fences in

1476
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
birch fences in
 

1477
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,029
birch fences in
and that doesn't count as a full stack

1478
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
and that doesn't count as a full stack
 

1479
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,710
and that doesn't count as a full stack
so it's not going to output a full

1480
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
so it's not going to output a full
 

1481
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,630
so it's not going to output a full
like 15 length signal from here

1482
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
like 15 length signal from here
 

1483
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,789
like 15 length signal from here
a little bit of a tricky thing to uh

1484
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
a little bit of a tricky thing to uh
 

1485
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,710
a little bit of a tricky thing to uh
figure out isn't it

1486
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:22,720
figure out isn't it
 

1487
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,149
figure out isn't it
if you guys have any ideas let me know

1488
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
if you guys have any ideas let me know
 

1489
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,590
if you guys have any ideas let me know
i'm kind of out of ideas for today

1490
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
i'm kind of out of ideas for today
 

1491
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,470
i'm kind of out of ideas for today
though

1492
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
though
 

1493
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,789
though
um i think we will wrap up our episode

1494
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799

 

1495
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,549

all right guys so our comment of the day

1496
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
all right guys so our comment of the day
 

1497
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,230
all right guys so our comment of the day
here it says the main issue

1498
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
here it says the main issue
 

1499
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,149
here it says the main issue
that this system may have that's the

1500
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159
that this system may have that's the
 

1501
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,750
that this system may have that's the
pixel

1502
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:39,760
pixel
 

1503
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,510
pixel
search engine system we were just

1504
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
search engine system we were just
 

1505
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,789
search engine system we were just
talking about

1506
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799
talking about
 

1507
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,029
talking about
is if there's a substantial amount of

1508
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
is if there's a substantial amount of
 

1509
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,310
is if there's a substantial amount of
boxes in the system

1510
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
boxes in the system
 

1511
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,750
boxes in the system
say 200 and the box that has the torches

1512
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
say 200 and the box that has the torches
 

1513
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,470
say 200 and the box that has the torches
is at the topmost stack then it will

1514
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:52,480
is at the topmost stack then it will
 

1515
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,789
is at the topmost stack then it will
take a long time to be sorted out

1516
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:56,799
take a long time to be sorted out
 

1517
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,630
take a long time to be sorted out
yeah that is definitely an issue with

1518
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
yeah that is definitely an issue with
 

1519
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,389
yeah that is definitely an issue with
the system and the reason why it might

1520
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
the system and the reason why it might
 

1521
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,549
the system and the reason why it might
not be practical currently

1522
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
not be practical currently
 

1523
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,070
not be practical currently
so with the thing we just made there the

1524
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
so with the thing we just made there the
 

1525
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,590
so with the thing we just made there the
defragger

1526
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
defragger
 

1527
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,110
defragger
would help out a lot it would speed

1528
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,120
would help out a lot it would speed
 

1529
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,510
would help out a lot it would speed
things up a lot but another idea would

1530
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
things up a lot but another idea would
 

1531
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:11,830
things up a lot but another idea would
be

1532
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:11,840
be
 

1533
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,750
be
to somehow introduce categories

1534
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
to somehow introduce categories
 

1535
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,389
to somehow introduce categories
into our system so for example if we

1536
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399
into our system so for example if we
 

1537
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,470
into our system so for example if we
have 200 shulker boxes

1538
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
have 200 shulker boxes
 

1539
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,789
have 200 shulker boxes
if we could divide that into let's say

1540
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
if we could divide that into let's say
 

1541
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,430
if we could divide that into let's say
10 categories like a stone block

1542
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
10 categories like a stone block
 

1543
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,549
10 categories like a stone block
category that would have cobblestone

1544
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
category that would have cobblestone
 

1545
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,950
category that would have cobblestone
stone stone bricks you know all that

1546
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
stone stone bricks you know all that
 

1547
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,470
stone stone bricks you know all that
sort of thing

1548
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,480
sort of thing
 

1549
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,669
sort of thing
then it would be 20 shocker boxes per

1550
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
then it would be 20 shocker boxes per
 

1551
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,549
then it would be 20 shocker boxes per
category

1552
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
category
 

1553
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,389
category
maybe and you could search through 20

1554
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
maybe and you could search through 20
 

1555
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,510
maybe and you could search through 20
chunker boxes pretty quickly so that

1556
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
chunker boxes pretty quickly so that
 

1557
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,549
chunker boxes pretty quickly so that
would be another

1558
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
would be another
 

1559
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,430
would be another
major way of increasing the speed and

1560
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
major way of increasing the speed and
 

1561
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,669
major way of increasing the speed and
actually making it a practical system

1562
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:49,679
actually making it a practical system
 

1563
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,630
actually making it a practical system
to do that i'm not really sure how

1564
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
to do that i'm not really sure how
 

1565
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,990
to do that i'm not really sure how
that's another thing i've been thinking

1566
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,000
that's another thing i've been thinking
 

1567
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,789
that's another thing i've been thinking
about

1568
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:54,799
about
 

1569
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,269
about
but hopefully we can figure it out all

1570
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,279
but hopefully we can figure it out all
 

1571
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,470
but hopefully we can figure it out all
right

1572
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
right
 

1573
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,909
right
