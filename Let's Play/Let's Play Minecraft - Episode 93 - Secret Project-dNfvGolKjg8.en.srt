carts as the vehicles that you got to

84
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:56,360
carts as the vehicles that you got to
 

85
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
carts as the vehicles that you got to
get past and I would put zombies in them

get past and I would put zombies in them
so if you were walking by the zombies

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,090
so if you were walking by the zombies
 

89

so if you were walking by the zombies
would hit you if if you get close to one

90

would hit you if if you get close to one
 

91
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,610
would hit you if if you get close to one
of the carts and you would take damage

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:06,620
of the carts and you would take damage
 

93
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,440

each set to a specific pattern to go by
 

187
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,680
each set to a specific pattern to go by
and you would have to find the pattern

188

with three and I would keep track of it
 

213
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,230
with three and I would keep track of it
using a memory unit in redstone um I was

214
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,240
using a memory unit in redstone um I was
 

215
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,970
using a memory unit in redstone um I was
also going to keep track of time so as

216

you the time would count down and if you
 

221
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,590
you the time would count down and if you
didn't finish the level and then get

didn't finish the level and then get
 

223
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,830
didn't finish the level and then get
your frog across to the others to the

your frog across to the others to the
 

225
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,180
your frog across to the others to the
other side and time you would lose a

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:26,169
doing you know in Frogger when you go
 

231
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,170
doing you know in Frogger when you go
outside of the play field and

to have time you would there'd be five

274
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,010
to have time you would there'd be five
 

275
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,930
to have time you would there'd be five
doors at the end here one for each fraud

276
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:36,940
doors at the end here one for each fraud
 

277
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,529

you got to get cross finish the level

278
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:39,539
you got to get cross finish the level
 

279
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,330
you got to get cross finish the level
when you would go through one of the

280
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:42,340
when you would go through one of the
 

281
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,570
when you would go through one of the
doors memory unit would keep track with

282
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:45,580
doors memory unit would keep track with
 

283
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,189
doors memory unit would keep track with
that and then it would be closed so the

284
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
that and then it would be closed so the
 

285
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,379
that and then it would be closed so the
next time you go through the level that

286
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:49,389
next time you go through the level that
 

287
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,149
next time you go through the level that
door would be closed and the other four

288
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:51,159
door would be closed and the other four
 

289
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,430
door would be closed and the other four
would be open type thing if you tried to

290
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
would be open type thing if you tried to
 

291
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,010
would be open type thing if you tried to
go through a closed door again it would

292
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,020
go through a closed door again it would
 

293
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,200
go through a closed door again it would
know it was closed and you would lose a

294
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,210
know it was closed and you would lose a
 

295
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,310
know it was closed and you would lose a
life kind of like in real Frogger if you

296
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,320
life kind of like in real Frogger if you
 

297
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,899
life kind of like in real Frogger if you
try to go to the same one that you have

298
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:03,909
try to go to the same one that you have
 

299
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:09,899
try to go to the same one that you have
a frog already you lose a life the other

300
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:09,909
a frog already you lose a life the other
 

301
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,129
a frog already you lose a life the other
thing I was planning on doing was

302
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:11,139
thing I was planning on doing was
 

303
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,920
thing I was planning on doing was
keeping track of levels using redstone

304
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:13,930
keeping track of levels using redstone
 

305
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,920
keeping track of levels using redstone
and memory units so once you get all

306
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:16,930
and memory units so once you get all
 

307
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,740
and memory units so once you get all
five frogs across the pond here into

308
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,750
five frogs across the pond here into
 

309
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,100
five frogs across the pond here into
there five doors then you'd finish a

310
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,110
there five doors then you'd finish a
 

311
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,710
there five doors then you'd finish a
level you'd probably gain a life then

312
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:25,720
level you'd probably gain a life then
 

313
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,760
level you'd probably gain a life then
and

314
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:29,770

 

315
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,170

probably a victory tune would play using

316
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,180
probably a victory tune would play using
 

317
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,350
probably a victory tune would play using
note blocks for finishing the level then

318
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
note blocks for finishing the level then
 

319
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,270
note blocks for finishing the level then
the next level would get progressively

320
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,280
the next level would get progressively
 

321
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,969
the next level would get progressively
harder more minecarts would be on the

322
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:39,979
harder more minecarts would be on the
 

323
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,810
harder more minecarts would be on the
track and the pattern will change

324
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:42,820
track and the pattern will change
 

325
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,070
track and the pattern will change
pattern for the boats of change there

326
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,080
pattern for the boats of change there
 

327
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,630
pattern for the boats of change there
did be fewer boats as you go as you

328
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
did be fewer boats as you go as you
 

329
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,800
did be fewer boats as you go as you
advance through the levels so it would

330
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:50,810
advance through the levels so it would
 

331
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,260
advance through the levels so it would
get more difficult was what I was hoping

332
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,270
get more difficult was what I was hoping
 

333
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:59,650
get more difficult was what I was hoping
to do and let's see what else yeah as

334
00:08:59,650 --> 00:08:59,660
to do and let's see what else yeah as
 

335
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,620
to do and let's see what else yeah as
you were playing as planning on having a

336
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:01,630
you were playing as planning on having a
 

337
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,540
you were playing as planning on having a
Frogger music loop playing using note

338
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:04,550
Frogger music loop playing using note
 

339
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,540
Frogger music loop playing using note
blocks all the time if the game the text

340
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:07,550
blocks all the time if the game the text
 

341
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,820
blocks all the time if the game the text
that you died then it would play like an

342
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:09,830
that you died then it would play like an
 

343
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,360
that you died then it would play like an
oh you died music tune type thing so I

344
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,370
oh you died music tune type thing so I
 

345
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,680
oh you died music tune type thing so I
was planning on doing some stuff with no

346
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:17,690
was planning on doing some stuff with no
 

347
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,130
was planning on doing some stuff with no
blocks um but yeah I haven't gotten too

348
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,140
blocks um but yeah I haven't gotten too
 

349
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,410
blocks um but yeah I haven't gotten too
far I got it all like figured out in my

350
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:23,420
far I got it all like figured out in my
 

351
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,740
far I got it all like figured out in my
head I just have to do it and I still

352
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:26,750
head I just have to do it and I still
 

353
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,150
head I just have to do it and I still
plan on finishing it even though I'm

354
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
plan on finishing it even though I'm
 

355
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,950
plan on finishing it even though I'm
showing you I just don't really want it

356
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:29,960
showing you I just don't really want it
 

357
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,670
showing you I just don't really want it
to be a secret project anymore where's

358
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:36,680
to be a secret project anymore where's
 

359
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,579
to be a secret project anymore where's
the ladder there's the ladder good job

360
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:41,589
the ladder there's the ladder good job
 

361
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,560
the ladder there's the ladder good job
so the last thing I was working on or

362
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:44,570
so the last thing I was working on or
 

363
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,270
so the last thing I was working on or
the most recent thing I was working on

364
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,280
the most recent thing I was working on
 

365
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,270
the most recent thing I was working on
is hollowing it out under here so that

366
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,280
is hollowing it out under here so that
 

367
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,210
is hollowing it out under here so that
the I could set up the boat loops so

368
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,220
the I could set up the boat loops so
 

369
00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:00,130
the I could set up the boat loops so
when this is a boat launcher type area

370
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,140
when this is a boat launcher type area
 

371
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,800
when this is a boat launcher type area
this stream here when it gets the other

372
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:02,810
this stream here when it gets the other
 

373
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,810
this stream here when it gets the other
end it comes to one of these type things

374
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:04,820
end it comes to one of these type things
 

375
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,420
end it comes to one of these type things
and then it falls down and then there'd

376
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,430
and then it falls down and then there'd
 

377
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,520
and then it falls down and then there'd
be water stream underneath taking it to

378
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:09,530
be water stream underneath taking it to
 

379
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,090
be water stream underneath taking it to
the left and it would constantly loop

380
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,100
the left and it would constantly loop
 

381
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,660
the left and it would constantly loop
the boats and there would be doors at

382
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,670
the boats and there would be doors at
 

383
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,000
the boats and there would be doors at
the end to control the timing of the

384
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,010
the end to control the timing of the
 

385
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,710
the end to control the timing of the
boats like a neat system

386
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:23,720

 

387
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,770

and I was very careful at the end here

388
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:26,780
and I was very careful at the end here
 

389
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,600
and I was very careful at the end here
so that the boats wouldn't lose any

390
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,610
so that the boats wouldn't lose any
 

391
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,010
so that the boats wouldn't lose any
speed when they're getting launched

392
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,020
speed when they're getting launched
 

393
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,570
speed when they're getting launched
otherwise they wouldn't make it across

394
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:31,580
otherwise they wouldn't make it across
 

395
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,960
otherwise they wouldn't make it across
this pond here and yeah so that er

396
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:37,970
this pond here and yeah so that er
 

397
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,180
this pond here and yeah so that er
that's some of the things I was planning

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:00,710
like working on it I will and I don't
 

413
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,290
like working on it I will and I don't
have to worry about you guys hounding me

414
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,300
have to worry about you guys hounding me
 

415
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,030
have to worry about you guys hounding me
what's the secret project all the time

416
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,040
what's the secret project all the time
 

417
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,020
what's the secret project all the time
because now you know so hopefully

418
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,030
because now you know so hopefully
 

419
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,760
because now you know so hopefully
hopefully it'll get done eventually

those videos if you're interested and
you can see me building this and get a

434
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,080
you can see me building this and get a
 

435
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,020
you can see me building this and get a
little bit more detail on the plans for

436
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,030
little bit more detail on the plans for
 

437
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:41,320
little bit more detail on the plans for
it all but yeah that's what we got so

438
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,330
it all but yeah that's what we got so
 

439

far so I was kind of hoping to have more

440
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:46,610
far so I was kind of hoping to have more
 

441
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,760
far so I was kind of hoping to have more
done on this before I showed you guys

442
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:48,770
done on this before I showed you guys
 

443
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,990
done on this before I showed you guys
but you know I have been posting videos

but you know I have been posting videos
 

445
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,330
but you know I have been posting videos
pretty frequently and it's hard to do

446
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:55,340
pretty frequently and it's hard to do
 

447
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,360
pretty frequently and it's hard to do
the LP series and then work on this in

448
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,370
the LP series and then work on this in
 

449
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,950
the LP series and then work on this in
the background at the same time that's

450
00:11:59,950 --> 00:11:59,960
the background at the same time that's
 

451
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,230
the background at the same time that's
you know a lot of Minecraft to play in a

452
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
you know a lot of Minecraft to play in a
 

453
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,460

just sat here for a long time and that's
that's what happened more good news

476
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,490
and this time I will be sure to start
 

477
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,910
and this time I will be sure to start
off in the eye space I kind of messed up
