building a glass wall here
 

183
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,110
building a glass wall here
and the blazes are gonna be behind it

184
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
and the blazes are gonna be behind it
 

185
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,190
and the blazes are gonna be behind it
and we'll see if this makes things

186
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
and we'll see if this makes things
 

187
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,430
and we'll see if this makes things
better here

188
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
better here
 

189
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,470
better here
all right just a couple more blocks

190
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
all right just a couple more blocks
 

191
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,190
all right just a couple more blocks
there and there good that should do it

192
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
there and there good that should do it
 

193
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,830
there and there good that should do it
so we're going to turn this on

194
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
so we're going to turn this on
 

195
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,670
so we're going to turn this on
okay turn it on so that's all covered by

196
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
okay turn it on so that's all covered by
 

197
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,869
okay turn it on so that's all covered by
glass there

198
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
glass there
 

199
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,270
glass there
and all on the sides as well so they

200
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
and all on the sides as well so they
 

201
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,630
and all on the sides as well so they
should hopefully not see us at all now

202

that
 

243
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,310
that
that were happening from there and in

244
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
that were happening from there and in
 

245
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,390

one block wide gap there and there's a
behavior with blazes i didn't realize

254
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
behavior with blazes i didn't realize
 

255
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,590
behavior with blazes i didn't realize
when i started building this

256
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
when i started building this
 

257
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,670
when i started building this
something new that has changed in the

game
let's see if i can make it happen here

262
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
let's see if i can make it happen here
 

263
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,710
let's see if i can make it happen here
it seems whenever you damage these guys

264
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
it seems whenever you damage these guys
 

265
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,790
it seems whenever you damage these guys
uh they sort of all attack you as a

266
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
uh they sort of all attack you as a
 

267
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,950
uh they sort of all attack you as a
group then like they gang up on you

268
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
group then like they gang up on you

them
 

273
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,950
them
let's see if we can trigger it

274
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960

 

275
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,310

now it didn't happen there maybe it's

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
now it didn't happen there maybe it's
 

277
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,550
now it didn't happen there maybe it's
when they successfully hit you i don't

see me
um i'm not sure how it triggers exactly

292
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:07,480

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,150
blocks that were green
and like ice that was blue it kind of

340
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
and like ice that was blue it kind of
 

341
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,629
and like ice that was blue it kind of
had clashing colors and it just looked

342
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
had clashing colors and it just looked
 

343
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,270
had clashing colors and it just looked
bad

344
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
bad
 

345
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,029
bad
and it was very finity it wasn't

346
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
and it was very finity it wasn't
 

347
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,270
and it was very finity it wasn't
functioning well either

348
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
functioning well either
 

349
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,589
functioning well either
so i decided we need a new method here

350
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
so i decided we need a new method here
 

351
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,510
so i decided we need a new method here
so i went with the minecart system

352
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
so i went with the minecart system
 

353
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,189
so i went with the minecart system
instead

354
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
instead
 

355
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,029
instead
and already does doesn't this look a lot

356
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
and already does doesn't this look a lot
 

357
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,430
and already does doesn't this look a lot
cooler i decided to do the

358
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
cooler i decided to do the
 

359
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,909
cooler i decided to do the
purper blocks and sandstone that a lot

360
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
purper blocks and sandstone that a lot
 

361
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,589
purper blocks and sandstone that a lot
of people have been doing

362
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
of people have been doing
 

363
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,870
of people have been doing
i think it looks pretty cool here um

364
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
i think it looks pretty cool here um
 

365
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,950
i think it looks pretty cool here um
so yeah let's let's see this new system

366
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
so yeah let's let's see this new system
 

367
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,990
so yeah let's let's see this new system
in action

368
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
in action
 

369
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,390
in action
here if we can it's not totally done yet

370
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
here if we can it's not totally done yet
 

371
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,070
here if we can it's not totally done yet
uh there's a couple problems with it

372
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
uh there's a couple problems with it
 

373
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,909
uh there's a couple problems with it
still but it's working a lot better than

374
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
still but it's working a lot better than
 

375
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,390
still but it's working a lot better than
that slime block thing that's for sure

376
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
that slime block thing that's for sure
 

377
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,790
that slime block thing that's for sure
so first thing that happens

378
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
so first thing that happens
 

379
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,029
so first thing that happens
uh they fall down here in front of this

380
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
uh they fall down here in front of this
 

381
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,270
uh they fall down here in front of this
dispenser

382
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
dispenser
 

383
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,230
dispenser
eventually there they come when they

384
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
eventually there they come when they
 

385
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,749
eventually there they come when they
fall through there they activate a

386
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
fall through there they activate a
 

387
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,790
fall through there they activate a
tripwire

388
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
tripwire
 

389
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,790
tripwire
and then that activates the the

390
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
and then that activates the the
 

391
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,990
and then that activates the the
dispenser here

392
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
dispenser here
 

393
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,990
dispenser here
right and they get sent off on their

394
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
right and they get sent off on their
 

395
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,029
right and they get sent off on their
merry way

396
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
merry way
 

397
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,189
merry way
up to the top there to the drop off

398
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
up to the top there to the drop off
 

399
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,710
up to the top there to the drop off
point in the middle

400
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
point in the middle
 

401
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,869
point in the middle
and then they fall down into our killing

402
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
and then they fall down into our killing
 

403
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,670
and then they fall down into our killing
chamber which is where we want them

404
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
chamber which is where we want them
 

405
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,990
chamber which is where we want them
uh this dispenser setup though is a

406
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
uh this dispenser setup though is a
 

407
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,230
uh this dispenser setup though is a
little bit special

408
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
little bit special
 

409
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,710
little bit special
because if we had for example two blazes

410
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
because if we had for example two blazes
 

411
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,629
because if we had for example two blazes
fall down

412
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
fall down
 

413
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,110
fall down
we would have an instant problem because

414
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
we would have an instant problem because
 

415
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,629
we would have an instant problem because
one would get stuck in the trip wire and

416
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
one would get stuck in the trip wire and
 

417
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,869
one would get stuck in the trip wire and
this wouldn't activate again

418
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
this wouldn't activate again
 

419
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,710
this wouldn't activate again
so instead we have a clock that runs

420
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
so instead we have a clock that runs
 

421
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,390
so instead we have a clock that runs
here whenever there's something in the

422
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
here whenever there's something in the
 

423
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,110
here whenever there's something in the
tripwire

424
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120

 

425
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,029

this disables the lock on it and then

426
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
this disables the lock on it and then
 

427
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,870
this disables the lock on it and then
the clock is free to run

428
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
the clock is free to run
 

429
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,469
the clock is free to run
and it keeps running until there's no

430
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
and it keeps running until there's no
 

431
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,949
and it keeps running until there's no
more blazes in the tripwire area so it

432
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
more blazes in the tripwire area so it
 

433
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,589
more blazes in the tripwire area so it
doesn't get

434
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
doesn't get
 

435
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,469
doesn't get
jammed up if there's more than one

436
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
jammed up if there's more than one
 

437
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,230
jammed up if there's more than one
there's a problem here we gotta fix yet

438
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
there's a problem here we gotta fix yet
 

439
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,550
there's a problem here we gotta fix yet
though

440
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
though
 

441
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,509
though
see how they're building up because the

442
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
see how they're building up because the
 

443
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,430
see how they're building up because the
old system had a clock that would clear

444
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
old system had a clock that would clear
 

445
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,470
old system had a clock that would clear
them and i removed all that now

446
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
them and i removed all that now
 

447
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,550
them and i removed all that now
all right so they go up here up this

448
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
all right so they go up here up this
 

449
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,590
all right so they go up here up this
this rail line to the middle

450
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
this rail line to the middle
 

451
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,030
this rail line to the middle
and then there's a little bit of a blaze

452
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
and then there's a little bit of a blaze
 

453
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,670
and then there's a little bit of a blaze
clearing mechanism here

454
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
clearing mechanism here
 

455
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,430
clearing mechanism here
i had to finish with this a lot i got to

456
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
i had to finish with this a lot i got to
 

457
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,509
i had to finish with this a lot i got to
tell you guys one thing do not

458
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
tell you guys one thing do not
 

459
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,430
tell you guys one thing do not
use activator rails they are a nightmare

460
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
use activator rails they are a nightmare
 

461
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,190
use activator rails they are a nightmare
i was trying to eject them with an

462
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
i was trying to eject them with an
 

463
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,350
i was trying to eject them with an
activator rail at first

464
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
activator rail at first
 

465
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,350
activator rail at first
and after i pulled out a few hairs i

466
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
and after i pulled out a few hairs i
 

467
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,509
and after i pulled out a few hairs i
decided just to switch to a cactus to

468
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
decided just to switch to a cactus to
 

469
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,710
decided just to switch to a cactus to
break the minecart

470
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
break the minecart
 

471
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,030
break the minecart
and then we got hoppers there and there

472
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
and then we got hoppers there and there
 

473
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,190
and then we got hoppers there and there
to pick up the minecarts

474
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
to pick up the minecarts
 

475
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,590
to pick up the minecarts
after they break and then the blazes

476
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
after they break and then the blazes
 

477
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,870
after they break and then the blazes
gets ejected

478
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
gets ejected
 

479
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,030
gets ejected
in front of that piston and then that

480
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
in front of that piston and then that
 

481
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,949
in front of that piston and then that
one push pushes them over to the side

482
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
one push pushes them over to the side
 

483
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,550
one push pushes them over to the side
and they fall down the middle

484
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
and they fall down the middle
 

485
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,670
and they fall down the middle
and that happens on both sides

486
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
and that happens on both sides
 

487
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,509
and that happens on both sides
the most part it works pretty good

488
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
the most part it works pretty good
 

489
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,829
the most part it works pretty good
there's just the odd problem

490
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
there's just the odd problem
 

491
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,590
there's just the odd problem
such as that i don't know why that just

492
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
such as that i don't know why that just
 

493
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,110
such as that i don't know why that just
happened

494
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120

 

495
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,070

um eventually like if minecarts jam into

496
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
um eventually like if minecarts jam into
 

497
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,509
um eventually like if minecarts jam into
that one it seems to

498
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
that one it seems to
 

499
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,509
that one it seems to
to fix the problems somewhat

500
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
to fix the problems somewhat
 

501
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,190
to fix the problems somewhat
but we might have a few jams in the

502
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
but we might have a few jams in the
 

503
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,100
but we might have a few jams in the
system still

504
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,110

up there we'll just turn this blaze farm
 

519
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,350
up there we'll just turn this blaze farm
off for a second

520
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
off for a second
 

521
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,430

how do you do that i filled up that

532
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
how do you do that i filled up that
 

533
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,069
how do you do that i filled up that
tunnel with glass too so there's

534
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
tunnel with glass too so there's
 

535
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,069
tunnel with glass too so there's
hopefully no chance of anything spawning

536
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
hopefully no chance of anything spawning
 

537
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,829
hopefully no chance of anything spawning
in there and getting in the way

538
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
in there and getting in the way
 

539
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,509
in there and getting in the way
um okay they're bouncing around there

540
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
um okay they're bouncing around there
 

541
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,949
um okay they're bouncing around there
oh okay

542
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959

 

543
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,269

i'm trying to do this without cutting

544
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
i'm trying to do this without cutting
 

545
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,710
i'm trying to do this without cutting
but we might need to just cut here and

546
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
but we might need to just cut here and
 

547
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,110
but we might need to just cut here and
let me clear them

548
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
let me clear them
 

549
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,630
let me clear them
it's a real pain whenever this happens

550
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
it's a real pain whenever this happens
 

551
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,350
it's a real pain whenever this happens
there's one down

552
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360

 

553
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,870

whoa i just want to show you guys what's

whoa i just want to show you guys what's
 

555
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,190
whoa i just want to show you guys what's
what's built up here i just broke some

556
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
what's built up here i just broke some
 

557
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,389
what's built up here i just broke some
redstone

558
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
redstone
 

559
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,829
redstone
oh and they attacked each other no

560
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
oh and they attacked each other no
 

561
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,630
oh and they attacked each other no
what did that do are they flying all

562
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
what did that do are they flying all
 

563
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,389
what did that do are they flying all
over the place

564
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
over the place
 

565
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,509
over the place
yeah they are look at this if they ever

566
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
yeah they are look at this if they ever
 

567
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,910
yeah they are look at this if they ever
hit each other it's just this disaster

568
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
hit each other it's just this disaster
 

569
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,509
hit each other it's just this disaster
they go crazy

570
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519

 

571
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,710

okay i'm gonna have to leave and come

572
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
okay i'm gonna have to leave and come
 

573
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,949
okay i'm gonna have to leave and come
back and let them despawn one second

574
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
back and let them despawn one second
 

575
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,230
back and let them despawn one second
yeah so i'll just show you guys what's

576
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
yeah so i'll just show you guys what's
 

577
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,310
yeah so i'll just show you guys what's
up at the top here with uh the shut off

578
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
up at the top here with uh the shut off
 

579
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,350
up at the top here with uh the shut off
for right now

580
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
for right now
 

581
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,750
for right now
so at the top here this isn't finished

582
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
so at the top here this isn't finished
 

583
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,190
so at the top here this isn't finished
this tunnel should be enclosed with

584
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
this tunnel should be enclosed with
 

585
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,230
this tunnel should be enclosed with
glass as well so

586
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
glass as well so
 

587
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,069
glass as well so
nothing will run on the track and get in

588
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
nothing will run on the track and get in
 

589
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,230
nothing will run on the track and get in
the way like no zombie pigman

590
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
the way like no zombie pigman
 

591
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,629
the way like no zombie pigman
um they come up here though this is like

592
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
um they come up here though this is like
 

593
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,550
um they come up here though this is like
a fail-safe method as well

594
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
a fail-safe method as well
 

595
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,190
a fail-safe method as well
instead of having a a curve junction

596
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
instead of having a a curve junction
 

597
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,750
instead of having a a curve junction
here

598
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
here
 

599
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,670
here
i have it just going back into a block

600
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
i have it just going back into a block
 

601
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,150
i have it just going back into a block
that way if for some reason the minecart

602
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
that way if for some reason the minecart
 

603
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,710
that way if for some reason the minecart
tries to reverse it doesn't go all the

604
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
tries to reverse it doesn't go all the
 

605
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,629
tries to reverse it doesn't go all the
way back down here and gets stuck in

606
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
way back down here and gets stuck in
 

607
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:06,949
way back down here and gets stuck in
this

608
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
this
 

609
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,470
this
uh glass tunnel area it'll just bounce

610
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
uh glass tunnel area it'll just bounce
 

611
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,230
uh glass tunnel area it'll just bounce
around at the top here

612
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
around at the top here
 

613
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,150
around at the top here
uh goes over a detector rail this

614
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
uh goes over a detector rail this
 

615
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,550
uh goes over a detector rail this
triggers this piston first

616
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
triggers this piston first
 

617
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,430
triggers this piston first
after seven delay and then after nine

618
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
after seven delay and then after nine
 

619
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,910
after seven delay and then after nine
delay

620
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
delay
 

621
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,750
delay
it triggers this one so they go left and

622
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
it triggers this one so they go left and
 

623
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,069
it triggers this one so they go left and
then right and the blaze falls down that

624
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
then right and the blaze falls down that
 

625
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,629
then right and the blaze falls down that
little

626
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
little
 

627
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,949
little
that little hole there one of the things

628
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
that little hole there one of the things
 

629
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,470
that little hole there one of the things
i didn't really

630
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
i didn't really
 

631
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,910
i didn't really
realize at first that was giving me a

632
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
realize at first that was giving me a
 

633
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,949
realize at first that was giving me a
lot of trouble is

634
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
lot of trouble is
 

635
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,150
lot of trouble is
don't put anything

636
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
don't put anything
 

637
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,150
don't put anything
like in the third block blazes are only

638
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
like in the third block blazes are only
 

639
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,829
like in the third block blazes are only
two blocks tall but if you put something

640
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
two blocks tall but if you put something
 

641
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,990
two blocks tall but if you put something
in this third block area

642
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
in this third block area
 

643
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,790
in this third block area
um what happens is like as they eject

644
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
um what happens is like as they eject
 

645
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,550
um what happens is like as they eject
from the minecart they don't eject on

646
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
from the minecart they don't eject on
 

647
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,990
from the minecart they don't eject on
the ground level they're a little bit in

648
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
the ground level they're a little bit in
 

649
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,190
the ground level they're a little bit in
the air

650
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
the air
 

651
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,790
the air
and if if you have blocks

652
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
and if if you have blocks
 

653
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,350
and if if you have blocks
like up here they'll be inside those

654
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
like up here they'll be inside those
 

655
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,269
like up here they'll be inside those
blocks for a brief moment before they

656
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
blocks for a brief moment before they
 

657
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,750
blocks for a brief moment before they
they fall down so if the piston tries to

658
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
they fall down so if the piston tries to
 

659
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,790
they fall down so if the piston tries to
move them

660
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
move them
 

661
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,310
move them
when they're in those blocks like when

662
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
when they're in those blocks like when
 

663
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,069
when they're in those blocks like when
their heads just grazing them

664
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
their heads just grazing them
 

665
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,710
their heads just grazing them
uh the piston can't move them so i had a

666
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
uh the piston can't move them so i had a
 

667
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,829
uh the piston can't move them so i had a
little bit of trouble getting these

668
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
little bit of trouble getting these
 

669
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,190
little bit of trouble getting these
pistons to actually

670
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
pistons to actually
 

671
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,190
pistons to actually
move them where i want until i got rid

672
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
move them where i want until i got rid
 

673
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,069
move them where i want until i got rid
of the the ones i had up here

674
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
of the the ones i had up here
 

675
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,310
of the the ones i had up here
all right yeah the minecart though it

676
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
all right yeah the minecart though it
 

677
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,750
all right yeah the minecart though it
runs into this hopper

678
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
runs into this hopper
 

679
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,590
runs into this hopper
or into the cactus and then falls into

680
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
or into the cactus and then falls into
 

681
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,790
or into the cactus and then falls into
the hopper

682
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
the hopper
 

683
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,670
the hopper
and then i have a pickup system to grab

684
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
and then i have a pickup system to grab
 

685
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,750
and then i have a pickup system to grab
all the spare mine carts they go into

686
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
all the spare mine carts they go into
 

687
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,509
all the spare mine carts they go into
here

688
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
here
 

689
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,470
here
and a storage minecart comes by if

690
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
and a storage minecart comes by if
 

691
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,870
and a storage minecart comes by if
there's

692
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
there's
 

693
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,550
there's
anything in these hoppers

694
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
anything in these hoppers
 

695
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,150
anything in these hoppers
it shuts off that power rail there until

696
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
it shuts off that power rail there until
 

697
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,030
it shuts off that power rail there until
the minecart is fully loaded or until

698
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
the minecart is fully loaded or until
 

699
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,949
the minecart is fully loaded or until
this hopper is fully empty i should say

700
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
this hopper is fully empty i should say
 

701
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,470
this hopper is fully empty i should say
then it'll take off again

702
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
then it'll take off again
 

703
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,310
then it'll take off again
another design choice i decided to make

704
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
another design choice i decided to make
 

705
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,470
another design choice i decided to make
here is i made each of these pickup

706
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
here is i made each of these pickup
 

707
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,310
here is i made each of these pickup
systems separate instead of combining

708
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
systems separate instead of combining
 

709
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,189
systems separate instead of combining
them together i

710
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
them together i
 

711
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,310
them together i
i kept the side separate that way uh i

712
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
i kept the side separate that way uh i
 

713
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,590
i kept the side separate that way uh i
don't have to worry about issues like

714
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
don't have to worry about issues like
 

715
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,750
don't have to worry about issues like
with one side getting all the mine carts

716
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
with one side getting all the mine carts
 

717
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,710
with one side getting all the mine carts
and one side having none it's just

718
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
and one side having none it's just
 

719
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,030
and one side having none it's just
each side has a certain amount and it

720
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
each side has a certain amount and it
 

721
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,710
each side has a certain amount and it
stays that way

722
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
stays that way
 

723
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,430
stays that way
but then the minecarts storage minecart

724
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
but then the minecarts storage minecart
 

725
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,590
but then the minecarts storage minecart
comes down here

726
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
comes down here
 

727
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,710
comes down here
and unloads the minecarts it picks up

728
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
and unloads the minecarts it picks up
 

729
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,710
and unloads the minecarts it picks up
into the dispenser again so it does a

730
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
into the dispenser again so it does a
 

731
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,870
into the dispenser again so it does a
full loop

732
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
full loop
 

733
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,389
full loop
and since i put another rack in there

734
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
and since i put another rack in there
 

735
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,310
and since i put another rack in there
that's where it is so i

736
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
that's where it is so i
 

737
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,910
that's where it is so i
only got five in each side i think

738
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
only got five in each side i think
 

739
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,670
only got five in each side i think
that's enough

740
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
that's enough
 

741
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,710
that's enough
though uh-huh and

742
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
though uh-huh and
 

743
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,550
though uh-huh and
let's see what else so

744
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560

 

745
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,189

gotta do a few changes around here that

746
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
gotta do a few changes around here that
 

747
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,030
gotta do a few changes around here that
when this used to run on a clock

748
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
when this used to run on a clock
 

749
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,790
when this used to run on a clock
it would activate this every so often

750
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
it would activate this every so often
 

751
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,310
it would activate this every so often
now we have no way of triggering this

752
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
now we have no way of triggering this
 

753
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,230
now we have no way of triggering this
maybe what i'll do is just

754
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240

 

755
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,590

hook it up to this clock see if that

756
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
hook it up to this clock see if that
 

757
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,189
hook it up to this clock see if that
does anything to help speed up the blaze

758
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199

all right just run it up like that maybe

770
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
all right just run it up like that maybe
 

771
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,430
all right just run it up like that maybe
see if that does anything to help it out

772
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
see if that does anything to help it out
 

773
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,430
see if that does anything to help it out

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,389
oh so that happens because they take a
little bit of damage from this uh blaze

840
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
little bit of damage from this uh blaze
 

841
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,710
little bit of damage from this uh blaze
cone thing

842
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
cone thing
 

843
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,430
cone thing
it's not quite perfect but you'll notice

844
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
it's not quite perfect but you'll notice
 

845
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,269
it's not quite perfect but you'll notice
one thing important here even though we

846
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
one thing important here even though we
 

847
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,749
one thing important here even though we
lost a few blazes from that

848
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
lost a few blazes from that
 

849
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,910
lost a few blazes from that
uh and the signal went down to four we

850
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
uh and the signal went down to four we
 

851
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,870
uh and the signal went down to four we
still have this

852
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
still have this
 

853
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,749
still have this
block preventing the full health guys

854
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
block preventing the full health guys
 

855
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,350
block preventing the full health guys
from mixing in with

856
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
from mixing in with
 

857
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,990
from mixing in with
the low health guys so it's still

858
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
the low health guys so it's still
 

859
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,590
the low health guys so it's still
separating them even though we lost a

860
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
separating them even though we lost a
 

861
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,470
separating them even though we lost a
few

862
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
few
 

863
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:53,509
few
and now we should try this out

864
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519

 

865
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,470

uh yeah so one of my concerns here

866
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
uh yeah so one of my concerns here
 

867
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,749
uh yeah so one of my concerns here
is the xp orbs landing on the iron

868
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
is the xp orbs landing on the iron
 

869
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,710
is the xp orbs landing on the iron
pressure plate

870
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
pressure plate
 

871
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,630
pressure plate
might actually trigger it again

872
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640

 

873
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,150

which kind of looked like it happened

874
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
which kind of looked like it happened
 

875
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,510
which kind of looked like it happened
there i don't think there was enough

876
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
there i don't think there was enough
 

877
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,110
there i don't think there was enough
lasers to do it

878
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120

 

879
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,150

i guess let's kill these guys

880
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
i guess let's kill these guys
 

881
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,470
i guess let's kill these guys
okay it's not supposed to release that

882

885
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,630

which it didn't happen the first time

886
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
which it didn't happen the first time
 

887
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,309
which it didn't happen the first time
there so i might need to fix a few

888
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
there so i might need to fix a few
 

889
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,750
there so i might need to fix a few
things

890
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760

this time it waited for me to pick up

892
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
this time it waited for me to pick up
 

893
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,070
this time it waited for me to pick up
the xp before i let the other ones down

894
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
the xp before i let the other ones down
 

895
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,270
the xp before i let the other ones down
so that's good

896
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280

 

897
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,110

so we're getting close guys this is

898
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
so we're getting close guys this is
 

899
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,270
so we're getting close guys this is
almost working ideally

900
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
almost working ideally
 

901
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,070
almost working ideally
um then once we get it working perfect

902
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
um then once we get it working perfect
 

903
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,029
um then once we get it working perfect
we gotta

904
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
we gotta
 

905
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,630
we gotta
sort of give this area a nice little

906
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
sort of give this area a nice little
 

907
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,870
sort of give this area a nice little

nice purple blocks
 

913
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,590
nice purple blocks
let's see if we do something like that

914
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
let's see if we do something like that
 

915
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,669
let's see if we do something like that
i'm thinking we leave this visible up

916
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
i'm thinking we leave this visible up
 

917
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,750

924
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
and then maybe we'll do similar to what
 

925
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,110
and then maybe we'll do similar to what
we did with the tracks where we have

maybe if we changed it up a bit got rid

972
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
maybe if we changed it up a bit got rid
 

973
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,230

this
 

977
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,150
this
to the purper half slabs might look good

978
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
to the purper half slabs might look good
 

979
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,549
to the purper half slabs might look good
also i was considering maybe changing

980
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
also i was considering maybe changing
 

981
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,190
also i was considering maybe changing
out some of the sandstone with purple

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840

 

1175
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,909

so it turns out there was a repeater

1176
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
so it turns out there was a repeater
 

1177
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,870
so it turns out there was a repeater
missing last time so we'll try it again

1178
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
missing last time so we'll try it again
 

1179
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,149
missing last time so we'll try it again
that kind of matters

1180
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159

 

1181
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,230

to do here i want to build a special
enchanting station for this

1198
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
enchanting station for this
 

1199
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,590
enchanting station for this
and maybe a potion brewing system i have

1200
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
and maybe a potion brewing system i have
 

1201
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,789
and maybe a potion brewing system i have
an idea for one

1202
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
an idea for one
 

1203
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,750
an idea for one
that works in the nether which would be

1204
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
that works in the nether which would be
 

1205
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,269
that works in the nether which would be
a pretty fun project

1206
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
a pretty fun project
 

1207
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,190
a pretty fun project
also going to do some more netherrack

1208
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
also going to do some more netherrack
 

1209
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,269
also going to do some more netherrack
removal

1210
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
removal
 

1211
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,950
removal
i think i do like the cyan clay for it

1212
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
i think i do like the cyan clay for it
 

1213
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,549
i think i do like the cyan clay for it
let's try to figure out how to finish up

1214
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
let's try to figure out how to finish up
 

1215
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,909
let's try to figure out how to finish up
the ceiling here maybe we'll do it like

1216
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
the ceiling here maybe we'll do it like
 

1217
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,029
the ceiling here maybe we'll do it like
this

1218
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
this
 

1219
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,830
this
and have it go all the way down

1220
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840

 

1221
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,190

let's fill this in open my out i'm out

1222
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
let's fill this in open my out i'm out
 

1223
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,470
let's fill this in open my out i'm out
okay something like

1224
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
okay something like
 

1225
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,669
okay something like
that uh needs a bit of work

1226
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
that uh needs a bit of work
 

1227
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,549
that uh needs a bit of work
another thing the the proper way of

1228
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
another thing the the proper way of
 

1229
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,350
another thing the the proper way of
entering here

1230
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
entering here
 

1231
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,789
entering here
instead of going through that nether

1232
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
instead of going through that nether
 

1233
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,350
instead of going through that nether
fortress maybe what we'll do

1234
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
fortress maybe what we'll do
 

1235
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,470
fortress maybe what we'll do
is build a tunnel down this way and have

1236
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
is build a tunnel down this way and have
 

1237
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,350
is build a tunnel down this way and have
it connect to that other tunnel we have

1238
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
it connect to that other tunnel we have
 

1239
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,390
it connect to that other tunnel we have
got to be careful we don't fall off here

1240
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
got to be careful we don't fall off here
 

1241
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,510
got to be careful we don't fall off here
this should open up to that area

1242
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
this should open up to that area
 

1243
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,549
this should open up to that area
if we go far enough

1244
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559

 

1245
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,950

i think maybe upwards okay we gotta go

1246
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
i think maybe upwards okay we gotta go
 

1247
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,710
i think maybe upwards okay we gotta go
up a little bit

1248
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720

 

1249
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,230

yeah there's the tunnel so we gotta try

1250
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
yeah there's the tunnel so we gotta try
 

1251
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,990
yeah there's the tunnel so we gotta try
connect to that somehow

1252
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
connect to that somehow
 

1253
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,149
connect to that somehow
from here that way we'll have a proper

1254
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
from here that way we'll have a proper
 

1255
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,990
from here that way we'll have a proper
way of getting to it as well

1256
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000

 

1257
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,430

all right so we're going to finish up

1258
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
all right so we're going to finish up
 

1259
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,590
all right so we're going to finish up
today by trying out the coarse fruit

1260
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
today by trying out the coarse fruit
 

1261
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,870
today by trying out the coarse fruit
farm again

1262
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
farm again
 

1263
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,510
farm again
i'm just harvesting all the seeds i

1264
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
i'm just harvesting all the seeds i
 

1265
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,789
i'm just harvesting all the seeds i
don't think it was quite

1266
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
don't think it was quite
 

1267
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,630
don't think it was quite
fully done growing now that i started

1268
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
fully done growing now that i started
 

1269
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,470
fully done growing now that i started
so we might not get as many seeds as we

1270
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
so we might not get as many seeds as we
 

1271
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,230
so we might not get as many seeds as we
should here but

1272
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
should here but
 

1273
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,070
should here but
we'll just make sure the the water

1274
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
we'll just make sure the the water
 

1275
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,830
we'll just make sure the the water
system works and everything so here we

1276
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
system works and everything so here we
 

1277
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,830
system works and everything so here we
go

1278
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:12,840

 

1279
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,070

bam

1280
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080

 

1281
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,789

oh it's happening this is really laggy

1282
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
oh it's happening this is really laggy
 

1283
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,750
oh it's happening this is really laggy
it's like oh man it's not working

1284
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760

 

1285
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,510

all right so everything's flowing down

1286
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
all right so everything's flowing down
 

1287
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,269
all right so everything's flowing down
here the idea is everything

1288
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
here the idea is everything
 

1289
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,909
here the idea is everything
should make it to the bottom before the

1290
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
should make it to the bottom before the
 

1291
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,230
should make it to the bottom before the
water shuts off

1292
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
water shuts off
 

1293
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,990
water shuts off
so it's on a timer right now and also we

1294
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
so it's on a timer right now and also we
 

1295
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,710
so it's on a timer right now and also we
got to make sure

1296
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
got to make sure
 

1297
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,230
got to make sure
everything gets picked up by those

1298
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,240
everything gets picked up by those
 

1299
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,990
everything gets picked up by those
hoppers

1300
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
hoppers
 

1301
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,909
hoppers
okay that was the last of the items and

1302
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
okay that was the last of the items and
 

1303
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,789
okay that was the last of the items and
the water's shutting off now that's good

1304
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
the water's shutting off now that's good
 

1305
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,909
the water's shutting off now that's good
that looks like it worked out okay yeah

1306
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
that looks like it worked out okay yeah
 

1307
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,669
that looks like it worked out okay yeah
let's check if there's anything

1308
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:49,679
let's check if there's anything
 

1309
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,390
let's check if there's anything
on these hoppers or if it picked

1310
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
on these hoppers or if it picked
 

1311
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,070
on these hoppers or if it picked
everything up

1312
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
everything up
 

1313
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,669
everything up
looks like you got everything okay so

1314
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
looks like you got everything okay so
 

1315
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,430
looks like you got everything okay so
these should be filled up with stuff

1316
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,440
these should be filled up with stuff
 

1317
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,390
these should be filled up with stuff
what about this one here yeah every

1318

what about this one here yeah every
single hopper is

1320
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
single hopper is
 

1321
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,549
single hopper is
full

1322
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559

 

1323
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,350

aha oh except for that one

aha oh except for that one
 

1325
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,950
aha oh except for that one
okay so there was a little bit of space

1326
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
okay so there was a little bit of space
 

1327
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,789
okay so there was a little bit of space
left if uh

1328
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
left if uh
 

1329
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,789
left if uh
if there was a bit more coarse fruit or

work out so well for them if uh
 

1373
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,310
work out so well for them if uh
the thing they build is constantly

1374
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
the thing they build is constantly

changing as a seasons update you know
like they'll build something and then

1378
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
like they'll build something and then
 

1379
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,630
like they'll build something and then
they look at it later and it's covered

1380
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
they look at it later and it's covered
 

1381

1383
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,190
in snow it doesn't quite work out
perfectly uh i would think like even in

1384
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
perfectly uh i would think like even in
 

1385
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,909
perfectly uh i would think like even in
terra firma craft for example it looks

1386
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
terra firma craft for example it looks
 

1387
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,950
terra firma craft for example it looks
that has seasons like it'll snow and

1388
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
that has seasons like it'll snow and
 

1389
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,350
that has seasons like it'll snow and
then the snow will disappear and

1390
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
then the snow will disappear and
 

1391
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,430
then the snow will disappear and
it leaves change color and all that if

1392
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
it leaves change color and all that if
 

1393
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,750
it leaves change color and all that if
uh if you're trying to build something

1394
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,760
uh if you're trying to build something
 

1395
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,389
uh if you're trying to build something
it looks

1396
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399
it looks
 

1397
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,510
it looks
way different in the winter time and

1398
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
way different in the winter time and
 

1399
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,430
way different in the winter time and
if you just want to try build stuff that

1400
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,440
if you just want to try build stuff that
 

1401
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,350
if you just want to try build stuff that
looks good and you don't really care

1402
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
looks good and you don't really care
 

1403
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,350
looks good and you don't really care
about the seasons it would be annoying

1404
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
about the seasons it would be annoying
 

1405
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,190
about the seasons it would be annoying
and they can't just add an option to

1406
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
and they can't just add an option to
 

1407
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,710
and they can't just add an option to
disable it or that kind of stuff because

1408
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
disable it or that kind of stuff because
 

1409
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,950
disable it or that kind of stuff because
it just makes a lot more work for them

1410
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960
it just makes a lot more work for them
 

1411
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,710
it just makes a lot more work for them
so i think that's the reasoning behind

1412
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
so i think that's the reasoning behind
 

1413
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,029
so i think that's the reasoning behind
not doing it

1414
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
not doing it
 

1415
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,350
not doing it
but it would uh would be good in some

1416
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
but it would uh would be good in some
 

1417
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,990
but it would uh would be good in some
situations for sure

1418
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
situations for sure
 

1419
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,789
situations for sure
